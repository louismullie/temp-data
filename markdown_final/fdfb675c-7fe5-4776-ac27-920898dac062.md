## Question

Low LH and testosterone in 30 years male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a 30-year-old man with low testosterone and low LH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true biochemical hypogonadism with proper sampling and assay considerations. Then, I should classify the hypogonadism phenotype using LH/FSH to distinguish primary from secondary causes. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis for secondary hypogonadism in a 30-year-old, including functional, pituitary, systemic, and genetic etiologies. After that, I need to outline targeted diagnostic testing, including prolactin, pituitary MRI, iron studies, and when to consider genetic testing. Finally, I will align management to fertility goals, discuss reversible contributors, and set a monitoring plan with safety considerations and shared decision-making principles.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical diagnosis before labeling this as hypogonadism. I need to ensure two separate fasting morning total testosterone measurements are obtained between 7 and 10 AM using a reliable assay, because diurnal and day-to-day variability can misclassify up to 30% of men if we rely on a single low value, and I should double-check for assay interference or recent illness that could transiently suppress testosterone, deferring testing if the patient is acutely or subacutely ill [^115LrmTB] [^114mHtWq] [^1124vnU2].

> Wait, let me verify the role of free testosterone here. If total testosterone is borderline low or SHBG is abnormal, I should measure free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or calculate it using a validated equation, since SHBG can be low in obesity and high in liver disease, which alters the interpretation of total testosterone and may unmask true androgen deficiency or reveal pseudo-hypogonadism, respectively [^114mHtWq].

> Next, I should review the gonadotropins to classify the disorder. Low testosterone with low or inappropriately normal LH and FSH indicates secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism, whereas elevated gonadotropins would indicate primary testicular failure, so I need to ensure LH and FSH were measured on the same early-morning sample and interpreted against the lab's reference range, keeping in mind that functional causes are common in younger men with low LH and low testosterone [^112oc1u4] [^113duQSa] [^114mHtWq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should construct a differential for secondary hypogonadism in a 30-year-old, prioritizing potentially reversible functional causes such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic opioid or glucocorticoid use, anabolic steroid exposure, and hyperprolactinemia, while also considering pituitary pathology like prolactinoma, infiltrative disease, or post-radiation injury, systemic illnesses including hemochromatosis and chronic liver disease, and rare genetic causes such as LHB mutations or Kallmann syndrome, noting that LHB mutations typically present with low LH, low testosterone, and often normal or high FSH and respond to hCG therapy [^114mHtWq] [^116Q7pEX] [^112Uk7Ze] [^111e84Xw].

> I will now examine targeted adjunctive testing. I should confirm prolactin in any man with low testosterone and low or low-normal LH because hyperprolactinemia suppresses gonadotropins, repeat prolactin if mildly elevated to exclude spurious results, and proceed to pituitary MRI if prolactin is persistently elevated, if total testosterone is less than 150 ng/dL, or if there are mass effect symptoms, since the yield is higher in these scenarios [^114kmP9Y] [^114EM4gb].

> But wait, what if iron overload is contributing? I should check iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation to screen for hemochromatosis, which can cause secondary hypogonadism via pituitary iron deposition, and I should also consider other pituitary axes if panhypopituitarism is suspected, including morning cortisol, TSH and free T4, and IGF-1, guided by clinical features [^114mHtWq] [^116Q7pEX].

> Let me consider genetic testing when the phenotype is atypical or congenital. If there is delayed puberty, anosmia, or a family history, I should evaluate for Kallmann syndrome, and if LH is very low with low testosterone and normal or high FSH, I should consider LHB mutation testing, given the therapeutic implications of hCG responsiveness in LHB deficiency [^112Uk7Ze] [^111e84Xw].

> I should confirm the fertility goals before choosing therapy. If fertility is desired now or in the near future, exogenous testosterone is contraindicated because it suppresses spermatogenesis via LH/FSH suppression, so I should use hCG with or without FSH or consider a SERM such as clomiphene citrate to stimulate endogenous testosterone and spermatogenesis, whereas if fertility is not a concern, testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate after shared decision-making and exclusion of contraindications [^112Jbyq3] [^113duQSa] [^114mHtWq].

> Next, I should review reversible contributors and address them aggressively. Weight loss, treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, optimization of glycemic control, removal of offending drugs when feasible, and management of hyperprolactinemia with dopamine agonists can restore the HPT axis and obviate the need for lifelong testosterone therapy in a meaningful subset of patients, so I need to ensure these are prioritized before committing to long-term androgen replacement [^114mHtWq] [^113phHZf] [^112ovUmW].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring is in place if testosterone therapy is initiated. Baseline and periodic hematocrit should be checked to mitigate polycythemia risk, PSA should be assessed in men over 40 or with risk factors, and bone density should be considered in prolonged hypogonadism or high fracture risk, with therapy titrated to maintain mid-normal testosterone levels and reassessment of symptoms at 3 to 6 months to confirm benefit [^114ATRq4] [^114mHtWq].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of LH in monitoring. If I use a SERM, tracking LH and testosterone helps guide dose titration, and if LH rises but testosterone fails to increase, that pattern suggests testicular resistance and limited SERM efficacy, which should prompt reconsideration of the underlying etiology and treatment choice [^111pJpBi] [^1125Ej87].

> Let me reconsider the broader context. In a 30-year-old, age-related decline is not the primary driver, so I should be vigilant for organic pituitary or hypothalamic disease, systemic illness, medication effects, or genetic causes, and I should avoid anchoring bias toward functional hypogonadism without a thorough, guideline-concordant workup and longitudinal follow-up to document persistence and response to interventions [^114mHtWq] [^112oc1u4] [^113duQSa].

Low LH with low testosterone in a 30-year-old male indicates **secondary hypogonadism** (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) due to hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction [^113duQSa]. This pattern is not explained by normal aging, which typically leaves LH normal or elevated [^113CHfFb]. Immediate evaluation should include **repeat morning testosterone with LH/FSH**, prolactin, and pituitary MRI to exclude structural lesions or hyperprolactinemia [^116Q7pEX]. Management targets the underlying cause, with testosterone therapy for symptomatic patients without fertility goals and **gonadotropin therapy for those pursuing fertility** [^11142ntu] [^112Jbyq3].

---

## Physiological role of LH in testosterone production

LH is produced by the anterior pituitary and stimulates Leydig cells to synthesize testosterone; **normal adult LH is 1.0–8.0 IU/L**. Low LH reduces intratesticular testosterone, impairs spermatogenesis, and causes hypogonadal symptoms [^111YyASQ].

---

## Clinical significance of low LH and testosterone levels

Low LH with low testosterone defines **secondary hypogonadism** — hypothalamic or pituitary failure — and is distinct from primary testicular failure, which shows high gonadotropins [^112oc1u4] [^113duQSa].

## Differential diagnosis of low LH and testosterone in a 30-year-old male

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Pituitary or hypothalamic disorders | - Pituitary adenomas <br/> - Hypopituitarism <br/> - Kallmann syndrome <br/> - Traumatic brain injury <br/> - Radiation-induced hypogonadism [^115aEe7e] [^112sfPnx] |
| Functional or reversible causes | - Chronic opioid use <br/> - Anabolic steroid abuse <br/> - Severe systemic illness <br/> - Excessive exercise <br/> - Stress <br/> - Malnutrition [^11738iP2] [^112J9LkA] |
| Genetic or congenital conditions | - Kallmann syndrome <br/> - CHARGE syndrome <br/> - PROP1 mutations [^notfound] |
| Medications and substances | - Glucocorticoids <br/> - Opioids <br/> - Anabolic steroids <br/> - GnRH analogs [^11738iP2] [^112J9LkA] |

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential:

- **Confirm low testosterone**: Repeat morning total testosterone (7–10 am, fasting) [^115LrmTB] [^1124R92x].
- **Measure gonadotropins**: LH and FSH to distinguish primary vs secondary hypogonadism [^112oc1u4] [^113duQSa].
- **Evaluate pituitary function**: Prolactin, TSH, free T4, cortisol, IGF-1 [^113pqiLE].
- **Imaging**: Pituitary MRI if prolactin is elevated, testosterone is very low (< 150 ng/dL), or other pituitary deficits are present [^114kmP9Y] [^114EM4gb].
- **Additional tests**: Iron studies (hemochromatosis), genetic testing (Kallmann, PROP1), medication review [^116Q7pEX] [^111EbdnM].

---

## Clinical implications and health risks

Untreated secondary hypogonadism can cause:

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility [^114Hq3p8].
- **Bone health**: Osteoporosis, increased fracture risk [^112J9LkA].
- **Metabolic effects**: Increased adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia [^112kDkJD].
- **Psychological effects**: Depression, fatigue, reduced quality of life [^114Hq3p8].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on cause, fertility goals, and severity:

- **Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)**: For symptomatic men without fertility goals; monitor hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone [^112Jbyq3] [^114ATRq4].
- **Gonadotropin therapy**: hCG ± FSH for fertility restoration [^11142ntu] [^116RNQSy].
- **Address reversible causes**: Stop offending drugs, treat systemic illness, lifestyle changes [^114mHtWq] [^111EbdnM].
- **Pituitary lesions**: Surgery, radiation, or medical therapy (e.g. dopamine agonists for prolactinomas) [^113phHZf].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by etiology: **reversible causes** often normalize with treatment, whereas **irreversible causes** (e.g. genetic, structural) generally require lifelong therapy. With appropriate therapy, symptoms and quality of life usually improve [^111NffLQ].

---

Low LH with low testosterone in a 30-year-old male indicates **secondary hypogonadism**; prompt evaluation and targeted therapy are essential to restore testosterone, preserve fertility, and prevent long-term complications.

### Progressive impairment of testicular endocrine function in ageing men: testosterone and dihydrotestosterone decrease, and luteinizing hormone increases, in men transitioning from the 8th to 9th decades of life [^113ucBU2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Sex hormone trajectories in ageing men and their health implications remain unclear. We examined longitudinal trajectories and associations of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), oestradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in oldest old men.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

We studied 1025 community-dwelling men median age 75.1 years at baseline with 8.6 years of follow-up.

Measurements

Baseline and follow-up T, DHT and E2 were assayed using mass spectrometry. Physical performance was assessed at follow-up. Correlations and covariate-adjusted P-values were determined.

Results

Longitudinal change in T was -2.0%/year, DHT -7.2%/year, LH +7.5%/year, SHBG +5.6%/year while E2 remained stable. Annualized increases in LH correlated with decreases in T and DHT (r = -.20, P < .0001 and r = -.12, P = 0.0035, respectively). Higher baseline T correlated with better physical performance at follow-up (eg, Step test r = .07, P = 0.03), as did higher baseline DHT (eg, time to sit-stand [TSS] r = -.07, P = 0.01). Larger annualized increases in LH predicted poorer physical performance at follow-up (eg, TSS r = .14, P = 0.001). Higher T at follow-up was associated with better physical performance (eg, TSS r = -.07, P = 0.04), as were higher DHT and lower LH. At baseline, 24 men (2.4%) had abnormally high LH (> 16 IU/L); at follow-up, 175 (17.4%) had high LH of whom 70 had low T (< 6.4 nmol/L).

Conclusions

Annualized increases in LH are associated with declines in T and DHT, and predict poorer subsequent physical performance in oldest old men. Men transitioning from 8th to 9th decades exhibit biochemical evidence of progressively impaired testicular endocrine function, warranting further evaluation.

### Klinefelter syndrome with low gonadotropin levels [^112C7fjq]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome is usually characterised by the presence of a eunuchoid body habitus and testes that are usually small and firm, with low testosterone, and elevated luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, consistent with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Low levels of gonadotropins in karyotypically proven cases are not expected, they are extremely rare occurrences. We report a case of a patient who was diagnosed to have Klinefelter syndrome (47 XXY) with low gonadotropin levels. The rest of his anterior pituitary hormonal profile was normal with no lesions in the pituitary gland on imaging. He was continued on androgen replacement therapy.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115LrmTB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

How Should the Clinical Suspicion of Androgen Deficiency Be Assessed Biochemically?

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 Am) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings of the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (eg, specific clinical features, such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing very mild hypogonadism in older men over misdiagnosing eugonadal men as hypogonadal. The benefit of testosterone therapy on vitality and bone (and likely other parameters) is related to the change from baseline serum testosterone in older men; men with lower serum baseline testosterone concentrations are more likely to benefit from normalization of serum testosterone. Therefore, borderline low serum testosterone concentrations or multiple serum testosterone measurements that are discordant (eg, one result that is slightly low and one that is normal) should be interpreted cautiously and generally not as confirmatory evidence of hypogonadism.

### Sexual inactivity results in reversible reduction of LH bioavailability [^111Y8DxD]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

We have recently documented significantly reduced serum testosterone (T) levels in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). To understand the mechanism of this hypotestosteronemia, which was independent of the etiology of ED, and its reversibility only in patients in whom a variety of nonhormonal therapies restored sexual activity, we measured serum luteinizing hormone (LH) in the same cohort of ED patients (n = 83; 70% organic, 30% nonorganic). Both immunoreactive LH (I-LH) and bioactive LH (B-LH) were measured at entry and 3 months after therapy. Based on outcome (ie number of successful attempts of intercourse per month), patients were categorized as full responders (namely, at least eight attempts; n = 51), partial responders (at least one attempt; n = 20) and non-responders (n = 16). Compared to 30 healthy men with no ED, baseline B-LH (mean ± s.d.) in the 83 patients was decreased (13.6 ± 5.5 vs 31.7 ± 6.9 IU/L, P < 0.001), in the face of a slightly increased, but in the normal range, I-LH (5.3 ± 1.8 vs 3.4 ± 0.9 IU/L, P < 0.001); consequently, the B/I LH ratio was decreased (3.6 ± 3.9 vs 9.7 ± 3.3, P < 0.001). Similar to our previous observation for serum T, the three outcome groups did not differ significantly for any of these three parameters at baseline. However, outcome groups differed after therapy. Bioactivity of LH increased markedly in full responders (pre-therapy = 13.7 ± 5.3, post-therapy = 22.6 ± 5.4, P < 0.001), modestly in partial responders (14.8 ± 6.9 vs 17.2 ± 7.0, P < 0.05) but remained unchanged in non-responders (11.2 ± 2.2 vs 12.2 ± 5.1). The corresponding changes went in the opposite direction for I-LH (5.2 ± 1.7 vs 2.6 ± 5.4, P < 0.001; 5.4 ± 2.2 vs 4.0 ± 1.7, P < 0.05; 5.6 ± 1.2 vs 5.0 ± 1.2, respectively), and in the same direction as B-LH for the B/I ratio (3.7 ± 4.1 vs 11.8 ± 7.8, P < 0.001; 4.2 ± 4.3 vs 5.8 ± 4.2, P < 0.05; 2.1 ± 0.7 vs 2.6 ± 1.3, respectively). We hypothesize that the hypotestosteronemia of ED patients is due to impaired bioactivity of LH. This reduced bioactivity is reversible, provided that resumption of sexual activity is achieved regardless of the therapeutic modality. Because biopotency of pituitary hormones is controlled by the hypothalamus, LH hypoactivity should be due to the hypothalamic functional damage associated to the psychological disturbances which unavoidably follow sexual inactivity.

### Etiology and treatment of hypogonadism in adolescents [^114D3jkq]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Adequate functioning at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is necessary for normal gonadal development and subsequent sex steroid production. Deficiencies at any level of the axis can lead to a hypogonadal state. The causes of hypogonadism are heterogeneous and may involve any level of the reproductive system. This review discusses various causes of hypogonadism, describes the evaluation of hypogonadal states, and outlines treatment options for the induction of puberty in affected adolescents. Whereas some conditions are clearly delineated, the exact etiology and underlying pathogenesis of many disorders is unknown.

### Association of low testosterone with changes in non-cardiovascular biomarkers in adult men [^117Vzu3z]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD) contains all health care data and measurements from all inpatients and outpatients treated or evaluated at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, which was the site of the Institutional Review Board that approved this study From UPOD, we extracted data from 9939 male outpatients over 40 years old who had a laboratory measurement of total testosterone levels as well as a measurement of one or more of the following biomarkers on the same day: free testosterone, uric acid, estradiol, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), creatinine, bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hemoglobin A1c, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, and body mass index. These markers were selected for inclusion in this study, because they relate to organs or functions impacted by testosterone and also because they were also the most likely tests to be routinely ordered as part of the general medical workup of adult men who are being tested for possible hypogonadism.

All tests were performed on AU5800/DxI ® analyzers (Beckman Coulter, Inc. Brea, CA USA). The 95% reference range for total testosterone measured on the DxI analyzer is 175–781 ng/dL and is substantially lower than the reference ranges established for use by other analyzers from other manufacturers or thresholds for diagnosing low testosterone. The reasons for the variations in reference ranges for testosterone between various manufacturers and assays have been described. The Beckman Coulter reference range was initially established by measuring testosterone levels in American men between the ages of 18 and 66 years of age, not otherwise specified. It was then validated at Utrecht for use with their patient population. We therefore believe that the 95% reference range was appropriate for use in this study. Nevertheless, it is possible that using a higher threshold for distinguishing between low and "normal" (or even optimal) levels of testosterone might yield more significant associations between testosterone and non-cardiovascular biomarkers. Free testosterone was calculated using the Vermeulen equation.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113pqiLE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central hypogonadism in males — diagnostic evaluation recommends that in males with suspected hypogonadism, we recommend measuring serum testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) to diagnose central hypogonadism, and we recommend that clinicians perform hormonal testing in the absence of acute/subacute illness and before 10 AM (after overnight fast) combined with serum prolactin (PRL); evidence notes that central hypogonadism in males manifests with low serum T levels and features of T deficiency and/or impaired spermatogenesis, and that testosterone levels show a circadian rhythm with maximum serum values between 5:30 and 8 AM and trough levels approximately 12 hours later.

### Gonadal hormones in men with rheumatoid arthritis – from onset through 2 years [^114JZBZ6]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate changes over a 2-year course in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in men with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from start of treatment with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Methods

Forty-one men with early RA and with joint symptoms less than 1 year were studied. Mean age at inclusion was 53 years and mean disease duration 6 months. They were followed prospectively for 2 years for disease activity [Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28)], physical impairment (Health Assessment Questionnaire), total serum testosterone, non-sex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH). A group of 131 healthy, medicine-free men served as controls for baseline hormone concentrations.

Results

The men with RA already had mean testosterone levels lower than controls early in the disease course. Patients older than 50 years also had significantly lower LH levels compared with controls, consistent with mild hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In patients who responded to treatment at the 2-year followup the testosterone levels increased significantly. A decrease in DAS28 during the 2 years correlated significantly with increased testosterone levels (r(s) = -0.46, p = 0.006). LH levels were low and stable and did not correlate with disease activity.

Conclusion

In early RA, current inflammation seemed to affect the HPG axis, mainly at the gonadal rather than the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Prospective studies are indicated to determine if low HPG activity may be a cause rather than a consequence of a chronic inflammatory state.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^112Jbyq3]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Male infertility context — endocrine abnormalities and alternatives to exogenous testosterone: Low testosterone levels are highly prevalent among males presenting for an infertility workup, and half of all couples experiencing infertility will have a male factor with 30–70% of men undergoing a reproductive workup having an endocrine abnormality of some type. Exogenous testosterone has inhibitory effects on intratesticular testosterone needed for normal spermatogenesis, and alternative medications including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are commonly used to promote endogenous testosterone production.

### Hypogonadism: its prevalence and diagnosis [^116ZkfHk]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome, which results from the failure of the testes to produce physiologic levels of testosterone and a normal number of spermatozoa due to defects at one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Primary hypogonadism results from malfunction at the level of the testes due to a genetic cause, injury, inflammation, or infection. Hypothalamic and/or pituitary failure leads to secondary hypogonadism, most often as a result of genetic defects, neoplasm, or infiltrative disorders. The signs and symptoms of hypogonadism depend on the age of onset, severity of androgen deficiency, and underlying cause of androgen deficiency.

AUA testosterone deficiency — follow-up laboratory testing (luteinizing hormone [LH]) advises: At baseline, Recommendation: Measure with repeat total testosterone level if first level low. During the testosterone titration phase, Recommendation: Measure four weeks after initiation of SERM therapy in men with persistently low testosterone levels. In the stable phase, Recommendation: Measure in men on SERMs who cease responding (decrease in testosterone level after initial response — tachyphylaxis). Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) wording is per the on-page abbreviation key.

### Commentary: who is a candidate for testosterone therapy? A synthesis of international expert opinions [^115ydEZp]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite increasing use of testosterone therapy (TTh) for men with testosterone deficiency (TD), there remains uncertainty determining who is a candidate for treatment.

Aim

The aim if this study was to report the opinions of international experts on TTh, as initially presented at the meeting of the World Meeting on Sexual Medicine in Chicago, United States in August 2012.

Methods

Expert responses to questions regarding the diagnosis of TD based on their own clinical and research experience.

Results

All experts emphasized the primacy of symptoms for the diagnosis of TD. Total testosterone (T) thresholds used to identify TD ranged from 350ng/dL to 400ng/dL (12–14nmol/L); however, experts emphasized the diagnostic limitations of this test. Free T was obtained by all, with some valuing this test more than total T for clinical decision making. Only one expert routinely used a screening questionnaire. None used age-adjusted values. Bioavailable T and the free androgen index were not used. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone-binding globulin levels were routinely obtained at evaluation. Additional supportive evidence for TD diagnosis included small testicular volume, high androgen receptor CAG repeats, elevated LH, and presence of diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Two T tests were generally obtained but not always required. Some experts did not require morning testing in men 50 years and older. All monitored prostate-specific antigen and hematocrit after initiation of TTh. All but one expert would consider a trial of TTh to a symptomatic man with total T within the normal range. Recent studies suggesting increased cardiovascular risk with T therapy were not found to be credible.

Conclusions

Determining who is a candidate for TTh requires clinical assessment based on symptoms and signs, with confirmatory laboratory evaluation. These expert opinions differed from some published guidelines by the emphasis on symptoms as paramount, recognition of the limitations of total T as a diagnostic test, and the potential utility of a therapeutic trial in symptomatic cases with normal total T concentrations.

### The prevalence of low sex steroid hormone concentrations in men in the third national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES III) [^111XPefY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Physiologic processes during ageing leading to multi-morbidity and diseases that increase risk of premature death may be influenced by ageing-associated changes in endogenous hormone production.

Objective

To evaluate the decline in sex steroid hormone levels across age and estimate the number of US men 40+ years old who may have low hormone levels.

Design

We measured serum testosterone, oestradiol and sex hormone binding globulin by immunoassay in 1351 men 20+ years old in Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We estimated free hormones by mass action.

Results

Free testosterone declined most rapidly with age (a 2% decline in geometric mean concentration occurred after ageing 1.3 years), followed by total testosterone (2.4 years), free oestradiol (4.1 years) and total oestradiol (8.1 years). These hormone changes with age translated into 25.0% and 30.2% of men 70+ years old having low total (which we defined as < 10.4 nm) and free (< 0.17 nm) testosterone, respectively, and 8.3% and 23.9% having low total (< 73.4 pm) and free (< 2.2 pm) oestradiol. Using population size projections between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, we estimated that 8.4 (95% CI 4.7–12.2), 6.2 (3.1–9.2) and 6.0 (3.1–9.0) million men 40+ years old may have low total testosterone, free testosterone and free oestradiol, respectively. The prevalences were only modestly lower in men without prevalent chronic diseases.

Conclusion

Although no consensus exists for defining low hormone levels in ageing men, a substantial number of US men may have low sex steroid hormone levels, possibly putting them at risk for adverse health consequences and premature death.

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone deficiency — Serum prolactin levels should be measured in patients with low testosterone levels combined with low or low/normal luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A); if a patient has elevated prolactin levels, prolactin measurement should be repeated to ensure that the initial elevation was not spurious, and men with total testosterone levels of < 150 ng/dL in combination with a low or low/normal LH should undergo a pituitary MRI regardless of prolactin levels.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

Gonadotropin Deficiency

Gonadotropins are peptide hormones, namely LH and FSH, secreted by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland that regulate ovarian and testicular function. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis can result in low levels of sex steroids. In times of stress, as a compensatory mechanism of the body, the level of anabolic androgens decreases to conserve energy expenditure, enabling function of vital organs. Gonadotropin deficiency is the second most common hormonal deficiency, with a prevalence of about 40–80% in adults, but it is likely to be transient and much less prevalent in children. In the chronic stage, the prevalence ranges from 2 to 32%, with 4% of the patients still having gonadotropin deficiency 5 years after TBI. Agha et al. studied 50 adult patients with TBI 12 days (median) after injury and found 80% to have low serum gonadal sex steroid levels and low gonadotropin levels. The authors also found a significant positive correlation of admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and functional outcome at 12 months with serum testosterone levels. By 12 months, 85% of these hypogonadal patients had recovered.

Hyperprolactinemia after TBI can be caused by stress (acute trauma), damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk, or administration of antidopaminergic medications. Pituitary stalk compression can cause inhibition of negative feedback for prolactin secretion, causing hyperprolactinemia resulting in menstrual and sexual dysregulation. This causes hypogonadism by inhibiting secretion of LH and FSH, resulting in decreased levels of estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Hyperprolactinemia has been found to be present in 48% of hypogonadal patients in the acute phase, in 28% at 6 months, and in 33% at 12 months. In children, it has been seen to be transient and of not much clinical significance. The diagnosis of hypogonadism is tabulated in Table 1. Low levels of LH and FSH in the presence of low testosterone levels in men and low estrogen levels in women is diagnostic of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Along with these, serum prolactin levels should be measured in all patients.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113duQSa]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — Adjunctive testing with luteinizing hormone (LH) indicates that in patients with low testosterone, clinicians should measure serum luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). A low or low/normal LH level points to a secondary (central) hypothalamic-pituitary defect (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), while an elevated LH level indicates a primary testicular defect (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the yield from adjunctive tests (e.g., prolactin measurement, pituitary imaging, iron studies) is increased, and in the event that a patient may have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, adjunctive tests should be ordered, although the literature at this time fails to define the LH level below which such adjunctive testing is warranted. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is not a contraindication to begin testosterone therapy, and in some cases a karyotype may be warranted to establish a diagnosis of KS (47, XXY). Testosterone deficient patients with low or low/normal LH levels can be considered candidates for selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) use, particularly those wishing to preserve their fertility, but an LH level below which SERM response is optimized is not firmly established.

### Approach to the patient: low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^111tuHFS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In most men with obesity, measured serum testosterone will be only modestly reduced, but very low concentrations can occur particularly in men with extreme obesity (eg, BMI > 40 kg/m²). In such cases, the presence of a low serum testosterone, with proportionately low serum SHBG and normal-range serum LH and FSH (typical features of the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity) in conjunction with a normal testicular examination is reassuring. These findings suggest that the hormonal aberrations are likely reversible due to obesity and will improve with significant weight loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary and measurement of other anterior pituitary hormones is only required if specific additional clinical signs are present (ie, headache, galactorrhea, bitemporal hemianopia), if serum LH and FSH are very low or undetectable, or when serum testosterone concentration does not increase following clinically significant weight loss. Key features distinguishing cases of pathological hypogonadism from the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2.
Distinguishing factors between pathological hypogonadism and the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity

Treatment Recommendations

Testosterone is not indicated for treatment of reduced serum testosterone concentrations in men with overweight and obesity, except where there is also pathological hypogonadism, which should be excluded by history, physical examination, and relevant laboratory testing. In simple obesity, weight loss is critical to restoring health, with meta-analyses on the effect of diet, exercise, and bariatric surgery showing marked increases in serum testosterone concentrations proportionate to the degree of weight loss achieved (Fig. 1).

His serum FSH was 4.1 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–7.0 IU/L), and LH was 3.2 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–8.0 IU/L).

What Additional Diagnostic Evaluation Is Necessary to Exclude Classic Organic Hypothalamic-Pituitary Pathology in a Man With Low Serum Total Testosterone and Normal Serum Gonadotropin Concentrations?

Most middle-aged and older, obese men with a low testosterone will have secondary hypogonadism with normal serum gonadotropin concentrations. Men with secondary hypogonadism should be clinically assessed for Cushing syndrome and sleep apnea. Evaluation for identifiable hypothalamic and pituitary pathology should be individualized because the yield is typically low. In men ≥ 50 years old with low serum testosterone and normal gonadotropin concentrations, clinical experience suggests that the probability of classic organic hypothalamic-pituitary pathology is inversely related to BMI, age, number of comorbidities, and testosterone concentration. In older, obese men, pseudohypogonadism due to obesity is the most common cause for the biochemical constellation of low serum total testosterone (due to low SHBG), normal serum free testosterone, and normal gonadotropins, reflecting a eugonadal state. In secondary hypogonadism due to structural or genetic hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, gonadotropins are often low or undetectable.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^1113xBos]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism (AOH) in middle-age and older men is described as a syndrome with low testosterone (T) and low or normal gonadotropins that is distinct from classical primary or secondary hypogonadism because it may include elements of both presentations. The Sexual Medicine Society of North America defines AOH as a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterized by T deficiency with symptoms and signs due to testicular and/or hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) dysfunction, and it is characterized by failure to mount an adequate compensatory pituitary response to low T with gonadotropin levels low or in the normal range. For contrast, primary hypogonadism is identified by low T with elevated gonadotropin levels (luteinizing hormone [LH]; follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]), whereas secondary hypogonadism results from gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency such as pituitary or hypothalamic failure and may arise from HP injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. The panel also deliberated on a diagnostic process for AOH, the rationale for T therapy, and a monitoring protocol for T-treated patients.

### Approach to the patient: low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^112ovUmW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points
Serum testosterone concentration is often reduced in men with obesity, proportional to the degree of excess weight.
In men with obesity, low serum testosterone concentrations alone do not equate to a diagnosis of hypogonadism, even if nonspecific symptoms resembling testosterone deficiency are present.
Reduced serum testosterone concentrations in men with obesity are predominantly due to obesity-related effects lowering serum SHBG. Serum LH and FSH operate as highly sensitive tissue androgen sensors and remain normal, indicating the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity is a eugonadal state.
In men with obesity and low serum testosterone concentrations but without pathological hypogonadism, treatment should focus on identification and rectification of obesity related comorbidities, optimizing health-related lifestyle behaviors and interventions to promote significant and sustained weight loss without risking the adverse effects of unjustified testosterone treatment.

Mild to moderate reduction in serum testosterone concentrations with typically normal serum LH and FSH are frequent in men with overweight/obesity. Such men may also complain of nonspecific symptoms resembling those seen in androgen deficiency or from many other age-related comorbidities. This phenomenon has been termed the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity, which reflects that the combination of nonspecific symptoms and lowered serum testosterone concentrations does not equate to an organic state of hypogonadism and as such testosterone replacement therapy is not justified. Obesity-related pseudo-hypogonadism is a common variant of the nongonadal illness syndrome, a variety of nongonadal conditions that cause a modest lowering of serum testosterone as a nonspecific and potentially reversible barometer of general health but retaining a eugonadal state for which testosterone treatment is not justified.

There is no evidence that men with simple obesity have pathologic hypogonadism understood as structural or genetic disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or testes. Clinical trial data in older men provide little evidence to suggest substantial health benefit(s) from testosterone treatment in contrast to even modest lifestyle interventions. Using an example of a patient from our clinic, we outline a framework for assessing and managing the increasingly prevalent finding of pseudo-hypogonadism involving a mild to moderate lowering of serum testosterone concentrations with preservation of normal serum LH and FSH in men with overweight/obesity.

### Factors associated with circulating sex hormones in men: individual participant data meta-analyses [^117JATHk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Various factors modulate circulating testosterone in men, affecting interpretation of testosterone measurements.

Purpose

To clarify factors associated with variations in sex hormone concentrations.

Data Sources

Systematic literature searches (to July 2019).

Study Selection

Prospective cohort studies of community-dwelling men with total testosterone measured using mass spectrometry.

Data Extraction

Individual participant data (IPD) (9 studies; n = 21074) and aggregate data (2 studies; n = 4075). Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors and concentrations of total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol were extracted.

Data Synthesis

Two-stage random-effects IPD meta-analyses found a nonlinear association of testosterone with age, with negligible change among men aged 17 to 70 years (change per SD increase about the midpoint, -0.27 nmol/L [-7.8 ng/dL] [CI, -0.71 to 0.18 nmol/L {-20.5 to 5.2 ng/dL}]) and decreasing testosterone levels with age for men older than 70 years (-1.55 nmol/L [-44.7 ng/dL] [CI, -2.05 to -1.06 nmol/L {-59.1 to -30.6 ng/dL}]). Testosterone was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI) (change per SD increase, -2.42 nmol/L [-69.7 ng/dL] [CI, -2.70 to -2.13 nmol/L {-77.8 to -61.4 ng/dL}]). Testosterone concentrations were lower for men who were married (mean difference, -0.57 nmol/L [-16.4 ng/dL] [CI, -0.89 to -0.26 nmol/L {-25.6 to -7.5 ng/dL}]); undertook at most 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week (-0.51 nmol/L [-14.7 ng/dL] [CI, -0.90 to -0.13 nmol/L {-25.9 to -3.7 ng/dL}]); were former smokers (-0.34 nmol/L [-9.8 ng/dL] [CI, -0.55 to -0.12 nmol/L {-15.9 to -3.5 ng/dL}]); or had hypertension (-0.53 nmol/L [-15.3 ng/dL] [CI, -0.82 to -0.24 nmol/L {-23.6 to -6.9 ng/dL}]), cardiovascular disease (-0.35 nmol/L [-10.1 ng/dL] [CI, -0.55 to -0.15 nmol/L {-15.9 to -4.3 ng/dL}]), cancer (-1.39 nmol/L [-40.1 ng/dL] [CI, -1.79 to -0.99 nmol/L {-51.6 to -28.5 ng/dL}]), or diabetes (-1.43 nmol/L [-41.2 ng/dL] [CI, -1.65 to -1.22 nmol/L {-47.6 to -35.2 ng/dL}]). Sex hormone-binding globulin was directly associated with age and inversely associated with BMI. Luteinizing hormone was directly associated with age in men older than 70 years.

Limitation

Cross-sectional analysis, heterogeneity between studies and in timing of blood sampling, and imputation for missing data.

Conclusion

Multiple factors are associated with variation in male testosterone, SHBG, and LH concentrations. Reduced testosterone and increased LH concentrations may indicate impaired testicular function after age 70 years. Interpretation of individual testosterone measurements should account particularly for age older than 70 years, obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116Q7pEX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of suspected testosterone deficiency begins with "Measure morning fasting total T* (and free T* if altered SHBG or borderline total T, Table 2)". Abnormal results are "Confirm by repeating morning fasting total T (and free T5)", after which "Diagnosis of hypogonadism is confirmed"; if instead "Normal total T or Normal or low total T and normal free T", then "Consider other causes of symptoms and signs". Following confirmation, "Measure LH and FSH" (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) to differentiate "LH and FSH low or inappropriately normal (Secondary hypogonadism)" — with actions to "Consider potentially reversible functional causes, Table 1", "Measure prolactin, iron saturation", "Evaluate other pituitary hormones (if clinically indicated5)", and "Pituitary MRI (if indicated7)" — from "LH and FSH high (Primary hypogonadism)", for which to "Obtain karyotype to diagnose Klinefelter syndrome (if clinical indication)". The figure specifies that "The lower limit of the normal total testosterone (TT) harmonized to the CDC standard in healthy nonobese young men is 264 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L) (9); this limit could be used for TT assays that are CDC certified" and that "Free testosterone (FT) should be measured by an equilibrium dialysis method or estimated from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin using a formula that accurately reflects FT by equilibrium dialysis".

### Normal spermatogenesis in a man with mutant luteinizing hormone [^116fq5uV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Men with mutations in LHB, the gene encoding the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LHB), have azoospermia with absent or few fetal Leydig cells. We report a mutation in LHB in a man and his sister. The man presented with absence of virilization, undetectable luteinizing hormone, and a low serum testosterone level. He had complete spermatogenesis with a normal sperm count. The mutant luteinizing hormone had a low level of partial activity in vitro. We concluded that the residual luteinizing hormone activity, resulting in the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in few mature Leydig cells producing small amounts of intratesticular testosterone (20.2 ng per gram), was sufficient for complete and quantitatively normal spermatogenesis.

### 'What should I do with a 60-year old man with a slightly low serum total testosterone concentration and normal levels of serum gonadotrophins'? [^112kDkJD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The fundamental question in assessing an older man with a slightly low total testosterone and normal gonadotrophin levels is to determine whether or not he has clinical hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome complex, which comprises both symptoms as well as biochemical testosterone deficiency. As symptoms are nonspecific and there are no clear cut-off values for testosterone levels this invariably leads to a clinical dilemma. International guidelines have been published which provide recommendations to aid the clinician in making a diagnosis. Late-onset hypogonadism, the preferred terminology for age-related hypogonadism, can only be made once other causes have been excluded. Evidence shows that low testosterone levels are associated with several common male conditions including erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis and diabetes. Short-term studies have shown benefits of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, bone metabolism, insulin resistance, sexual function and quality of life. Recommendations give clear advice on safety monitoring, specifically in relation to prostate health. If a diagnosis of hypogonadism is made with borderline testosterone levels then a 3-month trial of TRT can be considered. The diagnosis of hypogonadism associated with borderline testosterone levels and the decision to treat should only be made by an experienced clinician.

### What is the optimal therapy for young males with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism? [^11142ntu]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), consequent to congenital or acquired disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, presents as absent/delayed/arrested sexual maturation and infertility. Optimal management includes: (a) confirmation of the diagnosis and prognosis, (b) timing and choice of therapeutic intervention and (c) consideration of future fertility prospects. Therapy is usually initiated with testosterone to induce development of secondary sexual characteristics, taking the patient (often diagnosed late) through puberty. Monitoring of the impact of the condition on long-term health and psychosocial function is necessary. Treatment is likely to be life-long, requiring regular monitoring for its optimization and avoidance of adverse responses. Induction of spermatogenesis requires either pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) or gonadotropin administration. Gonadotropins can be self-administered subcutaneously and are not inferior to the more costly GnRH. 'Reversible genetic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism' is a recently described entity which has implications for the long-term management of patients with HH.

### Factors associated with circulating sex hormones in men: individual participant data meta-analyses [^113CHfFb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While SHBG increased across the age span, testosterone and LH were stable until after age 70 years, whereupon divergent associations of testosterone and LH with age emerged. The magnitude of the age-associated increase in SHBG was pronounced, and further investigation is warranted to explore whether this might alter the bioavailability of testosterone to access target tissues. Previous studies limited to men ≥ 70 years have reported longitudinal declines in testosterone concentrations and increases in LH with age. Our IPDMA, including data from men aged 17–99 years, provides new evidence suggesting that a change in HPT axis function may occur in men around age 70 years. The relative stability of mean testosterone until, and the decline after this age, raises the question whether a single reference range should be applied across men of all ages. A reference range for healthy nonobese young men has been proposed (9.2–31.8 nmol/L based on 2.5 th -97.5 th percentiles in men aged 19–39 years, for assays standardised to a higher order reference method established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). It may be appropriate to adjust the lower cut-off when applying this to older men. Alternatively, an age-appropriate reference range has been proposed for men ≥ 70 years (6.4–25.7 nmol/L based on 2.5 th -97.5 th percentiles in very healthy older men).

Combination therapy with low dose hCG has been described to maintain intratesticular testosterone levels and preserve spermatogenesis for men on exogenous testosterone, hCG alone or with SERMs has been shown to facilitate recovery of testosterone production and spermatogenesis in men with prior exogenous testosterone use or anabolic steroid abuse, and return of sperm to the ejaculate can be highly variable, taking up to two years after cessation of exogenous testosterone in some cases with some men never experiencing return of sperm.

In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1125Ej87]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Prescribing SERMs and AIs — key points include that a serum LH level can help guide clinical decision-making after initiation of SERM therapy; if after starting the SERM testosterone and LH levels remain low or LH is normal, dose escalation of the SERM should be considered to increase testosterone; if testosterone is low but LH is high, the patient likely has testicular dysfunction and SERM dose escalation is not likely to increase testosterone; AIs should in general not be used for extended periods of time due to concerns regarding loss of bone mineral density (BMD) because AIs can significantly suppress E2; with regular follow-up and careful titration of AI dosage, E2 can often be maintained in the therapeutic range, minimizing risk of bone density loss; if AI therapy results in persistently elevated E2 levels, the AI should be discontinued due to lack of clinical efficacy.

### Effects of oestradiol on gonadotrophin levels in normal and castrated men [^111Q2dct]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Testosterone inhibits gonadotrophin release in men either directly or after aromatization to oestradiol. We hypothesized that in males the androgen receptor-mediated effect of testosterone on LH release is negligible relative to that of oestradiol.

Objective

To compare the effect of experimentally induced variations of plasma oestradiol levels on LH levels in normal (physiological testosterone levels) and castrated men (very low testosterone levels).

Design

Prospective, open label, intervention.

Subjects and Interventions

We suppressed endogenous oestradiol in 10 young men with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily. In these men and in 10 young healthy castrated men, we restored plasma oestradiol levels with oestradiol patches (first week 100 mug/day, second week 50 mug/day, third week 25 mug/day and fourth week no oestradiol patch).

Measurements

The effect of the intervention on plasma levels of LH were monitored and compared between the groups.

Results

With the intervention, the mean plasma oestradiol level in the two groups varied from supraphysiological to below the lower reference range. Levels of LH mirrored plasma oestradiol levels in both the groups, as did testosterone in the intact group. Despite similar oestradiol levels, mean levels of LH were significantly higher in the castrated group compared to the intact group for all doses of oestradiol, and supraphysiological levels of oestradiol were unable to suppress LH into the physiological range in the castrated group.

Conclusions

Physiological plasma oestradiol levels have a substantial suppressive effect on LH in men. However, low-normal testosterone levels are a prerequisite for suppression of LH into the normal range.

### Association of serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone with blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged and elderly men [^115pk2cV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The synthesis of testosterone by testicular Leydig cells in response to LH may decrease slightly with increasing age. Testosterone levels are generally lower in aging men with chronic comorbidities and metabolic disorders. 47 It can be indistinguishable whether low testosterone is the cause of their illness or just a byproduct. Low testosterone has been linked to various cardiac risk factors, but that does not necessarily prove it causes CVD incidence. In contrast, clinical trials regarding the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy are controversial. 48, 49, 50 It has raised concern that testosterone administration might increase the risk of CVD outcomes. Testosterone treatment used in the cohort of veterans with comorbidities is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. 51 It is possible that testosterone promoted platelet aggregation, coronary plaque formation, and affected salt and water retention, endothelium inflammation, or through other mechanisms that might render some men susceptible to adverse CVD outcomes. 52 In fact, increased testis volume is found to be a positive predictor of incident CVD events. 53 The decline in testosterone level with aging may be an adaptive response, as an indicator of underlying comorbidities. 54 Therefore, exogenous testosterone administration may cause consequences by interrupting the whole body homeostasis in some circumstances.

Our study was subject to certain limitations. First, because of the retrospective nature of this cross‐sectional study, it neither addressed the temporality of observed associations nor examined the causal relationship between exposure and outcome. Second, although we adjusted for major risk factors and excluded patients with diabetes mellitus, other confounding factors such as atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis, or specific drug use cannot be fully adjusted because of unavailable information. Third, the relatively small sample size of CVD may yield impaired statistical power, especially for subgroup analysis. Also, there was a possibility of underestimation of CVD attributed to asymptomatic or subclinical conditions. Fourth, it lacked sufficient CVD risk prediction strategies and additional data for further interpretation. We need a larger sample size with more laboratory indicators in a longitudinal study to validate the relationship in hypertensive patients. Future research is warranted to understand how testosterone differentially affects the specific subgroups and how risk might be effectively reduced.

### Value of gonadotropin-releasing hormone testing in the differential diagnosis of androgen deficiency in elderly men [^1139bMxb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Elderly men with low testosterone (T) levels are increasingly diagnosed to have partial androgen deficiency of the aging male (PADAM). Frequently, magnetic resonance imaging is performed to exclude pituitary adenoma. The value of GnRH testing to differentiate PADAM from secondary hypogonadism is unknown. Serum levels of T as well as LH and FSH at baseline and after GnRH were evaluated in the following groups: 1) 24 elderly men with low serum T (< 11.7 nmol/liter), 2) 25 elderly men with normal serum T levels (> 11.7 nmol/liter), 3) 10 men with primary hypogonadism, 4) 24 men with secondary hypogonadism, and 5) 13 healthy young volunteers. In elderly men, T levels were lower (P < 0.001) and gonadotropin levels higher (P = 0.03) compared with younger controls. LH and FSH response to GnRH was higher in elderly men with low T levels (PADAM) compared with elderly men with normal T levels (P = 0.02 and P < 0.001) in the presence of similar basal gonadotropin levels. To differentiate secondary hypogonadism from PADAM with a sensitivity of 100%, a T less than 10 nmol/liter had a specificity of 50%. This specificity was improved to 75% by using a cutoff of less than or equal to 15 mU/liter increase of LH upon GnRH stimulation. Overall, decreased T levels and increased LH levels in elderly men suggest a primary Leydig cell dysfunction. In the subgroup of elderly men with low T levels, an increased LH response to GnRH with normal basal LH levels suggests additional, possibly hypothalamic changes. To exclude secondary hypogonadism in PADAM, diagnostic accuracy can be improved by using GnRH testing.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Striant®is indicated for replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone:

Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) - testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchidectomy, Klinefelter's syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol or heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone levels and gonadotropins (FSH, LH) above the normal range.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) — idiopathic gonadotropin or LHRH deficiency, or pituitary hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. These patients have low serum testosterone levels but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range.

### Don't prescribe testosterone therapy unless there is… [^1146Egtj]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Many of the symptoms attributed to male hypogonadism are commonly seen in normal male aging or in the presence of comorbid conditions. Testosterone therapy has the potential for serious side effects and represents a significant expense. It is therefore important to confirm the clinical suspicion of hypogonadism with biochemical testing. Current guidelines recommend the use of a total testosterone level obtained in the morning. A low level should be confirmed on a different day, again measuring the total testosterone. In some situations, a free or bioavailable testosterone may be of additional value.

### Treatment of male infertility secondary to morbid obesity [^115mk3CR]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

A 29-year-old man presented to a clinic with infertility and hypogonadism in the setting of morbid obesity. On presentation, he had notable gynecomastia and a low testicular volume. The patient's weight was 154 kg and his height was 168 cm (BMI 54.5 kg/m²). Before referral to the clinic, the patient had been treated with testosterone therapy for 4 months for hypogonadism. This treatment had caused his initially low sperm concentration to fall to undetectable levels.

Investigations

Measurement of reproductive hormone levels, pituitary MRI, and semen analysis.

Diagnosis

Infertility secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an elevated estrogen:testosterone ratio.

Management

Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, led to normalization of the patient's testosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, suppression of serum estradiol levels, and to normalization of spermatogenesis and fertility.

A 34-year-old male presented to the endocrinology clinic with the complaint of the absence of facial, axillary and pubic hairs. Further history revealed absent ejaculations and decreased early morning erections. The patient had no history of headaches, visual problems or anosmia. On physical examination, there were sparse facial, axillary and pubic hairs, bilateral gynaecomastia, stretch penile length of 5 cm and bilateral testicular volume of 10 mL. Laboratory investigations showed low luteinising hormone, follicular stimulating hormone and testosterone with normal prolactin and thyroid profile. MRI of the pituitary gland showed no evidence of pituitary microadenoma or macroadenoma. The patient was started on testosterone injections. After 9months of testosterone replacement, the patient's testicular size increased to 20 mL bilaterally and his penile length increased to the mean adult size for his age with normal testosterone and luteinising hormone. He was, thus, advised to discontinue testosterone therapy.

### Elevated luteinizing hormone despite normal testosterone levels in older men-natural history, risk factors and clinical features [^113sGEzB]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) with normal testosterone (T) suggests compensated dysregulation of the gonadal axis. We describe the natural history, risk factors and clinical parameters associated with the development of high LH (HLH, LH > 9.4 U/L) in ageing men with normal T (T ≥ 10.5 nmol/L).

Design, Patients and Measurements

We conducted a 4.3-year prospective observational study of 3369 community-dwelling European men aged 40–79 years. Participants were classified as follows: incident (i) HLH (n = 101, 5.2%); persistent (p) HLH (n = 128, 6.6%); reverted (r) HLH (n = 46, 2.4%); or persistent normal LH (pNLH, n = 1667, 85.8%). Potential predictors and changes in clinical features associated with iHLH and rHLH were analysed using regression models.

Results

Age > 70 years (OR = 4.12 [2.07–8.20]), diabetes (OR = 2.86 [1.42–5.77]), chronic pain (OR = 2.53 [1.34–4.77]), predegree education (OR = 1.79 [1.01–3.20]) and low physical activity (PASE ≤ 78, OR = 2.37 [1.24–4.50]) predicted development of HLH. Younger age (40–49 years, OR = 8.14 [1.35–49.13]) and nonsmoking (OR = 5.39 [1.48–19.65]) predicted recovery from HLH. Men with iHLH developed erectile dysfunction, poor health, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer more frequently than pNLH men. In pHLH men, comorbidities, including CVD, developed more frequently, and cognitive and physical function deteriorated more, than in pNLH men. Men with HLH developed primary hypogonadism more frequently (OR = 15.97 [5.85–43.60]) than NLH men. Men with rHLH experienced a small rise in BMI.

Conclusions

Elevation of LH with normal T is predicted by multiple factors, reverts frequently and is not associated with unequivocal evidence of androgen deficiency. High LH is a biomarker for deteriorating health in aged men who tend to develop primary hypogonadism.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^116yEGXD]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

The influence of aging — testosterone dynamics and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis changes indicate that among healthy aging men, HPG function may be maintained, yet beginning at age 20 to 30 years, T levels decline by 0.3% to 1.4% per year. Declining T levels are linked to primary testis failure with Leydig cells becoming less responsive to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation and the number of Leydig cells declining, but most older men with low T levels do not have increased LH. Mechanistically, production of GnRH decreases with age and GnRH/LH pulse amplitude diminishes; androgen negative feedback suppression of LH secretion may be increased; sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) levels tend to rise in older men causing free T levels to decline; and T shows higher morning levels with dampening of this diurnal rhythm as men grow older. Adult-onset hypogonadism, unlike overall hypogonadism, may be less influenced by age, and in EMAS among men with low T and normal LH levels — men likely to have AOH — age was not a significant predictor.

### Testosterone (Striant) [^112J9LkA]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Striant®delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone to the systemic circulation, thereby producing circulating testosterone concentrations in hypogonadal males that approximate physiologic levels seen in healthy young men (300–1050 ng/dL).

Testosterone - General Androgen Effects

Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal chord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics.

Male hypogonadism results from insufficient production of testosterone and is characterized by low serum testosterone concentrations. Symptoms associated with male hypogonadism include impotence and decreased sexual desire, fatigue and loss of energy, mood depression, regression of secondary sexual characteristics and osteoporosis. Hypogonadism is a risk factor for osteoporosis in men.

Drugs in the androgen class also promote retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein.

Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for the eventual termination of linear growth brought about by fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates but may cause a disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use by children and adolescents over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of the growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate the production of red blood cells by enhancing the production of erythropoietin.

During exogenous administration of androgens, endogenous testosterone release may be inhibited through feedback inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may also be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

### Primary testicular failure in Klinefelter's syndrome: the use of bivariate luteinizing hormone-testosterone reference charts [^112v6PgX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of androgen deficiency is based on clinical features and confirmatory low serum testosterone levels. In early primary testicular failure, a rise in serum LH levels suggests inadequate androgen action for the individual's physiological requirements despite a serum testosterone level within the normal range. The combined evaluation of serum LH and testosterone levels in the evaluation of testicular failure has not been widely advocated.

Patients

Seven hundred and six healthy males and 39 patients with known primary hypogonadism due to Klinefelter's syndrome and SRY-positive 46, XX karyotypes were included in the study.

Design

Testosterone, oestradiol and LH serum concentrations were measured in all individuals. Based on the 706 healthy males two-dimensional bivariate LH-testosterone reference charts were constructed.

Results

Despite a median serum total and free testosterone and oestradiol levels being reduced (P < 0.001) and LH levels elevated (P < 0.001) in Klinefelter's syndrome and 46, XX-males, many subjects (69%) had total testosterone within the reference range. However, using the bivariate charts all subjects lay outside the 97.5 percentile.

Conclusion

Bivariate LH and testosterone charts are useful in the evaluation of men with known primary testicular failure due to sex chromosomal aneuploidy in whom evaluation based on testosterone measurement in isolation underestimates the prevalence of hypogonadism. It is, however, important to emphasize that isolated use of the bivariate evaluation should not form the basis for androgen substitution therapy. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the use of bivariate LH and testosterone charts in the assessment of any younger man with possible primary testicular failure.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^114Pp2x3]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of hypogonadism — primary testicular disorders impair both Leydig and seminiferous tubule function, resulting in reduced T synthesis and hypospermatogenesis. The hormonal pattern is a low serum T level with elevated serum gonadotropin levels, whereas secondary hypogonadism, also called centrally mediated hypogonadism, is due to destruction or infiltration of the pituitary gland resulting in reduced gonadotropin synthesis and low circulating T level, with etiologies including pituitary tumors (secretory or nonsecretory), granulomatous invasion, or infectious complications and possible LHRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]) deficiency. Many chronic illnesses are associated with low T levels but do not fit into the 2 classical endocrine situations, and these adult-acquired syndromes often exhibit functional hyposecretion at the level of both pituitary and testis.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^1165tybo]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism (AOH) — diagnostic algorithm: Begin with history, physical examination, and morning total testosterone (TT; by reliable assay). If low or borderline low T (eg, T < 280–300 ng/dL or lower limit in reference laboratory), exclude drug effects and other known causes of low T; repeat morning TT with LH/FSH and SHBG, and if SHBG abnormality is suspected or T is borderline low, measure free T or bioavailable T. If normal history/physical and normal T (T > 280–300 ng/dL), no AOH and seek other causes. With confirmed low T (total T, free T or bioavailable T as appropriate), if confirmed low T with low bioavailable T, assess PRL and perform pituitary workup (eg, MRI) if total T < 150 ng/dL. Branching by gonadotropins/prolactin: low T with low or normal LH+FSH equals AOH; exclude TRT contraindications (eg, elevated Hct, breast Ca, severe sleep apnea, severe cardiac failure); begin TRT with lifestyle modifications and investigate for DM2, HL, and NAFLD and manage if present. High LH+FSH with normal PRL equals primary hypogonadism. Low/normal LH+FSH with elevated PRL warrants investigation for pituitary and other causes (eg, iron studies; other AP hormones; MRI if symptoms of mass effect or T < 150 ng/dL).

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^114mHtWq]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism — evaluation, diagnostics, and initial management are outlined as follows: Men can be classified as having AOH if they have signs and symptoms of AOH and persistently low T levels without confounds to T measurement, and signs and symptoms should be used with biochemical parameters to identify the syndrome; patients presenting with possible signs and symptoms of AOH should have a history and physical examination and morning total testosterone (T) measured by a reliable assay, and if acutely or subacutely ill their evaluation should be deferred; a low or borderline low total T should be interpreted in the context of other causes of low T, and if low then a second morning total T should be measured with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) should be measured when an SHBG abnormality is suspected, with free T or bioavailable T assessed; if T is low with elevated LH, the patient has primary hypogonadism; if T (and free/bioavailable T when indicated) is low and LH + FSH are low or normal with signs and symptoms of AOH, the patient may have AOH; if total T is extremely low (ie, < 150 ng/dL), an endocrine pituitary workup including prolactin and magnetic resonance imaging is indicated; if no cause is identified, a trial of testosterone therapy (TT) after exclusion of contraindications with lifestyle and comorbidity management is appropriate; the panel strongly recommends that TT be combined with lifestyle modifications in patients who are overweight/obese, deconditioned/sedentary, or with comorbidities or elevated psychosocial stress, and patients with signs or symptoms consistent with sleep apnea should be referred as necessary for management.

### Circulating testosterone as the hormonal basis of sex differences in athletic performance [^111YyASQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Clinically, exogenous testosterone replicates fully all effects of endogenous testosterone on every reproductive and nonreproductive organ or tissue, with the sole exception of the testis. Sperm production in the testis requires a very high concentration of testosterone (typically 100-fold greater than in the general bloodstream), which is produced in nature only by the action of the pituitary hormone LH. LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the interstitial space of the testis between seminiferous tubules to produce high intratesticular concentrations of testosterone, which are necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain sperm production in the adjacent seminiferous tubules. This high concentration of testosterone also provides a downhill gradient to supply the rest of the body, where circulating testosterone acts on androgen-responsive tissues to produce and maintain masculine patterns of androgenization. When exogenous testosterone (or any other androgen) is administered to men, pituitary LH is suppressed by negative feedback and the sperm production halts for as long as exogenous testosterone or androgen exposure continues, after which it recovers. However, even the reduction in spermatogenesis and testis size when men are treated with exogenous testosterone is only a matter of degree. It is well established in rodents that spermatogenesis is induced by exogenous testosterone when the testosterone concentrations in the testis are high enough to replicate what occurs naturally via LH stimulation. However, direct replication that high-dose testosterone also initiates and maintains spermatogenesis in humans is not feasible, as these testosterone doses are 10- to 100-fold higher than could be safely given to humans. Nevertheless, confirmatory evidence in humans is available from rare cases of men with an activating mutation of the chorionic gonadotropin/LH receptor. This mutation causes autonomous testicular testosterone secretion leading to precocious puberty arising from the premature adult male circulating testosterone concentrations that lead to complete suppression of circulating gonadotropin (LH, FSH) secretion. In this illustrative case the testis was exposed to nonphysiologically high testosterone concentrations (but without any gonadotropin stimulation) that induced sperm production and allowed for natural paternity. This indicates that even for spermatogenesis, exogenous testosterone can replicate all biological effects of endogenous testosterone in accordance with the relevant dose-response characteristics.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171UtFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Testosterone assessment and related remarks — age effects, binding, and testing considerations: Testosterone levels demonstrate an age-related decline, with healthy men reaching the highest serum T levels around the age of 30 years and thereafter showing a gradual decline at a rate of 1–2% annually, and the level below which symptoms occur has not been clearly established; about 2% of circulating T is free, 44% is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 54% is bound to albumin and other proteins. For borderline low T values, two measurements performed with the same assay are preferred. When assessing fertility is required, clinicians should perform semen analysis before starting T replacement, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces circulating gonadotropins with reductions of up to 60% for FSH and 50% for LH.

### Luteinizing hormone suppression profiles in men treated with exogenous testosterone [^115ysVq9]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the negative feedback mechanism involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, testosterone therapy (TTh) may result in suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, but clinical experience demonstrates the level of LH suppression is variable.

Aim

We sought to define the relationship between TTh and LH levels, specifically predictors of LH suppression in men on TTh.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients with testosterone deficiency (TD) treated with TTh. Patient demographic and clinical data including vascular risk factor (VRF) status were collected. Serum total T and LH levels before TTh and after ≥ 3 months (m) were recorded. LH suppression was defined as serum LH level < 1.0 IU/ml.

Main Outcome Measures

Predictors of LH suppression were searched though a series of logistic regression models assessing suppression status at the final observation, and then a series of Cox proportional hazards models assessing time to first suppression were performed.

Results

A total of 227 patients with mean age of 58 ± 14 years at time of TTh initiation were included in our analysis. Just under half of subjects received transdermal T as the only modality (n = 101, 44%), while one third (n = 77, 34%) received intramuscular only, and the remainder (n = 49, 22%) received both modalities during follow-up. The mean baseline LH level was 10 ± 12 IU/ml. The percent of men who had baseline LH level above 1 IU/ml and at any given point of TTh was 84% and 78%, respectively, thus 22% of men had suppressed LH levels on TTh considering the definition of LH < 1 IU/ml. Most men (73%) had a suppressed LH level of < 1 IU/ml at least once during follow-up. In the final adjusted model for LH suppression, intramuscular route (OR = 2.44), baseline LH (OR = 0.94), estradiol (OR = 1.05) remained significant.

Clinical Implications

LH suppression profiles may be relevant for dose titration during TTh and perhaps to minimize testicular atrophy.

Strengths & Limitations

A strict definition for TD was applied using LCMS for T measurements and patients had long-term follow-up.

Conclusion

While 73% of patients had at least one LH < 1 IU/ml during TTh, only 22% maintained suppressed throughout the treatment. Miranda EP, Schofield E, Matsushita K, et al. Luteinizing Hormone Suppression Profiles in Men Treated With Exogenous Testosterone. J Sex Med 2022;19:1359–1365.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hypogonadism in adult male patients – 2002 update [^116RNQSy]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

In these clinical practice guidelines, specific recommendations are made for determining the most effective methods of diagnosing and treating hypogonadism in adult male patients. The target populations for these guidelines include the following: (1) men with primary testicular failure requiring testosterone replacement (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); (2) male patients with gonadotropin deficiency or dysfunction who may have received testosterone replacement therapy or treatment for infertility (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); and (3) aging men with symptoms relating to testosterone deficiency who could benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Initial hormonal evaluation generally consists of a testosterone determination, in conjunction with a free testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin level, inpatients with clear symptoms and signs but normal-range total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels. Other possible tests include semen analysis, pituitary imaging studies, genetic studies, bone densitometry, testicular ultrasonography, testicular biopsy, and specialized hormonal dynamic testing. Therapeutic options generally consist of testosterone replacement by injections, patches, or topically applied gel in hypergonadotropic patients and in hypogonadotropic patients not interested in fertility. In hypogonadotropic patients interested in fertility, gonadal stimulation option scan be considered, including human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation therapy with or without human menopausal gonadotropin (or follicle-stimulating hormone) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone pump therapy. These therapies may be combined with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which may allow pregnancy to occur with very low numbers of sperm.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypogonadism [^1124vnU2]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

A systematic approach to diagnose hypogonadism initially establishes the presence of symptoms/signs of testosterone deficiency, considers other potential causes of manifestations, and excludes conditions that transiently suppress testosterone. Hypogonadism is confirmed by measuring fasting serum total testosterone in the morning on at least 2 separate days, or free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or calculated free testosterone in men with conditions that alter sex hormone-binding globulin or serum total testosterone near lower limit of normal. To guide management, further evaluation is performed to identify the specific cause of hypogonadism and whether it is potentially reversible or an irreversible pathologic disorder.

### Association of serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone with blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged and elderly men [^11699L65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In the subgroup analyses, we found that inverse association of testosterone level with the risk of prevalent hypertension remained notable only in participants aged < 65 years or BMI < 24, but not in the older or overweight men. It suggested that lower testosterone primarily had negative impacts on the relatively young or low‐normal weight population, yet the role of testosterone was attenuated in advanced age and overweight men because age‐related decline and metabolic disorders played a major part. In fact, low testosterone is a key factor in the pathogenesis of obesity, while weight gain leads to decreased testosterone. 29, 30 Furthermore, in participants who ever smoked or had a family history of hypertension, the inverse association of testosterone with hypertension was more pronounced. This interesting and novel discovery may be explained by potential synergistic or additive effects of those factors. That is, habitual smoking or familial genetic factor might aggregate the impact testosterone deficiency had on hypertension and high BP‐induced vascular damage. It also indicated that for participants who ever smoked or had a family history of hypertension, low testosterone was associated with increased risk of hypertension. Thus, they should be extra cautious when test results indicate they have testosterone deficiency.

We further evaluated the relationship between sex hormones, BP categories, and cardiovascular diseases. Testosterone was found to be inversely associated with the presence of CVD, especially in normal‐high BP and grade 1 hypertension groups, while in other groups it displayed a suggestive level of association. It is in line with the investigations showing that low testosterone is associated with increased CVD risks, such as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, and even all‐cause mortality in some studies, 31, 32, 33 although some consider it is not significantly relevant. 34, 35 Interestingly, LH was positively associated with the odds of CVD in the grade 2 hypertension group, suggesting that men with severe hypertension with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism appeared to have an increased prevalence of CVD. In fact, few studies explore the relationship between gonadotrophins and CVD in men. It is reported that men with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism are more susceptible to ischemic heart disease than those with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, 36 the underlying mechanism of which is unclear. LH might theoretically exert a direct effect on the vascular tissue or heart through the LH receptor in extragonadal sites. 37

### New horizons in testosterone and the ageing male [^1167m2da]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

The fall in testosterone levels with age appears to be a real phenomenon. Declining testicular function and hypothalamic dysregulation appear to be the mechanisms explaining the fall in testosterone levels with age. The increased prevalence of obesity and chronic illness in ageing men both cause a large drop in testosterone levels independent of ageing. Age-related hypogonadism appears to be different to other 'classical' causes of hypogonadism. Testosterone levels are not unequivocally low and associated symptoms are non-specific. In frail older men with low testosterone levels, testosterone therapy appears to improve QOL and physical function. In less frail men, however, effects of testosterone therapy in the ageing male are small and/or inconsistent. There remains an urgent need for randomised clinical trials with sufficient size, duration and power to determine specific benefits and risks of testosterone therapy in older men.

### Characteristics of secondary, primary, and compensated hypogonadism in aging men: evidence from the European male ageing study [^113z7pE5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) in older men with age-related declines in testosterone (T) is currently not well characterized.

Objective

Our objective was to investigate whether different forms of hypogonadism can be distinguished among aging men.

Design

The study was a cross-sectional survey on 3369 community-dwelling men aged 40–79 yr in eight European centers.

Methods

Four groups of subjects were defined: eugonadal (normal T and normal LH), secondary (low T and low/normal LH), primary (low T and elevated LH), and compensated (normal T and elevated LH) hypogonadism. Relationships between the defined gonadal status with potential risk factors and clinical symptoms were investigated by multilevel regression models.

Results

Among the men, 11.8, 2.0, and 9.5% were classified into the secondary, primary, and compensated hypogonadism categories, respectively. Older men were more likely to have primary [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 3.04; P < 0.001] and compensated (RRR = 2.41; P < 0.001) hypogonadism. Body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or higher was associated with secondary hypogonadism (RRR = 8.74; P < 0.001). Comorbidity was associated with both secondary and primary hypogonadism. Sexual symptoms were more prevalent in secondary and primary hypogonadism, whereas physical symptoms were more likely in compensated hypogonadism.

Conclusions

Symptomatic elderly men considered to have LOH can be differentiated on the basis of endocrine and clinical features and predisposing risk factors. Secondary hypogonadism is associated with obesity and primary hypogonadism predominately with age. Compensated hypogonadism can be considered a distinct clinical state associated with aging. Classification of LOH into different categories by combining LH with T may improve the diagnosis and management of LOH.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114EM4gb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Pituitary imaging in secondary hypogonadism — When evaluating middle-aged and older men with secondary hypogonadism, the cost-effectiveness of pituitary imaging to exclude pituitary and/or hypothalamic disease is unknown, and surveys have revealed a low prevalence of hypothalamic–pituitary abnormalities. Clinicians can improve the diagnostic yield of pituitary imaging by performing it in men with panhypopituitarism, persistent hyperprolactinemia, serum TT < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L), or symptoms of tumor mass effect such as visual impairment, visual field defect, or new onset headache. Many men with secondary hypogonadism have potentially reversible or treatable causes of gonadotropin suppression and low T concentrations that may be managed without need for testosterone treatment.

### Testosterone therapy for age-related low… [^114x19wa]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Testosterone therapy leads to small improvements in erectile and global sexual function in patients with age-related low testosterone levels, but offers no other benefits.
- Consider discontinuing therapy for age-related low testosterone levels unless sexual function improves.
- Consider prescribing intramuscular over transdermal testosterone therapy because of identical benefit and much lower cost. From the AFP Editors Testosterone levels in men normally diminish with age. For men older than 35 years, testosterone declines by nearly 2% each year. There is no cutoff for low testosterone, although a level of 300 ng per dL is used in most trials. One-fifth of patients older than 60 years and one-half of patients older than 80 years have testosterone levels less than 320 ng per dL, many without symptoms.

Treatment of age-related low testosterone is controversial, and no testosterone products are labeled for treatment of age-related effects, including sexual dysfunction. The American College of Physicians published guidelines for testosterone therapy in cis gender men with age-related low testosterone based on a systematic review. Sexual Dysfunction Testosterone therapy leads to small improvements in global sexual function and erectile function compared with placebo in men with age-related low testosterone levels. The guidelines recommend considering testosterone therapy in cis-gender men with age-related low testosterone levels who want to improve sexual function and prescribing replacement therapy only after discussion with the patient. Because of limited evidence, discontinuing testosterone therapy should be considered in patients who do not report improvement in sexual function within 12 months, after an appropriate trial.

Other Age-Related Symptoms Testosterone therapy does not improve physical or cognitive function compared with placebo. A questionable improvement in objective physical tests is too small to be clinically significant. Testosterone therapy fails to demonstrate clinically significant improvement in fatigue and depressive symptoms. Quality of life is improved with testosterone more than with placebo, although the difference is small. The group suggests not using testosterone therapy to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition. Testosterone Formulation Intramuscular and transdermal testosterone have similar benefits and harms, but intramuscular dosing is less than one-tenth the cost of transdermal formulations. The guideline group suggests that intramuscular administration be used to treat sexual dysfunction.

### Low free testosterone predicts mortality from cardiovascular disease but not other causes: the health in men study [^114g8CNh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Low testosterone is associated with all-cause mortality, but the relationship with cause-specific mortality is uncertain.

Objective

Our objective was to explore associations between testosterone and its related hormones and cause-specific mortality.

Design

This was a population-based cohort study.

Setting and Participants

Demographic and clinical predictors of mortality, and testosterone, SHBG, and LH were measured from 2001–2004 in 3637 community-dwelling men aged 70–88 yr (mean, 77 yr).

Main Outcome Measure

Cause of death was obtained via electronic record linkage until December 31, 2008.

Results

During a mean follow-up period of 5.1 yr, there were 605 deaths. Of these, 207 [34.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 30.4–38.1%] were due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), 231 to cancer (38.2%; 95% CI = 34.3–42.1%), 130 to respiratory diseases (21.5%; 95% CI = 18.2–24.8%), and 76 to other causes (12.6%; 95% CI = 9.9–15.2%). There were 39 deaths attributable to both cancer and respiratory diseases. Lower free testosterone (hazard ratio = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.20–2.19, for 100 vs. 280 pmol/liter), and higher SHBG and LH levels were associated with all-cause mortality. In cause-specific analyses, lower free testosterone (sub-hazard ratio = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.12–2.62, for 100 vs. 280 pmol/liter) and higher LH predicted CVD mortality, while higher SHBG predicted non-CVD mortality. Higher total testosterone and free testosterone levels (sub-hazard ratio = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.14–3.36, for 400 vs. 280 pmol/liter) were associated with mortality from lung cancer.

Conclusions

Low testosterone predicts mortality from CVD but is not associated with death from other causes. Prevention of androgen deficiency might improve cardiovascular outcomes but is unlikely to affect longevity otherwise.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^114ATRq4]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — adjunctive testing in men with low testosterone states that in patients with low testosterone, clinicians should measure serum luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Serum prolactin levels should be measured in patients with low testosterone levels combined with low or low/ normal luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A), and patients with persistently high prolactin levels of unknown etiology should undergo evaluation for endocrine disorders (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Serum estradiol should be measured in testosterone deficient patients who present with breast symptoms or gynecomastia prior to the commencement of testosterone therapy (Expert Opinion). Men with testosterone deficiency who are interested in fertility should have a reproductive health evaluation performed prior to treatment (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). PSA should be measured in men over 40 years of age prior to commencement of testosterone therapy to exclude a prostate cancer diagnosis (Clinical Principle).

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^11738iP2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

What Additional Diagnostic Evaluation Would Be Helpful in an Older Man With a Low Serum Testosterone Concentration That Has Been Appropriately Confirmed?

We have now confirmed that this patient has low serum testosterone concentrations. Does he have nongonadal illness or hypogonadism? The first step is the determination of serum gonadotropin concentrations. Elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations would be consistent with primary hypogonadism. Primary hypogonadism increases to 2% to 7% prevalence in men over age 70; age over 70 is associated with a progressive decline of serum testosterone concentration and a rise of serum LH concentration (to > 15 IU/L) in many men. If this man has elevated FSH and LH concentrations, then he is hypogonadal. If he has low or normal serum gonadotropin concentrations, then he should be evaluated for causes of hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction. To minimize phlebotomies and expedite the evaluation, we recommend ordering early morning, fasting serum total testosterone, SHBG, and gonadotropins at the first clinic visit.

Using serum gonadotropins as a pivot in the evaluation of possible hypogonadism is very useful. Although many causes of hypogonadism may affect the central (hypothalamus and/or pituitary) and peripheral (testes) components of the HPT axis, the serum gonadotropins indicate the site of the principal dysfunction. Primary hypogonadism defined by low testosterone concentrations and elevated gonadotropins is generally irreversible in older men, whereas many causes of secondary hypogonadism might be reversible. Thus, affirmation of elevated serum gonadotropins (FSH > LH) clinches the diagnosis of primary hypogonadism in a man with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of hypogonadism and a low serum testosterone concentration.

Although classic pathologic causes of hypogonadism have been described as organic and potentially reversible, nonclassic causes of hypogonadism such as obesity have been described as functional; we recommend classifying hypogonadism as primary or secondary and potentially reversible or irreversible. Klinefelter syndrome is an example of irreversible primary hypogonadism. Very high BMI (usually ≥ 40 kg/m²) (for review see), severe systemic disease, endogenous Cushing syndrome, endogenous hyperprolactinemia, and treatment with corticosteroids, opioids, and anti-dopaminergic medications are common causes of potentially reversible secondary (or combined secondary and primary) hypogonadism. This typology of potentially reversible or irreversible primary and secondary hypogonadism is informative and clearer and more useful than organic and functional.

### Hypogonadism in a patient with a mutation in the luteinizing hormone β-subunit gene [^112Uk7Ze]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

A 30-year-old man who presented with delayed puberty and infertility was found to have hypogonadism associated with an absence of circulating luteinizing hormone. The patient had a homozygous missense mutation in the gene that encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (Gly36Asp), a mutation that disrupted a vital cystine knot motif and abrogated the heterodimerization and secretion of luteinizing hormone. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin increased circulating testosterone, promoted virilization, and was associated with the appearance of normal spermatozoa in low concentrations. This case illustrates the important physiological role that luteinizing hormone plays in male sexual maturation and fertility.

### Luteinizing hormone β-subunit deficiency: report of a novel LHB likely pathogenic variant and a systematic review of the published literature [^111e84Xw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Selective deficiency of β-subunit of luteinizing hormone (LHB) is a rare disease with scarce data on its characteristics.

Objectives

To describe a male with LHB deficiency and systematically review the literature.

Design and Patients

Description of a male patient with LHB deficiency and a systematic review of LHB deficiency patients published to date (10 males and 3 females) as per PRISMA guidelines.

Results

A 36-year-old Asian Indian male presented with infertility. On evaluation, he had sexual maturity of Tanner's stage 3, low testosterone (0.23ng/ml), low LH (0.44mIU/ml), high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, 22.4mIU/ml), and a novel homozygous missense likely pathogenic variant (p. Cys46Arg) in LHB. In the molecular dynamics simulation study, this variant interferes with heterodimerization of alpha-beta subunits. Eleven males with pathogenic variants in LHB reported to date, presented at a median age of 29 (17–38) years, most commonly with delayed puberty. Clinical and biochemical profiles were similar to those of our patient. In the majority, testosterone monotherapy modestly increased testicular volume whereas human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) monotherapy also improved spermatogenesis. In females, oligomenorrhoea after spontaneous menarche was the most common manifestation. Ten pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (three in-frame deletions, three missense, two splice-site, one nonsense, and one frameshift variants) have been reported in nine index patients.

Conclusion

We report a novel likely pathogenic LHB variant in an Asian Indian patient. The typical phenotype in male patients with LHB deficiency is delayed puberty with low testosterone, low LH, and normal to high FSH and hCG monotherapy being the best therapeutic option.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^114uFEqc]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

### Hypopituitarism [^115aEe7e]. Pituitary (2006). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is the partial or complete insufficiency of anterior pituitary hormone secretion and may result from pituitary or hypothalamic disease. The reported incidence (12–42 new cases per million per year) and prevalence (300–455 per million) is probably underestimated if its occurrence after brain injuries (30–70% of cases) is considered. Clinical manifestations depend on the extent of hormone deficiency and may be non specific, such as fatigue, hypotension, cold intolerance, or more indicative such as growth retardation or impotence and infertility in GH and gonadotropin deficiency, respectively. A number of inflammatory, granulomatous or neoplastic diseases as well as traumatic or radiation injuries involving the hypothalamic-pituitary region can lead to hypopituitarism. Several genetic defects are possible causes of syndromic and non syndromic isolated/multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. Unexplained gonadal dysfunctions, developmental craniofacial abnormalities, newly discovered empty sella and previous pregnancy-associated hemorrhage or blood pressure changes may be associated with defective anterior pituitary function. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism relies on the measurement of basal and stimulated secretion of anterior pituitary hormones and of the hormones secreted by pituitary target glands. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. Genetic testing, when indicated, may be diagnostic. Secondary hypothyroidism is a rare disease. The biochemical diagnosis is suggested by low serum FT4 levels and inappropriately normal or low basal TSH levels that do not rise normally after TRH. L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice. Before starting replacement therapy, concomitant corticotropin deficiency should be excluded in order to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency. Prolactin deficiency is also very rare and generally occurs after global failure of pituitary function. Prolactin deficiency prevents lactation. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males is characterized by low testosterone with low or normal LH and FSH serum concentrations and impaired spermatogenesis. Hyperprolactinemia as well as low sex hormone binding globulin concentrations enter the differential diagnosis. Irregular menses and amenorrhea with low serum estradiol concentration (< 100 pmol/l) and normal or low gonadotropin concentrations are the typical features of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in females. In post menopausal women, failure to detect high serum gonadotropin values is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. In males, replacement therapy with oral or injectable testosterone results in wide fluctuations of serum hormone levels. More recently developed transdermal testosterone preparations allow stable physiological serum testosterone levels. Pulsatile GnRH administration can be used to stimulate spermatogenesis in men and ovulation in women with GnRH deficiency and normal gonadotropin secretion. Gonadotropin administration is indicated in cases of gonadotropin deficiency or GnRH resistance but is also an option, in alternative to pulsatile GnRH, for patients with defective GnRH secretion.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years. 1 Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia; osteoporosis (see Table 1). 2 Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting. 3 Measure TT when patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 Am. 4 Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected (see Table 2). Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone given the limitations discussed in the manuscript and focus instead on interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum free testosterone with an accurate method. 5 Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging also indicated if there are symptoms of a sellar mass, serum LH is undetectable, or serum total testosterone is < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). 6 This includes optimization of management of chronic disease, stopping medications that can suppress the HPT axis if possible (eg, opioids, glucocorticoids), evaluation and treatment of depression and sleep apnea. 7 Consider karyotype for assessment for Klinefelter syndrome; offer testosterone treatment if there is no contraindication (including desire to conceive in the next 1–2 years). 8 The decision to offer testosterone therapy should take into consideration the likelihood of benefit and the potential risk. The benefits are highest in men with lower testosterone concentrations and men with concordantly low total and free testosterone concentrations. A trial of testosterone therapy may be offered if the following conditions are met: 1) there are no contraindications; 2) there has been a discussion regarding potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy and the uncertainties regarding long-term health outcomes; 3) patient-specific goals have been set; and 4) there is agreement that testosterone treatment will be stopped if these goals are not achieved. See text in manuscript. 9 Reassessment of men with high BMI consists of assessment for symptoms and signs of hypogonadism and re-measurement of testosterone. If there are symptoms of hypogonadism and low serum testosterone after 6–12 months of lifestyle changes, then testosterone therapy may be considered. Medical therapy to achieve weight loss and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for men whose BMI remains > 30 kg/m² after 6 months of lifestyle changes. Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; FT, free testosterone; HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total testosterone; SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns. Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by current evidence, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

### Testosterone (Natesto) [^111uWiV5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Natesto is indicated for replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.

Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): testicular failure due to conditions such as cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchiectomy, Klinefelter's syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol or heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone concentrations and gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH]) above the normal range.
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. These men have low testosterone serum concentrations but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range.

Limitations of use:

Safety and efficacy of Natesto in men with "age-related hypogonadism" (also referred to as "late-onset hypogonadism") have not been established.
Safety and efficacy of Natesto in males less than 18 years old have not been established [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Natesto is an androgen indicated for replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone:

Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) (1)
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) (1)

Limitations of use:

Safety and efficacy of Natesto in men with "age-related hypogonadism" have not been established (1).

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113CJiev]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Distinguishing between primary or secondary hypogonadism — in men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary-hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations. This recommendation is graded (1|⊕⊕⊕○). Measuring LH and FSH concentrations can help distinguish between primary and secondary hypogonadism.

### Association of serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone with blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged and elderly men [^116J3pSj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our findings indicate high BP is associated with decreased TT, FT, and SHBG in middle‐aged and elderly men. Thus, lower TT could be a promising marker for prevalent hypertension. Age > 65 years or overweight could attenuate the inverse association between testosterone and hypertension. However, those who smoke or have a family history of hypertension should be extra cautious when testing reveals testosterone deficiency. Furthermore, primary hypogonadism, which is characterized by increased LH, could potentially be a risk marker for major CVDs in men with relatively severe hypertension. An enhanced understanding of those associations may lead to better preventive and therapeutic strategies of testosterone‐related diseases.
