## Question

patient just started school this week and mother wants to increase ritalin dose saying patient is disruptive. is this too quick?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about whether it is too soon to increase a child's methylphenidate dose after only 5–7 days of school-related disruption, and what the minimum acceptable interval is before the first dose escalation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled titration schedule and the principle of titrating to effect. Then, I should review how much time is typically needed at a stable dose to assess efficacy and tolerability. Next, I will consider confounding environmental factors from the start of school. After that, I need to weigh the safety risks of premature escalation. Then, I should define the monitoring period and data needed before changing the dose. Finally, I will consider formulation and coverage issues and synthesize a practical recommendation with the minimum interval and a short-term plan, guided by pediatric ADHD guidelines and labeling data [^117Az1RR] [^1145xUKk].

> Let me first confirm the standard titration protocol so I don't jump to conclusions. The FDA label for immediate-release methylphenidate in children 6 years and older recommends starting at 5 mg before breakfast and lunch and increasing by 5–10 mg increments at weekly intervals, not exceeding 60 mg/day, which operationalizes "start low and go slow" rather than rapid escalation within days [^117Az1RR] [^115SVGP3]. Hold on, I should verify that the clinical maxim aligns with practical dosing; yes, guidance also emphasizes individualized titration to benefit with tolerable adverse effects rather than chasing a maximum dose, reinforcing the same cadence of weekly adjustments [^1145xUKk] [^1121hADU].

> Now, I need to check the timeframe. If the child just started school this week, that implies only 5–7 days on the current regimen, which is usually insufficient to judge behavioral response and side effects, since clinicians often assess response over at least 1–2 weeks at a stable dose and the label itself contemplates weekly, not intra-week, increases [^117Az1RR]. Wait, let me verify guideline framing; pediatric ADHD guidance stresses systematic, data-driven titration over time rather than reactive changes within days, which supports allowing adequate observation at a fixed dose before changing it [^1145xUKk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "medication failure" when a major environmental transition is in play. The first week of school adds new routines, academic demands, and social stressors that can transiently worsen ADHD behaviors; I need to ensure we distinguish situational adjustment from true inadequate pharmacologic coverage by observing during a period of relative stability before escalating the dose [^1145xUKk]. Let me reconsider how to interpret this: short-term disruption right after school starts is a confounder, so premature dose increases risk attributing environmental effects to the medication [^115BuZ5J].

> Next, I should review safety risks of premature titration so I keep risk–benefit in view. Rapid dose escalation can amplify common adverse effects such as appetite suppression, insomnia, irritability, and rebound, and increases the chance of overshooting the therapeutic window; there are also nontrivial long-term concerns about slowed growth velocity and short-term increases in heart rate and blood pressure that warrant measured, monitored titration rather than quick jumps [^112Srosq] [^114sAuff] [^115iQSnx]. But wait, what if early escalation is driven by acute impairment; even then, I should confirm that adverse event monitoring and cardiovascular screening are in place before changing the dose [^115iQSnx] [^114sAuff].

> I will now examine what monitoring period is reasonable before adjusting. I should confirm that we have 7–14 days of structured observations at home and school, using teacher and parent rating inputs where possible, along with a side effect log capturing appetite, sleep, mood, and tics; without these data, it is hard to judge whether to increase the morning dose, add a midday or early afternoon dose, or change formulation [^1145xUKk]. Let me verify that adherence and administration timing line up with the school schedule too, since suboptimal timing can masquerade as inadequate dosing and is a correctable issue without dose escalation [^1145xUKk] [^116sm6ra].

> But wait, what if the problem is a coverage gap rather than an underdose. Immediate-release methylphenidate typically lasts about 3–4 hours, so afternoon disruption may reflect waning effect; in that case, adding a school-time or early afternoon IR dose or switching to an extended-release formulation could provide smoother coverage across the school day, often with fewer peaks and troughs, before simply increasing total mg load [^114Gsvdv] [^112faPrQ]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline principles emphasizing long-acting options to improve adherence and all-day symptom control in school-aged children, particularly when midday dosing is impractical [^1145xUKk].

> Next, I should review core guideline principles to anchor the decision. The AAP recommends titrating to maximum benefit with tolerable side effects using a shared, data-informed process, not calendar pressure; that means decisions to escalate are driven by documented impairment and tolerability across settings, with measured weekly steps if needed rather than intra-week changes, and with integration of behavioral supports at school [^1145xUKk] [^115Xj9pb]. Hold on, I should verify that nothing in the guidance suggests accelerating within the first week absent urgent safety concerns; I see no such exception, which supports waiting for adequate observation and data gathering first [^1145xUKk].

> Let me synthesize this and be explicit about the minimum interval. At first glance, I was inclined to say we should always wait 2–4 weeks before any escalation; wait, let me correct that with the label in hand: the FDA-labeled minimum interval for IR methylphenidate titration is one week, so the earliest evidence-based change can occur after a full week, but good clinical practice commonly involves 1–2 weeks of observation at a stable dose with data before escalating, especially during confounded periods like the first week of school [^117Az1RR] [^1145xUKk]. Given this child has only had 5–7 days with a major environmental change, I should confirm that immediate escalation is premature unless there is clear documentation of inadequate morning response, proper timing, and acceptable tolerability, in which case a cautious, label-consistent weekly increment could be considered after completing at least the first full week of data collection [^117Az1RR] [^1145xUKk].

> Final assessment: Yes, this is too quick to increase the dose based solely on the first week of school disruption without structured data and adequate time at a stable dose; the minimum acceptable interval for first escalation is one full week per labeling, but 2–4 weeks with systematic monitoring is often preferred to avoid confounding and safely gauge effect, with attention to growth and cardiovascular parameters during titration [^117Az1RR] [^1145xUKk] [^112Srosq] [^114sAuff]. I need to ensure that we also counsel on early seizure vigilance in the first month after initiation or dose change, even though the absolute risk appears low, to maintain comprehensive safety monitoring during titration [^1133q3V6].

> Recommended short-term plan: Let me first confirm correct dosing times relative to class periods and adherence this week; if timing is suboptimal, fix that now and continue the current dose for another 1–2 weeks while collecting teacher and parent ratings and a side-effect log. Next, I should review the pattern of impairment by time of day; if symptoms cluster later in the day, consider adding a midday IR dose or switching to an extended-release product to smooth coverage rather than simply increasing the morning dose. After at least one full week, and preferably 2 weeks, if impairment persists with good adherence and tolerability, then increase by 5 mg per dose in weekly steps per FDA labeling, with BP/HR and growth monitoring and re-checks for mood, sleep, appetite, and tics, alongside reinforcement of school-based behavioral supports and family education about risks and benefits [^117Az1RR] [^1145xUKk] [^114Gsvdv] [^112Srosq] [^114sAuff].

Yes, it is **too soon** to increase the Ritalin dose after just one week of school. Wait at least **1–2 weeks** at the current dose to allow for school adjustment and to assess response and side effects [^117Az1RR]. Dose changes should be based on **structured teacher ratings and direct observation**, not solely on parent report. If symptoms persist after this period, titrate by 5–10 mg weekly as needed, with close monitoring of efficacy and adverse effects [^117Az1RR] [^115SVGP3].

---

## Recommended titration schedule for methylphenidate

- **Initial dose**: 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) [^117Az1RR] [^115SVGP3].
- **Titration**: Increase by 5–10 mg weekly based on response and tolerability [^117Az1RR] [^1121eNFn].
- **Maximum dose**: 60 mg/day [^117Az1RR] [^112z8i94].

---

## Clinical guidelines on timing of dose adjustments

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing and gradual titration** to balance efficacy and side effects [^1121hADU]. The AAP recommends titrating to achieve maximal benefit with tolerable side effects, typically **over several weeks** [^1145xUKk]. Early dose changes can obscure the true response and increase adverse effects [^1121eNFn].

---

## Risks associated with rapid dose escalation

Rapid dose escalation can increase **adverse effects**, including:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Elevated blood pressure and heart rate [^114sAuff] [^115wTN5y].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, irritability, aggression, and rare psychotic symptoms [^115iQSnx] [^113HGT9H].
- **Growth suppression**: Reduced appetite and slowed growth [^112Srosq] [^112BFn87].

---

## Importance of monitoring and assessment

Careful monitoring is **essential** to optimize outcomes and minimize risks. Clinicians should use structured teacher ratings and direct observation to guide adjustments, because parent reports alone may not accurately reflect school behavior.

---

## Recommended approach in this scenario

Because the patient has just started school, it is **premature to increase the dose** based solely on early parent reports. The recommended approach is:

- **Maintain current dose**: Continue the current dose for at least 1–2 weeks to allow school adjustment and accurate assessment [^115SVGP3].
- **Collect structured data**: Obtain teacher ratings and direct observations to guide dose changes [^1145xUKk].
- **Reassess after 1–2 weeks**: If symptoms persist, titrate by 5–10 mg weekly with close monitoring [^117Az1RR].

---

## Conclusion

It is **too soon to increase the Ritalin dose** after just one week of school. Maintain the current dose for **1–2 weeks**, collect structured teacher ratings, then titrate gradually if needed, balancing efficacy and side effects.

### Ritalin [^117Az1RR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **Pediatric patients 6 years and older**: Start with 5 mg orally twice daily (before breakfast and lunch), titrating the dose weekly in 5- to 10-mg increments. Dosages above 60 mg/day are not recommended.
	- **Adults**: The average daily dosage is 20 mg to 30 mg, administered 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. The maximum total daily dosage is 60 mg. For patients who are unable to sleep due to late dosing, the last dose should be taken before 6 p.m.

- **Pretreatment screening**: Prior to treating patients with Ritalin, assess for the presence of cardiac disease by performing a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and a physical exam [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Evaluate the family history and clinically assess patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating Ritalin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

- **General dosing information**:
	- **Pediatric patients 6 years and older**: Start with 5 mg orally twice daily and increase the dosage gradually in 5- to 10-mg increments weekly. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.
	- **Adults**: The average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily, administered in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. The maximum total daily dosage is 60 mg.

- **Dosage reduction and discontinuation**: If paradoxical worsening of symptoms or other adverse reactions occur, reduce the dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue Ritalin. If improvement is not observed after appropriate treatment, further evaluation is necessary.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^116jYe5p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Methylphenidate HCl oral solution is indicated for use as part of a comprehensive treatment program for Attention Deficit Disorders and narcolepsy. This program typically includes psychological, educational, and social measures to stabilize children with a behavioral syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Diagnosis should not be made based solely on symptoms of recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disabilities, and abnormal EEG may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may be considered.

- **Special diagnostic considerations**: The specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. An adequate diagnosis requires a comprehensive approach utilizing medical, psychological, educational, and social resources. Commonly reported characteristics include a chronic history of short attention span, distractibility, emotional lability, impulsivity, and moderate-to-severe hyperactivity. Minor neurological signs and abnormal EEG may be observed, and learning may or may not be impaired.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of new-onset seizures [^1133q3V6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually treated with stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (MPH). ADHD is associated with an increased risk of seizures, and in this context, concerns have been expressed that stimulant drugs, including MPH, may increase the seizure risk. However, four large observational studies have found that ADHD drugs in general and stimulant drugs in particular are not associated with increased seizure risk and may, in fact, be associated with a reduced risk of seizures; these studies were largely conducted in children and adolescents, including those with epilepsy, with or without other brain comorbidities. The findings were obtained in both between-subjects and within-subjects analyses; the latter controlled for time-invariant inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds. These reassuring results support the results of many small, short-duration trials that found that MPH was not associated with increased seizure risk.

One other observational study, however, found that MPH was indeed associated with an increased risk of seizures, but only during the first 30 days after drug initiation; there was no increase in risk in earlier or later time windows. There are many reasons why this single finding should be viewed with reservation; in any case, even if the finding is valid, the absolute risk of seizures with MPH appears to be very low. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that MPH may be safely used in children and adolescents, even those with or past history of epilepsy. However, prudence dictates that attention b

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Xj9pb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, specifically concerning pharmacotherapy, the 2019 AAP guidelines recommend considering the use of methylphenidate in pediatric patients aged 4–5 years if behavioral interventions fail to yield significant improvement. This is particularly advised when there is a moderate-to-severe disturbance in the patient's functioning. It is important to weigh the risks of starting medication before the age of 6 against the potential harm of delaying treatment, especially in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are unavailable.

In cases of moderate-to-severe ADHD with tics, treatment with psychostimulants, which are the first-line choice for ADHD, is likely required. Therefore, when tics are also present, augmenting methylphenidate with guanfacine to address symptoms of both conditions seems preferable. Using guanfacine may additionally benefit ADHD symptoms, as shown by evidence, and the adverse events were generally mild to moderate, with no differences in safety or tolerability noted in combined treatment.

While it is best for children to receive as few medications as possible at the lowest dose to achieve desired clinical goals, combining treatments may be beneficial when there is clear impairment from both disorders. Especially when ADHD symptoms are more severe and impairing, a combination of methylphenidate and guanfacine is worth considering.

The addition of guanfacine can also potentially benefit sleep difficulties and night-time settling, reducing the need for alternatives such as melatonin.

- **Antipsychotics vs. clonidine/guanfacine**: When treating tics in children and young people, consider antipsychotics more appropriate than clonidine or guanfacine when warranted. A recent prescribing survey among 59 European expert clinicians, members of the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome, identified the most commonly used medications for tics in children and adolescents, in descending order, as aripiprazole, clonidine, and tiapride (not available in the United Kingdom).

### Editorial: On the safety of long-term methylphenidate treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in early childhood [^1148wTvZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

The clinical manifestations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often emerge before six years of age, and an early onset can lead to a more marked and severe clinical course. Given that untreated ADHD can negatively impact educational attainment and social functioning, early treatment is indicated, as it might result in better long-term outcomes. For this age group, clinical guidelines and ADHD experts recommend administering behavioral therapy as the first-line treatment. Due to the limited information available on the possible safety implications of long-term pharmacological treatment at young ages, the use of methylphenidate is reserved for cases with impairing ADHD symptoms unresponsive to psychosocial intervention.

### Treatment outcomes with licensed and unlicensed stimulant doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138w7NB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are often prescribed at unlicensed doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The benefits and risks of dose escalation beyond US Food and Drug Administration recommendations remain unclear.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of stimulant doses on treatment outcomes in adults with ADHD and determine whether unlicensed doses present positive risk benefits compared to licensed doses. The study involved a comprehensive search of twelve databases, including published sources like PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science, as well as unpublished literature from ClinicalTrials.gov, up to February 22, 2023, without language restrictions.

Two researchers independently screened records to identify double-blinded randomized clinical trials of stimulants versus placebo in adults (18 years and older) with ADHD. Data were then extracted and synthesized using random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and network meta-analyses.

Main outcome measures included changes in ADHD symptoms and discontinuations due to adverse events. Results indicated that 47 randomized clinical trials consisting of 7,714 participants (mean age 35, SD 11 years; 56% male) were included. For methylphenidate, dose-response curves indicated additional symptom reductions with dosage increases, though gains diminished progressively and were accompanied by increased risk of adverse event-related discontinuations. Network meta-analyses also illustrated that unlicensed doses continued to demonstrate similar trends.

### Effects of a single-dose methylphenidate challenge on resting-state functional connectivity in stimulant-treatment naive children and adults with ADHD [^1137YUQk]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increasingly been considered a disorder of brain-wide network dysconnectivity rather than region-specific deficits. Methylphenidate, the primary pharmacological treatment for ADHD, has been proposed to alter functional connectivity in various brain-wide functional circuits affected by ADHD. For instance, normalized connectivity in fronto-parietal-cerebellar circuits has been observed in children with ADHD following acute methylphenidate administration. This was first observed by An et al, demonstrating that a single dose of methylphenidate, compared to placebo, upregulated abnormally decreased local connectivity in bilateral ventral prefrontal cortices and the cerebellar vermis. It also downregulated abnormally increased local connectivity in the right parietal and visual areas in children with ADHD.

Similarly, Silk et al. found that a single dose of methylphenidate, compared to placebo, normalized increased functional connectivity in occipital, temporal, and cerebellar regions, as well as in visual, executive, and default mode networks in adolescents with ADHD. More recently, alterations in fronto-parietal-cerebellar circuits have also been observed following prolonged methylphenidate treatment in medication-naïve children with ADHD. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that such normalization might also occur in adults with ADHD. However, due to methodological heterogeneity in previous studies, further research is required to confirm these findings.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering arranging for a parent, health professional, such as a trained school nurse, or other trusted adult to directly observe the administration of the medication. This is especially important if using a short-acting formulation in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder with ADHD. Consider counseling families on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications.

Only after all these aspects have been assessed should the prescriber consider the following options:

- **Second-line medications**: Atomoxetine, which selectively inhibits the norepinephrine transporter; guanfacine, which selectively stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors; or clonidine, which selectively stimulates alpha-2A adrenergic receptors.

- **Augmenting agents**: Guanfacine or clonidine XR.

- **Other agents**: These should be used under specialist advice or supervision, and RCTs provide preliminary evidence of efficacy (e.g. bupropion, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).

Does the concomitant use of cannabis impact the effectiveness and tolerability of psychostimulants?

The evidence on the effectiveness of psychostimulants in marijuana users and the tolerability of the combination of psychostimulants and marijuana is limited. In an RCT of OROS-methylphenidate and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in youths with substance use disorder, which was primarily marijuana (66% of cases), there were no significant differences in efficacy between participants assigned to OROS-methylphenidate plus CBT and those in the placebo plus CBT group when considering the primary outcome (scores on the ADHD-RS completed by clinicians). However, ADHD-RS scores rated by parents were significantly lower in adolescents treated with OROS-MPH and CBT compared to those in the placebo and CBT arm at 8 and 16 weeks. The tolerability of OROS-methylphenidate was not substantially different from what would be expected with OROS-methylphenidate alone. Another RCT showed additive effects.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to psychostimulants, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of long-acting methylphenidate formulations at or above the maximum dose approved by the FDA for ADHD to effectively reduce amphetamine-type stimulants use.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (For) [^117MmqwR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Long-term effectiveness studies for ADHD medications are complicated to design well, and no single study design will capture the entire picture. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the highest level of evidence, most authorities agree that, when you have treatments as efficacious as ADHD medications (methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives and prodrugs, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine), it is neither practical nor ethical to conduct long-term placebo-controlled RCTs. Consequently, almost all of the RCT evidence for ADHD medications relates to short-term studies, which, although providing strong evidence for short-term efficacy, do not speak to long-term effectiveness.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the need for additional evidence of long-term effects before granting licenses for medications that will usually need to be taken for several years. They introduced a requirement for companies to demonstrate longer-term efficacy, which has generally been done through randomized withdrawal designs intended to demonstrate continued efficacy over a period of 6 to 12 months. Several such studies have been completed and published, all of which, as expected, demonstrate continued efficacy.

The EMA also insisted that all new ADHD medications demonstrate continued effectiveness, with adverse effects and safety assessed over up to 2 years. Again, the studies completed so far support continued effectiveness, and, although they highlight the presence of common, expected adverse effects, they have not identified any new safety concerns.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^116vC4sb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, or both, along with hyperactivity, affecting children, adolescents, and adults. In some countries, methylphenidate is the first option to treat adults with moderate or severe ADHD. However, evidence on the efficacy and adverse events of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate in treating ADHD in adults is limited and controversial.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and harms (adverse events) of IR methylphenidate for treating ADHD in adults.

- **Search methods**: In January 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight additional databases, and three trial registers. We also searched internal reports on the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration websites. We checked citations of included trials to identify additional trials not captured by the electronic searches.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IR methylphenidate, at any dose, with placebo or other pharmacological interventions (including extended-release formulations of methylphenidate) for ADHD in adults. Primary outcomes comprised changes in the symptoms of ADHD (efficacy) and harms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the clinical impression of severity and improvement, level of functioning, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Outcomes could have been rated by investigators or participants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data independently on the characteristics of the trials and participants.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: A population-based cohort study [^113HGT9H]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

There is a clinical concern that prescribing methylphenidate, the most common pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), might increase the risk of psychotic events, particularly in young people with a history of psychosis. We aimed to determine whether the risk of psychotic events increases immediately after initiation of methylphenidate treatment or, in the longer term, one year after treatment initiation in adolescents and young adults with and without a previously diagnosed psychotic disorder.

- **Methods**: In this cohort study, we used population-based observational data from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, the National Patient Register, and the Total Population Register. These are three population-based registers containing data on all individuals in Sweden, providing information on sex, birth, death, migration, medication use, and psychotic events for all eligible participants. We screened individuals on these registers to identify those receiving methylphenidate treatment, who were aged 12–30 years at the start of treatment, for inclusion in the study.

We used a within-individual design to compare the incidence of psychotic events in these individuals during the 12-week periods immediately before and after methylphenidate initiation. Longer-term risk was assessed by comparing the incidence of psychotic events 12 weeks before methylphenidate initiation and during a 12-week period one calendar year before the initiation of methylphenidate with the incidence of these events during the 12-week period one calendar year after methylphenidate initiation.

### Stimulant-related reductions of growth rates in the PATS [^112BFn87]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

To investigate the growth of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS), before and after initiation of treatment with methylphenidate at titrated doses (average, 14.2 mg/day) administered three times daily, 7 days/week for approximately 1 year, the following method was used:

The heights and weights of 140 children with ADHD were measured up to 29 times according to the PATS protocol, starting at an average age of 4.4 years. The relationship between standard (z) scores and time on medication was examined using mixed-effect regression to estimate change in relative size (slope).

Average relative size at baseline was significantly greater than zero (p < 0.0001) for z height (+0.45) and z weight (+0.78), indicating greater than expected height (by 2.04 cm) and weight (by 1.78 kg). During treatment, slopes were significantly less than zero (p < 0.0001) for z height (-0.304/yr) and z weight (-0.530/yr), indicating reduction of growth rates. For 95 children who remained on medication, annual growth rates were 20.3% less than expected for height (5.41 cm/yr - 6.79 cm/yr = -1.38 cm/yr) and 55.2% for weight (1.07 kg/yr - 2.39 kg/yr = -1.32 kg/yr).

Risks of reduced growth rates should be balanced against expected benefits when preschool-age children are treated with stimulant medication.

### SPL drug information for methylphenidate hydrochloride [^1116kiSG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride PO (also known as Ritalin, Methylin, Daytrana):

- **Exacerbation of acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.
- **Exacerbation of peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud's phenomenon**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon.
- **Exacerbation of psychosis**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing psychotic disorders.
- **Exacerbation of tics**: Use caution in patients with Tourette's syndrome.
- **Increased intraocular pressure**: Use caution in patients with open-angle glaucoma.
- **Priapism**: Use caution in adult and pediatric male patients, especially with a history of sexual impairment.
- **Weight loss, growth delay**: Use caution in pediatric patients.

### Methamphetamine hydrochloride [^116FSm89]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years, who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate. On average, there is a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years, without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth; however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.

- **Seizures**: There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with a prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued.

- **Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon**: Stimulants, including methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets used to treat ADHD, are associated with peripheral vasculopathy.

Safety concerns about central nervous system stimulants for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) include adverse cardiac effects. This study aimed to compare the risk for cardiac events in users of methylphenidate and amphetamine salts.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort design using claims data from the Florida Medicaid fee-for-service program, representing a total of 2,131,953 children and adolescents, was used. The analysis included all beneficiaries who were between 3 and 20 years of age, enrolled between July 1994 and June 2004, had at least one physician diagnosis of ADHD, and were newly started on methylphenidate or amphetamine salts. Each month of follow-up was classified according to stimulant use into current use or former use. We defined cardiac events as the first emergency department (ED) visit for cardiac disease or symptoms. The risk between current users of methylphenidate versus amphetamine salts, and former users of drugs in these categories, was compared using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model that adjusted for differences in gender, race, age, year of the index date, disability, congenital anomalies, history of circulatory disease, history of hospital admission, and use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and bronchodilators.

- **Results**: A total of 456 youths visited the ED for cardiac reasons during 52,783 years of follow-up. After adjustment for differences in covariates, the risk for cardiac ED visits was similar among users of methylphenidate or amphetamines. Periods of former use had a similar risk between users.

### Evaluation of methylphenidate safety and maximum-dose titration rationale in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A meta-analysis [^1121eNFn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Evidence on the titration of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is lacking. This absence of evidence has not prevented medication guidelines from specifying seemingly arbitrary dose limitations, which could discourage clinicians from titrating methylphenidate to higher, potentially more efficacious doses for some patients.

- **Objective**: To determine evidence on dose titration and adverse events associated with dose titration of stimulants for ADHD.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, and PsycINFO from 1806 through April 1, 2019, were searched to identify relevant articles.

- **Study selection**: The inclusion criteria were: (1) the study was conducted on children up to 18 years of age; (2) children had a diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or hyperkinetic disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases codes; and (3) the dose of methylphenidate was determined by titration.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: The PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity were followed. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Jadad scoring system. Statistical analysis was carried out using a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The outcomes of interest were: (1) the doses used in published clinical trials, (2) the clinical justification given by researchers for their selected dose range, and (3) the adverse effects associated with methylphenidate when the dose is established by titration.

- **Results**:

Other serious side effects include:

- **Slowing of growth**: (height and weight) in children.
- **Seizures**: Mainly in patients with a history of seizures.
- **Visual symptoms**: Eyesight changes or blurred vision.
- **Painful and prolonged erections**: (priapism) have occurred with methylphenidate. If you or your child develop priapism, seek medical help right away. Because of the potential for lasting damage, priapism should be evaluated by a doctor immediately.

Common side effects include:

- Talk to your doctor if you or your child has side effects that are bothersome or do not go away. This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

How should I store methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution?

### Methylphenidate HCl [^112kgPuK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the post-marketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of these behaviors.

- **Seizures**: There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with a prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued.

- **Priapism**: Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.

- **Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon**: Stimulants, including methylphenidate HCl, used to treat ADHD, are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^116sm6ra]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Safe and effective medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is available and recommended as first-line treatment for the core symptoms of inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness. Despite impaired functioning during adolescence, many discontinue medication treatment. For children, healthcare decisions are usually made by the parent; older youth make their own decisions. Beliefs and attitudes may differ widely. Some families understand that ADHD is a neurobiological condition and accept that medication is indicated; for others, such treatment is unacceptable.

Converging evidence describes negative perceptions of the burden associated with medication use as well as concerns about potential short- and long-term adverse effects. Indeed, experiences of adverse effects are a frequent explanation for discontinuation among youth. Ways to improve shared decision-making among practitioners, parents, and youth, and to monitor effectiveness, safety, and new onset of difficulties, are likely to optimize outcomes.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^112bkwRs]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 5.3% of youths and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Individuals with ADHD present increased risks for a wide array of psychiatric and somatic conditions, serious functional outcomes, and premature death. This makes the delivery of safe and effective treatments, which improve both the core symptoms and related impairments, a key public health issue. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that ADHD medications are effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms and large observational studies further indicate these medications are associated with lower risks of real-world outcomes, including injuries, crime, transport crashes, suicide attempts, and unnatural-cause mortality.

In recent years, in many countries, the administrative prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was much lower than the estimated epidemiological prevalence. However, the diagnosis of ADHD and prescription of ADHD medication has increased substantially worldwide over the last decade. A recent study reported an annual rise of 9.7% in ADHD medication use across 64 countries between 2015 and 2019. Sweden has seen a particularly sharp increase in ADHD medication use over the years. From 2006 to 2020, ADHD medication use in children increased nearly 5-fold, from 0.6% to 2.8%, and more than 10-fold in adults, from 0.1% to 1.3% during this period, positioning Sweden among countries with the highest rates of ADHD medication prescription globally. Similar trends are observed in other European countries.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^115SVGP3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Dosage and administration: Dosage should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient.

- **Adults**: Administer in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. The average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily. Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily. In others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate. Patients who are unable to sleep if medication is taken late in the day should take the last dose before 6 p.m.

- **Children (6 years and over)**: Methylphenidate HCl should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly increments. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended. If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued. Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly. If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur, reduce dosage or, if necessary, discontinue the drug. Methylphenidate HCl should be periodically discontinued to assess the child's condition. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued. Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may be discontinued after puberty.

### Model-based approach for optimizing study design and clinical drug performances of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate for the treatment of ADHD [^113ykuWr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate (MPH) is currently used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several extended-release (ER) formulations characterized by a dual release process were developed to improve efficacy over an extended duration. In this study, a model-based approach using literature data was developed to:

- **Evaluate the most efficient pharmacokinetic (PK) model**: Characterize the complex PK profile of MPH ER formulations.
- **Provide PK endpoint metrics**: Compare ER formulations.
- **Define criteria for optimizing development**: Use a convolution-based model linking in vitro release, in vivo release, and hour-by-hour behavioral ratings of ADHD symptoms.
- **Define an optimized trial design**: Assess the activity of MPH in pediatric populations.

The convolution-based model accurately described the complex PK profiles of a variety of ER MPH products, providing a natural framework for establishing an in vitro/in vivo correlation and for defining criteria for assessing comparative bioequivalence of MPH ER products.

### Editorial: Time for a new conversation on stimulant use [^111bGuuB]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Psychostimulants are one of the safest and most efficacious pharmacological interventions for a psychiatric disorder. In 1999, the groundbreaking Multimodal Treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) Study set the standard of care for long-term treatment for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since then, stimulant use has increased substantially around the world. Because ADHD is a chronic condition, guidelines recommend re-evaluating the continued use of stimulant medications over many years to assess symptom relief and associated poor academic, social, and work-life functioning. Although few long-term adverse effects have been identified, growth suppression was documented in early adulthood in the MTA cohort, with the stimulant-treated group showing an average height decrement from the untreated group of 2.55 cm or 1.00 inch.

In the issue of JAACAP, Greenhill et al. build on this earlier report. They compare growth trajectories for the self-selected ADHD stimulant medication groups and a normative comparison group. The study demonstrates differences in the shape of growth trajectories, especially during puberty, and finds that a greater total lifetime dose of stimulants is associated with increased height suppression and, not previously described, greater gain in weight and body mass index (BMI). In young adulthood, consistent stimulant users were shorter than negligible users by an estimated 4.06 cm or 1.60 inches and heavier by an estimated 4.50 kg or 9.95 pounds. The clinical implications of these findings…

### Driving performance and ocular activity following acute administration of 10 mg methylphenidate: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113FECVX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). High credibility.

Given the relatively low complexity of the simulated highway drive, the demands on gaze behavior and the necessity for frequent and varied eye movements may be low. Consequently, the repetitive nature of the task may have resulted in a ceiling effect, in which the range of required eye movements is inherently limited, regardless of the driver's internal state. The outcomes of this study should be contextualized with the recognition that real-world driving involves navigating through a broad spectrum of environments. In naturalistic and more challenging driving scenarios that involve direct safety risks, such as maneuvering through urban roads or navigating heavy traffic, greater visuospatial attention is demanded, and a more significant effect of methylphenidate on gaze behavior and scanning efficiency might become apparent.

Furthermore, we used a relatively low, acute dose of methylphenidate in this study, which reflects typical introductory therapeutic doses. Thus, we acknowledge that this may not fully capture alterations associated with higher acute doses or patterns of change following chronic usage, which are arguably more common in real-world misuse scenarios and likely associated with road traffic collisions (RTCs). The dose-related limitation in the present study is reflective of much of the clinical experimental work assessing acute amphetamine effects, which are limited by complex ethical and methodological constraints. Future research should consider varying the dosing regimens, including higher and repeated doses over extended periods, and incorporate these considerations into the study design.

### Once-a-day Concerta methylphenidate versus three-times-daily methylphenidate in laboratory and natural settings [^114Gsvdv]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate (MPH), the most commonly prescribed drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has a short half-life, necessitating multiple daily doses. The requirement for multiple doses creates problems with medication administration during school and after-school hours, impacting compliance. Previous long-acting stimulants and preparations have shown effects equivalent to twice-daily dosing of MPH. This study evaluates the efficacy and duration of action, in both natural and laboratory settings, of an extended-release MPH preparation designed to last 12 hours, intended to be equivalent to three-times-daily dosing.

- **Methods**: Sixty-eight children with ADHD, aged 6 to 12, participated in a within-subject, double-blind comparison of placebo, immediate-release (IR) MPH (three times a day), and Concerta, a once-daily MPH formulation. Three dosing levels of medication were used: 5 mg IR MPH three times daily/18 mg Concerta once daily; 10 mg IR MPH three times daily/36 mg Concerta once daily; and 15 mg IR MPH three times daily/54 mg Concerta once daily. All children were currently medicated with MPH at enrollment, and each child's dose level was based on their previous MPH regimen. The doses of Concerta were selected to be comparable to the daily doses of MPH each child received. To achieve the desired continuous coverage, Concerta doses were 20% higher on a daily basis than a comparable three-times-daily regimen of IR MPH. Children received each medication condition for seven days.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^117KXWLc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed mainly in children, often persist into adulthood. Adults in this group have a high rate of other psychiatric problems and functional difficulties in key areas such as academic achievement, interpersonal relationships, and employment. Although the usefulness of immediate-release methylphenidate in children has been extensively studied, studies in adults, which are few, demonstrate varying results.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases in November 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and two trials registers. Biosis was searched in December 2013. We inspected references of all relevant papers to identify more studies and contacted authors of recently published trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized trials comparing immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in participants aged 18 years or older with ADHD. We excluded trials conducted on subpopulations of adults with ADHD such as adults with both ADHD and substance dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trial risk of bias. We contacted authors of trials to ask for additional and missing data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we…

### Limits of meta-analysis: Methylphenidate in the treatment of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^116W7PRC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults advocate methylphenidate as first-line treatment. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of methylphenidate treatment of adult ADHD and to examine the influence of methods on meta-analytic results. Electronic databases were searched to identify clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo in the treatment of adult ADHD. Studies were summarized using meta-analytic methods.

- **Subgroup analyses**: Conducted with respect to parallel group versus cross-over trials and self versus observer ratings.

- **Dosage and effect size relationship**: Explored by weighted regression analysis. The results were tested for publication bias, and several sensitivity analyses were performed. Findings and methods were compared with a previous meta-analysis.

Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria of which 16 were included in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size (d = 0.42) was significantly different from zero but was only half the size expected on the basis of a previous meta-analysis. No significant differences could be observed in the subgroup analyses. The regression analysis showed no significant influence of mean daily dose on effect size. These results contradict findings of a previous meta-analysis and challenge guideline recommendations. Methodological issues in meta-analyses are discussed.

### Ritalin [^112z8i94]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a CNS stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and narcolepsy is not known.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-threo enantiomers. The d-threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: A formal QT study has not been conducted in patients taking Ritalin. The effect of dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of Ritalin, on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open-label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of dexmethylphenidate XR 40 mg (maximum recommended adult total daily dosage) in 75 healthy volunteers. Electrocardiograms were collected up to 12 hours postdose. Frederica's method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was less than 5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time-matched comparisons versus placebo, which was below the threshold of clinical concern, and there was no evident exposure response relationship.

### Relexxii [^112faPrQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The mean single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters in 36 healthy adults following the administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets 18 mg once daily and methylphenidate 5 mg three times daily are summarized. The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in healthy adults following single- and multiple-dose administration (steady state) of doses up to 144 mg per day (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets). The mean half-life was about 3.6 hours. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were noted following single and repeated once-daily dosing, indicating no significant drug accumulation. The area under the curve (AUC) and half-life (t1/2) following repeated once-daily dosing are similar to those following the first dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a dose range of 18 mg to 144 mg.

- **Effect of food**: There were no differences in either the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic performance of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets when administered following a high-fat breakfast. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food.

### Does long-term medication use improve the academic outcomes of youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^116CiMTr]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2012). Low credibility.

Youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently experience academic impairment, including lower grades than their peers and an elevated risk for grade retention and school dropout. Medication is the most commonly used treatment for youth with ADHD, and it is therefore essential to understand the extent to which medication use improves long-term academic functioning. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between long-term medication use and the academic outcomes of youth with ADHD.

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify pertinent studies published since 2000 that followed youth with ADHD for three or more years. Academic outcomes of interest included school grades, achievement test scores, and grade retention. Nine studies were identified, reporting on eight distinct longitudinal samples (N across studies = 8,721). These studies demonstrate that long-term medication use is associated with improvements in standardized achievement scores; however, the magnitude of these improvements is small, and the clinical or educational significance is questionable. Evidence for long-term improvements in school grades and grade retention is less compelling.

This review highlights methodological considerations and provides directions for future research. The importance of using multiple sources to gather information about medication adherence is discussed, including the use of methodologies such as electronic monitors, rather than relying solely on parent report or chart review. Future research should also examine a range of medication adherence definitions.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes, adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors, including two review authors from the original review, participated in the process.

### Common practical questions and answers at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111W8QUn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses, is it best to go beyond the treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, is it best to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine, or can you cross-taper?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the range of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young people may tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that the sedation has additional benefits for sleep and comorbidities. Therefore, in these children, higher doses may be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. Clonidine can also be divided into two or three doses. Children who are sensitive to guanfacine side effects often find that a BD or TDS regime of clonidine suits them better than the once daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, whereas guanfacine appears to be more potent at postsynaptic receptors, which translates into increased prefrontal activity, impulse control regulation, and improvement in behavior regulation. Therefore, in the case of comorbidities where behavioral modification is desired, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines suggest 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day, indicating that a rough equivalency is: guanfacine 1 mg is approximately equal to clonidine 100 mcg.

If clinically acceptable from a tic perspective, it is best to reduce and withdraw clonidine first before initiating guanfacine.

### Safety of therapeutic methylphenidate in adults: A systematic review of the evidence [^117Mojwo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood. Stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate, have shown efficacy in trials for ADHD in adults. Adult psychiatrists are likely to encounter increasing numbers of adult patients who may benefit from methylphenidate. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to examine the evidence on the safety of methylphenidate when used therapeutically in adults. Twenty-six placebo-controlled trials were found, in which 811 adults received methylphenidate for ADHD and other conditions. In the short term, methylphenidate was well tolerated, and no serious side effects were observed. There is little information on the long-term safety of methylphenidate in adults, although the number of serious adverse effects reported to regulatory authorities has, so far, been low. Methylphenidate is associated with a modest rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Surveys of stimulant use in US universities show that misuse of prescribed medication, for recreation or to enhance study, is fairly common, although the level of harm that arises from this practice is unclear.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^1121hADU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dosing**: Failing to "start low and go slow" is a common pitfall when initiating medication. Adverse effects often occur before therapeutic benefits are observed, potentially leading to premature discontinuation. This issue can be mitigated by employing a strategy of gradual titration — starting with low doses and increasing slowly. For instance, initial syncope, due to postural hypotension, can be associated with the initiation of clonidine, which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, and guanfacine, which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors. Sedation is a potential effect of all medications used for tics. These adverse effects are more likely if the initial dose is too high, but careful low-dose initiation and slow titration significantly reduce their likelihood. Suggested initial doses are 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg of guanfacine, and 0.5–1 mg of aripiprazole once daily. Titration should follow a weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly schedule, depending on the patient's response. Initial dosages and titration speed may vary based on the patient's body weight, age, and other characteristics.

- **Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose**: After initiating medication, it is crucial to titrate to the recommended therapeutic doses. For clonidine, the average daily dose is 3–5 mcg/kg; for aripiprazole, it is approximately 5–10 mg daily; and for guanfacine, it ranges from 1 to 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents, depending on weight. Often, young people are sub-optimally medicated to minimize potential side effects, leading to inadequate therapeutic exposure.

Based on the severity of symptomatology, dosage may be titrated up or down depending on the individual patient's response. An increase to 225 mg/day may be required in patients with severe symptomatology. Elderly and debilitated patients should be started on a lower dosage.

- **Maintenance dosage schedule**:
	- Mild cases require 5 mg to 15 mg three or four times a day.
	- Moderate cases necessitate 10 mg to 25 mg three or four times a day.
	- Severe cases may require up to 225 mg/day.

### α2-adrenergic agonists or stimulants for preschool-age children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^112sHprY]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is diagnosed in approximately 2.4% of preschool-age children, with stimulants recommended as the first-line medication treatment. However, up to 25% of preschool-age children with ADHD are treated with α2-adrenergic agonist medications, despite minimal evidence regarding their efficacy or adverse effects in this age group.

The study aimed to determine the frequency of reported improvement in ADHD symptoms and adverse effects associated with α2-adrenergic agonists and stimulant medication for initial ADHD medication treatment in preschool-age children. It was conducted through a retrospective electronic health record review. Data were obtained from health records of children seen at seven outpatient developmental-behavioral pediatric practices in the Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics Research Network in the US. Researchers abstracted data for 497 consecutive children who were younger than 72 months at the initiation of treatment with either an α2-adrenergic agonist or stimulant medication, conducted by a developmental-behavioral pediatrician for ADHD. These treatments occurred between January 1, 2013, and July 1, 2017, with follow-up completed on February 27, 2019.

- **Exposures**: The study focused on α2-adrenergic agonist vs stimulant medication as initial ADHD medication treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were the reported improvement in ADHD symptoms and adverse effects.

Data were abstracted from electronic health records of 497 preschool-age children with ADHD receiving α2-adrenergic agonists or stimulants. The median child age was 62 months at ADHD medication initiation.

### Efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in 45 adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over trial [^115ZnZWZ]. Psychological Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Data on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are lacking in Europe. This study was undertaken to report on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in an adult outpatient population with ADHD and to compare results with US data.

- **Method**: A double-blind randomized cross-over trial comparing methylphenidate and placebo in 45 adults with ADHD with childhood onset was performed in a dose-titration design. Methylphenidate was titrated from 0.5 mg/kg per day in week 1 up to 1.0 mg/kg per day in week 3.

- **Results**: Response rates using methylphenidate varied between 38% and 51%, and using placebo between 7% and 18% (p < 0.05), depending on the outcome measure used. Although the overall percentage of subjects experiencing side effects with both methylphenidate and placebo was rather high, side effects on methylphenidate over and above those on placebo were few and mild.

- **Conclusions**: Methylphenidate proves to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for symptoms of ADHD in adults in the short term. Future research should study the long-term response and clarify the impact of gender, co-morbidity, socio-economic status, and IQ on response rates in adults with ADHD.

Assessing cardiovascular status in patients being treated with stimulant medications

Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history taken, including an assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia. In addition, a physical exam should assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and further cardiac evaluation, such as an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, is recommended if findings suggest such disease. Patients who develop symptoms like exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other indicators suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.

- **Psychiatric adverse events**:
	- **Pre-existing psychosis**: Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.
	- **Bipolar illness**: Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder due to the concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. This screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.
	- **Emergence of new psychotic or manic symptoms**: Treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania, in children and adolescents can occur.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^114NQAX5]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Research has continued to suggest that osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate lessens ADHD symptoms throughout the day and has greater adherence, thought to be associated with the convenience of once-daily dosing. Dexmethylphenidate extended-release (XR) and transdermal methylphenidate also offer this benefit. Dexmethylphenidate comes in capsules that can be opened and mixed with food and has the earliest onset of efficacy of the long-acting preparations. Transdermal methylphenidate bypasses the oral route entirely and, in short-term studies, is associated with efficacy throughout the day, improved family quality of life, and, when carefully titrated, little effect on sleep. Greater absorption of medication occurs when the patch is applied to the buttocks rather than to the subscapular area.

Comorbid anxiety was not found to affect stimulant efficacy in a recent study, and some studies suggest that treatment with stimulants can help to lessen the likelihood of other psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence, including cigarette use and substance abuse. However, meta-analyses of stimulants and other ADHD medications in the treatment of ADHD comorbid with tic disorders concluded that supratherapeutic doses of dextroamphetamine should be avoided in this population. These studies also indicated that methylphenidate gave the best control for ADHD and that α-2-agonists produced the best improvement in both tics and ADHD.

The commonest side effects of stimulants (decreased appetite, trouble with sleep onset) have also continued to receive recent research attention.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^116Xkfdt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and more specifically with respect to patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of extended-release formulations when initiating psychostimulant medications in patients with co-occurring ADHD. Consider maintaining a level of monitoring that corresponds to the risk profile of the given medication and patient; this may include pill counts, drug testing, increased clinical contact, and more frequent prescription drug monitoring program checks (clinical consensus, strong recommendation).

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: A population-based cohort study [^113wUVro]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Further limitations of our study include an absence of information on methylphenidate dosage, missed doses, and the possibility that milder psychotic events not resulting in hospital visits might have been missed. Our pharmacovigilance study of methylphenidate was limited to psychotic events, and we did not consider other adverse effects or therapeutic benefits. We included the coding of drug-induced psychosis to ensure that stimulant-related psychotic adverse events were recorded. We did not select participants because of their ADHD diagnosis, although this is the only clinically indicated use for methylphenidate. We studied clinically prescribed methylphenidate use, and so we cannot generalize our findings to non-clinically prescribed use. We cannot exclude the possible moderating effect of comorbid conditions on the effects of methylphenidate. Additionally, we did not study other, less frequently used ADHD medications such as atomoxetine and amphetamines (e.g. dexamphetamine) and, hence, we cannot generalize our findings to these medications, which could carry different risks. Finally, we focused on psychotic events associated with methylphenidate treatment, but we did not assess concomitant medication use, including the use of antipsychotics. Hence, we cannot determine from our study whether the risk of psychotic events associated with methylphenidate in individuals with a history of psychosis is moderated by antipsychotic medication.

In conclusion, contrary to clinical concerns, our study did not detect an increased risk of psychotic events in adolescents and young adults after clinically prescribed methylphenidate use.

### Efficacy and safety of immediate-release methylphenidate treatment for preschoolers with ADHD [^115o83bX]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2006). High credibility.

The Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS) was a NIMH-funded, six-center, randomized controlled trial that aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of immediate-release methylphenidate (MPH-IR). The study focused on children aged 3 to 5.5 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The 8-phase, 70-week PATS protocol included two double-blind, controlled phases: a crossover-titration trial followed by a placebo-controlled parallel trial. The crossover-titration phase's primary efficacy measure was a combined score from the Swanson, Kotkin, Atkins, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) scales, along with the Conners, Loney, and Milich (CLAM) rating scales. The parallel phase's primary outcome measure was defined as an excellent response based on composite scores from the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP) rating scale.

Of the 303 preschoolers enrolled, 165 were randomized into the titration trial. Compared with placebo, significant decreases in ADHD symptoms were observed with MPH at doses of 2.5 mg (p < 0.01), 5 mg (p < 0.001), and 7.5 mg (p < 0.001) taken three times a day, but not at 1.25 mg (p < 0.06). The mean optimal MPH total daily dose for the entire group was 14.2 ± 8.1 mg/day (0.7 ± 0.4 mg/kg/day). For the preschoolers (n = 114) later randomized into the parallel phase, only 21% on the best-dose MPH and 13% on placebo achieved the MTA-defined categorical criterion for remission set for school-age children with ADHD.

MPH-IR at doses of 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg three times a day produced significant reductions in ADHD symptom scales in preschoolers compared to placebo. However, the effect sizes, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8, were smaller.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117NtF7x]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Is treatment with methylphenidate associated with benefits or harms for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

Methylphenidate is associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms, general behavior, and quality of life; however, due to the very low quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the associated improvement is uncertain. Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of nonserious adverse events. There are too few data to assess the association with serious adverse events.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (Against) [^116Fmx6p]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The definition of terms is necessary to address the motion. First, "psychostimulants" are defined as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which inherently are short-acting drugs characterized by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of immediate-release formulations that act for a few hours. Sustained effects across the day can be achieved by controlled-release formulations, but positive carry-over to the next day is not significant, so on subsequent days these medications must be administered again to reinstate pharmacological effects.

Second, "effective" refers to treatment-as-usual, whereas "efficacious" refers to enhanced or optimized treatment (that may set a maximum for effectiveness). The magnitude of effectiveness, such as small, medium, or large effect size, depends on who is treated, how treatment is delivered, what outcome is evaluated, and other factors including treatment adherence and study design.

Third, "long term" refers to a given time frame, for example, 1 year, which can be applied to specify the duration of treatment, length of follow-up, or both. Some studies evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment while it is continued, whereas others evaluate long-term effectiveness during the follow-up after it is discontinued. Given these definitions, the following questions address the long-term effectiveness of stimulant medication.

### Cardiovascular safety of stimulant medications for pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^115wTN5y]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder that is often treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salts. Despite their efficacy and long history of use, there is concern about their potential for adverse cardiovascular effects in children and adolescents. Data from placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials published after 2000 were reviewed, and cardiovascular adverse event data were compared. Both placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials have repeatedly shown stimulant-induced increases in mean blood pressure, heart rate, and QT interval in children, adolescents, and adults. Although these increases seem relatively minor, their existence raises questions regarding whether stimulants could influence the likelihood of sudden death or other serious cardiovascular consequences, especially in patients with underlying heart problems. Moreover, questions have been raised regarding the necessity of screening patients for occult or unrecognized heart problems that are felt to be adversely affected by stimulant use. Obtaining a baseline electrocardiogram for any patient starting stimulant treatment is reasonable if access to such screening is readily available and not too costly.

### Stimulants and sudden death: What is a physician to do [^1179TtYg]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Recently, a US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee raised concerns about cardiovascular risks and sudden death in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who are receiving stimulants.

- **Methods**: We comment on the risk of sudden death in children/adolescents taking stimulants compared with population rates, biological plausibility, and known cardiovascular effects of stimulants to determine specific risk.

- **Results**: There does not seem to be a higher risk of sudden death in stimulant-treated individuals compared with the general population. Although there is evidence of biological plausibility, the known effects of stimulants on cardiovascular electrophysiology and vital signs seem to be benign.

- **Conclusions**: There does not seem to be compelling findings of a medication-specific risk necessitating changes in our stimulant treatment of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The use of existing guidelines on the use of stimulants (and psychotropic agents) may identify children, adolescents, and adults who are vulnerable to sudden death.

### Common pitfalls and how to avoid them in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^113rA9Gf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Optimizing the treatment of children using psychopharmacological methods requires careful consideration of dosage and patient response. The maximum licensed dose of methylphenidate for children, except for osmotic-release and prolonged-release formulations, is 60 mg/day in many countries. However, some guidelines, such as those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA, caddra.ca) and other documents, recommend higher doses. The British National Formulary (BNF) suggests a dose of up to 90 mg/day under specialist supervision. For osmotic-release and prolonged-release formulations of methylphenidate, the maximum licensed dose is 54 mg/day, but the BNF specifies a maximum of 108 mg/day for Concerta XL® in children and adults.

Failure to optimize the medication dose to achieve the highest tolerated benefit can result in only moderate improvement in symptoms. Meta-analytic evidence from flexible-dose trials for both methylphenidate and amphetamines indicates increased efficacy and reduced discontinuation rates with rising stimulant doses, up to the maximum FDA-licensed dose. In adults (notably, this data is not available for children), meta-analyses suggest that doses exceeding licensed levels generally do not offer a favorable benefit–risk profile. Despite this finding, individual patients may derive benefit and tolerate doses beyond those licensed, although this practice should not become standard. Considering doses beyond the recommended maximums may be appropriate when patients present unique responses and tolerances.

### Focalin [^1113fSov]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Administer Focalin orally twice daily, 4 hours apart with or without food.

- **Pretreatment screening**: Before treating patients with Focalin, assess for the presence of cardiac disease by performing a careful history, including family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and a physical exam [see warnings and precautions (5.2)]. Also, evaluate the family history and clinically assess patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating Focalin [see warnings and precautions (5.10)].

- **Recommended dosage**:

	- **Patients new to methylphenidate**: The recommended starting dose of Focalin for pediatric patients who are not currently taking racemic methylphenidate, or for those on other stimulants, is 5 mg daily (2.5 mg twice daily) with or without food.

	- **Patients currently on methylphenidate**: For pediatric patients currently using methylphenidate, the recommended starting dose of Focalin is half (1/2) the total daily dose of racemic methylphenidate.

- **Titration schedule**: The dose may be titrated weekly in increments of 2.5 mg to 5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg daily (10 mg twice daily). The dose should be individualized according to the needs and response of the patient.

### Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride [^115zcsFk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. However, the safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients aged less than 6 years have not been established. Additionally, the long-term efficacy of these tablets in pediatric patients has not been established.

- **Long-term suppression of growth**: Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Juvenile animal toxicity data**: Rats treated with racemic methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 6 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m² basis.

	- In a study conducted in young rats, racemic methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal weeks 13 to 14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in both males and females.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly concerning patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend arranging for a parent, health professional (such as a trained school nurse), or other trusted adult to directly observe the administration of the medication. This is especially crucial when using a short-acting formulation in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder related to ADHD. Additionally, families should be counseled on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^112Srosq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Careful follow-up of weight and height in children aged 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) experience a temporary slowing in growth rate. On average, there is a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years, without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.

Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause similar suppression of growth; however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.

- **Visual disturbance**: Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment.

- **Use in children less than six years of age**: Methylphenidate HCl should not be used in children under six years, since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^114sAuff]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Serious cardiovascular events**: Sudden death and pre-existing structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems.

	- **Children and adolescents**: Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may increase vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.

	- **Adults**: Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.

- **Hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions**: Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2 to 4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3 to 6 bpm), and individuals may experience larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored.
