## Question

subsequent workup for solid nodular opacity of left lower lob 2.8cmx1.3cm with solid component measuring 1.3cm on CT lung screening

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the step-by-step workup of a 2.8 cm part-solid pulmonary nodule with a 1.3 cm solid component in the left lower lobe and whether immediate evaluation vs surveillance is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline malignancy risk given the subsolid morphology and the size of the solid component. Then, I should confirm the technical adequacy of CT imaging to ensure measurements are reliable. Next, I will decide between immediate diagnostic workup versus surveillance, followed by selecting the initial test, typically FDG-PET/CT. After that, I will outline tissue diagnosis options and the role of multidisciplinary review, interpret possible PET-CT scenarios, and link results to definitive management. Finally, I need to consider alternatives if PET-CT is unavailable, patient-centered factors, and the risks of delay before stating a concise recommendation [^112fLWzu] [^112YruNE].

> Let me first confirm the malignancy risk based on nodule type and dimensions; a 28 mm part-solid nodule with a 13 mm solid component already places this lesion in a high-risk category because subsolid nodules carry higher malignancy risk than purely solid ones, and a solid component exceeding about 8–10 mm correlates with invasive adenocarcinoma on pathology, which I should explicitly acknowledge here [^112fLWzu] [^116Zw6g7] [^114JqRBL].

> Wait, let me verify CT technique before anchoring on size thresholds; accurate characterization of subsolid nodules requires thin-section, low-dose noncontrast CT with maximum section thickness ≤ 1.25 mm and ideally 1 mm axial reformats, along with careful segmentation and, when appropriate, volumetric analysis to assess growth reproducibly, so I need to ensure the measurements of both total and solid components were obtained on such a protocol [^116SGP45] [^114Hf7ZN] [^112JSSSY] [^112auJJZ] [^114iXGyU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surveillance; given the presence of a solid component > 8 mm within a large part-solid nodule, surveillance alone is inappropriate in most guideline frameworks, and the next step should be immediate diagnostic evaluation rather than watchful waiting because the pretest probability is high and subsolid morphology with a sizable solid core signals invasiveness [^112Sigqt] [^114JqRBL] [^112fLWzu].

> I should confirm the first-line diagnostic study; FDG-PET/CT is recommended for nodules with a solid component > 8 mm to assess metabolic activity, evaluate regional nodes, and survey for distant disease, while recognizing that lepidic-predominant adenocarcinomas and some subsolid lesions may demonstrate lower FDG avidity, so a negative PET does not exclude malignancy here and should not defer tissue diagnosis in this size range [^112Sigqt] [^112YruNE] [^112fLWzu].

> Next, I should review tissue diagnosis pathways; CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy offers high yield for peripheral lesions but carries pneumothorax risk that must be weighed, whereas bronchoscopic approaches may be considered for more central lesions or when anatomy favors an endobronchial route, and direct surgical resection may be justified justified for a high pretest probability lesion in an operative candidate — wait, I should correct that repetition and emphasize that in patients with high probability of malignancy, proceeding directly to surgical resection without prior biopsy can be appropriate after MDT agreement and staging considerations [^112YruNE] [^114UnkDS] [^112YruNE].

> I need to ensure multidisciplinary input; a thoracic MDT that includes radiology, pulmonology, thoracic surgery, and oncology should synthesize CT, PET-CT, patient comorbidities, and preferences to individualize the sequence of biopsy versus upfront resection, which improves guideline concordance and allows reasoned deviations when justified [^111UkTmm].

> I will now examine how PET-CT results might guide next steps; a clearly hypermetabolic solid component (for example, SUVmax thresholds in the 2–4 range have prognostic implications in stage I adenocarcinoma) strengthens the case for definitive management, while low uptake does not obviate biopsy or resection in larger subsolid lesions, so I should integrate SUV with solid size rather than treat SUV in isolation [^115MEhTm] [^112YruNE].

> If tissue confirms malignancy such as invasive adenocarcinoma, I should confirm stage and resectability; staging is typically completed with contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging and PET-CT if not already done, and surgical resection with oncologically appropriate margins and nodal evaluation is the standard for operable early-stage disease, with the extent of resection tailored to tumor size, solid component, and patient physiology, followed by adjuvant therapy per pathologic stage and biomarkers as indicated [^112YruNE].

> But wait, what if pathology is benign or nondiagnostic; if benign with high-confidence sampling, I should return to guideline-based surveillance using thin-slice, low-dose CT and apply validated growth thresholds such as a ≥ 25% volume increase for true growth, whereas a nondiagnostic result in this high-risk context warrants repeat biopsy or surgical excision rather than prolonged surveillance because of the size and morphology [^1127mNLc] [^112YruNE] [^112Sigqt].

> If PET-CT is unavailable, I should double-check the alternative pathway; proceeding directly to CT-guided biopsy or to surgical consultation is reasonable, reserving short-interval CT only for situations where both PET-CT and biopsy are contraindicated or infeasible, and even then with clear documentation of risks, time frames, and triggers to escalate given the high baseline risk here [^112YruNE] [^116Vo255].

> I need to ensure patient-centered considerations are explicit; shared decision-making should cover risks and benefits of biopsy versus upfront surgery, procedural risks like pneumothorax, potential need for adjuvant therapy, and how centralized nodule programs and clear communication can reduce disparities in follow-up, with space for patient values and preferences to guide the plan [^114UnkDS] [^113AszaE] [^116RqftG].

> Hold on, I should verify the implications of timing; evidence from screening cohorts suggests that extending follow-up intervals beyond about 6 months for indeterminate nodules risks stage migration, which supports expeditious workup for high-risk features rather than protracted surveillance, though the exact interval should be individualized and operationally prompt to avoid delays [^116p22P3].

> Putting this together, my summary recommendation is: confirm thin-slice CT measurements, obtain whole-body FDG-PET/CT promptly, convene MDT, and secure tissue diagnosis by CT-guided biopsy or proceed to surgical resection in an appropriate operative candidate without undue delay, recognizing that surveillance alone is not appropriate for a 28 mm part-solid nodule with a 13 mm solid component given the high likelihood of invasive adenocarcinoma and the limitations of PET in subsolid disease [^116SGP45] [^112JSSSY] [^112Sigqt] [^114JqRBL] [^112YruNE] [^112fLWzu].

For a solid nodular opacity of the left lower lobe measuring 2.8 × 1.3 cm with a 1.3 cm solid component on CT lung screening, the next step is to **obtain a PET-CT scan** [^112Sigqt] to assess metabolic activity and stage disease [^114JqRBL]. If the PET-CT is positive or the clinical risk is high, proceed to **tissue diagnosis** [^112YruNE] via CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy [^114UnkDS] or bronchoscopy with EBUS [^111hebEh], selected by nodule location and patient factors. If malignancy is confirmed or strongly suspected, refer to a multidisciplinary team [^111UkTmm] for surgical resection or definitive therapy; if PET-CT is negative and clinical risk is low, consider CT surveillance [^114JqRBL] at 3–6, 9–12, and 18–24 months [^111mHsJx].

---

## Initial risk assessment

Clinical risk assessment considers **age, smoking history, prior malignancy, family history, occupational exposures, and comorbidities** [^112fLWzu]. Radiographic features informing risk include nodule size, solid component, spiculation, irregular margins, and growth rate [^115hCbef]. Given the nodule's size and solid component, the malignancy risk is **moderate to high** [^111RnwGJ], warranting further evaluation.

---

## Recommended diagnostic imaging

### PET-CT scan

- **Indication**: Solid pulmonary nodules [^112Sigqt] > 8 mm [^114JqRBL].

- **Purpose**: Assess metabolic activity (SUV) and detect regional/distant metastases [^112fLWzu].

- **Interpretation**: SUV > 2.5 suggests malignancy; false positives/negatives can occur [^111UVmrX].

---

### High-resolution CT (HRCT)

High-resolution CT refines **nodule characterization** by detailing morphology, margins, and growth [^112auJJZ]. Thin-section (≤ 1.25 mm) imaging [^114Hf7ZN] with MIP/VR reconstructions [^116AFw8z] is recommended [^116SGP45] for optimal assessment.

---

## Tissue diagnosis

### CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB)

- **Indication**: Peripheral nodules accessible by percutaneous approach [^111hebEh].

- **Advantages**: High diagnostic yield for peripheral lesions [^116Vo255].

- **Risks**: Pneumothorax, bleeding, infection [^114UnkDS].

---

### Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)

- **Indication**: Central lesions or suspected mediastinal lymphadenopathy [^111mHsJx].

- **Advantages**: Minimally invasive, allows lymph node sampling [^112YruNE].

- **Limitations**: Lower yield for peripheral lesions [^111mHsJx].

---

## Multidisciplinary team (MDT) evaluation

Evaluation by a **multidisciplinary team** [^111UkTmm] including a pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, radiologist, oncologist, and pathologist ensures coordinated care. The team integrates clinical, radiographic, and pathological data to guide management decisions.

---

## Management based on diagnostic findings

### Malignant or highly suspicious lesions

For malignant or highly suspicious lesions, **surgical resection** with lobectomy or segmentectomy and lymph node sampling [^112YruNE] is preferred when the patient is operable. In inoperable patients, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or systemic therapy offers definitive non-surgical management [^111mHsJx].

---

### Benign or low-risk lesions

Benign or low-risk lesions may be managed with **serial CT surveillance** [^114JqRBL] at 3–6, 9–12, and 18–24 months [^111mHsJx]. Patients can be discharged from imaging follow-up after at least 2 years of demonstrated stability [^114N446G].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Counsel patients regarding the **risks, benefits, and alternatives** of diagnostic and therapeutic options. Incorporate patient values and preferences into the management plan through **shared decision-making** [^116RqftG].

### The incidental pulmonary nodule in a child. Part 1: Recommendations from the SPR Thoracic Imaging Committee regarding characterization, significance and follow-up [^114FPpyn]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

No guidelines are currently in place for the follow-up and management of pulmonary nodules that are incidentally detected on CT in the pediatric population. The Fleischner guidelines, which were developed for the older adult population, do not apply to children. This review summarizes the evidence collected by the Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) Thoracic Imaging Committee in its attempt to develop pediatric-specific guidelines. Small pulmonary opacities can be characterized as linear or as ground-glass or solid nodules. Linear opacities and ground-glass nodules are extremely unlikely to represent an early primary or metastatic malignancy in a child. In our review, we found a virtual absence of reported cases of a primary pulmonary malignancy presenting as an incidentally detected small lung nodule on CT in a healthy, immune-competent child.

Because of the lack of definitive information on the clinical significance of small lung nodules that are incidentally detected on CT in children, the management of those that do not have the typical characteristics of an intrapulmonary lymph node should be dictated by the clinical history. Factors to consider include possible exposure to infectious agents, the presence of an occult immunodeficiency, the much higher likelihood that the nodule represents a metastasis rather than a primary lung tumor, and ultimately, the individual preference of the child's caregiver. Nodules appearing in children with a history of immune deficiency, malignancy, or congenital pulmonary airway malformation should not be considered incidental, and their workup should be dictated by the natural history of these conditions.

### Pulmonary nodules and CT screening: The past, present and future [^1121yLFN]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

With the advances in CT technology and pulmonary nodule management, are we now in a position to recommend screening? In 1968, Wilson and Jungner compiled a report commissioned by the WHO, highlighting that while the concept of screening was admirable, it was not without difficulties in terms of optimizing benefits and harms. To aid the appropriate selection of conditions for which the benefits of screening outweighed the harms, they outlined ten screening principles for appraising the viability, effectiveness, and appropriateness of a screening program. These principles form the basis for the criteria outlined by the UK NSC.

- **Issues to be addressed for successful implementation**: Table 5 lists these ten principles and proposes key factors that need to be addressed for successful implementation of a lung cancer screening program. Advances in CT scanning technology have improved nodule detection and characterization while reducing radiation dose. Techniques such as iterative reconstruction, which reduces the extent of noise and artifact associated with images at lower radiation doses, altering tube voltage, and gantry rotation speed, are valuable in reducing effective radiation doses. Further reduction in overall radiation exposure over time will follow the implementation of more conservative approaches to managing positive findings, as suggested in more recent guidelines.

### Evidence for the treatment of patients with pulmonary nodules: When is it lung cancer? ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^111UVmrX]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a frequent incidental finding that may represent primary lung cancer or other malignant or benign lesions. The optimal management of the SPN remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic literature review to address the following questions: (1) the prevalence of SPN; (2) the prevalence of malignancy in nodules with varying characteristics (size, morphology, and type of opacity); (3) the relationships between growth rates, histology, and other nodule characteristics; and (4) the performance characteristics and complication rates of tests for SPN diagnosis. We searched MEDLINE and other databases and used previous systematic reviews and recent primary studies.

- **Results**: Eight large trials of lung cancer screening showed that both the prevalence of at least one nodule (8 to 51%) and the prevalence of malignancy in patients with nodules (1.1 to 12%) varied considerably across studies. The prevalence of malignancy varied by size (0 to 1% for nodules 20 mm). Data from six studies of patients with incidental or screening-detected nodules showed that the risk for malignancy was approximately 20 to 30% in nodules with smooth edges; in nodules with irregular, lobulated, or spiculated borders, the rate of malignancy was higher but varied across studies from 33 to 100%. Nodules that were pure ground-glass opacities were more likely to be malignant (59 to 73%) than solid nodules (7 to 9%). The sensitivity of positron emission tomography imaging for identifying a

### Correlation between the size of the solid component on thin-section CT and the invasive component on pathology in small lung adenocarcinomas manifesting as ground-glass nodules [^116Zw6g7]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate the correlation between the size of the solid component on thin-section computed tomography (CT) and invasive component on pathology in small lung adenocarcinomas manifesting as subsolid nodules.

- **Methods**: Fifty-nine subsolid nodules in 58 patients were evaluated. The maximum diameters of subsolid nodules and the solid component on CT were measured by two radiologists in three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) planes using in-house software. In addition, the maximum diameters of the tumor and invasive component were measured on pathology by two pathologists. CT measurements were compared with pathologic measurements.

- **Results**: There was a strong correlation between the size of the solid component on CT and the invasive component on pathology, as well as the size of subsolid nodules and the tumor size (r = 0.82–0.87 for 3D measurement, 0.72–0.88 for 2D measurement; p < 0.0001). The size of subsolid nodules in 3D and 2D measurements was significantly larger than the tumor size (p < 0.0001). In regard to measurement of the solid component, 3D measurements tended to be larger than the size of the invasive component, whereas 2D measurements tended to be similar to the size of the invasive component. By applying a size criterion of a solid component that was 3 mm or less in maximum diameter, preinvasive and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma was predicted with a specificity of 100% (28 of 28).

- **Conclusion**: We found a significant correlation between the size of the solid component on thin-section CT and the invasive component on pathology.

### Defining growth in small pulmonary nodules using volumetry: Results from a "coffee-break" CT study and implications for current nodule management guidelines [^117RPx7u]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Lung nodule growth is defined as an increase in nodule diameter or volume on sequential computed tomography (CT) scans and is a powerful predictor of lung malignancy. Measuring nodule growth can be performed using electronic callipers or semi-automated tools. However, establishing that true nodule growth has occurred can be challenging in cases where the increase in nodule size is small, due to the inherent limitations of measurement tools. For this reason, many clinical practice guidelines stipulate that a minimum increase in nodule size must be achieved before nodule growth can be determined.

For example, the Fleischner Society guidelines stipulate that a threshold of 2-mm diameter growth should be used to define true nodule growth. By contrast, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) nodule management guidelines stipulate a 25% increase in nodule volume to determine growth, a threshold also used in the Nederlands–Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON) lung cancer screening trial.

The threshold of a 25% increase in volume to determine true nodule growth in the BTS guidelines and NELSON nodule management protocol was based on a number of in vivo "coffee break" studies, in which individuals were scanned twice on the same day, demonstrating up to 25% variability in nodule volumes. This variability has been attributed to slight differences in nodule segmentation, including for nodules which are irregular in shape, or attached to pleural surfaces or vessels, and to patient factors, such as the level of patient inspiration or pulsation of the heart.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: An observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^111KUsJc]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

Our findings should not be interpreted as giving the "optimal" time to perform surveillance scans. There is already a discrepancy between LungRADS, which recommends a 3-month follow-up for higher risk and a 6-month follow-up for lower risk nodules, and the BTS and European position statements for lung cancer screening guidelines, which recommend a repeat LDCT at 3 months. Determining the optimal nodule follow-up CT scan interval must consider the risk of a stage shift while ensuring enough time for true growth to be observed and for feasibility for participants and screening programs.

Our comparative analysis is limited by the fact that we were able to perform the vast majority of nodule follow-up CT scans within 6 months; therefore, only a small number of participants were scanned after an interval of more than 180 days. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the 2,001 individuals and 87 cancers included in this analysis are comparable with other entire screening cohorts. A further limitation is that this is observational data. Finally, although LungRADS categories were available for secondary analysis, our nodule management protocol used BTS guidelines.

In conclusion, in a cohort of 2,001 participants who underwent NFU CT for indeterminate nodules that were identified at baseline LDCT, we observed no difference in the risk of lung cancer diagnosis at stage greater than 1 when nodule follow-up CT scans were delayed from 3–6 months. However, we observed a higher proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage II or above when scans were delayed beyond 6 months. This finding provides support for the guidelines proposed by the study.

### Improved interobserver agreement on nodule type and Lung-RADS classification of subsolid nodules using computer-aided solid component measurement [^1121fBsh]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) classification of subsolid nodules (SSNs) can be challenging due to limited interobserver agreement in determining the type and size of the nodule. Our study aimed to assess the effect of a computer-aided method on the interobserver agreement of Lung-RADS classification for SSNs.

This study consisted of 156 SSNs in 121 patients who underwent initial CT screening for lung cancer. Three independent readers determined the nodule type and measured the size of the entire nodule as well as the solid component, first without and then assisted by a semi-automated computer-aided tool. They assigned to each nodule the corresponding Lung-RADS 1.1 category. Agreement in size measurements was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman indexes, while agreement in nodule type and Lung-RADS was determined using Fleiss kappa statistics. The relationship between the final diagnosis of the nodules and Lung-RADS classifications was also evaluated.

Among the 156 nodules, manual size measurement reached an ICC of 0.994, and 48 nodules contained a solid component measured by all three readers both manually and semi-automatically. ICCs for the solid component measurement were 0.952, 0.997, and 0.996 for manual diameter, semi-automated diameter, and volume measurement, respectively. Bias and 95% limits of agreement for the average diameter of the solid component were smaller with semi-automated measurements than with manual measurements. Kappa values of semi-automated assessment for nodule type and Lung-RADS classification showed improved agreement compared to manual assessment alone.

### Follow-up of incidental pulmonary nodules and the radiology report [^117H1S6y]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Incidental pulmonary nodules requiring follow-up are often identified on chest CT scans. Evidence-based guidelines for their appropriate follow-up have been published; however, the rate of adherence to these guideline recommendations remains unknown. It is also unclear whether the content of the radiology report impacts the follow-up rate of these nodules.

- **Methods**: A review of 1,000 CT pulmonary angiographic studies from the emergency department was conducted to identify incidental pulmonary nodules. The Fleischner Society guidelines were applied to determine if follow-up was recommended. Radiology reports were categorized based on whether nodules were mentioned only in the findings section, noted in the impression section, or included explicit recommendations for follow-up. The impact of the radiology report on the follow-up rate was assessed across these three categories.

- **Results**: Incidental pulmonary nodules necessitating follow-up were found in 9.9% (95% confidence interval, 8%-12%) of the studies. Overall, nodule follow-up was poor (29% [28 of 96]; 95% confidence interval, 20%-38%) and decreased significantly when nodules were mentioned only in the findings section (0% [0 of 12]). Even with specific follow-up instructions in radiology reports, the follow-up rate remained low at 29% (19 of 65; 95% confidence interval, 18%-40%).

- **Conclusions**: Incidental pulmonary nodules detected on CT pulmonary angiography are common and are frequently not followed up properly. The presence of a pulmonary nodule in the impression section or with specific follow-up instructions does not significantly improve adherence to recommended follow-up protocols.

### Management of progressive pulmonary nodules found during and outside of CT lung cancer screening studies [^112PywyE]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Although the effectiveness of screening for lung cancer remains controversial, it is a fact that most lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage outside of lung cancer screening programs. In 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force revised its lung cancer screening recommendation, now supporting lung cancer screening by low-dose computed tomography in patients at high risk. This is also endorsed by many major medical societies and advocacy group stakeholders, albeit with different eligibility criteria.

In Europe, population-based lung cancer screening has so far not been recommended or implemented, as some important issues remain unresolved. Among them is the open question of how enlarging pulmonary nodules detected in lung cancer screening should be managed. This article comprises two parts:

- **Lung cancer screening approaches**: A review focusing on the potential therapeutic options for enlarging pulmonary nodules.
- **Consensus statements**: A meeting report including statements of an interdisciplinary expert panel that discussed the potential of the different therapeutic options.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: A research framework for pulmonary nodule evaluation and management [^114RaRa1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are frequently detected during diagnostic chest imaging and as a result of lung cancer screening. Guidelines for their evaluation are largely based on low-quality evidence, and patients and clinicians could benefit from more research in this area.

- **Methods**: In this research statement from the American Thoracic Society, a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates reviewed available evidence for pulmonary nodule evaluation. They characterized six focus areas to direct future research efforts and identified fundamental gaps in knowledge and strategies to address them. Formal mechanisms were not used to prioritize one research area over another or to achieve consensus.

- **Results**: There was widespread agreement that novel tests (including novel imaging tests, biopsy techniques, biomarkers, and prognostic models) may improve diagnostic accuracy for identifying cancerous nodules. However, before these tests are used in clinical practice, better evidence is needed to show that they improve more distal outcomes of importance to patients. Additionally, the pace of research and the quality of clinical care would be improved by the development of registries that link demographic and nodule characteristics with patient-level outcomes. Methods to share data from registries are also necessary.

- **Conclusions**: This statement may help researchers to develop impactful and innovative research projects and enable funders to better judge research proposals. The aim is to accelerate the pace and increase the efficiency of discovery.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, specifically in the context of follow-up imaging and subsolid nodules, the BTS 2015 guidelines recommend offering repeat low-dose, thin-section CT at 1, 2, and 4 years from baseline where the risk of malignancy is approximately less than 10%.

### Pulmonary nodules and CT screening: The past, present and future [^112gVXSA]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Management of pulmonary nodules through LDCT has been extensively studied, providing insights into CT features and growth rates that differentiate benign from malignant diagnoses. Several predictive models, incorporating clinical, demographic, CT, and PET features, have been proposed and validated. These models enable the quantification of malignancy risk for a given nodule, allowing for a more conservative management approach. CT surveillance can be employed for certain nodules, with invasive procedures reserved for higher-risk cases.

In response to the increasing number of small CT-detected nodules, the Fleischner Society published a management algorithm in 2005. Adopting a conservative strategy, this algorithm recommended follow-up for all small nodules in high-risk individuals, primarily smokers or former smokers. More recent guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) generally mirror the Fleischner guidelines, showing little change to follow-up recommendations. The Fleischner Society has also addressed subsolid nodule management with a further statement.

For individuals at high risk according to the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria, the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been created. However, emerging evidence suggests that the implementation of the ACCP guidelines in the US has been suboptimal. Additionally, the performance of Lung-RADS may not be as accurate as approaches using the Brock University method.

### Stepwise diagnostic algorithm for high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities on CT [^1121krDr]. Insights into Imaging (2023). High credibility.

High-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities are commonly seen on CT. These findings are increasingly encountered with the growing number of CT examinations and the wide availability of thin-slice images. The abnormalities include benign lesions, such as infectious granulomatous diseases and metabolic diseases, and malignant tumors, such as lung cancers and metastatic tumors. Given the wide spectrum of diseases, the proper diagnosis of high-attenuation abnormalities can be challenging. The assessment of these abnormal findings requires scrutiny, and treatment is imperative.

Our proposed stepwise diagnostic algorithm consists of five steps:

- **Establish the presence or absence of metallic artifacts**: This initial step is crucial to differentiate between artifact-related and genuine findings.

- **Identify associated nodular or mass-like soft tissue components**: This helps in assessing whether the abnormalities are indicative of a benign or malignant process.

- **Establish the presence of solitary or multiple lesions**: If nodular or mass-like soft tissue components are identified, determining the multiplicity helps in the differential diagnosis.

- **Ascertain the predominant distribution in the upper or lower lungs**: This step is necessary if not previously identified, as it may suggest particular diseases associated with specific lung regions.

- **Identify the morphological pattern, such as linear, consolidation, nodular, or micronodular**: This step aids in categorizing the lesions, especially if the distribution pattern wasn't determined in the previous step.

These five steps to diagnosing high-attenuation abnormalities subdivide the lesions into nine categories. This stepwise radiologic diagnostic approach could help to narrow down the differential diagnosis for various pulmonary high-attenuation abnormalities and achieve a precise diagnosis. Our proposed stepwise diagnostic algorithm for high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities may help recognize a variety of those high-attenuation findings and determine whether further investigation or treatment is required.

### Research priorities for interventions to address health disparities in lung nodule management: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113AszaE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The panel reached a consensus about the importance of literacy-matched educational content and communication about lung nodules found on CT and their required follow-up in reducing disparities in lung nodule management. However, the optimal approach to achieving this important goal is unknown. For example, it is unclear whether system-level interventions, such as written after-visit summaries and automated reminders, improve lung nodule management in patients with low literacy. In addition, compared with in-person notifications, phone calls or letters about mammography results can lead to diagnostic delays and an incomplete understanding of mammography results. It is unclear whether the method of communication of lung nodule follow-up recommendations affects disparities in care.

The role of centralized lung nodule management protocols, as opposed to decentralized approaches that rely solely on the ordering or primary care clinician, may be of particular relevance to patients who receive diagnoses of incidental pulmonary nodules in the context of emergency department visits. Studies have shown greater adherence to annual lung cancer screening in centralized screening programs and improved disparities in follow-up rates for Black individuals. The impact of centralized versus decentralized lung nodule follow-up programs on disparities in lung nodule evaluation is not known.

Variability in radiology reporting of CT findings, including vague language and lack of inclusion of the finding in the final impression of the report, has been associated with decreased completion of lung nodule management.

### Evaluation of patients with pulmonary nodules: When is it lung cancer? ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^115hCbef]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are spherical radiographic opacities that measure up to 30 mm in diameter. Nodules are extremely common in clinical practice and challenging to manage, especially small, "subcentimeter" nodules. Identification of malignant nodules is important because they represent a potentially curable form of lung cancer.

- **Methods**: We developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines based on a systematic literature review and discussion with a large, multidisciplinary group of clinical experts and other stakeholders.

- **Results**: We generated a list of 29 recommendations for managing the solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) that measures at least 8 to 10 mm in diameter; small, subcentimeter nodules that measure < 8 mm to 10 mm in diameter; and multiple nodules when they are detected incidentally during evaluation of the SPN. Recommendations stress the value of risk factor assessment, the utility of imaging tests (especially old films), the need to weigh the risks and benefits of various management strategies (biopsy, surgery, and observation with serial imaging tests), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated by estimation of the probability of malignancy, performance of imaging tests to characterize the lesion(s) better, evaluation of the risks associated with various management alternatives, and elicitation of patient preferences for treatment.

### The "solid" component within subsolid nodules: Imaging definition, display, and correlation with invasiveness of lung adenocarcinoma, a comparison of CT histograms and subjective evaluation [^113zh7Jj]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The objective was to validate three proposed definitions of the "solid" component of subsolid nodules. This was compared to CT histograms and the use of different window settings for discriminating the invasiveness of adenocarcinomas, in a manner that facilitates routine clinical assessment.

Methods included a retrospective analysis of 328 pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinomas, manifesting as subsolid nodules. Three-dimensional CT histograms were generated by setting 11 CT attenuation intervals from -400 to 50 HU, at 50 HU intervals, and the voxel percentage within each CT attenuation interval was generated automatically. Three definitions of the "solid" component were proposed, and 10 medium window settings were set to evaluate the "solid" component. The diagnostic performance of the three definitions for identifying invasive adenocarcinoma was compared with that of CT histogram analysis and subjective evaluation with medium window settings.

Results showed a parallel diagnosis using five intervals with the largest AUC (AUC ≥ 0.797) demonstrated good differential diagnostic performance, with 78% sensitivity and 73.7% specificity. Definition 2 (visibility in the mediastinum window) yielded higher accuracy (75.6%) than the other two definitions (p < 0.01). A medium window setting of -50 WL/2 WW provided a larger AUC than the other nine medium window settings, as well as definition 2, with 82.5% specificity and 88.5% PPV, which was higher than those of the parallel diagnosis with CT histogram and definition 2.

In conclusion, using -50 WL/2 WW is the optimum approach for evaluating the "solid" component.

CT image analysis was conducted by two radiologists experienced in chest imaging. They were blinded to patient data and interpreted the CT images independently on a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstation (Vue PACS, Carestream). Any disagreements were resolved through discussion until a consensus was reached.

- **Recorded non-contrast CT features of SSNs included**:
	- **Detected time**: Either first detected on the initial CT or on follow-up CT.
	- **Nodule location**: Upper, middle, or lower lung lobe.
	- **Size**: Maximum nodule diameter in the CT lung window setting.
	- **Margin**: Well-defined (clear border) or ill-defined (partially or totally blurred border).
	- **Shape**: Regular (round or oval) or irregular (uneven contour that could not be classified as round or oval).
	- **Intranodular characteristics, including density**: Pure ground-glass opacity (pGGO) or part-solid opacity (PSO).
	- **CT value of the GGO area**: The largest slice of the nodule was selected on the axial CT image in the lung window. For nodules with pGGO, a circular region of interest (ROI) was drawn covering more than two-thirds of the lesion. For nodules with PSO, the largest possible circular ROI of the GGO was drawn avoiding solid components, vessels, and bronchi. The same ROI was placed on three adjacent images using the copy-and-paste function to record the average value, calculated as the CT value of the GGO area.
	- **Presence of a target sign**: Characterized by a focal, circular, solid component in the center of the SSN, similar to a target.
	- **Presence of an air bronchogram**: [text incomplete].

### Persisting new nodules in incidence rounds of the NELSON CT lung cancer screening study [^116oNDB6]. Thorax (2019). Low credibility.

The US guidelines recommend low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening for high-risk individuals. New solid nodules after baseline screening are common and have a high lung cancer probability. Currently, no evidence exists concerning the risk stratification of non-resolving new solid nodules at first LDCT screening after initial detection.

- **Methods**: In the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening (NELSON) trial, 7,295 participants underwent the second screening round and 6,922 participants the third. We included participants with solid nodules registered as new or < 15mm³ (study detection limit) at previous screens and received additional screening after initial detection, thereby excluding high-risk nodules according to the NELSON management protocol (nodules ≥ 500mm³).

- **Results**: Overall, 680 participants with 1,020 low-risk and intermediate-risk new solid nodules were included. A total of 562 (55%) new solid nodules were resolving, leaving 356 (52%) participants with a non-resolving new solid nodule, of whom 25 (7%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. At first screening after initial detection, volume doubling time (VDT), volume, and VDT combined with a predefined ≥ 200mm³ volume cut-off had high discrimination for lung cancer (VDT, area under the curve (AUC): 0.913; volume, AUC: 0.875; VDT and ≥ 200mm³ combination, AUC: 0.939). Classifying a new solid nodule with either ≤ 590 days VDT or ≥ 200mm³ volume positive provided 100% sensitivity, 84% specificity, and 27% positive predictive value for lung cancer.

- **Conclusions**: More than half of new low-risk and intermediate-risk solid nodules were resolving; however, a subset presented a risk for lung cancer as indicated by defined metrics of VDT and volume.

### Executive summary: Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112YruNE]. Chest (2013). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, more specifically with respect to follow-up imaging, the ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend considering surveillance with serial CT in patients with a solid, indeterminate nodule greater than 8 mm in diameter in the following circumstances:

- **Very low density nodules**: (15 HUs on dynamic contrast CT), resulting in a very low posttest probability of malignancy

- **Nondiagnostic needle biopsy**: The lesion is not hypermetabolic on PET

- **Patient management preference**: A fully informed patient preferring this non-aggressive management approach.

### Pulmonary nodules: Common questions and answers [^111RnwGJ]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are often incidentally discovered on chest imaging or through dedicated lung cancer screening. Screening adults aged 50 to 80 years with a 20-pack-year smoking history, who currently smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years, using low-dose computed tomography is associated with a decrease in cancer-associated mortality. Once a nodule is detected, specific radiographic and clinical features can be used in validated risk stratification models to assess the probability of malignancy and guide management.

- **Solid pulmonary nodules**: Solid pulmonary nodules less than 6 mm warrant surveillance imaging in patients at high risk. Nodules between 6 and 8 mm should be reassessed within 12 months, with the recommended interval varying by the risk of malignancy and an allowance for patient-physician decision-making. A functional assessment with positron emission tomography/computed tomography, nonsurgical biopsy, and resection should be considered for solid nodules 8 mm or greater with a high risk of malignancy.

- **Subsolid nodules**: Subsolid nodules have a higher risk of cancer and should be followed with surveillance imaging for longer periods.

Direct physician-patient communication, clinical decision support within electronic health records, and guideline-based management algorithms included in radiology reports are associated with increased compliance with existing guidelines.

### Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening: Clinical evidence and implementation research [^116C7oKY]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The nodule type has been shown to be consequential to the risk of malignancy. Nodules can be classified into calcified and noncalcified, with the latter further classified into solid and subsolid (part-solid and pure-ground glass). Solid nodules are most prevalent in lung cancer screening; however, subsolid nodules are associated with a higher malignancy risk, albeit they are usually detected at a premalignant or early stage. Furthermore, a nodule's risk of malignancy can be related to other distinguishing characteristics, such as location and attachment. In the NELSON trial, for example, 82.2% of adenocarcinomas were detected in the periphery (outer one-third of the hilar-costal diameter) of the lungs and were attached to the pleura compared to 17.8% detected in the middle or centrally (inner two-thirds of the hilar-costal diameter). Additionally, 45.0% of all lung cancers were situated in the right upper lobe. These results affirm the suggestion that nodule management should be decided on an independent nodule-to-nodule basis.

Computed tomography (CT) images of solid and subsolid nodules can be seen in Fig. 2:

- **Fig. 2**:
	- **Computed tomography images showing solid and subsolid lung nodules**:
		- (a) Mixed ground-glass malignant (invasive adenocarcinoma) nodule peripherally situated in the left upper lobe measuring 25 mm max. diameter.

		- (c) Solid benign nodule situated peripherally in the left lower lobe measuring 248 mm.

### Incidental perifissural nodules on routine chest computed tomography: Lung cancer or not [^116gRXE1]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Solid pulmonary nodules are a common finding in computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Management decisions regarding these nodules are encountered by many on an almost daily basis. The majority of solid nodules, however, will not represent a malignancy. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to reliably differentiate (potentially) malignant nodules from benign lesions. To guide this process, screening-focused guidelines like Lung-RADS (Lung Screening Reporting and Data System) are available. Additionally, guidelines for clinical use have been issued by the ACCP (American College of Chest Physicians), the Fleischner Society, and the British Thoracic Society.

A substantial subset of solid pulmonary nodules will represent perifissural nodules (PFNs), which most likely are intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Morphologically, these are solid, homogeneous nodules with a smooth margin and are oval or rounded, lentiform, or triangular in shape. It has been proposed to differentiate between typical and atypical PFNs on one hand, and non-PFN nodules on the other, based on the presence of fissural attachment and morphological characteristics. Prior lung cancer screening studies have shown that solid pulmonary nodules conforming to the definition of PFNs — whether typical or atypical — do not represent or develop into lung malignancies over time and should be regarded as non-suspect and benign lesions.

Outside a screening setting, these perifissural nodules are also regularly found in daily routine imaging, and one may assume that they behave similarly. However, data on PFNs in routine settings remain limited.

### ACR Lung-RADS v2022: Assessment categories and management recommendations [^115uUqSn]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

The American College of Radiology created the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) in 2014 to standardize the reporting and management of screen-detected pulmonary nodules. Lung-RADS was updated to version 1.1 in 2019 and revised size thresholds for nonsolid nodules, added classification criteria for perifissural nodules, and allowed for short-interval follow-up of rapidly enlarging nodules that may be infectious in etiology. Lung-RADS v2022, released in November 2022, provides several updates including guidance on the classification and management of atypical pulmonary cysts, juxtapleural nodules, airway-centered nodules, and potentially infectious findings. This new release also provides clarification for determining nodule growth and introduces stepped management for nodules that are stable or decreasing in size. This article summarizes the evidence and expert consensus supporting Lung-RADS v2022.

### Projected outcomes using different nodule sizes to define a positive CT lung cancer screening examination [^115fecBR]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer has been associated with a high frequency of false positive results due to the prevalence of indeterminate but usually benign small pulmonary nodules. The acceptability of reducing false-positive rates and diagnostic evaluations by increasing the nodule size threshold for a positive screen depends on the projected balance between benefits and risks.

- **Methods**: We examined data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) to estimate screening CT performance and outcomes for scans with nodules above the 4 mm NLST threshold used to classify a CT screen as positive. Outcomes assessed included screening results, subsequent diagnostic tests performed, lung cancer histology and stage distribution, and lung cancer mortality. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for the different nodule size thresholds. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: In 64% of positive screens (11,598/18,141), the largest nodule was 7 mm or less in greatest transverse diameter. By increasing the threshold, the percentages of lung cancer diagnoses that would have been missed or delayed and false positives avoided progressively increased, for example, from 1.0% and 15.8% at a 5 mm threshold to 10.5% and 65.8% at an 8 mm threshold, respectively. The projected reductions in post-screening follow-up CT scans and invasive procedures also increased as the threshold was raised. Differences across nodules sizes for lung cancer histology and stage distribution were also noted.

### Management of lung nodules detected by volume CT scanning [^1173HyAN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Use of multidetector computed tomography (CT) in lung-cancer screening trials involving subjects with an increased risk of lung cancer has highlighted the problem for the clinician of deciding on the best course of action when noncalcified pulmonary nodules are detected by CT.

- **Methods**: A total of 7,557 participants underwent CT screening in years 1, 2, and 4 of a randomized trial of lung-cancer screening. We used software to evaluate a noncalcified nodule according to its volume or volume-doubling time. Growth was defined as an increase in volume of at least 25% between two scans. The first-round screening test was considered to be negative if the volume of a nodule was less than 50 mm³, if it was 50 to 500 mm³ but had not grown by the time of the 3-month follow-up CT, or if, in the case of those that had grown, the volume-doubling time was 400 days or more.

- **Results**: In the first and second rounds of screening, 2.6% and 1.8% of the participants, respectively, had a positive test result. In round one, the sensitivity of the screen was 94.6% (95% confidence interval, 86.5 to 98.0) and the negative predictive value was 99.9% (95% CI, 99.9 to 100.0). In the 7,361 subjects with a negative screening result in round one, 20 lung cancers were detected after 2 years of follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Among subjects at high risk for lung cancer who were screened in three rounds of CT scanning and in whom noncalcified pulmonary nodules were evaluated according to volume and volume-doubling time, the chances of finding lung cancer 1 and 2 years following a negative first-round screening were notably low.

### Multidisciplinary team-based management of incidentally detected lung nodules [^111UkTmm]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Each year, more than 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Practice guidelines attempt to balance the benefit of early detection of lung cancer with the risks of diagnostic testing, but adherence to guidelines is low. The goal of this study was to determine guideline adherence rates in the setting of a multidisciplinary nodule clinic and describe reasons for nonadherence as well as associated outcomes.

- **Methods**: This cohort study included 3 years of follow-up of patients aged ≥ 35 years with an incidentally detected lung nodule evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic that used the 2005 Fleischner Society Guidelines.

- **Results**: Among 113 patients, 67% (95% CI, 58–76) were recommended a guideline-concordant nodule evaluation; 7.1% (95% CI, 3.1–13) and 26% (95% CI, 18–25) were recommended less or more intense evaluation, respectively. In contrast, 58% (95% CI, 48–67), 22% (95% CI, 18–25), and 23% (95% CI, 16–32) received a guideline-concordant, less intense, or more intense evaluation. The most common reason for recommending guideline-discordant care was concern for two different diagnoses that would each benefit from early detection and treatment. A majority of lung cancer diagnoses (88%) occurred in patients who received guideline-concordant care. There were no lung cancer cases in those who received less intense nodule care.

- **Conclusions**: A multidisciplinary nodule clinic may serve as a system-level intervention to promote guideline-concordant care, while also providing a multidisciplinary basis by which to deviate from guidelines.

### Performance of volume and diameter thresholds in malignancy prediction of solid nodules in lung cancer screening [^114AfzGC]. Thorax (2025). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there has been no prospective validation of the discriminatory performance of these thresholds in a large (> 10,000 participants) screening cohort. With the recent approval of a national LCS programme by the National Screening Committee in the UK, assessment of these thresholds is urgently required.

The aim of this analysis was to use data from the SUMMIT Study to:

1. Report the performance of the BTS nodule management guidelines in ruling out benign and identifying malignant solid nodules at baseline LDCT.

2. Compare the performance of a nodule management protocol including volumetric (where possible) thresholds to that achieved by single long-axis diameter thresholds.

3. Compare the performance of the 'rule out' volume thresholds used by BTS and EUPS, and of a mathematically determined 'optimal' Brock threshold against the current 10% risk (advocated by BTS) for identifying nodules requiring further investigation.

This analysis was limited to solid nodules to reflect the differences in measurement methods and diagnostic approach recommended between solid and subsolid nodules in all major guidelines.

### Detection and quantification of the solid component in pulmonary subsolid nodules by semiautomatic segmentation [^114ubfD3]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine whether semiautomatic volumetric software can differentiate part-solid from nonsolid pulmonary nodules and aid quantification of the solid component, this study was conducted.

As per the reference standard, 115 nodules were differentiated into nonsolid and part-solid by two radiologists, with disagreements adjudicated by a third radiologist. The diameters of solid components were measured manually. Semiautomatic volumetric measurements were used to identify and quantify a possible solid component using different Hounsfield unit (HU) thresholds. The measurements were compared with the reference standard and manual measurements.

The reference standard detected a solid component in 86 nodules. Diagnosis of a solid component by semiautomatic software depended on the threshold chosen. A threshold of -300 HU resulted in the detection of a solid component in 75 nodules with good sensitivity (90%) and specificity (88%). At a threshold of -130 HU, semiautomatic measurements of the diameter of the solid component (mean 2.4 mm, SD 2.7 mm) were comparable to manual measurements at the mediastinal window setting (mean 2.3 mm, SD 2.5 mm [p = 0.63]).

Semiautomatic segmentation of subsolid nodules could diagnose part-solid nodules and quantify the solid component similar to human observers. Performance depends on the attenuation segmentation thresholds. This method may prove useful in managing subsolid nodules.

- **Key points**:
	- Semiautomatic segmentation can accurately differentiate nonsolid from part-solid pulmonary nodules
	- Semiautomatic segmentation can quantify the solid component effectively

### ACR appropriateness criteria® incidentally detected indeterminate pulmonary nodule [^114WFeX1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Incidental pulmonary nodules are common. Although the majority are benign, most are indeterminate for malignancy when first encountered, making their management challenging. CT remains the primary imaging modality to first characterize and follow-up incidental lung nodules. This document reviews available literature on various imaging modalities and summarizes the management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules detected incidentally.

- **Evidence-based guidelines**: The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals.
- **Methodology principles**: Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.
- **Expert recommendations**: In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Performance of volume and diameter thresholds in malignancy prediction of solid nodules in lung cancer screening [^116nn2NG]. Thorax (2025). Low credibility.

Effective lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose CT (LDCT) requires distinguishing between pulmonary nodules with varying levels of malignancy risk. These risks determine whether referral for definitive investigation is warranted, further surveillance needed for intermediate risk, or if the nodule is of sufficiently low risk to be disregarded. Several models, some developed from LCS data, have been validated for predicting the malignancy of a nodule seen on a single or baseline LDCT. Size is the dominant factor in these models and serves as the key discriminator in guiding management at baseline LDCT in LCS programs. Guidelines have been developed for both screen-detected and incidentally detected nodules, proposing size thresholds below which no further surveillance is required, and also size and risk thresholds above which further investigation, such as positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT), should be conducted.

There remains discordance between guidelines regarding the preferred measurement method, size thresholds, and the point at which predicted malignancy risk is incorporated into management decisions. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) nodule management guidelines (2015), using evidence largely from LCS data, recommend volumetry as the primary sizing method, with a < 80 mm³ 'rule out' threshold (< 5 mm maximum diameter where reliable volumetric analysis cannot be obtained) for solid nodules at baseline LDCT. This approach is utilized by the targeted lung health check (TLHC) program in England. Lung-RADS (reporting and data systems) (V.2022) is used in screening programs in the…

### Management of an incidentally discovered pulmonary nodule [^11545BmT]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The incidental finding of a pulmonary nodule on computed tomography (CT) is becoming an increasingly frequent event. The discovery of such a nodule should evoke the possibility of a small bronchogenic carcinoma, for which excision is indicated without delay. However, invasive diagnostic procedures should be avoided in the case of a benign lesion.

The objectives of this review article are:

- **To analyze the CT criteria**: Defining benign nodules, nodules of high suspicion of malignancy, and indeterminate nodules.
- **To analyze the diagnostic performances**: Limitations of complementary investigations requested to characterize indeterminate lung nodules.
- **To review the criteria**: Permitting to assess the probability of malignancy of indeterminate nodules.
- **To report on new guidelines**: Provided by the Fleischner Society for the management of small indeterminate pulmonary nodules, according to their prior probability of malignancy.

### Growing small solid nodules in lung cancer screening: Safety and efficacy of a 200 mm minimum size threshold for multidisciplinary team referral [^1146cQgQ]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Of the 11,566 participants who underwent a baseline scan in this analysis, 3,621 solid nodules with a volume of 30–300 mm³ were identified in 2,344 participants (see Figure 1). Of these, 1,620 nodules in 953 participants underwent a 3-month interval scan (nodules 30–80 mm³ do not undergo interval scanning in the BTS/SUMMIT protocol, so these scans were performed for a coexisting finding, such as a larger nodule or consolidation). At the initial interval scan, 1,424 out of 1,620 (88%) nodules persisted, while the remaining 196 (12%) resolved.

Seventy-nine nodules in 70 participants demonstrated growth at the 3-month scan, with an additional two nodules in two participants showing clear growth on visual assessment but with unreliable segmentation at follow-up CT; these were excluded from further analysis. A further 17 nodules in 17 participants were noted to be growing on the 3-month interval scan, having been initially missed or disregarded on the baseline scan, giving a total of 96 solid nodules in 87 participants with clear evidence of growth at the 3-month scan. Of the 96 growing solid nodules, 36 nodules in 30 participants had a volume > 200 mm³ (management and outcomes shown in Figure 2), and 60 nodules in 59 participants had a volume ≤ 200 mm³ (management and outcomes shown in Figure 3).

### British Thoracic Society guidelines for the investigation and management of pulmonary nodules [^117DaP82]. Thorax (2015). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pulmonary nodules, specifically concerning surgical resection indications, the BTS 2015 guidelines recommend considering resection/non-surgical treatment or offering observation for pure ground-glass nodules that are enlarging by ≥ 2 mm in maximum diameter. For nodules under observation, it is advised to obtain a repeat CT scan following a maximum of 6 months, taking into account patient choice, age, comorbidities, and the risk of surgery.

### Growing small solid nodules in lung cancer screening: Safety and efficacy of a 200 mm minimum size threshold for multidisciplinary team referral [^116kR23Q]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Indeterminate pulmonary nodules are common in lung cancer screening, with only a small proportion ultimately confirmed as malignant. On baseline scans, malignancy risk, and thus nodule management in solid nodules, is primarily driven by size, whereas at follow-up CT scan, growth indicates an elevated risk of malignancy. The question of how to optimally manage growing solid nodules which remain below a size threshold for subsequent investigations is an area of uncertainty.

In LungRads 1.1, participants with growing nodules that remain < 8 mm are recommended for either CT surveillance or positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines and the European Position Statement stipulate that all nodules initially between 80 or 100 mm³ (respectively) and 300 mm³ (or ≥ 5 to < 10 mm in diameter when volumetry is not possible) which subsequently demonstrate growth with volume doubling time (VDT) < 400 days are referred for further definitive management, regardless of size.

The SUMMIT study (NCT03934866) is an observational study in high-risk participants using low-dose CT (LDCT) screening in London. The nodule management protocol used in SUMMIT is based on the BTS guidelines but includes a specific threshold volume of 200 mm³ before referral for growing solid nodules to the multidisciplinary team (MDT) for further investigation is advised. The rationale for this was twofold: first, data from the NELSON study found that the development of new solid pulmonary nodules was associated with a higher cancer risk but only above a threshold volume.

### Current readings: Radiologic interpretation of the part-solid nodule: Clinical relevance and novel technologies [^111tPrvz]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent subsolid nodules, whether part-solid or pure ground-glass attenuation, are associated with primary lung adenocarcinoma. These have been recently redefined by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer-American Thoracic Society-European Respiratory Society in 2011, and include newly categorized entities such as adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma. Awareness of the relationship between subsolid nodules and adenocarcinoma has emerged with the advent of high-resolution multidetector computed tomography (CT).

This article highlights the role of noninvasive CT for subsolid nodules, emphasizing the potential for quantitative measures to predict adenocarcinoma subtypes and their longitudinal behavior. Of particular importance is the knowledge that an increase in the solid components on CT signifies progression. Continued experience in evaluating quantitative measures, in combination with morphologic features such as margin contour, internal architecture, and nodule size, will further aid in guiding crucial decisions between CT surveillance and more invasive approaches, including biopsy and surgical resection.

### Characteristics of subsolid pulmonary nodules showing growth during follow-up with CT scanning [^111koPDi]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The positive results of a screening CT scan trial are likely to lead to an increase in the use of CT scanning and, consequently, an increase in the detection of subsolid nodules. Noninvasive methods, including follow-up with CT scanning to determine which nodules require invasive diagnosis and surgical treatment, should be defined promptly.

- **Methods**: Between 2000 and 2008, from our database of 60,000 examinations with CT scanning, we identified 174 subsolid nodules, which showed a ground-glass opacity area over 20% of the nodule and measured 2 cm in diameter, in 171 patients. We investigated the clinical characteristics and CT images of the subsolid nodules in relation to changes identified during the follow-up period.

- **Results**: The nodule sizes ranged from 4 mm to 20 mm at the first presentation. Nonsolid nodules numbered 98. During the follow-up period, 18 nodules showed resolution or shrinkage, and 41 showed growth of 2 mm or more in diameter. The time to 2-mm nodule growth curves, calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods, indicated that the 2-year and 5-year cumulative percentages of growing nodules were 13% and 23% in patients with nonsolid nodules and 38% and 55% in patients with part-solid nodules, respectively. Multivariate analysis disclosed that a large nodule size (over 10 mm) and history of lung cancer were significant predictive factors of growth in nonsolid nodules.

- **Conclusions**: An effective schedule for follow-up with CT scanning for subsolid nodules should be developed according to the type of subsolid nodule, initial nodule size, and history of lung cancer.

### Solid tumor size on high-resolution computed tomography and maximum standardized uptake on positron emission tomography for new clinical T descriptors with T1 lung adenocarcinoma [^115MEhTm]. Annals of Oncology (2013). High credibility.

To better describe clinical T descriptors using solid tumor size (the maximum dimension of the solid component of the tumor) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT), we examined 610 consecutive patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma who underwent complete resection. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was assessed on the basis of whole tumor size (maximum dimension of the tumor), solid tumor size, or a combination of solid tumor size and SUVmax.

- **Results**: RFS based on whole tumor size was not significantly different between patients with tumors measuring ≤ 2 cm and 2–3 cm (P = 0.089), whereas RFS based on solid tumor size was significantly different (P < 0.0001). Using both solid tumor size and SUVmax, we classified patients into four groups:
	- **Group 1**: Solid tumor size ≤ 2 cm, SUVmax ≤ 1.8
	- **Group 2**: Solid tumor size ≤ 2 cm, SUVmax > 1.8
	- **Group 3**: Solid tumor size 2–3 cm, SUVmax ≤ 3.6
	- **Group 4**: Solid tumor size 2–3 cm, SUVmax > 3.6

Groups 2 and 3 were combined due to similar RFS. RFS was significantly different among these groups: group 1 versus groups 2 + 3, P < 0.0001; groups 2 + 3 versus group 4, P = 0.019.

- **Conclusions**: Both solid tumor size on HRCT and SUVmax on FDG-PET/CT reflect prognosis well in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma and may support new clinical T descriptors.

### Computerized tomography screening for lung cancer: New findings and diagnostic work-up [^117ChPbh]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

On computerized tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer within the Early Lung Cancer Action Project, both at baseline and repeat screening, we found not only solid but also subsolid nodules, which, unlike solid ones, do not completely obscure the lung parenchyma. We established that subsolid nodules represent approximately 20% of the nodules shown on screening and that they have a higher frequency of malignancy than solid nodules. Although we found growth of solid nodules to be a reliable indicator of malignancy, the growth of subsolid nodules was more difficult to assess. On review of our results at the time of writing, we have continued to refine our definition of a positive result of screening from that given in our initial publication on screening. We have also provided an updated screening regimen. It starts with the initial, low-dose CT test, and for all those with positive results on this initial test, the regimen continues by specifying the work-up needed to rule in a diagnosis of malignancy. In this regimen, we found growth assessed by high-resolution CT to be a useful indicator of malignancy and have developed image-processing tools to help in this assessment. Once growth is ascertained, we recommend fine-needle aspiration for confirmation of malignancy. It may be that once criteria for definitive growth are established and validated, fine-needle aspiration may become optional. However, in the meantime, in the context of screening, a more cautious approach is warranted.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: An observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^116p22P3]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

In a cohort of 2,001 participants who underwent interval surveillance due at 3 months for an indeterminate nodule at baseline low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), we found no change in the proportion of participants diagnosed with stage > I lung cancer when nodule follow-up CT scans were delayed from 3 to 6 months. However, we observed a higher proportion of cancers that were diagnosed at stage II or above when scans were delayed beyond 6 months, suggesting that delays beyond this time point risk significant disease progression.

Although evidence indicates that adherence to recommended follow-up for screen-detected findings is known to be suboptimal, there is little evidence for the consequences of such delays. Conducting this research is challenging: First, most participants undergoing nodule follow-up CT scans will not have cancer, necessitating large screened cohorts to obtain sufficient cancer numbers. Second, pathologic upstaging at surgery occurs in 17%-38% of cases, making it difficult to determine whether extended delays truly led to stage shifts in individual cases.

A recently published article in a US screening cohort used a retrospective review of baseline (noncontrast) LDCT examinations to assess for clinical stage shift. It found that clinical upstaging was observed more frequently following delayed nodule follow-up CT scans compared to cancers diagnosed following nodule follow-up CT scans performed at the target time, with a median delay in cases where upstaging occurred of 131 days after the target time.

### Resource use and guideline concordance in evaluation of pulmonary nodules for cancer: Too much and too little care [^117QReFL]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are common, and more will be found with the implementation of lung cancer screening. The way potentially malignant pulmonary nodules are evaluated may affect patient outcomes, healthcare costs, and the effectiveness of lung cancer screening programs. Guidelines for evaluating pulmonary nodules for cancer exist, but little is known about how nodules are evaluated in the usual care setting.

- **Objective**: To characterize nodule evaluation and concordance with guidelines.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including a detailed review of medical records from pulmonary nodule detection through evaluation completion, cancer diagnosis, or study end (December 31, 2012). The participants included 300 adults with pulmonary nodules from 15 Veterans Affairs hospitals.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Resources used for evaluation at any Veterans Affairs facility and guideline-concordant evaluation served as the main outcomes.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven of 300 patients (9.0%) with pulmonary nodules ultimately received a diagnosis of lung cancer: 1 of 57 (1.8%) with a nodule of 4 mm or less, 4 of 134 (3.0%) with a nodule of 5 to 8 mm, and 22 of 109 (20.2%) with a nodule larger than 8 mm. Nodule evaluation entailed 1,044 imaging studies, 147 consultations, 76 biopsies, 13 resections, and 21 hospitalizations. Radiographic surveillance (n = 277) lasted a median of 13 months but ranged from less than 0.5 months to 8.5 years. Forty-six patients underwent invasive procedures (range per patient, 1–4): 41.3% (19 patients) did not have cancer.

### Growing small solid nodules in lung cancer screening: Safety and efficacy of a 200 mm minimum size threshold for multidisciplinary team referral [^111QnFsL]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

The PPV of a growing nodule that reached size > 200 mm³ being malignant was 65.9% (29/44), constituting 21 cancers in 36 nodules > 200 mm³ at first interval scan (figure 2) plus 8 cancers in 8 nodules which grew to > 200 mm³ at subsequent scans (figure 3). PPV was 60.5% (23/38) on a per-participant basis.

In this study, 53 growing nodules of ≤ 200 mm³ at 3 months were managed by further surveillance (figure 3). Of these, eight were diagnosed as lung cancer within 2 years. Seven were stage 1, and one was stage 3 (pN2 nodal involvement at surgical resection, not demonstrable on preoperative CT imaging). The false negative rate of the protocol was therefore 1.9% (95% CI 0.33% to 9.94%) (1/53).

At first interval scan, median VDT was shorter in nodules subsequently confirmed to be malignant compared with those where malignancy was ultimately excluded (median 98 days, range 42–389, vs. median 202 days, range 27–440). A management protocol based on evidence of growth alone would have resulted in all 87 participants being referred for definitive assessment; however, a combination of growth and minimum volume threshold reduced this by 62% to 33/87 (figures 2 and 3).

- **Example images**: Panel A shows a growing nodule subsequently diagnosed as lung cancer. The baseline scan shows a volume of 42 mm³. At 3 months, the volume increased to 92 mm³, with a PVC of +117% and a VDT of 98 days. At 6 months (scan performed at 8 months), the volume reached 246 mm³, with a PVC of +168% and a VDT of 109 days.

### British thoracic society guidelines for the investigation and management of pulmonary nodules [^116Vo255]. Thorax (2015). High credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) 2015 guidelines provide recommendations for diagnostic procedures concerning pulmonary nodules, particularly lung biopsy. They suggest considering an image-guided biopsy or excision biopsy. Alternatively, CT surveillance may be appropriate, guided by individual risk assessment and patient preference. These procedures are advised if the risk of malignancy is estimated to be between 10–70% after re-evaluating risk following a PET-CT scan.

### Characteristics of new solid nodules detected in incidence screening rounds of low-dose CT lung cancer screening: The NELSON study [^113uGa46]. Thorax (2018). High credibility.

New nodules after baseline are regularly found in low-dose CT lung cancer screening and have a high lung cancer probability. It is unknown whether morphological and location characteristics can improve new nodule risk stratification by size.

- **Methods**: Solid non-calcified nodules detected during incidence screening rounds of the randomized controlled Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening (NELSON) trial and registered as new or previously below detection limit (15mm³) were included. A multivariate logistic regression analysis with lung cancer as the outcome was performed, including previously established volume cut-offs (< 30mm³, 30- < 200mm³, and ≥ 200mm³) and nodule characteristics (location, distribution, shape, margin, and visibility < 15mm³ in retrospect).

- **Results**: Overall, 1280 new nodules were included, with 73 (6%) being lung cancer. Of nodules ≥ 30mm³ at detection and visible < 15mm³ in retrospect, 22% (6/27) were lung cancer. Discrimination based on volume cut-offs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.80, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.84) and continuous volume (AUC: 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.87) was similar. After adjustment for volume cut-offs, only location in the right upper lobe (OR 2.0, P = 0.012), central distribution (OR 2.4, P = 0.001), and visibility < 15mm³ in retrospect (OR 4.7, P = 0.003) remained significant predictors for lung cancer. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P = 0.75) and assessment of bootstrap calibration curves indicated adequate model fit. Discrimination based on the continuous model probability (AUC: 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89) was superior.

### Radiological evidence of rapid growth acceleration of a small part solid nodule found to be large-cell carcinoma of the lung [^11674JM6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

In April 2021, a third chest CT scan conducted seven months after the second showed that the mixed ground-glass opacity (GGO) had already progressed to a 3.1 cm × 2.9 cm solid tumor with an obvious lobulation sign. Volume doubling times (VDTs) calculated by the Modified Schwartz Equation were 400 and 36 days, respectively, throughout the two follow-up periods. The Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan exhibited a high maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax: 5.1) lesion at the left lower lobe. This patient detected no distant metastasis by PET/CT or contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Serum tumor biomarker levels, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA: 6.19 ng/ml) and progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP: 81.8 pg/ml), were elevated in this case.

- **Figure description**:
	- **A**: The chest CT on 29th December 2019 revealed a 0.8 cm × 0.6 cm mixed GGO lesion with a distinct boundary on her left lower lobe, which comprised 3 mm subsolid components.
	- **B**: The second chest CT on 15th September 2020 showed that there was no significant change in the size of this nodule, but revealed a larger solid component within the mixed GGO lesion.
	- **C**: The third chest CT on 19th April 2021 showed a 3.1 cm × 2.9 cm completely solid nodule with a discriminated boundary and sign of lobulation.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, and more specifically with respect to follow-up imaging, the Fleischner Society 2017 guidelines recommend follow-up for patients with multiple solid noncalcified nodules. If there is at least one nodule that is ≥ 6 mm, an initial follow-up should occur at 3–6 months, followed by an optional second scan at 18–24 months depending on the estimated risk.

### Evaluating the patient with a pulmonary nodule: A review [^112fLWzu]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million patients per year in the US and are detected on approximately 30% of computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest. Optimal treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule can lead to early detection of cancer while minimizing testing for a benign nodule.

- **Observations**: At least 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified are benign, most often granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Smaller nodules are more likely to be benign. Pulmonary nodules are categorized as small solid (< 8 mm), larger solid (≥ 8 mm), and subsolid. Subsolid nodules are divided into ground-glass nodules (no solid component) and part-solid (both ground-glass and solid components). The probability of malignancy is less than 1% for all nodules smaller than 6 mm and 1% to 2% for nodules 6 mm to 8 mm.

Nodules that are 6 mm to 8 mm can be followed with a repeat chest CT in 6 to 12 months depending on the presence of patient risk factors, imaging characteristics associated with lung malignancy, clinical judgment about the probability of malignancy, and patient preferences. The treatment of an individual with a solid pulmonary nodule 8 mm or larger is based on the estimated probability of malignancy; the presence of patient comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease; and patient preferences. Management options include surveillance imaging, defined as monitoring for nodule growth with chest CT imaging, positron emission tomography-CT imaging, and nonsurgical biopsy with bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle aspiration.
