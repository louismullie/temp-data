## Question

Frenulum and steroids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of steroids in frenulum-related conditions, including when topical or intralesional steroids are indicated, how to choose potency and duration, what outcomes to expect, and when to escalate to surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entities that involve the frenulum and whether steroids are relevant. Then, I should verify guideline-backed indications for topical versus intralesional steroids. Next, I will examine potency, duration, and safety, and finally, I will consider alternatives if steroids fail and synthesize a practical decision framework with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. The most common scenario where steroids are discussed for the frenulum is lichen sclerosus (LS) causing scarring, shortening, or fissuring of the frenulum, particularly in males, where guidelines explicitly address steroid use and surgical options when scarring is present [^9aeeaeda] [^68c29bd3]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — other frenulum issues like a "tight frenulum" without LS, congenital adhesions, or trauma-related scarring are different entities and may not respond to steroids, so I need to ensure the diagnosis is LS before recommending steroids for the frenulum specifically [^a68e7f3f].

> Next, I should review guideline-backed indications. I need to check whether topical steroids are first-line for LS and whether intralesional steroids are reserved for refractory scarring. Multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend ultra-potent or potent topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy for genital LS, with escalation to intralesional triamcinolone for scarring or shortening of the frenulum when guideline-recommended topical therapy fails, often alongside frenuloplasty or as an alternative to circumcision in select cases [^d61a7313] [^eccf1279] [^9aeeaeda] [^68c29bd3].

> I will now examine potency and regimen. Wait, let me verify the strength and duration. For genital LS, ultra-potent agents such as clobetasol 0.05% ointment are standard, typically applied once daily for 4–8 weeks initially, with maintenance strategies individualized to disease activity; ointment is preferred on genital skin to minimize irritation, and fingertip-unit guidance helps avoid under- or over-application [^d61a7313] [^83eb8bea] [^5b2e8fa6]. Hold on, I should confirm safety in this location — genital skin is thin and permeable, so even low-potency agents can be effective, but ultra-potent steroids require careful supervision to mitigate atrophy risk [^5b136671].

> Now, intralesional steroids. I need to ensure dosing and context are correct. When frenulum scarring persists despite optimized topical therapy, guidelines suggest intralesional triamcinolone, often 10–20 mg, sometimes in combination with frenuloplasty; there is no consensus on repeat dosing, so I should individualize and reassess response and atrophy risk before repeating injections [^9aeeaeda] [^68c29bd3] [^20c50b56]. But wait, what if the diagnosis is uncertain? If topical steroids have failed, I should double-check the diagnosis with biopsy when appropriate to exclude mimics or malignancy before escalating to intralesional therapy [^20c50b56].

> Next, I should review expected outcomes and limitations. Let me consider the evidence base. While high-quality RCTs specific to intralesional steroids for frenulum scarring are lacking, guideline consensus supports this approach in refractory LS scarring; topical steroids for LS overall improve symptoms and reduce scarring progression, and pediatric data suggest topical therapy can reduce circumcision rates in LS, though follow-up is often limited and heterogeneity is high, so I should counsel about uncertain magnitude of benefit and the need for ongoing maintenance [^9aeeaeda] [^a6e9b818]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were robust RCTs for intralesional therapy in this exact setting — let me correct that: the strongest evidence exists for topical steroids in LS, with intralesional use supported by expert consensus rather than large RCTs, so shared decision-making is essential [^d61a7313] [^9aeeaeda].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring. Genital skin is prone to atrophy with potent steroids; limiting continuous ultra-potent use to about 2 weeks before tapering or switching to maintenance, and using the lowest effective dose, reduces risk; I need to monitor for striae, telangiectasia, and secondary infection, and reassess at 2–3 months to titrate potency and frequency [^5b136671] [^83eb8bea]. Hold on, I should verify systemic absorption concerns — on limited genital surface area, systemic effects are uncommon but possible with prolonged high-potency use, so I should avoid occlusion and excessive quantities and document cumulative use over time [^9f3b838f].

> Let me consider alternatives if steroids fail or are contraindicated. If topical and intralesional steroids do not achieve control, or if scarring is severe and function-limiting, surgical options such as frenuloplasty or circumcision are reasonable; in parallel, I should re-evaluate adherence, confirm the diagnosis, and consider second-line medical options like topical calcineurin inhibitors with counseling about long-term safety uncertainties, reserving these for specialist care [^9aeeaeda] [^68c29bd3] [^20c50b56]. I need to ensure I am not conflating phimosis guidance with frenulum disease — while topical steroids are first-line for primary phimosis, that does not automatically translate to frenulum scarring without LS, so I should anchor recommendations to LS-specific guidance for the frenulum [^6f3895fc] [^49d5bdd1].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm LS as the cause of frenulum scarring or shortening; if uncertain, consider biopsy. Second, initiate ultra-potent topical corticosteroid ointment once daily for 4–8 weeks with clear return precautions and counseling on safe application. Third, reassess at 2–3 months; if scarring persists or function remains limited, offer intralesional triamcinolone 10–20 mg, optionally with frenuloplasty, recognizing that repeat dosing is individualized. Fourth, if still refractory, refer for surgical management and reconsider the diagnosis or alternative therapies under specialist supervision [^d61a7313] [^9aeeaeda] [^68c29bd3] [^20c50b56]. Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed patient education and adherence — steroid phobia and underapplication are common and can undermine outcomes, so explicit counseling and follow-up are critical to success [^6d23e791] [^5b2e8fa6].

Steroids are **not indicated for a tight frenulum** (frenulum breve) because it is a structural anomaly, not an inflammatory condition. Topical or intralesional steroids do not lengthen the frenulum or improve elasticity, and surgery (frenuloplasty or frenectomy) is the definitive treatment when symptomatic [^notfound]. Steroids may be used only if there is coexisting inflammatory skin disease (e.g. lichen sclerosus) affecting the frenulum, but even then, **surgery is often still required** for functional correction [^9aeeaeda].

---

## Pathophysiology of frenulum breve

Frenulum breve is characterized by a short, thick, or inelastic frenulum that restricts foreskin movement, causing pain, tearing, and difficulty with sexual activity. It is a **congenital or acquired structural abnormality** — not an inflammatory disease — so steroids, which reduce inflammation, do not address the underlying mechanical problem.

---

## Role of steroids in medical treatment

Steroids are anti-inflammatory agents used for dermatologic and inflammatory conditions; they do not alter tissue structure or elasticity. Their role in frenulum breve is **limited to managing coexisting inflammatory conditions** (e.g. lichen sclerosus) that may involve the frenulum; they do not correct the short frenulum itself.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for using topical or intralesional steroids to treat isolated frenulum breve. Steroids are not recommended for structural abnormalities like a short frenulum, and no studies demonstrate benefit in this context.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is the **definitive treatment** for symptomatic frenulum breve:

- **Frenuloplasty**: Lengthens the frenulum via a Z-plasty or V-Y advancement, preserving the vascular bundle and improving mobility.
- **Frenectomy**: Complete excision of the frenulum, typically reserved for severe or recurrent cases.

These procedures are highly effective, with low recurrence and high patient satisfaction.

---

## Risks and limitations of steroid use

Steroids carry risks, especially in the genital area, including:

- **Skin atrophy**: Thinning of the genital skin.
- **Striae**: Stretch marks.
- **Secondary infections**: Increased susceptibility.
- **Delayed healing**: Impaired wound repair.

Given these risks and the lack of benefit, **routine steroid use for frenulum breve is not justified**.

---

## Clinical scenarios where steroids may be considered

Steroids may be considered only when there is a **coexisting inflammatory dermatologic condition** (e.g. lichen sclerosus) involving the frenulum. Even then, steroids treat the inflammation — not the short frenulum — and surgical correction is often still required for functional improvement [^9aeeaeda].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Steroids are **not indicated for isolated frenulum breve** because it is a structural, not inflammatory, condition. Surgery remains the definitive treatment; steroids should be reserved for coexisting inflammatory disease, and even then, surgical intervention is frequently necessary for functional correction.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^fe18cb96]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

Question 2: What is the most appropriate next step in management for complete resolution?
A. Surgical excision of the affected area
B. Antiviral suppression
C. Localized yeast injection
D. Liquid nitrogen treatment
E. Topical steroid application

Answers:
A. Surgical excision of affected area – Correct. Surgical excision is the recommended approach for complete resolution. A trans-ungual approach is most common, including the removal of the nail and excising the tumor. While allowing complete excision, this approach may not be cosmetically pleasing. Additionally, postsurgery recurrence is relatively common due to incomplete removal, development of a new lesion, or a missed satellite lesion.
B. Antiviral suppression – Incorrect. While effective for herpetic whitlow, viruses do not play a role in the etiopathogenesis of this condition.
C. Localized yeast injection – Incorrect. This is an effective treatment for verruca vulgaris but will not stimulate a sufficient immune response to eliminate the tumor.
D. Liquid nitrogen treatment – Incorrect. While liquid nitrogen causes local destruction, this is not recommended due to the tumor depth and imprecision.
E. Topical steroid application – Incorrect. This will have no effect on management and will likely be unable to penetrate the nail bed.

### Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^5b2e8fa6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side-effects are generally uncommon. Current advice to patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency for which the evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. In the patient's mind, the current advice groups all steroids together regardless of their potential for adverse effects. The advice also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labelling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing of topical corticosteroids and help in the provision of more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, and continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions, preferably with images of a 'fingertip unit' and a chart to show the number of units required for specific areas of the body.

### Glucocorticoids promote CCL20 expression in keratinocytes [^d932d14e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease that classically manifests with flushing, telangiectasias, and inflamed papules and pustules on the face. A wide spectrum of stimuli can exacerbate rosacea, including ultraviolet exposure, temperature, microbes and drugs. The inflammation of rosacea is often treated with topical or oral antibiotics, and its chronic nature typically requires long‐term management and the avoidance of triggers.

Rosacea responds poorly to treatment with steroids. In general, steroids are envisioned as having potent immunosuppressive properties and have an essential role in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, clinicians have long recognized that topical steroids worsen rosacea with prolonged treatment or upon their withdrawal. A related inflammatory skin condition – perioral dermatitis – is frequently associated with the long‐term use of topical steroids on the face. In fact, these two clinical entities (rosacea and perioral dermatitis) are histologically similar and considered by some clinicians to be variants of the same condition. Together they represent cardinal examples of skin conditions that are initiated or worsened by steroids. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie their atypical proinflammatory response to steroids is not well understood.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^ebbcd5b2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Steroid-related adverse effects during immune-related adverse event (irAE) management — general principles: Steroids remain the most studied and valuable agents in the management of immunotherapy-related AEs, but higher steroid doses may be necessary and use is often prolonged, placing patients at significant risk for acute and long-term toxicities. Evaluation of the patient's pre‑existing conditions and careful monitoring of steroid-related complications is crucial, and prophylactic agents to prevent certain opportunistic infections along with preemptive measures to mitigate various toxicities are necessary for patients needing longer‑term steroid use. The lowest possible dose of steroids should be used for the shortest possible duration, steroid tapers should be gradual and individualized based on the irAE's response and the patient's ability to tolerate steroids, and certain patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, an immune‑compromised state, and the elderly will need special attention. A multidisciplinary approach may be used for certain steroid‑related complications, institutional guidelines should be considered in decision making, and readers are directed to Table 12 for a complete set of recommendations for prevention and management of AEs related to steroid use.

Topical anti-inflammatory medications — topical corticosteroids: For decades, topical corticosteroids have been the standard of care for AD and, despite concerns about potential side effects, have long been an effective and safe treatment when used with appropriate supervision. A common misconception is that steroids discolor or bleach the skin; although rare hypopigmentation after intralesional use has been reported, typical use of topical steroids does not alter skin pigmentation.

### Referrals from primary care with foreskin symptoms: room for improvement [^42e5c380]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Referrals to secondary care for boys with foreskin symptoms require face-to-face review, resulting in time out of school / work and costs to the family. This study aimed to review outcomes of referrals to ascertain if there was scope to reduce referrals.

Methods

New patients referred to a UK regional paediatric surgery clinic during 2019 were identified and screened retrospectively. Medical records for boys over one year of age referred due to foreskin symptoms were reviewed.

Results

Of 2598 referrals, 1939 (75%) were boys & 1094 were > 1 yr; 398 (21%) were referred with foreskin symptoms at median age 7.2 yrs (IQR 4–10). 307 (77%) were diagnosed with physiological phimosis, 67 (18%) with pathological phimosis, 9 (2%) with balanitis (the remainder had 'smegma' retention cysts, preputial adhesions, tight frenulum or anatomical abnormalities). 211 (53%) were discharged at the initial appointment, this was significantly more likely for younger boys, and those with physiological phimosis (p < 0.001). 62 (16%) were prescribed topical steroids (more likely in older boys, p < 0.001). 70 (18%) were offered surgery: circumcisions (n = 51), preputioplasties (n = 13), other (n = 4). The circumcision rate was therefore 12%. Age at referral was positively correlated with GP trial of steroid (older more likely), diagnosis (physiological phimosis more likely if younger) and outcome (topical steroids or surgery more likely if older): Spearman's rank correlation p < 0.001.

Conclusions

Over 75% of boys referred had a normal foreskin, over half were discharged at their first review. Improved knowledge amongst parents and primary care providers could reduce referrals and save money and resources.

### Steroid phobia: a review of prevalence, risk factors, and interventions [^6d23e791]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroid phobia may lead to poor adherence, resulting in persistent disease and escalation to systemic agents. The aim of this paper was to review current literature to assess topical steroid phobia prevalence, populations most at risk, reasons behind steroid phobia, and interventions to reduce it. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid (Journals@Ovid, MEDLINE), ScienceDirect, and Web of Science was performed. Studies ranged from May 2000 to February 2021. In total, 37 articles met the inclusion criteria. There was inter-study variation in the way steroid phobia is defined, from concern to irrational fear. The worldwide prevalence of topical steroid phobia ranges from 31 to 95.7% and does not differ with patient race/ethnicity or dermatological condition. Female patients and caregivers, and those who have experienced side effects of topical corticosteroids are most likely to express steroid phobia. Reasons for steroid phobia include lack of education, fear of side effects, polypharmacy, misinformation, negative experience with topical steroids, and frequently changing of clinics. Successful interventions to address steroid phobia include patient education in the form of educational videos followed by individualized oral education based on concerns, and demonstrations of application of topical steroids. Multiple interventions address topical corticosteroid phobia and improve adherence of topical corticosteroids in the management of dermatological conditions. Providers should screen patients for steroid phobia, especially in populations particularly at risk. Interventions using patient education should be individualized based on concerns expressed during screening. Further research should investigate if reducing steroid phobia can in fact improve long-term adherence.

### Topical corticosteroids for treating phimosis in boys [^49d5bdd1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. Phimosis is a condition in which the prepuce (foreskin) cannot be fully retracted past the head of the penis (glans). Phimosis is often treated surgically by circumcision or prepuce plasty; however, reports of non-invasive treatment using topical corticosteroids applied for four to eight weeks have suggested favorable outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical corticosteroids applied to the stenotic portion of the prepuce for the treatment of phimosis in boys compared with placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrial.gov. We checked reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for additional studies. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. The date of the last search was 4 October 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any topical corticosteroid with placebo or no treatment for boys with any type or degree of phimosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data related to the review's primary and secondary outcomes, and assessed the studies' risk of bias. We used the random-effects model for statistical analyses and expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We contacted the authors of the primary articles to request details of the study design and specific outcome data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence on a per-outcome basis.

Main Results

In this update, we identified two new studies with 111 participants, bringing the total number of included studies to 14 (1459 randomized participants). We found that types of corticosteroids investigated, participant age, degree of phimosis, type of phimosis, and treatment duration varied considerably among studies. Compared with placebo or no treatment, topical corticosteroids may increase the complete resolution of phimosis after four to eight weeks of treatment (RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.16; I² = 72%; 10 trials, 834 participants; low-certainty evidence). Based on 252 complete resolutions per 1000 boys in the control group, this corresponds to 436 more complete resolutions per 1000 boys (95% CI 199 more to 796 more). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious inconsistency. Topical corticosteroids may also increase the partial resolution of phimosis at four to eight weeks of treatment compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.40; I² = 44%; 7 trials, 745 participants; low-certainty evidence). Based on 297 partial resolutions per 1000 boys in the control group, this corresponds to 202 more partial resolutions per 1000 boys (95% CI 50 more to 416 more). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious inconsistency. We are uncertain of the effect of topical corticosteroids compared to placebo on change in retractability score (standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.48, 95% CI -2.93 to -0.03; I²91%; 2 trials, 177 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations, one level for serious heterogeneity, and one level for serious imprecision. Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids may increase the long-term complete resolution of phimosis six or more months after treatment (RR 4.09, 95% CI 2.80 to 5.97; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 280 participants; low-certainty evidence). Based on 171 long-term complete resolutions per 1000 boys in the control group, this corresponds to 528 more complete resolutions per 1000 boys (95% CI 308 more to 850 more). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious imprecision. There may be little or no difference in the risk of adverse effects between topical corticosteroids and placebo or no treatment (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.62; I² = 22%; 11 trials, 1091 participants; low-certainty evidence). Only two of 11 studies that recorded adverse effects reported any adverse effects; one event occurred in the corticosteroid group and six in the control group. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one level for serious study limitations and by one level for serious imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical corticosteroids, compared to placebo or no treatment, may increase complete and partial resolution of phimosis when assessed after four to eight weeks of treatment, and may increase long-term complete resolution of phimosis assessed six or more months after treatment. Topical corticosteroids may have few or no adverse effects, and we are uncertain about their effect on retractability scores. The body of evidence is limited by poor reporting of methods in the studies, important clinical heterogeneity, and serious imprecision in the results. Future, higher-quality trials with long-term follow-up would likely improve our understanding of the effects of topical corticoids on phimosis in boys.

Question 2: Which of the following topical therapies is most effective in treating this condition?
A. Topical antifungal therapy
B. Topical imiquimod
C. Topical steroid therapy
D. Topical antibiotic therapy
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil

Answers:
A. Topical antifungal therapy – Incorrect. This would be appropriate for the management of tinea cruris or intertrigo. It is important to note that EMPD can mimic fungal or inflammatory conditions, which often results in delays in diagnosis and management.
B. Topical imiquimod – Correct. Topical imiquimod is often used as a first line agent and has been shown to provide a complete response in up to 73% of patients. Its efficacy is due to its ability to stimulate an immune response against tumor cells.
C. Topical steroid therapy – Incorrect. Topical steroid therapy does not have a role in the management of EMPD.
D. Topical antibiotic therapy – Incorrect. Topical antibiotic therapy is not applicable in the management approach for EMPD, as it does not target the underlying malignant pathology.
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil – Incorrect. While it has been shown to be effective in some case series, it is not effective as a monotherapy. Instead, it must be paired with other agents, such as imiquimod or calcipotriene, and is often reserved for refractory cases.

Systemic steroids versus placebo — A Cochrane review first published in 2006 and most recently updated in 2013 found only 3 trials of steroids versus placebo or no treatment; all looked at oral steroids versus placebo and all were found to have high risk of bias. Two of the included trials demonstrated no significant benefit, while 1 trial showed improvement of hearing in 61% of patients in the steroid group as compared with 32% in the control group, and because of these contradictory outcomes and small numbers the role of steroids remained unclear. In 2016, another group compared the addition of IV methylprednisolone to oral steroids and noted no difference in hearing outcomes with the addition of IV steroids.

### Erosive lichen sclerosus – A clinicopathologic subtype [^f33d9172]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

In poorly controlled LS with many fissures and ulcers, biopsies obtained from multiple morphologically distinct sites may be required to exclude differentiated VIN and SCC. There are many etiologies of genital ulcers to include pressure, infectious, reactive, granulomatous, immunobullous, and manifestations of systemic autoimmune disease. If an ulcer occurs in a field of well-controlled LS, a comprehensive history, examination, and investigations may be required to determine the cause and direct therapy. Focal fissures in LS may arise from sexual trauma, infection, estrogen deficiency, and undertreatment. Rarely, they persist despite maximal medical treatment but respond to excision of lichenified edges with reapproximation of well-treated adjacent skin. Fissures also may occur within vestibulovaginal sclerosis. In contrast to ulcerated LS, this usually occurs in the space between urethra and clitoral frenulum, has nil to scant lymphocytic infiltrate, and does not respond to topical steroid ointment.

The centralized referral and expert review of biopsy specimens permitted identification and description of this infrequent erosive subtype of LS. Limitations of this study are those inherent to the retrospective design, to include missing data, practice differences across clinicians, and low rates of clinical photography and microbiologic assessment. The small number of cases and variable follow-up preclude comment on erosion recurrence and association with human papillomavirus, VIN, and SCC. The prevalence of erosions and ulcers in treated LS is unknown, and its utility in proposed severity scoring systems remains unclear. The finding that outcome correlates with provider type likely relates to underprescribing of topical steroids by nonspecialists and highlights the need for referral pathways to vulvar clinics and enhanced education on vulvovaginal diseases in training programs. –

### Noninfectious penile lesions… [^5b136671]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

3 Punch or shave biopsy is indicated if lesions are atypical. Treatment depends on whether the disease is localized or disseminated. 3, 5, 7, 9 First-line localized treatment includes mild to midstrength topical corticosteroids. 3, 6, 8, 9 Once-daily application of corticosteroids is sufficient because genital skin is permeable, and corticosteroid receptors remain saturated for almost 24 hours. As a general rule, no more than 50 g of ultrapotent or 100 mg of potent topical corticosteroids should be applied over a long-term period 9 because continuous use may cause skin atrophy. Lesions may reappear when corticosteroid use is discontinued. 10 To avoid overdose, daily ultrapotent topical corticosteroid use should be limited to two weeks, followed by weekend dosing. 10 If long-term therapy is required, tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be appropriate, without the risk of atrophy.

11 Vitamin D 3 analogues are a first-line option for localized disease, and are usually applied once or twice daily. Patients with refractory disease should be referred to a dermatologist. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and prevent malignant transformation. 13 Lichen sclerosus can be treated with moderate to ultrapotent fluorinated topical corticosteroids. Biopsy is indicated if squamous cell carcinoma is suspected. 20 Surgery is needed in patients with persistent disease or a history of squamous cell carcinoma. 18 Circumcision may be indicated in patients with lichen sclerosus limited to the glans penis and prepuce. 31, 33 Patients rarely experience pruritus. 32, 33 The course of lichen nitidus is variable and can resolve spontaneously. 31 When treatment is indicated for cosmesis, options include corticosteroids, vitamin A analogues, cyclosporine, itraconazole, and phototherapy.

33 Laser ablation should be avoided because of the potential for scarring.
31. The response to treatment of lichen planus is variable. 37, 38 Daily potent topical corticosteroids are usually effective but carry a risk of atrophy; however, weekend dosing of ultrapotent topical corticosteroids may be effective. For isolated lichen planus of the prepuce, circumcision is indicated when medical management fails.
39. The presentation of squamous cell carcinoma is variable because patients commonly delay seeking medical care, with average delays of six months or longer.

### Survival among veterans receiving steroids for immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^7b7e7914]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a cornerstone of oncologic treatment since the approval of ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma. By modulating T-cell interactions with tumor cells via cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1), ICIs enhance antitumor T-cell activity, with promising clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, ICI treatment is often associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to blockade of negative regulatory pathways that limit autoimmunity. These irAEs can affect various organ systems and most commonly involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine glands, lungs, or liver.

Systemic corticosteroids are the clinical standard for management of most grade 2 or higher irAEs, but they have classically played a larger role in alleviating cancer-related symptoms (eg, symptomatic brain metastases and pain) for supportive prophylaxis for cancer-specific treatments (eg, chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting, and drug infusion reactions) and for comorbid conditions (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and autoimmune disease).

Due to their immunosuppressive properties, there is concern that concurrent steroids may undermine the antitumor efficacy of ICIs. Although multiple retrospective studies, have suggested that steroids are not associated with decreased overall survival (OS), others have suggested an increased risk of death and cancer progression. Further subgroup analyses have demonstrated that steroids for irAE management or other non–cancer-related indications are not associated with decreased survival, whereas palliative steroid use is associated with worse outcomes. Although the association of steroid timing with ICI initiation is potentially contributory, there remain inconsistencies in current data, with some studies showing adverse outcomes with early use or baseline use and others showing no difference.,

Given the conflicting evidence, more research is needed to elucidate the association of steroids with cancer survival outcomes and identify optimal strategies for their use in patients receiving ICI therapy. To investigate how steroid administration and its timing is associated with survival, we conducted a retrospective study of US veterans receiving ICIs using the Veterans Health Administration's (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW).

### Multifocal alopecia of the scalp, axillae, and body [^18b2cb09]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following would be considered first-line in treatment of this condition?
A. Topical steroids
B. Tofacitinib
C. Doxycycline
D. Hydroxychloroquine
E. Minoxidil

Answers:
A. Topical steroids – Correct. Both topical and intralesional steroids are considered first-line therapy for lichen planopilaris (LPP) and its variants including GLPLS. Steroids have been shown to reduce clinical signs of inflammation and halt progression of cicatricial alopecia. They can be used alone or in combination with other agents.
B. Tofacitinib – Incorrect. Janus kinase upregulation has been thought to play a role in LPP and its variants such as GLPLS. The use of oral tofacitinib has been reported in recalcitrant cases of GLPLS, however is not considered a first-line therapy.
C. Doxycycline – Incorrect. Although doxycycline, an oral antibiotic with antiinflammatory properties, is commonly used in some cicatricial alopecias such as frontal fibrosing alopecia, it is not considered first-line in treatment of GLPLS.
D. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Hydroxychloroquine, widely used in the treatment of autoimmune conditions, has been reported as a treatment for cases of GLPLS refractory to first-line treatment with topical and/or intralesional steroids. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown effective for controlling symptoms, significantly reducing disease severity, and halting progression of LPP.
E. Minoxidil – Incorrect. Minoxidil is used to treat other etiologies of alopecia such as androgenic or alopecia areata, but it is not typically used as first-line treatment of LPP and its variants.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^3b0d07ef]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Overview — key topics and conclusions for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis (ICI-pneumonitis) emphasize rising recognition and major research gaps. The increase in ICI use has led to more irAEs, including potentially fatal ICI-pneumonitis, and development of these events is sporadic, unpredictable, and relatively uncommon per site, making systematic study difficult. Terminology used to define, diagnose, and describe radiologic findings has been inconsistent. Proposed mechanisms include increased T-cell activity against autoantigens, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced complement-mediated inflammation, yet the key biologic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Because patients with underlying rheumatologic or lung diseases have been underrepresented in trials, it is unknown if comorbid conditions increase risk, and how best to risk stratify using baseline physiologic, radiologic, and serologic evaluation is poorly understood and in need of research. Current recommendations for diagnostic evaluation lack clear evidence that they differentiate ICI-pneumonitis from infection; the role of physiologic testing (pulmonary function tests) remains undefined and should be incorporated in research studies, and the role and timing of bronchoscopy with BAL deserve further investigation. Management uncertainties include which asymptomatic radiographic changes warrant a change in management, the optimal timing, dose, and duration of steroids, and whether steroid dose and duration impact outcomes. For steroid-refractory disease, the role of steroid-sparing agents should be studied in clinical trials, and there is a major concern that steroid treatment may adversely impact the ICI antitumor response and increase infection risk.

### Androgens in women: androgen-mediated skin disease and patient evaluation [^26b0c977]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Androgens are produced throughout the body in steroid-producing organs, such as the adrenal glands and ovaries, and in other tissues, like the skin. Several androgens are found normally in women, including dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione. These androgens are essential in the development of several common cutaneous conditions in women, including acne, hirsutism, and female pattern hair loss (FPHL)-androgen-mediated cutaneous disorders (AMCDs). However, the role of androgens in the pathophysiology of these diseases is complicated and incompletely understood. In the first article in this Continuing Medical Education series, we discuss the role of the skin in androgen production and the impact of androgens on the skin in women. Specifically, we review the necessary but insufficient role that androgens play in the development of acne, hirsutism, and FPHL in women. Dermatologists face the challenge of differentiating physiologic from pathologic presentations of AMCDs in women. There are currently no dermatology guidelines outlining the indications for endocrinologic evaluation in women presenting with acne, hirsutism, or FPHL. We review the available evidence regarding when to consider an endocrinologic workup in women presenting with AMCDs, including the appropriate type and timing of testing.

Question 2: Which of the following is the LEAST appropriate for treating this condition?
A. Oral glucocorticoids
B. Oral contraceptives
C. Topical steroids
D. Isotretinoin
E. Liposuction-assisted curettage

Answers:
A. Oral glucocorticoids – Correct. Oral steroids are not typically indicated for this condition.
B. Oral contraceptives – Incorrect. Oral contraceptives have shown efficacy in women with apocrine miliaria/Fox-Fordyce disease.
C. Topical steroids – Incorrect. Midpotency topical steroids are effective, but the duration of therapy is limited owing to the risk of side effects, including striae formation and skin atrophy.
D. Isotretinoin – Incorrect. Case reports suggest that there has been some success with this oral retinoid.
E. Liposuction-assisted curettage – Incorrect. This has been reported as an effective treatment. Alternatively, microwave thermolysis (MiraDry, Miramar Labs Inc) may provide relief. In severe cases, surgical excision may be warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of vulvar skin disorders: ACOG practice bulletin, number 224 [^1d1b276a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Lichen planus treatment — initial therapy and monitoring emphasize realistic expectations, topical corticosteroids, and scheduled follow-up. The prognosis for spontaneous remission of vulvovaginal lichen planus is poor, and patients should be counseled that complete control of symptoms is not typical in patients with vulvovaginal lichen planus. Based on limited evidence and expert opinion, the recommended initial treatment for lichen planus is a high-potency topical corticosteroid ointment, with a common regimen of twice-daily use and subsequent tapering in frequency and potency as improvement occurs. Initial follow up at 2–3 months after initiation of therapy is recommended; stable disease can be evaluated annually by the primary care physician, whereas erosive disease requires long-term specialized follow-up. For disease resistant to topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors can be considered, and counseling and documentation should address the unknown long-term safety profile and the FDA black box warning about the potential risk of cancer associated with these agents.

### The role of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of lichen sclerosus [^b99e5949]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a propensity to affect the mucocutaneous anogenital area. Topical corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for this condition and constitute an effective therapeutic modality. However, in patients with corticosteroid-resistant disease, when long-term remission is not sustainable, or in those intolerant to these agents, topical calcineurin inhibitors may be considered. Studies have demonstrated their efficacy and tolerability; however, concerns remain with regard to their malignant potential with long-term use. As lichen sclerosus is a potentially precancerous dermatosis, topical calcineurin inhibitors should be used with caution in this disorder.

Introduction — clinical scope and physiology of androgen excess states that hirsutism affects 5–10% of reproductive-aged females and acne vulgaris affects as many as 90% of all adolescents. The diagnosis of hyperandrogenism can be based on clinical symptoms or measurement of serum androgens, and in females, androgens originate from three primary sources: the ovarian theca, the adrenal cortex, and within end organs by peripheral conversion. In healthy women, testosterone is largely bound by sex hormone binding globulin and albumin, leaving only approximately 1% freely circulating as bioactive "free testosterone", and varying expression of enzyme activity within the pilosebaceous unit leads to a lack of clear correlation between serum androgens and the presence or severity of acne and hirsutism.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and / or acne [^256d2136]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. Hirsutism is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones also known as androgens. It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles, and the secretory glands around the hair follicles, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 June 2003). The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched and drug companies contacted for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus: placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven trials were included in the review, eight trials were excluded. Two other trials are awaiting assessment. All included trials were small (no more than 41 participants) randomised and controlled. Only one trial studied acne as an outcome, the remainder were concerned with hirsutism. Two trials investigated spironolactone versus placebo; one trial was a dosage studies of spironolactone; one trial compared spironolactone with spironolactone in combination with dexamethasone; one trial used topical spironolactone for the treatment of acne, one trial compared three treatments; spironolactone, finasteride, cyproterone acetate. Major outcome measures include the following: subjective observations, Ferriman and Gallwey hair scores, hormonal and biochemical parameters, side effects, sebum production measurement.

Main Results

All sample populations were small and confidence intervals were wide. In the two trials that compared 100 mg of spironolactone with placebo significant differences were reported for subjective improvements in hair growth (OR 7.18, 95% CI 1.96 to 26.28), Ferriman-Galwey score (WMD 7.20, 95% CI -10.98 to -3.42)). The remaining comparisons were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant improvements in Ferriman-Galwey scores 12 months after the end of treatment in those women who received 100mg/day spironolactone compared to 12.5 mg/day cyproterone acetate (first 10 days of cycle) (WMD -1.18, 95% CI -2.1 to -0.26) and 5mg/day finasteride (WMD -2.34, 95% CI -3.23 to -1.45).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Six months treatment with 100 mg/day spironolactone compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant subjective improvement in hair growth and a decrease in Ferriman-Galwey scores. Spironolactone 100mg/day is superior to finasteride 5 mg/day and low dose cyproterone acetate 12.5 mg/day (first 10 days of cycle) up to 12 months after the end of treatment. The effectiveness of treatment for acne vulgaris cannot be determined due to the small sample populations involved in the trials. Its value in clinical practice is difficult to assess from currently available research.

### Effective prescribing in steroid allergy: controversies and cross-reactions [^2e7a49b7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids should be considered in all patients who do not respond to, or are made worse by, the use of topical steroids. The incidence of steroid allergy in such patients is reported as 9% to 22% in adult patients and in 25% of children. It can often go undiagnosed for a long time in patients with a long history of dermatologic conditions and steroid use. Although rare, both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to systemic corticosteroids with an incidence of 0.3%. Reported reactions range from localized eczematous eruptions to systemic reactions, anaphylaxis, and even death. Delayed type reactions to systemically administered steroids may present as a generalized dermatitis, an exanthematous eruption, or occasionally, with blistering or purpura. In this contribution, we clarify the issues surrounding the pathogenesis of steroid allergy, cover the importance of cross-reactions, and describe strategies for the investigation and management for patients with suspected steroid allergy.

### Diagnosis and management of vulvar skin disorders: ACOG practice bulletin, number 224 [^20c50b56]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Lichen sclerosus management after topical corticosteroid failure focuses on confirming the diagnosis (with biopsy if not previously obtained), evaluating adherence and comorbid contributors, and considering intralesional corticosteroids or second-line topical calcineurin inhibitors with safety counseling. If treatment with topical corticosteroids fails, the most important next step is to check that the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus is correct and, if not obtained previously, a biopsy should be performed; issues with treatment adherence should be ascertained and attention paid to urinary incontinence, superimposed infection, contact dermatitis, or lichen simplex chronicus. In poorly controlled or resistant disease, intralesional corticosteroid injections can be considered, with guidelines suggesting 10–20 mg of intralesional triamcinolone after a biopsy to exclude malignancy and noting there is no consensus on repeat dosing. For nonresponders to topical or intralesional corticosteroids or those at risk of skin atrophy, topical calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) can be considered; both remain second-line, and counseling should address unknown long-term safety and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box warning about potential cancer risk.

### Diagnosis and management of vulvar skin disorders: ACOG practice bulletin, number 224 [^210f3a14]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Consultation and referral — care coordination for refractory or extensive disease focuses on multidisciplinary support, specialist referral, and compounded therapies. Collaboration with multidisciplinary experts to address emotional support, sexual dysfunction, and the need for long-term treatment should be included for patients with poorly controlled disease. When improvement is not seen with initial therapy and other causes have been ruled out, referral to a specialist in the treatment of vulvar dermatoses is recommended. For more extensive vaginal disease, compounded high-dose (100 mg) hydrocortisone inserts may be prescribed by a trained specialist, and although several alternative therapies have been studied, the data supporting their use is limited.

### Does application of topical steroids for lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans) affect the rate of circumcision? A systematic review [^a6e9b818]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LS), with topical steroids reduces the rate of circumcision.

Methods

Two independent reviewers performed a literature search of studies reporting treatment of LS with topical steroids using EMBASE and MEDLINE database(s).

Inclusion Criteria

boys aged 0–18 years, clinical diagnosis of LS, treatment with topical steroids. Literature reviews, studies of phimosis without LS and adult patients were excluded. Data analysed for each paper included age, duration of treatment, length of follow up and outcome, notably circumcision or no surgery.

Results

The original search identified 26 titles. Application of exclusion criteria left 6 articles for inclusion in the study. Eighty nine patients with LS were treated with topical corticosteroids. Circumcision was avoided in 31/89 (35%; range 0–100%). Median patient age was 6.5 years (1 month-15 years). Median duration of treatment was 2 months (1–23 months); median follow-up 4 months (6 weeks-5 years).

Conclusions

Treatment of LS with topical steroids reportedly avoided circumcision in 35% of boys. Duration of medical therapy and patient follow up in analysed studies were, however, short. A prospective randomised trial would provide a definitive answer.

Type Of Study

Systematic review.

### Gray-brown macules on the face and neck [^fc2e5bec]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate first step in treatment?
A. Topical calcineurin inhibitor
B. Cessation of immunotherapy
C. High-potency topical corticosteroid
D. Q-switched laser
E. Topical hydroquinone

Answers:
A. Topical calcineurin inhibitor – Correct. LPP is often refractory to treatment; however, topical calcineurin inhibitors are typically the first line therapy given their antiinflammatory effect and potential for longer-term use on sun-exposed skin. Topical corticosteroids are often used in the management of cirAEs; however, this would be less optimal as a first step in treatment given LPP tends to affect the face and neck.
B. Cessation of immunotherapy – Incorrect. While dose reduction or cessation of immunotherapy may be indicated in the setting of severe cutaneous adverse events, mild toxicities can be managed with topical therapies.
C. High-potency topical corticosteroid – Incorrect. Although high-potency topical corticosteroids may be appropriate in some cases of LPP and/or lichenoid cirAEs, they would not be recommended for long-term use on the face and neck given the risk of atrophy and further dyspigmentation.
D. Q-switched laser – Incorrect. Q-switched laser has been shown mild to moderate efficacy in treating LPP but can be costly and time-consuming. Other treatment options should be explored prior to treating with Q-switched laser.
E. Topical hydroquinone – Incorrect. Topical hydroquinone may be used in the treatment of LPP, but it is most appropriate in combination with other treatment options such as a topical calcineurin inhibitor. In addition, hydroquinone when used incorrectly can lead to exogenous ochronosis and paradoxical worsening pigmentation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^aaef1391]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 3: Symptomatic relief of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — clinicians may recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of ABRS. This is an option based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneous populations, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measures with a balance of benefit and harm. The action profile urges promotion of analgesics, saline irrigation, and topical intranasal steroids and discourages interventions with questionable, unknown or unproven efficacy such as systemic steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and guaifenesin. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for topical nasal steroids, Grade B for saline irrigation and systemic steroids, and grade D for analgesics, decongestants, antihistamines (in non-atopic patients) and guaifenesin. Benefits include relief of facial pain with analgesics, a modest increase in symptom relief from topical nasal steroids (number needed to treat 11), and possible symptom relief from saline irrigations; risks include local and systemic adverse reactions and medication costs. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium.

Additional problems

Beyond the worrying link between ARDS and ICB biology, ICB delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic has three additional problems.

First, the risk of merely attending a hospital environment for therapy delivery. The nature of oncology outpatient clinics has had to change dramatically to minimise the transmission risks of busy waiting rooms and multiple healthcare worker interactions.

Second is the diagnostic dilemma posed by ICB toxicity. Significant pneumonitis is a relatively uncommon ICB side effect (Grade 3/4 in 1–2%), although is an important cause of ICB treatment-related mortality. However, the radiological features of ICB-related pneumonitis are varied and non-pathognomonic, with important differentials including infection and, in the current climate, SARS-CoV-2 infection. ICB-related pneumonitis might therefore be mistaken for COVID-19.

Third are the implications for the management of such pneumonitides, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The mainstay of therapy is high-dose steroids followed by further immunosuppressive agents, including anti-TNFs. The use of steroids has been controversial so far in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, with conflicting evidence. At present, the World Health Organization (WHO) advises against the administration of steroids to patients with suspected COVID-19, although there may be a role in critically unwell patients with ARDS, however, the evidence base for this is beyond the scope of this comment. The WHO has also recommended against the discontinuation of non-steroidal disease-modifying agents in gastroenterological, rheumatological and dermatological conditions. In conditions where steroids are clearly indicated they should continue to be administered.
