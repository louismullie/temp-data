## Question

Is it appropriate to taper him off metoprolol since he has a Watchman device that controls his atrial fibrillation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to taper metoprolol in a patient with atrial fibrillation who has a Watchman left-atrial-appendage closure device, and whether the Watchman "controls his AF". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the Watchman device actually does versus what it does not do. Then, I should verify the guideline-based indications for metoprolol in AF and how those relate to rhythm status and heart rate targets. Next, I need to check whether durable sinus rhythm has been achieved, review comorbidities that might still mandate a beta-blocker, and assess for adverse effects that could justify tapering. After that, I will examine alternative rate-control strategies or AV nodal ablation scenarios, consider post-implant antithrombotic plans, and finally synthesize a decision framework with a cautious, clinically monitored taper only when appropriate.

> Let me first confirm what the Watchman device is intended to do because I need to ensure there's no misconception here. The Watchman provides mechanical occlusion of the left atrial appendage to lower thromboembolic risk in nonvalvular AF; it does not restore sinus rhythm nor control ventricular rate, so saying the Watchman "controls his AF" would be inaccurate and potentially dangerous if it leads to stopping necessary rate control therapy [^111cgL6d] [^113MmFW3] [^116KDH5T].

> Now, I should verify the indication for metoprolol in this context. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is a first-line agent for rate control in AF, with nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as alternatives depending on ejection fraction and comorbidities, and its role is independent of stroke-prevention strategy because it addresses ventricular rate, not thromboembolism risk [^1111A18w] [^111Sdrky] [^113MGeaC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the patient's current rhythm status before discussing tapering. If the patient remains in persistent or permanent AF, continued rate control is indicated; if he is in stable, monitored sinus rhythm after rhythm-control strategies (e.g., ablation or antiarrhythmic therapy) and has no other indication for a beta-blocker, tapering may be reasonable with careful follow-up for recurrence and heart rate increases [^1111A18w] [^111noMow].

> I should confirm the heart rate targets and how guidelines frame ongoing rate-control therapy. For patients managed with rate control, a resting heart rate target less than about 100–110 bpm is generally acceptable, with stricter targets considered in heart failure or tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy; none of this is changed by Watchman implantation, because LAAC affects stroke prevention only, not rate or rhythm control needs [^113b9KYs] [^1177LmhS] [^1111A18w].

> Let me think about comorbidities that could independently justify metoprolol. In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, evidence-based beta-blockers are foundational therapy and often serve dual roles of prognostically beneficial therapy and AF rate control; however, wait, let me verify the nuance — meta-analyses suggest the mortality benefit is clear in HFrEF patients in sinus rhythm and is less certain in those with AF, but guideline-endorsed beta-blockers remain standard for HFrEF regardless, so I should be cautious about tapering if HFrEF is present [^113HVt32] [^111Zw67U] [^116TyYiK].

> Next, I should review potential harms and when a taper is justified. If there are adverse effects such as symptomatic bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, or bronchospasm, and there is no compelling indication for ongoing beta-blockade, a gradual taper with close monitoring is reasonable; given lenient rate control targets are acceptable for many patients, reducing dose to minimize side effects while maintaining adequate rate control can be a pragmatic, safer middle ground rather than abrupt discontinuation [^113TVsoi] [^113b9KYs] [^116TyYiK].

> I will now examine whether an alternative rate-control or rhythm-control strategy has been established, because that would change the calculus. If the patient has been transitioned to diltiazem or verapamil with good control, or underwent AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation, metoprolol can be tapered after confirming the new regimen is effective; I should double-check device strategy timing because pacemaker leads should be secured and functioning before ablation when that pathway is chosen [^114pjgxy] [^111CW5aX].

> But wait, what about the post-Watchman antithrombotic regimen — does that interact with this decision? Typically, after Watchman there is a period of anticoagulation then dual antiplatelet therapy, followed by single antiplatelet therapy if imaging at 45 days shows no significant peri-device leak or thrombus; none of these antithrombotic steps obviate the need for rate control, and metoprolol does not meaningfully interact with this post-implant pathway in a way that would mandate tapering [^116KDH5T] [^1112fr7X].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework, and I should be careful to align it with guideline principles. If AF persists, metoprolol should generally be continued for rate control; if durable sinus rhythm is documented and there is no other beta-blocker indication, tapering may be appropriate with surveillance for AF recurrence and heart rate drift; if HFrEF, CAD, or other compelling indications exist, continuation is usually preferred; if adverse effects are limiting, dose reduction or substitution is sensible, but abrupt cessation should be avoided to prevent rebound tachycardia or ischemia, and any taper should be paced and monitored with symptom and heart rate checks [^1111A18w] [^113b9KYs] [^113HVt32].

> Final clinical conclusion: It is generally not appropriate to taper metoprolol solely because a Watchman device has been placed, since Watchman reduces stroke risk without controlling AF rhythm or ventricular rate; metoprolol should be continued as long as AF persists or other indications exist, and tapering should be considered only when sinus rhythm is durably restored without other beta-blocker needs or when adverse effects necessitate reduction, with any taper performed gradually under close clinical monitoring [^111cgL6d] [^1111A18w] [^113b9KYs].

No, the Watchman device **does not control atrial fibrillation or its ventricular rate**; it only **reduces stroke risk** [^116KDH5T] by occluding the left atrial appendage [^111q83uK]. Metoprolol or another rate-control agent **is still needed** to prevent tachycardia, symptoms, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^111Sdrky] [^1111A18w]. Metoprolol can be weaned only if the patient is in stable sinus rhythm or has adequate rate control on an alternative agent, with close monitoring for rapid AF recurrence [^113b9KYs]. The Watchman device **does not replace the need for rate control therapy** [^111cgL6d].

---

## Role of the watchman device in atrial fibrillation management

The Watchman device is a percutaneously implanted left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) device designed to **reduce the risk of thromboembolic stroke** [^111cgL6d] [^116KDH5T] in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who have contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation therapy [^111q83uK]. The device works by occluding the left atrial appendage, thereby preventing thrombus formation and subsequent embolization [^113MmFW3]. However, the Watchman device **does not address the underlying arrhythmia or its hemodynamic consequences**. Its primary function is **stroke prevention**, **not rhythm or rate control** [^1111A18w].

---

## Role of metoprolol in atrial fibrillation management

Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly prescribed for **rate control** in patients with AF [^1111A18w]. It works by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, thereby reducing ventricular rate and preventing tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS]. Metoprolol is particularly beneficial in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure, or other cardiovascular comorbidities [^113HVt32].

---

## Clinical guidelines regarding beta-blocker therapy in AF patients with watchman devices

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized patient assessment** when considering beta-blocker discontinuation in patients with AF and Watchman devices [^111noMow]. The decision to wean a patient off metoprolol should be based on several factors, including:

- **Presence of sinus rhythm**: If the patient has achieved and maintained sinus rhythm, discontinuation of metoprolol may be considered [^112dUWEh].

- **Adequate rate control**: If the patient remains in AF but has adequate rate control (resting heart rate < 100–110 bpm) without significant symptoms, discontinuation may be considered [^113b9KYs] [^113TVsoi].

- **Alternative rate control agents**: If the patient cannot tolerate metoprolol due to side effects or contraindications, alternative rate control agents such as nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) may be considered [^1111A18w] [^116zC4Vj].

## Risks and benefits of discontinuing metoprolol in AF patients with watchman devices

### Benefits

Potential benefits of discontinuing metoprolol include **reduced side effects** — such as fatigue, bradycardia, hypotension, and sexual dysfunction — and **improved quality of life** in patients with significant adverse effects [^112WUjJ8].

---

### Risks

Discontinuing metoprolol may lead to **recurrence of rapid atrial fibrillation** with palpitations, dizziness, and fatigue. Uncontrolled rapid AF may precipitate **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy**, a potentially reversible form of heart failure. Patients may experience increased symptom burden and reduced functional capacity if AF recurs or becomes uncontrolled [^1177LmhS].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting discontinuation of metoprolol in AF patients with watchman devices

There is **limited clinical evidence** specifically on discontinuing metoprolol in patients with AF and Watchman devices. Nonetheless, general AF management principles allow consideration of beta-blocker discontinuation in patients who have achieved and maintained sinus rhythm or have adequate rate control without significant symptoms. Additionally, an American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS) study emphasizes the importance of **individualized patient assessment** and shared decision-making when considering discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy in AF patients [^1111A18w] [^113XWm45].

---

## Alternative medications and strategies for rate control in AF patients with watchman devices

If metoprolol is discontinued, alternative medications and strategies for rate control include:

- **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**: Diltiazem or verapamil may be considered for rate control in patients without significant left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF > 40%) [^1111A18w] [^113MGeaC].

- **Digoxin**: May be considered in patients with heart failure or those who cannot tolerate beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers [^116zC4Vj].

- **Catheter ablation**: May be considered in patients with symptomatic AF refractory to medical therapy [^111noMow].

- **AV nodal ablation with pacemaker implantation**: May be considered in patients with refractory AF and uncontrolled ventricular rates despite maximal medical therapy [^114pjgxy] [^111CW5aX].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up protocols after discontinuing metoprolol

If metoprolol is discontinued, careful monitoring and follow-up are essential to detect rapid AF recurrence or other complications. Recommended monitoring protocols include:

- **Regular ECG monitoring**: Regular ECGs or Holter monitoring to detect recurrence of rapid AF [^111bjw4d].

- **Symptom assessment**: Regular assessment of symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath [^111noMow].

- **Echocardiography**: Periodic echocardiography to assess left ventricular function and detect tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS].

- **Patient education**: Educating patients about symptoms of rapid AF recurrence and when to seek medical attention [^1111A18w].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, the Watchman device **does not control atrial fibrillation** [^111q83uK] or its ventricular rate; it only reduces the risk of stroke by occluding the left atrial appendage [^116KDH5T]. Metoprolol or another rate-control agent **is still needed** to prevent tachycardia, symptoms, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^111Sdrky]. Metoprolol can be weaned only if the patient is in stable sinus rhythm or has adequate rate control on an alternative agent, with close monitoring for recurrence of rapid AF [^113b9KYs]. The Watchman device does not replace the need for rate control therapy [^1111A18w].

Catheter-based left atrial appendage closure vs. oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists

Two studies examined the efficacy and safety of LAAC with the first-generation Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) compared with OAC with warfarin. The randomized controlled PROTECT-AF trial (NCT00129545) fulfilled the primary efficacy endpoint but failed the primary safety endpoint due to an excess in peri-procedural adverse events. Because of concern over peri-procedural complications, concerns about the patients' risk factor profiles, poor adherence to mandated anticoagulation, and possible confounding by antiplatelet therapy, a second study was mandated by the FDA.

The subsequent PREVAIL trial (NCT01182441) failed to reach the primary efficacy endpoint due to low event rates but fulfilled late efficacy and safety requirements. However, there was a signal of more ischemic strokes in the LAAC group in PREVAIL that was more pronounced at later follow-up. A patient-level meta-analysis of both studies over an observation period of 5 years showed non-inferiority for the combined primary efficacy endpoint, which included stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death. Rates of stroke and systemic embolism were comparable in both treatment groups (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60–1.54; P = 0.87). An interesting observation was a reduction in fatal and severe stroke post-LAAC (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21–0.94; P = 0.034), although based on a small number of events.

Cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–0.49; P = 0.027) and overall mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; P = 0.035) were lower following catheter-based LAAC compared to oral anticoagulation.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rhythm control, pharmacological cardioversion, and the pill-in-the-pocket approach, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the "pill-in-the-pocket" method. This involves administering a single oral dose of flecainide or propafenone alongside a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent for pharmacological cardioversion. This approach should be implemented if it has been previously tested in a monitored setting for patients experiencing recurrent atrial fibrillation outside the hospital.

The study adhered to international rules for scientific studies, specifically the Helsinki principles, with local ethics committee approval in all participating centers. All subjects provided informed consent prior to the procedure.

EWOLUTION was designed as a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized cohort study aiming to include over 1,000 patients. Subjects were recruited from the general population of clinical sites at each participating physician's discretion if they were eligible to receive the WATCHMAN device according to the appropriate local and international guidelines and were of legal age to provide informed consent. Implanting physicians and centers with varying levels of past experience with the device participated in the registry. All implanting physicians underwent a thorough training and certification program to ensure an appropriate level of expertise to minimize patient risk.

Follow-up for subjects was based on each institution's standard practice, generally including a clinical visit between 1 and 3 months post-procedure, LAA imaging to assess residual flow around the device, and annual follow-up visits. Reporting on adverse events in this study is based on peri-procedural monitoring until 30 days of follow-up post-procedure. The relatedness of each adverse event to the device/procedure was determined by the participating center. Events and relevant source documents were additionally reviewed by the Sponsor Medical Safety Group (MSG), which includes physicians with expertise in electrophysiology.

### Cardioprotection with beta-blockers: Myths, facts and Pascal's wager [^112WUjJ8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers were documented to reduce the reinfarction rate more than three decades ago and subsequently touted as being cardioprotective for a broad spectrum of cardiovascular indications such as hypertension, diabetes, angina, atrial fibrillation, as well as perioperatively in patients undergoing surgery. However, despite lowering blood pressure, beta-blockers have never been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated hypertension. Also, beta-blockers do not prevent heart failure in hypertension any better than any other antihypertensive drug class. Beta-blockers have been shown to increase the risk of new-onset diabetes. When compared with nondiuretic antihypertensive drugs, beta-blockers increase all-cause mortality by 8% and stroke by 30% in patients with new-onset diabetes.

Beta-blockers are useful for rate control in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation but do not help restore sinus rhythm or have antifibrillatory effects in the atria. They provide symptomatic relief in patients with chronic stable angina but do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Adverse effects of beta-blockers are common, including fatigue, dizziness, depression, and sexual dysfunction. However, beta-blockers remain a cornerstone in the management of patients having suffered a myocardial infarction and for patients with heart failure. Thus, recent evidence argues against the universal cardioprotective properties of beta-blockers but attests to their usefulness for specific cardiovascular indications.

### Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device [^112J2Qmg]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

Our implantation success rate of 96.2% is comparable to previous studies (Figure 4). Our 7-day procedure/device-related complication rate was 4.3%, which is lower than the PROTECT-AF study at 8.7% and compared favorably to subsequent WATCHMAN studies (Figure 5). In our study, 38% of patients had same-day discharge (SDD), while 62% had non-SDD. The trend of SDD increased significantly from 0% in the first year to 53.3% in the final year of the study, reflecting our center's and operators' experience in postprocedural care and improved comfort level for SDD.

### Overview of the Food and Drug Administration circulatory system devices panel meetings on WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure therapy [^113MmFW3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) technology is a percutaneously delivered permanent cardiac implant placed in the LAA. This device is designed to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in warfarin-eligible patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

The first circulatory system device panel reviewed the Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study in 2009, and a "not approvable" letter was issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on safety concerns. Subsequently, the FDA, in collaboration with the sponsor, designed a new Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAAC Device in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long-Term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL) trial to address the earlier study limitations.

In December 2013, a second panel was convened to review the results of PREVAIL and additional long-term follow-up data from PROTECT AF. The second panel voted favorably 13 to 1 that the benefits of the WATCHMAN LAAC therapy outweigh the risks for use in patients who meet the criteria specified in the proposed indication.

- **Update on findings**: During the premarket approval review, updated data from the PREVAIL study revealed more ischemic strokes in the WATCHMAN group, corresponding to a total of 13 ischemic strokes in this group versus 1 in the control group. As a result of these strokes, the FDA called for a third panel to assess the benefit-risk profile of the WATCHMAN device.

This summary aims to describe the discussions and recommendations made during the panel meetings.

### Rationale and design of a randomized study comparing the Watchman FLX device to DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111cgL6d]. American Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (LAAC) was developed as a nonpharmacologic alternative to oral anticoagulants (OACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at an increased risk for stroke or systemic embolism. The Watchman device permanently seals off the LAA to prevent thrombi from escaping into the circulation. Previous randomized trials have established the safety and efficacy of LAAC compared to warfarin. However, direct OACs (DOACs) have become the preferred pharmacologic strategy for stroke prevention in patients with AF, and there is limited data comparing Watchman FLX to DOACs in a broad AF patient population. CHAMPION-AF is designed to prospectively determine whether LAAC with Watchman FLX is a reasonable first-line alternative to DOACs in patients with AF who are indicated for OAC therapy.

- **Study design**: A total of 3,000 patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 (men) or ≥ 3 (women) were randomized to Watchman FLX or DOAC in a 1:1 allocation at 142 global clinical sites. Patients in the device arm were to be treated with DOAC and aspirin, DOAC alone, or DAPT for at least 3 months post-implant followed by aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor for 1 year. Control patients were required to take an approved DOAC for the duration of the trial. Clinical follow-up visits are scheduled at 3 and 12 months, and then annually through 5 years; LAA imaging is required at 4 months in the device group. Two primary endpoints will be evaluated at 3 years: (1) composite of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic), cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism.

### Commentary: Watch out for WATCHMAN device failures [^112sHUS7]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Low credibility.

In three patients, the device was explanted and the left atrial appendage (LAA) was excluded with either suture or the AtriClip (AtriCure Inc, Mason, Ohio). In one patient, the device remained, and the LAA was excluded with the AtriClip. In another patient, the device was excluded with a pericardial patch. LAA occlusion was 100% successful — there was no flow or residual stump of the LAA; all patients underwent a maze procedure at the time of operation.

Several questions arise from this case series. First, why did three of these patients require valve replacements? Did the WATCHMAN device cause these valve pathologies, and if not, shouldn't these patients have been referred for surgical valve treatment and maze as the initial treatment? If the valve pathologies were caused by the device, it would be interesting to see on echocardiography how the device caused MR or aortic valve disease; there are case reports in the literature of MR and aortic stenosis caused by the WATCHMAN device.

Second, while the immediate postoperative echocardiography findings are promising, we know that most failures occur late. This series would be strengthened by long-term imaging confirmation of LAA occlusion. Third, two of the patients remained on anticoagulation for six months; this seems unusual since both of the patients had preoperative bleeding complications. If the anticoagulation is for prevention of thromboembolism after bioprosthetic valve replacement, then why was one of the patients on rivaroxaban, which is not the recommended anticoagulant, and both were anticoagulated for six months, which is on the lower recommended duration.

### Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device [^114KZfMr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a prevalence of 1% to 2% in the adult population. The majority of AF patients receive oral anticoagulation (OAC) to reduce the risk of stroke. Previous studies showed that approximately 13% of AF patients have a contraindication to OAC, and 2% have an absolute contraindication, most frequently due to a history of intracranial hemorrhage. Percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (LAAC) has emerged as a feasible option for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF.

- **Procedure-related complications**: The rate of procedure-related complications with the WATCHMAN device at 7 days was 8.7% and 4.2% in the PROTECT-AF (WATCHMAN left atrial appendage system for embolic protection in patients with atrial fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA closure device in patients with atrial fibrillation versus long term warfarin therapy) trials, respectively. However, the more recent EWOLUTION study (Evaluating real-world clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients receiving the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure technology) has shown a considerably lower 7-day procedure-related complication rate (2.7%). The complication rate is not negligible but improves with higher annual hospital volume and operator experience. The real-world in-hospital adverse event rate is low (2.2%), as reported in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry LAA Occlusion Registry.

- **Current practice**: In contemporary practice, patients are hospitalized overnight after LAAC and typically discharged the following day. Currently, there are limited data on same-day discharge (SDD) for LAAC.

NOAC therapy has become the standard for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Yet, some patients suffer extracranial bleeding events or have other reasons to seek non-pharmacologic stroke protection. LAA occlusion with the WATCHMAN device has been proven safe and effective for such patients and is now recommended in guidelines for this patient group; other devices also seek approval.

### Amplatzer amulet left atrial appendage occluder versus Watchman device for stroke prophylaxis (Amulet IDE): A randomized, controlled trial [^116KDH5T]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are at a 3- to 5-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke attributable to the stagnation of blood flow in the left atrial appendage (LAA), which promotes local thrombus formation. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is effective in preventing thromboembolic events; however, its use is limited by poor adherence, the necessity of long-term treatment, side effects including bleeding, and drug interactions. Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) can prevent thrombus embolization.

In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved the single-seal mechanism Watchman device for LAA occlusion, which requires six weeks of postprocedural anticoagulation. LAAO with a single-seal mechanism may be incomplete due to the complex and variable anatomy of the LAA. A dual-seal device with an outer disc may overcome the limitations of anatomic heterogeneity, provide an improved seal of the LAA ostium, and reduce the risk of leak.

Long-term follow-up of patients in the PROTECT-AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trials demonstrated that LAAO reduced the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, disabling/fatal stroke, and death, but not ischemic stroke, compared with warfarin through five years. Although there are observational studies suggesting comparable implant success, procedural outcomes, and safety events, no randomized multicenter trial has compared different devices.

### Antiarrhythmics for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation [^111BE3yT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia, often recurring after the restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been widely used to prevent recurrence. This review is an update of previous versions published in 2006, 2012, and 2015.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of long-term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs on death, stroke, drug adverse effects, and recurrence of atrial fibrillation in people who had recovered sinus rhythm after having atrial fibrillation.

- **Search methods**: We updated the searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in January 2019, and ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP in February 2019. We checked the reference lists of retrieved articles, recent reviews, and meta-analyses.

- **Selection criteria**: Two authors independently selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antiarrhythmic drug with a control (no treatment, placebo, or drugs for rate control) or with another antiarrhythmic drug in adults who had atrial fibrillation and in whom sinus rhythm was restored, spontaneously or by any intervention. We excluded postoperative atrial fibrillation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We pooled studies, if appropriate, using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All results were calculated at one year of follow-up or the nearest time point.

- **Main results**: This update included one new study (100 participants) and excluded one previously included study because of double publication. Finally, we included 59 studies.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of sotalol for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Proper dose selection should be based on kidney function, with close monitoring of the QT interval, heart rate, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, as well as kidney function. This applies to patients with atrial fibrillation without significant baseline QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or bradycardia.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: An umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^116TyYiK]. BMC Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Beta-blockers are widely used for many cardiovascular conditions; however, their efficacy in contemporary clinical practice remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospectively designed umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the evidence of beta-blockers in the contemporary management of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), patients undergoing surgery, or hypertension (registration: PROSPERO CRD42016038375). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception until December 2018. Outcomes were analyzed as beta-blockers versus control for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), incident HF, or stroke. Two independent investigators abstracted the data, assessed the quality of the evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence.

- **Results**: We identified 98 meta-analyses, including 284 unique RCTs and 1,617,523 patient-years of follow-up. In CAD, 12 meta-analyses (93 RCTs, 103,481 patients) showed that beta-blockers reduced mortality in analyses before routine reperfusion, but there was a lack of benefit in contemporary studies where ≥ 50% of patients received thrombolytics or intervention. Beta-blockers reduced incident MI at the expense of increased HF. In HF with reduced ejection fraction, 34 meta-analyses (66 RCTs, 35,383 patients) demonstrated a reduction in mortality and HF hospitalization with beta-blockers in sinus rhythm, but not in atrial fibrillation. In patients undergoing surgery, 23 meta-analyses (89 RCTs, 19,211 patients) showed no effect of beta-blockers on mortality.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with CKD, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) or an evidence-based dose of apixaban for oral anticoagulation. This is to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF who are at an elevated risk for stroke and have end-stage CKD (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis.

### Potential applicability and utilization of left atrial appendage occlusion devices in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111b4qcz]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The WATCHMAN left atrial appendage occluder device (Atritech, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) is currently being tested in a Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial, the PROTECT AF trial, for patients diagnosed with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rigorous screening and study design have resulted in the exclusion of a large number of patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential utility of this device among those eligible but excluded from the trial criteria and explore the reasons for exclusion.

- **Methods**: Screening logs from the respective sites participating in the PROTECT AF trial were collected and analyzed for potential utilization outside of a research trial. Only 31 patients were enrolled in the research trial from the screening of a total of 1,798 patients.

- **Results**: Information from the excluded patients was examined, and it was determined that 79% of these patients would be eligible for the device outside the research trial. Twenty-one percent of patients were unable to receive the device due to long-term warfarin need, contraindications to warfarin, unsuitable anatomy as determined by echocardiography, or the inability to take short-term aspirin and clopidogrel for protocol requirements.

- **Conclusions**: Should a device like the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage occluder be approved, approximately 79% of all patients with atrial fibrillation would be eligible for device placement.

### Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device [^1179soyG]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

A retrospective single-center study conducted in the United Kingdom reported same-day discharge (SDD) in 66% of patients after left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) with acceptable in-hospital adverse event rates. In that study, 50.4% of patients had LAAC with the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, 41% with the Amulet Occluder, and 2.5% with the WATCHMAN device. However, the study did not report the clinical outcomes during follow-up post-discharge.

Patients in that study were discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy for 4 weeks, followed by a single antiplatelet for at least 6 months, which aligns with European recommendations for patients not suitable for oral anticoagulation (OAC). In North America, patients are typically maintained on OAC and aspirin for 45 days, then transitioned to dual antiplatelet therapy for 6 months if the 45-day transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) shows an absence of peri-device flow greater than 5 mm or device-related thrombus. This practice is consistent with the study protocol of previous trials, where warfarin was used exclusively. Direct OACs may be a preferable alternative to warfarin for short-term anticoagulation.

In our study, 77% of patients were…

### The clinical impact of incomplete left atrial appendage closure with the Watchman device in patients with atrial fibrillation: a PROTECT AF (percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage versus warfarin therapy for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation) substudy [^1172nbqq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and clinical impact of incomplete left atrial appendage (LAA) sealing and consequent peri-device residual blood flow in patients undergoing percutaneous LAA closure with the Watchman device (Atritech, Inc, Plymouth, Minnesota).

During percutaneous LAA closure for stroke prophylaxis, the geometric variability of the LAA ostium may result in an incomplete seal of the LAA. This could enhance thrombus formation and embolization of thrombi around the device into the circulation; however, the relatively small size of these leaks may preclude clinically relevant embolizations.

Patients randomly assigned to device implantation in the PROTECT AF (percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage versus warfarin therapy for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation) trial were analyzed. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed at 45 days, 6 months, and 12 months. Per the study protocol, patients discontinued warfarin therapy if the 45-day transesophageal echocardiogram revealed either minimal or no peri-device flow (jet ≤ 5 mm width). The impact of peri-device flow severity, defined as minor, moderate, or major (3 mm, respectively), on the composite primary efficacy endpoint (stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death) is expressed as hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

Transesophageal echocardiography follow-up revealed that 32.0% of implanted patients had at least some degree of peri-device residual blood flow.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) and pre-excitation syndromes, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend against the use of pharmacological agents that block atrioventricular nodal conduction (such as verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, or β-blockers) in patients with atrial fibrillation who also have anterograde accessory pathway conduction, known as pre-excited atrial fibrillation, because of the risk of precipitating ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamic deterioration.

### Left atrial appendage closure device implantation in patients with prior intracranial hemorrhage [^1132AwjN]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

The Watchman device (Boston Scientific), used for left atrial appendage closure (LAAC), was approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and an appropriate rationale to avoid long-term oral anticoagulation. Patients with AF and prior intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) were excluded from clinical trials because of perceived risks of perioperative anticoagulation.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to study the efficacy and safety of LAAC using the Watchman in patients with AF and prior ICH.

- **Methods**: In a multidisciplinary AF/stroke prevention clinic, 38 consecutive patients with AF and prior ICH underwent Watchman implantation. Patients were enrolled in a prospectively maintained data registry.

- **Results**: Patients' mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 5.0 ± 1.3, and HAS-BLED score was 4.2 ± 1.0. Prior ICH events were categorized as intraparenchymal (60%), subdural (24%), or subarachnoid bleeds (16%). The median event-to-implantation time was 637 days (minimum 60). The Watchman device was implanted in all patients with no procedural complications. All patients completed 45 days of anticoagulation with warfarin (55%), apixaban (37%), or dabigatran (8%). Transesophageal echocardiograms at 45 days showed no peridevice leak, and one patient had a small filamentous echodensity on the device that resolved with anticoagulation. While undergoing anticoagulation, none of the patients developed reICH. Minor bleeding occurred in one patient (trauma-related lower extremity hematoma at 19 days postimplantation). At 13.4 months (quartiles 8–19) of follow-up, there were no strokes or ICH.

**Rate control in heart failure**: Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with heart failure (rate control), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering a stricter rate control strategy. This involves targeting a heart rate of less than 80 bpm at rest and less than 110 bpm during moderate exercise in patients with suspected AF-induced cardiomyopathy or refractory heart failure symptoms undergoing pharmacological rate control therapy for atrial fibrillation.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: A network meta-analysis [^116GCgHa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The Watchman device is the most recent addition to the "antiembolic armamentarium". Indirect unadjusted pair-wise estimates obtained for the Watchman device in our study are consistent with a recent network meta-analysis. We showed that the Watchman device is significantly more effective than placebo/control, but there was no evidence to prove that the Watchman device is more effective than aspirin.

The fact that, after adjustment for randomized controlled trial (RCT) population characteristics, the effect of the Watchman device did not differ from any other comparator (including placebo/control) is likely an indicator of an insufficient statistical power of the knowledge base. Importantly, the Watchman device was ranked as the best life-saving antiembolic intervention. Moreover, simultaneous clustered ranking for two of the most important outcomes (primary efficacy and all-cause mortality) included the Watchman device together with four non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in the cluster of most effective and safe interventions.

Clearly, further development of left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion devices and techniques is needed. The EWOLUTION registry recently showed that the rate of periprocedural strokes and bleedings could be further decreased. Future RCTs of LAA occlusion devices are needed to prove the effectiveness of the LAA occlusion approach given that it remains unclear whether LAA is a mechanistically essential structure for stroke development in atrial fibrillation (AF).

### Left atrial appendage occlusion with Watchman device after incomplete surgical ligation [^115NgLq5]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the major source of cardiac emboli in patients with NVAF. Anticoagulation (AC) is the standard of care for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF); however, many patients are intolerant of AC. Surgical exclusion of the LAA may result in incomplete closure and is associated with an increased risk of embolism.

We report a case of a woman in her 50s with a history of persistent AF, mitral valve prolapse status post repair with surgical LAA exclusion, and multifocal haemorrhagic stroke, who presented for elective LAA closure. She successfully underwent a Watchman placement. This case demonstrates that a percutaneous approach for occlusion of the LAA, when surgical exclusion is incomplete, may be feasible with appropriate planning. Clinical outcome data for this patient group are needed.

### Left atrial appendage occlusion for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^1112fr7X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Because of the safety concerns from the Watchman trials, the US FDA mandated the continued access registries CAP (Continued Access to PROTECT AF) and CAP2 (Continued Access to PREVAIL). Both are US FDA investigational devices exemption registries designed to gain further safety and efficacy data on the Watchman device in both trials. The registries have the same inclusion and exclusion criteria and treatment protocol as PROTECT AF and PREVAIL.

The CAP registry included 566 patients with an average follow-up of 50.1 months, whereas CAP2 included 578 patients with an average of 50.3 months. Both demonstrated similar procedural success rates (94%). The primary endpoint (composite of stroke, systemic embolism, cardiovascular/unexplained death, and safety) occurred at a rate of 3.05 per 100 patient-years in CAP, and 4.80 per 100 patient-years in CAP2. Total stroke rates were significantly lower in both registries (CAP, 78% reduction; CAP2, 69% reduction). Both registries contain the largest follow-up data of patients with the Watchman device. They reaffirm the safety and effective therapy of LAAO for patients with nonvalvular AF.

A rigid anticoagulation protocol (VKA for 45 days, then DAPT for 6 months, and then lifelong aspirin) was part of the trial design in PROTECT AF and PREVAIL. Patients with contraindication to warfarin were excluded in these trials. However, in real-world populations, many patients cannot tolerate any anticoagulation because of bleeding. After LAAO, these patients end up using only DAPT, single antiplatelet therapy, or nothing at all.

### Early Canadian multicenter experience with WATCHMAN for percutaneous left atrial appendage closure [^114pNC2h]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

There are limited data with WATCHMAN (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA, USA) for left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and contraindications to anticoagulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of WATCHMAN in our early Canadian experience.

- **Methods**: We report our pooled consecutive series of patients who underwent WATCHMAN implantation at four major Canadian centers. Indications for LAA closure were CHADS2 ≥ 1 or CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2, and contraindication/intolerance to or failure on anticoagulation. Follow-up imaging was typically performed 1–6 months postprocedure.

- **Results**: One hundred and six patients underwent LAA closure with WATCHMAN from May 2013 to October 2015. The mean age was 74.8 ± 7.7 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.8 ± 1.2, CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.3 ± 1.5, and HAS-BLED score was 3.2 ± 1.2. Permanent AF was present in 67.9% of patients and paroxysmal AF in 32.1%. Indications for LAA closure were prior bleeding (89.6%: 87 major bleeding and 8 minor bleeding), 9.4% were deemed high risk for bleeding, and 0.9% with recurrent strokes on warfarin. Procedural success was 97.2% (103 of 106), with one device embolization (snared percutaneously), one implant failure due to inadequate LAA depth, and one cardiac perforation requiring surgical repair before WATCHMAN implantation. The composite major safety event rate was 1.9% (1 death and 1 device embolization). The mean hospital stay was 1.8 ± 4.7 days. Antithrombotic therapy postimplant included dual antiplatelet therapy in 76 of 103 patients.

### Contemporary procedural trends of Watchman percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion in the United States [^116jFvpo]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine trends in real-world utilization and in-hospital adverse events associated with Watchman implantation since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015.

The risk of embolic stroke caused by atrial fibrillation is reduced by oral anticoagulants; however, not all patients can tolerate long-term anticoagulation. Left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device has emerged as an alternative therapy.

This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the National Inpatient Sample for the calendar years 2015–2017. The outcomes assessed included associated complications, in-hospital mortality, and resource utilization trends after Watchman implantation. Trends were analyzed using analysis of variance, and multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of mortality.

A total of 17,700 patients underwent Watchman implantation during the study period. There was a significant increase in the number of Watchman procedures performed over the study years, rising from 1,195 in 2015 to 11,165 devices in 2017 (p < 0.01). A significant decline in the rate of complications was noted, from 26.4% in 2015 to 7.9% in 2017 (p < 0.01), as well as in inpatient mortality, which decreased from 1.3% in 2015 to 0.1% in 2017 (p < 0.01). Predictors of in-hospital mortality included a higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (odds ratio [OR]: 2.61 per 1-point increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.91–3.57), chronic blood loss anemia (OR: 3.63, 95% CI: 1.37–9.61), and coagulopathy (OR: 4.90, 95% CI: 2.32–10.35).

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically in relation to rhythm control, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation for the following purposes:

- **Improve symptoms of AF**: Initiate rhythm control to alleviate symptoms associated with atrial fibrillation.

- **Enhance symptoms and outcomes in HF and ischemia**: Initiate rhythm control to improve symptoms, mortality, and hospitalization outcomes for heart failure and ischemia in patients with heart failure.

- **Reduce the risk of AF progression**: Employ rhythm control to minimize the progression of atrial fibrillation.

- **Decrease hospitalizations, strokes, and mortality**: Implement rhythm control to lower the risk of these events in patients with a recent atrial fibrillation diagnosis.

- **Mitigate the risk of dementia and cardiac structural issues**: Utilize rhythm control to reduce the likelihood of developing dementia or worsening cardiac structural abnormalities.

### The assessment of the Watchman device in patients unsuitable for oral anticoagulation (ASAP-TOO) trial [^112q1wHX]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce stroke risks in individuals with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, they are underused due to absolute or relative contraindications arising from the real or perceived risk of bleeding. Although left atrial appendage closure is increasingly performed in OAC-ineligible patients, it has not been extensively studied in a randomized controlled trial.

- **Study objectives**: The ASAP-TOO study is designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman left atrial appendage closure device in patients with nonvalvular AF deemed ineligible for OAC. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the time to the first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety endpoint includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device/procedural-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention.

- **Study design**: This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2 and deemed unsuitable for OAC by two study physicians will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to Watchman versus control. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy at the discretion of the study physician. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled from up to 100 global investigational sites. Both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months through 60 months.

This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the Watchman device in this patient population.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^114uCCYB]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are widely used for many cardiovascular conditions; however, their efficacy in contemporary clinical practice remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospectively designed, umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the evidence of beta-blockers in the contemporary management of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), patients undergoing surgery, or hypertension (registration: PROSPERO CRD42016038375). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception until December 2018. Outcomes were analyzed as beta-blockers versus control for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), incident HF, or stroke. Two independent investigators abstracted the data, assessed the quality of the evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence.

- **Results**: We identified 98 meta-analyses, including 284 unique RCTs and 1,617,523 patient-years of follow-up. In CAD, 12 meta-analyses (93 RCTs, 103,481 patients) showed that beta-blockers reduced mortality in analyses before routine reperfusion, but there was a lack of benefit in contemporary studies where ≥ 50% of patients received thrombolytics or intervention. Beta-blockers reduced incident MI at the expense of increased HF. In HF with reduced ejection fraction, 34 meta-analyses (66 RCTs, 35,383 patients) demonstrated a reduction in mortality and HF hospitalization with beta-blockers in sinus rhythm but not in atrial fibrillation. In patients undergoing surgery, 23 meta-analyses (89 RCTs, 19,211 patients) showed no effect of beta-blockers on mortality.

This study also had the following limitations:

- **Study-level meta-analysis**: The original data of all included studies was not obtained, making the influence of the baseline data on the results unknown.
- **Study duration and operator experience**: The duration of the included studies was long, and the experience of the operators may have influenced the results.
- **Antithrombotic strategies**: These varied across the included studies, and their influence on the results could not be analyzed.
- **Follow-up time**: Ranged from 3 to 48 months, which can affect the efficacy and safety endpoints.

### Indications for left atrial appendage occlusion in the United States and associated in-hospital outcomes: Results from the NCDR LAAO registry [^1132Vy9b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2022). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration approved left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device for patients who are at increased stroke risk and are suitable for oral anticoagulation but have an appropriate reason to seek a nondrug alternative. These broad criteria raise the question of their interpretation in clinical practice. There is a lack of studies comprehensively evaluating the indications for Watchman implantation among a large series of patients from contemporary, real-world practice in the United States.

- **Methods**: We used the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry to identify Watchman procedures performed between 2016 and 2018. We assessed procedural indications for Watchman implantation in the United States and evaluated the association between procedural indications and in-hospital adverse events.

- **Results**: A total of 38,314 procedures were included. The mean patient age was 76.1 ± 8.1 years, and 58.9% were men. The mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 4.8 ± 1.5, whereas the mean hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol (HAS-BLED) score was 3.0 ± 1.1. Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack was reported in 40.2%, and prior bleeding in 70.1%, with gastrointestinal bleeding being most common (41.9%). The most common site-reported procedural indications for Watchman implantation were increased thromboembolic risk (64.8%) and history of major bleed (64.3%), followed by high fall risk (35.5%). Most (71.9%) had initial hospital stays without complications, indicating procedures were generally well-tolerated.

### Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation [^111yoNhZ]. Progress in cardiovascular diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration, and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, such as changing the antiarrhythmic drug or initiating or redoing atrial fibrillation ablation.

A rhythm control strategy should include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities, including hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes. If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Digoxin may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate of less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with postoperative AF, rate and rhythm control, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend administering β-blockers to achieve rate control for AF after cardiac surgery unless contraindicated or ineffective. Administer nondihydropyridine CCBs if β-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: An umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^111WA1MM]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although beta-blockers are widely used in routine clinical practice, this analysis indicates that their overall clinical effect strongly depends on the clinical situation. In patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who are in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers show a clear benefit in terms of mortality reduction and lower rates of hospitalization. However, beta-blockers show neutral effects for many other clinical situations in the modern era, and in some cases, they may cause harm.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^113iTqJz]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

For the medical management of atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning anticoagulant therapy and pericardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend administering therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3–6 weeks. This should be followed by repeat imaging before cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation if cardioversion is deferred due to the detection of a left atrial appendage thrombus on pre-cardioversion imaging.

### Betapace AF [^112yu1in]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

It cannot be determined, however, in the absence of a controlled comparison of Betapace versus no pharmacologic treatment (for example, in patients with implanted defibrillators), whether Betapace response causes improved survival or identifies a population with a good prognosis. Betapace has not been shown to enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

- **Supraventricular arrhythmias**: Betapace AF has been studied in patients with symptomatic AFIB/AFL in two principal studies: one in patients with primarily paroxysmal AFIB/AFL, and the other in patients with primarily chronic AFIB. In one study, a U.S. multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response trial of patients with symptomatic primarily paroxysmal AFIB/AFL, three fixed dose levels of Betapace AF (80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg) twice daily and placebo were compared in 253 patients. In patients with reduced creatinine clearance (40 to 60 mL/min), the same doses were given once daily. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: QT > 450 msec; creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min; intolerance to beta-blockers; bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome in the absence of an implanted pacemaker; asymptomatic AFIB/AFL or association with syncope, embolic CVA, or TIA; acute myocardial infarction within the previous 2 months; congestive heart failure; bronchial asthma or other contraindications to beta-blocker therapy; receiving potassium-losing diuretics without potassium replacement or without the use of ACE inhibitors; uncorrected hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 MEq/L) or hypomagnesemia.

### β-blockers and 1-year postdischarge mortality for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and slow discharge heart rate [^113LDtQF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Overall, 2058 (60.3%) patients had sinus rhythm, and 826 (28.6%) patients had atrial fibrillation.

Regarding the patients with sinus rhythm, those on β-blockers exhibited lower heart rates. Under stratification by heart rate, among patients with a slow heart rate, the heart rate did not differ significantly between those with or without β-blockers after 3 months of follow-up:

- **At discharge**: 62.8 ± 5.0 bpm versus 62.0 ± 5.2 bpm, P = 0.087.
- **At 1 month**: 70.8 ± 12.3 bpm versus 74.7 ± 16.1 bpm, P = 0.026.
- **At 3 months**: 72.6 ± 13.5 bpm versus 72.1 ± 18.1 bpm, P = 0.815.
- **At 6 months**: 71.6 ± 14.3 bpm versus 72.0 ± 14.1 bpm, P = 0.818.
- **At 12 months**: 73.6 ± 13.2 bpm versus 74.5 ± 13.8 bpm, P = 0.630.

However, among patients with a high heart rate, those on β-blockers maintained lower heart rates throughout the follow-up period. Regarding outcomes, only patients with a high heart rate and no β-blocker prescription experienced higher 1-year all-cause mortality. No significant differences were observed among the other groups.

### Prevention of atrial fibrillation onset by beta-blocker treatment in heart failure: a meta-analysis [^117Kqqdt]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important morbidity-mortality risk factor, especially in patients with heart failure (HF). Beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in HF. This study was designed to estimate the preventive efficacy of beta-blocker treatment on AF occurrence in patients with HF.

- **Methods and results**: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify all clinical trials evaluating beta-blockers' efficacy in HF. Eligible studies had to be randomized, placebo-controlled, and provide information on the incidence of AF during follow-up among those with sinus rhythm at baseline. A total of seven studies, which included 11,952 patients receiving a background treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, were identified. Overall, beta-blockers significantly reduced the incidence of AF onset from 39 to 28 per 1,000 patient-years: relative risk reduction = 27% (95% confidence interval 14–38), P < 0.001. In patients over 70 years with systolic or diastolic HF, a higher prevalence of AF at baseline (35%) was observed compared with the mean baseline prevalence (13%).

- **Conclusion**: Beta-blockers appear to effectively prevent the occurrence of AF in patients with systolic HF.

### Assessment of rhythm and rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111bjw4d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

A recent series of randomized prospective clinical trials comparing rate control with rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) found no significant difference in primary outcomes between the two strategies. However, these trials lacked clear criteria for defining "successful" rate or rhythm control. Various measures have been used to gauge the success of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, including time to first recurrence of AF, any AF recurrence, AF burden, and a reduction in symptoms.

Determining the success of antiarrhythmic therapy can be relatively straightforward by assessing how patients feel during therapy as a key endpoint. Most patients are satisfied with a major reduction in symptomatic AF episodes and can live comfortably with occasional episodes of AF. For those who are bothered by even infrequent, brief AF episodes, a treatment regimen that eliminates nearly all AF recurrences is required, although this is often hard to achieve. Catheter ablation may be necessary to achieve a successful outcome in these patients. Suppression of AF in a patient at high risk of stroke does not, however, remove the need for concomitant warfarin therapy.

The endpoints of ventricular rate control are not clear, and the recently published rhythm versus rate control trials lacked standard criteria for judging acceptable rate control. One relatively simple method is to try and achieve a 24-hour heart rate that mimics expected normal sinus rhythm. It is important to achieve good rate control to minimize symptoms and the risk of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^114Lm1fq]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

In terms of perioperative care for atrial fibrillation, particularly regarding pre-procedural anticoagulation interruption, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend continuing anticoagulation rather than interrupting warfarin and bridging with heparin. This approach aims to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma in patients with atrial fibrillation who are on warfarin and have an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of 5% or greater while undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change.
