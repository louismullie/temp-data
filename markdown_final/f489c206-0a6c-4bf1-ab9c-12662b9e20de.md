## Question

What prebiotic regimen is recommended while taking antibiotics?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what prebiotic regimen to use during antibiotic therapy, including which substrates, doses, timing, duration, and safety considerations to prioritize, and how to tailor this to different patient populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic rationale for using prebiotics during antibiotics. Then, I should verify the strength and limits of the direct clinical evidence. Next, I will translate mechanistic signals into practical dosing, timing, and duration. After that, I need to consider population-specific nuances and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic recommendation and highlight uncertainties that warrant shared decision-making and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale. Antibiotics often increase gut redox potential and favor aerobic respiratory metabolism and Proteobacteria expansion, a hallmark dysbiotic pattern; fiber prebiotics can lower redox potential and buffer these shifts, thereby protecting commensals and supporting microbiome resilience during and after antibiotic exposure, which provides a biologically plausible basis for coadministration during therapy [^115nW8c4].

> Wait, let me verify the direct clinical evidence before jumping to dosing advice. High-quality human trials specifically testing prebiotics during antibiotic therapy are sparse; most pediatric and adult data focus on probiotics for antibiotic-associated diarrhea rather than prebiotics per se, and contemporary pediatric guidance concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine prebiotic supplementation for GI disorders, underscoring the evidence gap for prebiotics during antibiotics in children [^113HZwdF]. I should also note that a recent ICU trial of inulin during sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics showed no reduction in pathogen colonization or infection, likely reflecting antibiotic-driven microbiome suppression that outcompetes substrate effects, so I need to be cautious about extrapolating to highly disrupted hosts [^117UeUXb] [^111FqKHs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any human data support prebiotics around antibiotic exposure. A randomized infant trial after amoxicillin showed that a prebiotic-supplemented formula increased fecal bifidobacteria within 7 days without GI symptoms, suggesting feasibility and microbiota benefits in early life, though this was post-antibiotic rather than strictly co-administered, and the population and matrix differ from older children and adults [^115WKLSN]. In adults, a small RCT suggested oligofructose reduced relapse after CDI treatment, but again this is adjunctive to CDI-directed antibiotics rather than co-administration during systemic antibiotics, so it cannot be directly generalized to concurrent use [^112wSarB].

> I need to check dosing precedents to anchor practical recommendations. ISAPP synbiotic summaries report prebiotic doses ranging from about 100 mg to 10–15 g/day, with fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides commonly used; given the mechanistic goal of substrate provision during antibiotic stress, a moderate total daily dose of roughly 5–10 g of mixed GOS/FOS or inulin seems reasonable, recognizing that higher doses may be needed in some contexts and that individual tolerance varies [^116jAdjY]. Let me reconsider whether lower "synbiotic" doses are sufficient; many commercial synbiotics include only 100–500 mg prebiotic, which is likely below the threshold for robust microbiome modulation during antibiotic perturbation, so standalone prebiotic dosing in the gram range is more aligned with biological plausibility here [^116jAdjY].

> Next, I should review timing and duration. Mechanistically, starting prebiotics at or near antibiotic initiation makes sense to provide protective substrates before dysbiosis consolidates; extending use through the antibiotic course and for at least 1–2 weeks afterward aligns with the window of microbiome recovery and with pediatric synbiotic protocols that continue 7 days beyond antibiotics, acknowledging that optimal stop rules are not established and should be individualized [^112hxEBd] [^1119N7qR]. But wait, what if the host's baseline microbiota is severely disrupted or the antibiotic exposure is profound? In such cases, substrate effects may be muted, so expectations should be tempered and adjunctive measures considered [^111FqKHs].

> I will now examine population-specific considerations. In infants and young children, GOS/FOS-containing formulas have supportive signals for increasing bifidobacteria after amoxicillin, and ongoing pediatric trials are evaluating synbiotics to accelerate microbiota recovery; thus, a cautious, post-antibiotic GOS/FOS approach is reasonable in toddlers if clinically indicated, with monitoring for tolerance [^115WKLSN] [^116iF4XE]. In adults, the evidence base is thin; if used, inulin or GOS/FOS blends in the 5–10 g/day range can be trialed with attention to GI tolerance and baseline fiber intake, recognizing that diet strongly modifies prebiotic effects and should be accounted for in expectations and counseling [^116jAdjY] [^117BzYjh]. In ICU or sepsis settings, inulin failed to improve colonization outcomes, so routine prebiotic use during broad-spectrum IV antibiotics should be avoided outside trials, and stewardship plus narrow-spectrum choices when feasible remains paramount [^117UeUXb] [^111dYPik].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring. Prebiotics are generally well tolerated, but transient bloating, gas, and loose stools can occur, particularly with inulin or high loads; starting low and titrating, and avoiding overinterpretation of early GI changes as intolerance, is prudent, especially when combined with antibiotic-associated GI effects [^1154Avtg]. Serious adverse events are uncommon in reported prebiotic trials, but underreporting is a known issue in the biotics literature, so explicit inquiry about GI symptoms and adherence is warranted, and any severe or persistent symptoms should prompt reassessment of the regimen and the underlying condition [^117TXKXZ] [^1154Avtg].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic regimen while keeping the evidence limitations front and center. For a generally healthy adult starting a typical 7–10 day antibiotic course, consider 5–10 g/day of a mixed GOS/FOS or inulin product, begun within the first 1–2 days of antibiotics and continued through the course and for at least 1–2 weeks afterward, titrated to GI tolerance and baseline fiber intake; for children, if used, a lower GOS/FOS dose anchored to age and dietary context, ideally post-antibiotic or as part of a structured synbiotic trial, is reasonable, with pediatric-specific guidance still evolving [^116jAdjY] [^113HZwdF] [^116iF4XE]. I should emphasize that this is a conditional, mechanistically grounded approach rather than a guideline-endorsed standard, and shared decision-making about uncertain benefits and acceptable trade-offs is essential [^113HZwdF].

> Hold on, I should verify the key uncertainties and how to mitigate them. Dose-response in humans during antibiotic exposure is not defined, optimal substrates may vary by baseline microbiota and diet, and clinical endpoints beyond microbiota markers are largely untested for prebiotics alone in this setting; therefore, if adopted, it should be framed as a time-limited, tolerability-guided trial with attention to stool pattern, bloating, and any red flags, and with a plan to discontinue if no perceived benefit or if adverse effects emerge [^117BzYjh] [^11595fkA]. Given the stronger evidence base for probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, some patients may preferentially choose a probiotic strategy; if a prebiotic is used, it can be adjunctive rather than a substitute for established AAD prevention approaches where appropriate [^1115eYpP] [^1166GQYd].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. There is no authoritative, guideline-endorsed prebiotic-only regimen during antibiotics; a cautious, mechanistically informed approach is to provide 5–10 g/day of GOS/FOS or inulin starting near antibiotic initiation, continuing through the course and for 1–2 weeks after, with dose titration to tolerance and context-specific adjustments for age, diet, and illness severity, while recognizing that high-quality direct evidence is limited and that safety monitoring and shared decision-making are mandatory [^116jAdjY] [^115nW8c4] [^113HZwdF].

Prebiotics are **not routinely recommended during antibiotic therapy** because of limited evidence for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) or C. difficile infection (CDI) [^113HZwdF] [^116iF4XE]. They are generally safe, but **high-fiber intake may cause bloating or gas**. If used, start within 2 days of antibiotics, continue through treatment, and for 1–2 weeks after, at 2–5 g/day of inulin, FOS, or GOS; monitor for GI intolerance. Prebiotics are not substitutes for probiotics in high-risk patients, and evidence does not support routine use for AAD/ CDI prevention [^113HZwdF].

---

## Evidence for prebiotic use during antibiotic therapy

- **Limited clinical evidence**: There is scant direct evidence that prebiotics prevent AAD or CDI during antibiotic therapy; most data are from probiotics or synbiotics [^1115eYpP] [^11741scx].

- **Synbiotic data**: Some synbiotic studies suggest benefits (e.g. reduced infections, shorter hospital stay), but these effects cannot be attributed to prebiotics alone [^11741scx] [^115ZV6GW].

- **Pediatric data**: Infant formula with prebiotics increased bifidobacteria after amoxicillin, but clinical outcomes were not assessed [^115WKLSN].

- **ICU data**: Inulin during ICU sepsis did not reduce pathogen colonization or infection, highlighting limited efficacy in highly disrupted microbiotas [^117UeUXb] [^111FqKHs].

---

## Recommended prebiotic regimens

Given the limited evidence, **no standard regimen exists**; the following are practical, evidence-informed options:

| **Prebiotic type** | **Recommended dose** | **Timing** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Inulin | 2–5 g/day | Start within 2 days of antibiotics; take with food | Throughout antibiotic course + 1–2 weeks after |
| Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) | 2–5 g/day | Start within 2 days of antibiotics; take with food | Throughout antibiotic course + 1–2 weeks after |
| Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) | 2–5 g/day | Start within 2 days of antibiotics; take with food | Throughout antibiotic course + 1–2 weeks after |

---

Start within 2 days of antibiotics, continue through treatment, and for 1–2 weeks after, at 2–5 g/day of inulin, FOS, or GOS; monitor for GI intolerance. Prebiotics are not substitutes for probiotics in high-risk patients, and evidence does not support routine use for AAD/ CDI prevention [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

Potential benefits include **increased beneficial bacteria** (e.g. bifidobacteria, lactobacilli) and **short-chain fatty acid production**, which may support gut barrier and immune function [^114Fm4tk]. However, **clinical outcomes** — such as reduced AAD or CDI — are not well established for prebiotics alone during antibiotic therapy [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Prebiotics are **generally safe**, but clinicians should anticipate and counsel on GI effects:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Bloating, gas, and mild GI discomfort are common, especially with higher doses [^notfound].

- **Serious adverse events**: Rare; no significant increase in serious events reported in clinical studies [^112SihLr].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Use caution; monitor closely for intolerance or infection risk [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with probiotics and synbiotics

| **Characteristic** | **Prebiotics** | **Probiotics** | **Synbiotics** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Definition | Non-digestible fibers that selectively feed beneficial bacteria | Live microorganisms conferring health benefits | Combination of probiotics and prebiotics |
| Evidence for AAD/CDI prevention | Limited; insufficient evidence | Moderate; some guidelines support use in specific contexts | Emerging; some studies suggest benefit |
| Safety | Generally safe; GI symptoms possible | Generally safe; rare infections in high-risk patients | Generally safe; similar precautions apply |
| Clinical recommendation | Not routinely recommended during antibiotics | Consider in high-risk patients | Consider in high-risk patients |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing prebiotic use

- **Age**: Older adults may have more GI sensitivity; start low and titrate [^notfound].

- **Diet**: High-fiber diets may reduce tolerance; adjust dose accordingly [^notfound].

- **Health status**: Immunocompromised or critically ill patients require caution and close monitoring [^112A2Hsf].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines **do not recommend routine prebiotic use** during antibiotic therapy because of limited evidence; prebiotics may be considered case-by-case, especially when combined with probiotics in high-risk patients [^115weCBR] [^116gvfGs].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **Patient selection**: Consider prebiotics for patients at risk of AAD/CDI or with repeated antibiotic exposure, especially if combined with probiotics [^112wSarB] [^11595fkA].

- **Dosing and timing**: Use 2–5 g/day, start within 2 days of antibiotics, continue through treatment, and for 1–2 weeks after.

- **Monitoring**: Watch for GI intolerance; adjust dose or discontinue if symptoms occur [^112SihLr].

- **Patient education**: Explain potential benefits and side effects; set realistic expectations [^1127zPiE].

Population or participants

When choosing the study population, many parameters need to be defined, including the target host (including non-human species), target life stage (for example, pregnant women, infants, children, adults or elderly) and health status (for example, healthy, at-risk, or with a diagnosed disease or condition). Furthermore, microbiome-related factors, such as recent probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic or antibiotic use, microbiota-disrupting medications and diet can be considered as (in)eligibility criteria, depending on primary health and microbiota outcomes. A 2-week wash-in period is generally adequate for probiotics; however, certain populations might require longer wash-in periods (such as 4 weeks for those with slow transit time). The time since last antibiotic exposure will vary depending on a range of factors, including type of antibiotic, dose, duration and whether antibiotic use has occurred on multiple occasions in fairly short succession. A general recommendation is difficult to make, although a common exclusion is individuals who have taken antibiotics 3 months prior to a study. However, at a minimum, 4 weeks since cessation of antibiotics is recommended. Non-antibiotic prescription medications should also be considered if they can influence bowel function and the microbiome.

The population subgroups of interest should be specified. Clinical factors (such as sex or BMI), baseline microbiome features (such as presence of specific microbial taxa) and other microbiome-relevant factors (such as dietary fibre intake, maternal secretor status for studies on human milk oligosaccharides or birth mode) might be relevant to analyse. For studies on the elderly, consider age-associated differences in transit time, gastric acidity and diet diversity. For mother–infant dyads, consider possible vertical transmission of microorganisms from mother to infant in breast milk, microorganisms and substrates naturally present in breast milk, and the unique characteristics of immature infant microbiome.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^112QAZoy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — probiotics and prebiotic evidence in acute adult diarrheal infection — 21/168 (12.5%) compared with 102/165 (62%) in the placebo arms had diarrhea lasting greater than 4 days, and when combined, these studies achieved a 79% efficacy (relative risk: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08–0.52). The one study with S. boulardii did not appear to confer any advantage on the primary or secondary outcomes evaluated. Based on the current evidence, there are not enough studies, which would support the recommended use of any particular probiotic product for treatment in acute adult diarrhea infection; although a statistically significant summary treatment effect was observed for Enterococcus LAB SF68, heterogeneity in results, theoretical safety concerns, and no recent studies with this product have been reported. While evidence supporting therapy of probiotics in treatment of acute diarrheal infection is lacking, there is supporting evidence for the role of probiotics in prevention of acute diarrhea associated with antibiotic use, with pooled results among 63 randomized controlled trials indicating a relative risk reduction of 0.58 and a number needed to treat of 13.

On the other hand, this study is strengthened by its study design. In this study design, we have taken confounding variables into account, thereby enhancing the overall quality of our research. These variables include the mode of birth, gestational age at birth, sex, breastfeeding duration, consumption of formula milk, number of antibiotic courses and the consumption of dietary fibers. Furthermore, the control group in our study may consist of children who regularly consume cow's milk or formula milk with or without prebiotics. This setup allows us to investigate whether supplementing with the synbiotic product offers greater benefits after antibiotic treatment compared to current standard practices. Currently, there is a lack of clear guidance on the use of pro- and prebiotics following antibiotic treatment, despite the increasing availability of probiotic products. Therefore, with this study design we aim to provide scientifically validated advice on the use of synbiotic products as post-antibiotics care for children, when positive outcomes are validated. This guidance could benefit not only parents in supporting their child's health, but also Medical professionals who advise parents, and potentially shape a new guide lines of care post-antibiotic treatment in children, beneficial for overall public health.

### Harms reporting in randomized controlled trials of interventions aimed at modifying microbiota: a systematic review [^117TXKXZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are used increasingly, although the safety and potential harms of these interventions are poorly understood.

Purpose

To examine how harms-related information is reported in publications of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (without language restrictions) from 1 January 2015 to 20 March 2018.

Study Selection

RCTs assessing the safety or efficacy of at least 1 intervention involving probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics alone or in combination with another intervention compared with any control (such as a placebo or an antibiotic) for any clinical condition.

Data Extraction

4 reviewers independently assessed study characteristics, the reporting of harms, and the presentation of safety results.

Data Synthesis

Of 384 trials conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 136) or patients with any of several medical conditions (n = 248), 339 (88%) were published in specialty journals. Trials most often evaluated probiotics (n = 265 [69%]). Studies in persons with medical conditions enrolled outpatients (n = 195) and high-risk patients (n = 53). No harms-related data were reported for 106 trials (28%), safety results were not reported for 142 (37%), and the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) per study group was not given for 309 (80%). Of 242 studies mentioning harms-related results, 37% (n = 89) used only generic statements to describe AEs and 16% (n = 38) used inadequate metrics. Overall, 375 trials (98%) did not give a definition for AEs or SAEs, the number of participant withdrawals due to harms, or the number of AEs and SAEs per study group with denominators.

Limitation

Journal publication processes may have affected the completeness of reporting; only English-language publications were examined.

Conclusion

Harms reporting in published reports of RCTs assessing probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics often is lacking or inadequate. We cannot broadly conclude that these interventions are safe without reporting safety data.

Primary Funding Source

No specific funding.

### Effects of probiotics on the gastrointestinal tract [^115LSgRA]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent developments in our understanding of what gastrointestinal disorders probiotics can be of benefit for, focussing on conditions associated with infection or disruption of the normal gut flora. New insights into the effects administered strains can have in the gut, their safety, and potential for future development, will also be discussed.

Recent Findings

Recent clinical studies have shown that probiotics can protect young children from diarrhoeal illness, including antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. They may also protect neonates from necrotizing enterocolitis. In adults, they can help prevent or reduce the severity of diarrhoeal illness, and ameliorate side-effects for those undergoing antibiotic therapy for infection. Researchers are looking at combining probiotics with prebiotics to enhance anti-inflammatory effects and restore colonization resistance of the commensal flora. New technologies are elucidating complex effects on gene expression in the gut, the probiotic, and bacterial pathogens. Recombinant strains capable of binding bacterial toxins are being developed as novel therapeutics against gastrointestinal infection.

Summary

Considering the clinical trial evidence of therapeutic benefit, probiotics are an underused treatment modality for prevention and amelioration of diarrhoeal illness. Better understanding of strain-specific effects, dosing regimens and any contraindications should help resolve this.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^1164A9pt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — treatment of acute disease: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral rehydration options in the elderly with severe diarrhea or any traveler with cholera-like watery diarrhea is recommended. The use of probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults is not recommended, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness. Bismuth subsalicylates can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild-to-moderate illness. In patients receiving antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea, adjunctive loperamide therapy should be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. The evidence does not support empiric anti-microbial therapy for routine acute diarrheal infection, except in cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics.

### Guideline for the management ofInfection in children and adolescents with cancer and pediatric hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients [^1154xCEn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Literature Review and Analysis

This recommendation refers to the administration of a probiotic during a CDI episode as an adjunct to CDI-directed antibiotic therapy, not as secondary prophylaxis. Three trials examined probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of CDI (Data Supplement). - No children were included in any of these studies, and only one patient with cancer was included. All studies compared the intervention with placebo when used as an adjuvant to standard antibiotic therapy for CDI. Probiotics or prebiotics significantly reduced CDI recurrence (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.77).

The panel weighed the potential efficacy of these agents to reduce CDI recurrence against the potential for invasive infection raised in Recommendation 1. Given the lack of direct efficacy and safety data in children with cancer and pediatric HSCT patients, the panel made a weak recommendation against the routine use of probiotics to treat CDI.

### Effectiveness of probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic therapies in reducing postoperative complications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^11741scx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Microbiome-directed therapies are increasingly used preoperatively and postoperatively to improve postoperative outcomes. Recently, the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in reducing postoperative complications (POCs) has been questioned. This systematic review aimed to examine and rank the effectiveness of these therapies on POCs in adult surgical patients.

Methods

We searched for articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL plus. From 2002 to 2015, 31 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were identified in the literature. Risk of bias and heterogeneity were assessed. Network meta-analyses (NMA) were performed using random-effects modeling to obtain estimates for study outcomes. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We then ranked the comparative effects of all regimens with the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities.

Results

A total of 2,952 patients were included. We found that synbiotic therapy was the best regimen in reducing surgical site infection (SSI) (RR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12–0.64) in adult surgical patients. Synbiotic therapy was also the best intervention to reduce pneumonia (RR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09–0.90), sepsis (RR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.94), hospital stay (mean = 9.66 days, 95% CI, 7.60–11.72), and duration of antibiotic administration (mean = 5.61 days, 95% CI, 3.19–8.02). No regimen significantly reduced mortality.

Conclusions

This network meta-analysis suggests that synbiotic therapy is the first rank to reduce SSI, pneumonia, sepsis, hospital stay, and antibiotic use. Surgeons should consider the use of synbiotics as an adjunctive therapy to prevent POCs among adult surgical patients. Increasing use of synbiotics may help to reduce the use of antibiotics and multidrug resistance.

### Metabolic and nutritional support of critically ill patients: consensus and controversies [^112A2Hsf]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Pre-, pro- and synbiotics

The World Health Organization defines probiotics as 'live microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host'. Prebiotics are basically food for probiotics and are non-digestible by humans and stimulate the growth of so-called beneficial bacteria. Common prebiotics are inulin and carbohydrate fibers (oligosaccharides). A synbiotic is a supplement that contains both probiotics and prebiotics.

Critical illness results in changes to the microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to a loss of commensal flora and an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Administering certain strains of probiotics to critically ill patients may restore a balanced microbiota and have positive effects on immune function and gastrointestinal structure and function. Theoretical risks of transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes from Lactobacillus strains resistant to vancomycin to more pathogenic organisms, particularly Enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus, are possible but have not been established. Translocation resulting in iatrogenic infection has been reported only in case reports and has uniformly occurred in individuals with particular risk factors, such as uncontrolled diabetes and endovascular prostheses. Safety concerns emerged after publication of the Probiotics in Pancreatitis Trial, which showed increased mortality from gut ischemia in the probiotic-treated group. However, significant protocol violations, ethical concerns, and the use of a post-pyloric route for a fiber-containing formula limit the external validity of this trial.

The US Food and Drug Administration has clarified that their limited review of probiotics as a dietary supplement applies only to consumption by healthy people and that any use of probiotics to prevent, treat, or mitigate disease would define probiotics as a 'drug'.

Although all trials performed to assess the effects of probiotics during acute illness were included, no risk of adverse event was found. A recent meta-analysis of 13 RCTs including 1,439 patients demonstrated that probiotic administration did not significantly reduce duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU or hospital mortality rates but did reduce the incidence of ICU-acquired pneumonia and length of ICU stay. A meta-analysis comprising data from more than 11,000 patients showed that probiotics significantly reduced antibiotic-associated diarrhea in all types of patients. Despite these results, concerns remain related to the identification of which critically ill patients could benefit from this approach.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^114EToHS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — prevention and prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea: Patient level counseling on prevention of acute enteric infection is not routinely recommended but may be considered in the individual or close contacts of the individual who is at high risk for complications. Individuals should undergo pretravel counseling regarding high-risk food/beverage avoidance to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Frequent and effective hand washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers are of limited value in preventing most forms of traveler's diarrhea but may be useful where low-dose pathogens are responsible for the illness as for example during a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus infection, institutional outbreak, or in endemic diarrhea prevention. Bismuth subsalicylates have moderate effectiveness and may be considered for travelers who do not have any contraindications to use and can adhere to the frequent dosing requirements. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for prevention of TD are not recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has moderate to good effectiveness and may be considered in high-risk groups for short-term use.

### Therapies aimed at the gut microbiota and inflammation: antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, anti-inflammatory therapies [^1137pddh]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Several recent observations have raised the possibility that disturbances in the gut microbiota and/or a low-grade inflammatory state may contribute to symptomatology and the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Consequent on these hypotheses, several therapeutic categories have found their way into the armamentarium of those who care for IBS sufferers. These agents include probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents.

### Antibiotic therapy and outcome from immune-checkpoint inhibitors [^114AXfyL]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Gaining sufficient insight as to the mode of action by which bacteria might work as biotherapeutic agents is not just important for patient prognostication, but is in fact key to a successful, rational development of microbiome-modulating therapies which improve patient's outcome with ICPI. With antibiotic use now having been validated as an important and dynamic factor influencing outcome from immunotherapy, concerted efforts should be aimed at characterizing the candidate taxonomic features in the gut microbiota that are associated with worse outcome from ICPI in the context of preceding and concomitant antibiotic exposure and evaluate them in conjunction with the concomitant prescription of proton pump inhibitors, corticosteroids and vaccines, all of which have been postulated to influence ICPI response.

Recognising these changes is expected to facilitate the clinical development of diverse biotherapeutic approaches to induce microbiome reprogramming including dietary interventions with pre-biotics, therapeutic administration of single or multiple types of bacterial species or their metabolites, selective antibiotic therapy or faecal microbial transplantation, all of which are currently at the focus of intense clinical research efforts.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qq6KD]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Implication for practice and research

The summary of the available literature facilitates the utilization of scientific results in daily practice, which is crucially important. According to our findings, probiotics have only a minimal and temporary effect on the composition and diversity of gut microbiome during antibiotic therapy and are not suitable for preventing antibiotic-induced low-diversity dysbiosis. In this regard, strain-specific probiotic supplementation with antibiotics may be considered especially for vulnerable groups to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as advised by the current guideline of the AGA and WGO on the use of probiotics. These findings were however not connected to gut microbial compositions. Given our results, which describe a low moderating effect on gut flora, the question arises as to what exactly is the mechanism by which probiotics help prevent these conditions. A recent meta-analysis also points out that some strains may be more effective in the prevention of diarrhea and that the effect depends on the initial risk level. According to this, patients with a low baseline diarrhea risk do not benefit from probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment. Our findings do not suggest any further benefit regarding microbiome composition. Further evaluation of the relation between clinical manifestations, microbial diversity indices, and taxonomic composition will bring a more comprehensive understanding of the role of gut microbes in human health and how different factors affect it. The standardization of methods for microbiome diversity measurement and the definition of its optimal value are key factors in generating more homogenous data with increased clinical relevance. A measurement after a standard follow-up period should be considered for all future similar studies to determine the long-term effects.

Statistics

A statistician's involvement in the design phase of a study will provide confidence that the sample size is sufficient for the defined outcomes using intention-to-treat analysis. Mediation analyses might be useful to assess whether microbiota effects are contributing to the health benefit. Ancillary analyses, which could include population subgroups, responders versus non-responders or exploratory microbiota analyses should be pre-specified.

Finally, as with all trials, funding sources should be transparently reported, AEs must be carefully recorded and reported, and study design, execution and reporting should comply with CONSORT guidelinesto minimize study bias.

Guiding principles for synbiotic research

Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is recommended for synbiotic research. The study should be registered with accepted protocol and results systems such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Study quality factors include, but are not limited to, appropriate blinding, randomization, the allocation concealment mechanism, reporting of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria and adverse events (AEs), completion of intention-to-treat analyses, and adequate statistical power. Crossover designs might be preferred to account for the individualized nature of the gut microbiota. The wash-out period length should be based on the primary outcome with consideration for secondary outcomes; a 2-week wash-out between conditions is generally adequate for gut microbiota outcomes, although longer times might be necessary for some populations (for example, the elderly or for those with constipation or functional bowel disorders). Parallel-arm designs might be required for long-term outcomes (such as weight loss or glycaemia). The number of study groups required depends on whether the researchers intend to demonstrate synergism (Table 2). Health outcomes and selective utilization of the substrate by host microbiota must be demonstrated in the same study. When experimental trials are not feasible or ethical, observational trials, including prospective longitudinal studies, are useful; these studies must accurately capture synbiotic exposure and control for relevant confounders (such as diet or antibiotics).

Table 2
Evidence required for synbiotics using doses delivered in product

The unmodified term 'synbiotic' can be used on a commercial product label as long as the criteria for either a complementary or synergistic synbiotic are met. There is no restriction on the type of health target but it must be realistic and mechanistically driven. See Table 1 for a list of diseases and conditions targeted to date in human trials of putative synbiotics. Microbial, metabolic and health end points (or suitable biomarkers) must be tracked in the same study for a synergistic synbiotic, in the target host. It is not indicated here, but documentation of the safety of the final blended product for the intended use is required. a Effective doses delivered in a commercial product must be present through the end of shelf-life. b Studies documenting health benefits conferred by probiotic and prebiotic components are also required.

(Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). Probiotics "are defined as live microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host", and a candidate probiotic must meet properties including non-pathogenicity, viability in delivery vehicles, acid and bile stability, epithelial adherence, gastrointestinal persistence, antimicrobial production, immune modulation, and metabolic effects. Prebiotics "are non-digestible food ingredients that are fermentable in the colon and stimulate potentially health-promoting bacteria, chiefly bifidobacteriae and/or lactobacilli", and when combined with probiotics form synbiotics; such formulations have shown beneficial effects in animal models by "reducing adherence of pathogenic bacteria to the jejunum and colonic mucosa".

CONCLUSIONS

Our meta-analysis suggested that during antibiotic treatment, taking probiotics as early as possible has a positive and safe effect on preventing antibiotic-related diarrhea in adults. However, further studies should focus on the optimal dosage and duration of probiotics and pay attention to the strain specificity to develop a specific recommendation.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^116jAdjY]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Across studies, species from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus are the most commonly used live microorganisms within the formulations tested. The substrate components are usually galacto-oligosaccharides, inulin or fructo-oligosaccharides but doses vary considerably, from as low as 100 mg to as much as 10–15 g per day. For example, in a double-blind RCT, twice daily consumption of a synbiotic composed of Lactobacillus acidophilus 10 (10⁹ CFU), Lactobacillus rhamnosus HS111 (10⁹ CFU), Lactobacillus casei 10 (10⁹ CFU), Bifidobacterium bifidum (10⁹ CFU) and fructo-oligosaccharides (100 mg) 4 days before and 10 days after surgery for periampullary neoplasms resulted in a lower number of postoperative infections, a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, fewer non-infectious complications, shorter length of hospital stay and reduced mortality than in patients receiving a placebo (sucrose). Although such low doses would not be expected to provide a prebiotic effect in complementary synbiotics, they could, in theory, be sufficient to stimulate a cognate microorganism in a synergistic synbiotic formulation. In one RCTof 225 adults with overweight and obesity, a combination of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420 and polydextrose (12 g per day) resulted in a relative reduction in body fat mass of 4.5%, whereas the individual treatments had no effect. However, selective utilization was not established in this study. Thus, by itself, this study does not provide sufficient evidence that the tested combination was either a complementary or a synergistic synbiotic.

In general, the appropriate dose, duration and composition of a synbiotic needed to confer a health benefit are likely to be specific to the context, including outcome and baseline host target site microbiota, as well as coexisting environmental factors such as medication, habitual diet and, perhaps, yet-to-be-identified host genetic factors.

### Timely use of probiotics in hospitalized adults prevents Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review with meta-regression analysis [^1119N7qR]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Systematic reviews have provided evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in preventing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but guidelines do not recommend probiotic use for prevention of CDI. We performed an updated systematic review to help guide clinical practice.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Journal of Probiotics and Prebiotics, and The Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials evaluating use of probiotics and CDI in hospitalized adults taking antibiotics. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and overall quality of the evidence. Primary and secondary outcomes were incidence of CDI and adverse events, respectively. Secondary analyses examined the effects of probiotic species, dose, timing, formulation, duration, and study quality.

Results

We analyzed data from 19 published studies, comprising 6261 subjects. The incidence of CDI in the probiotic cohort, 1.6% (54 of 3277), was lower than of controls, 3.9% (115 of 2984) (P < .001). The pooled relative risk of CDI in probiotic users was 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.57; I² = 0.0%). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that probiotics were significantly more effective if given closer to the first antibiotic dose, with a decrement in efficacy for every day of delay in starting probiotics (P = 0.04); probiotics given within 2 days of antibiotic initiation produced a greater reduction of risk for CDI (relative risk, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.48; I² = 0%) than later administration (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–1.23; I² = 0%) (P = 0.02). There was no increased risk for adverse events among patients given probiotics. The overall quality of the evidence was high.

Conclusions

In a systematic review with meta-regression analysis, we found evidence that administration of probiotics closer to the first dose of antibiotic reduces the risk of CDI by > 50% in hospitalized adults. Future research should focus on optimal probiotic dose, species, and formulation. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO CRD42015016395.

### The individual response to antibiotics and diet-insights into gut microbial resilience and host metabolism [^11595fkA]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotic use disrupts microbial composition and activity in humans, but whether this disruption in turn affects host metabolic health is unclear. Cohort studies show associations between antibiotic use and an increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we review available clinical trials and show the disruptive effect of antibiotic use on the gut microbiome in humans, as well as its impact on bile acid metabolism and microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. Placebo-controlled human studies do not show a consistent effect of antibiotic use on body weight and insulin sensitivity at a population level, but rather an individual-specific or subgroup-specific response. This response to antibiotic use is affected by the resistance and resilience of the gut microbiome, factors that determine the extent of disruption and the speed of recovery afterwards. Nutritional strategies to improve the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome, as well as its recovery after antibiotic use (for instance, with prebiotics), require a personalized approach to increase their efficacy. Improved insights into key factors that influence the individual-specific response to antibiotics and dietary intervention may lead to better efficacy in reversing or preventing antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis as well as strategies for preventing cardiometabolic diseases.

### The rationale and clinical effectiveness of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome [^114RD6vz]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unknown. However, several lines of epidemiological, physiological, and clinical data suggest a role for intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recent microbiology studies demonstrated differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota between patients with IBS and healthy individuals. In addition, physiological studies have shown that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics can affect intestinal functions (eg, motility and sensation) relevant in the pathogenesis of IBS. Several randomized control trials comparing the effects of probiotics versus placebo in IBS have been published. Despite considerable differences in study design, dosing regimens, probiotic species used, and reported clinical end points, the current data indicate improving IBS symptoms and reducing the risk of persistent IBS symptoms. The data on the use of probiotics in children with IBS is more limited but is also suggestive for beneficial effects. The inconsistencies between the studies underline the need to look at each probiotic product separately for specific conditions, symptoms, and patient populations. This review article discusses the rationale for targeting the intestinal microbiota in patient with IBS and provides an overview and a critical evaluation of the currently available clinical data on the use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with IBS.

### Impact of microbiome-based interventions on gastrointestinal pathogen colonization in the intensive care unit [^114RBrDe]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Gastrointestinal colonization by pathogenic, multidrug-resistant bacteria is common among ICU patients and is a precursor to life-threatening infections and multiorgan dysfunction. Microbiome-based therapies offer an attractive alternative to traditional, antibiotic-centric decontamination efforts by enhancing the proliferation of beneficial symbionts and (hopefully) restoring gut microbial equilibrium. The existing evidence for such therapies is encouraging yet quite inconclusive as to whether pre-, pro-, or synbiotics can ameliorate pathogen colonization in the ICU (see summary Table 1). Future studies should state exactly what is being studied, and ideally, why. Such studies must predesignate the outcomes of interest. If MDRO pathogens are the targets, which organisms and precisely how will they be assessed? Is the intervention being tested to eradicate gut colonization that was already present at the time of ICU admission, or to prevent the acquisition of new MDROs during hospitalization? Culture remains the clinical gold standard for diagnosis of almost all important nosocomial pathogens; future studies may want to include culture for predesignated MDROs, as opposed to only sequencing results, as a way of assessing the effectiveness of interventions. To be convincing, studies of microbiome-based interventions will need to be relatively large, blinded, randomized, and appropriately controlled. Microbiome-based interventions have a bright future in the ICU but much work needs to be done before such interventions enter the clinical realm.

Key concept statements for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) emphasize that patients with a number of prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or surgery should be treated with therapies for moderate-to-severe disease. Patients with mildly to moderately active UC should be reassessed to determine response to induction therapy within 8 weeks. There is not sufficient evidence for routine use of probiotics, prebiotics, or other alternative therapies as primary induction therapy for patients with mildly to moderately active UC, and there is not sufficient evidence of an optimal approach to fecal microbial transfer as a primary induction treatment. Patients with previously mildly to moderately active UC who have achieved remission should be treated with maintenance therapy with demonstrated efficacy in prevention of relapse, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a probiotic as primary or adjunctive maintenance therapy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^114fXGqn]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — methodology and scope emphasize standardized question formulation, evidence appraisal, and intended users. The AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines follows the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and best practices as outlined by the National Academy of Science (formerly Institute of Medicine), and A priori, the Guideline Panel and methodologist identified and formulated clinically relevant questions about the use of probiotic formulations for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases (not prebiotic use). Each research question identified the population, intervention, comparison, and patient-important outcomes. Although the quality of evidence (Table 1) was a key factor in determining the strength of the recommendations (Table 2), the Panel also considered the balance between the benefits and harms of the interventions, as well as patients' values and preferences, resource use (ie, cost), health equity, acceptability, and feasibility (the Evidence to Decision Framework). The target audience for this guideline includes health care providers, dietitians, and patients, and the guidelines include recommendations for specific populations, including adults, children, and neonates. The panel prioritized conditions in which probiotics are commonly considered and focused on patient-important outcomes, stating they prioritized Clostridioides difficile–associated diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, infectious gastroenteritis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and focused on patient-important outcomes, such as induction and maintenance of disease, treatment of disease, prevention of sepsis, and all-cause mortality. The authors also note feasibility limits, stating we were not able to assess the viability of each formulation reported in the studies, as this information was not routinely available.

### Classifying compounds as prebiotics-scientific perspectives and recommendations [^112GbDE5]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Microbiomes provide key contributions to health and potentially important therapeutic targets. Conceived nearly 30 years ago, the prebiotic concept posits that targeted modulation of host microbial communities through the provision of selectively utilized growth substrates provides an effective approach to improving health. Although the basic tenets of this concept remain the same, it is timely to address certain challenges pertaining to prebiotics, including establishing that prebiotic-induced microbiota modulation causes the health outcome, determining which members within a complex microbial community directly utilize specific substrates in vivo and when those microbial effects sufficiently satisfy selectivity requirements, and clarification of the scientific principles on which the term 'prebiotic' is predicated to inspire proper use. In this Expert Recommendation, we provide a framework for the classification of compounds as prebiotics. We discuss ecological principles by which substrates modulate microbiomes and methodologies useful for characterizing such changes. We then propose statistical approaches that can be used to establish causal links between selective effects on the microbiome and health effects on the host, which can help address existing challenges. We use this information to provide the minimum criteria needed to classify compounds as prebiotics. Furthermore, communications to consumers and regulatory approaches to prebiotics worldwide are discussed.

### Design and reporting of prebiotic and probiotic clinical trials in the context of diet and the gut microbiome [^117BzYjh]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Diet is a major determinant of the gastrointestinal microbiome composition and function, yet our understanding of how it impacts the efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics is limited. Here we examine current evidence of dietary influence on prebiotic and probiotic efficacy in human studies, including potential mechanisms. We propose that habitual diet be included as a variable in prebiotic and probiotic intervention studies. This recommendation is based on the potential mechanisms via which diet can affect study outcomes, either directly or through the gut microbiome. We consider the challenges and opportunities of dietary assessment in this context. Lastly, we provide recommendations for the design, conduct and reporting of human clinical trials of prebiotics and probiotics (and other biotic interventions) to account for any effect of diet and nutrition.

### Gut microbiota: a potential new territory for drug targeting [^114mLZoZ]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2008). Medium credibility.

The significant involvement of the gut microbiota in human health and disease suggests that manipulation of commensal microbial composition through combinations of antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics could be a novel therapeutic approach. A systems perspective is needed to help understand the complex host-bacteria interactions and their association with pathophysiological phenotypes so that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in disease states can be reversed. In this article, we describe the therapeutic rationale and potential for targeting the gut microbiota, and discuss strategies and systems-oriented technologies for achieving this goal.

### A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of inulin for the prevention of gut pathogen colonization and infection among patients admitted to the intensive care unit for sepsis [^117UeUXb]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The trial has limitations. In hindsight, the selection of Day 3 as the primary outcome may have been too short a duration of treatment to realistically hope to see an effect from inulin. The trial was single center, and the population studied had a high burden of chronic illness, even for the medical ICU. The patient cohort was likely to have prior hospitalizations and they may have received prior antibiotics of varying durations. These cohort characteristics may have been reflected in the very high rates of VRE gut colonization observed, and they may have impacted the ability of inulin to affect the microbiome (i.e. inulin might be more effective in a more pristine ICU patient population). The trial targeted patients with sepsis, who are the plurality of ICU patients but not the only patients. The intervention was delivered over a timeframe of seven days rather than continuously during hospitalization and it is possible that greater effects would have been observed if inulin was continued past exposure to antibiotics (although this would be unlikely to impact short-term outcomes). In future studies, later sample timepoints — after discontinuation of antibiotics and microbiome recovery — would be of interest. A challenge of such samples is minimizing loss to follow-up, because substantial numbers of patients are likely to die or to be discharged after ICU Day 14. Last, as previously noted, the trial tested only one prebiotic (inulin). These results do not necessarily mean that all pre- or probiotic strategies are doomed in the ICU.

In sum, this trial did not find evidence that inulin improved gut pathogen colonization or infection in the ICU. Alternative strategies should be considered.

### A meta-analysis of probiotic and synbiotic use in elective surgery: does nutrition modulation of the gut microbiome improve clinical outcome? [^115ZV6GW]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative nutrition modulation of gut microbiota is increasingly used as a strategy for reducing the infective complications of elective surgery. This meta-analysis assessed the effect of probiotic and synbiotic preparations on the incidence of postoperative sepsis.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials that compared preoperative dosing of probiotics and synbiotics in patients undergoing elective general surgical procedures were included. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative sepsis rate. Pooled outcome measures were determined using random effects models.

Results

Thirteen randomized controlled trials totaling 962 patients were included in this analysis (304 received synbiotics and 182 received probiotics). The incidence of postoperative sepsis was reduced in the probiotic group vs the control (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.23–0.75; p = 0.003) and in the synbiotic group vs the control (pooled OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.1–0.6; p = 0.002). However, subgroup analysis failed to identify a significant reduction in the incidence of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or wound infections in the postoperative phase for either treatment group. Synbiotics reduced the length of postoperative antibiotic use (weighted mean differences = -1.71; 95% CI, -3.2 to -0.21; p = 0.03).

Conclusion

Probiotic and synbiotic nutrition strategies reduce the incidence of postoperative sepsis in the elective general surgery setting. These effects appear more pronounced with the use of synbiotics. High-powered, mechanistic studies are now required for the optimization of pro- and prebiotic regimens to further improve their efficacy.

### Effect of prebiotics on gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in children with intestinal failure: a pilot study [^116AebRY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Different prebiotics are degraded by various species of gut bacteria, thereby promoting the growth of different bacterial phyla. Consequently, using a diverse blend of prebiotics may be preferred when studying their effects on gut health and overall well‐being. Our study used a combination of different prebiotics known to affect the microbiota. However, the supplement contained insoluble fibres that have other properties, such as bulking and stool softening, in addition to prebiotic effects. This may contribute to changes observed in stool consistency and frequency. In addition, optimal dosage remains undetermined, warranting further investigation into effective yet non‐disruptive supplementation.

A trial strength includes testing prebiotics on all available subjects to improve power in the Phase 1 4‐week trial and the randomised, stratified design of the Phase 2 follow‐up study. Stratifying on PN dependency was done to minimise bias in relation to tolerance to enteral nutrition, which affects the gut microbiota. However, the higher representation of SBS children in the intervention group, by chance, limits generalisability to other aetiologies of IF. Moreover, a higher drop‐out rate in the control group decreased study power. Future research should ensure aetiological stratification beyond PN dependence and consider excluding patients with low GI burden to prevent dilution of effects. Furthermore, some secondary end points of the trial suffered from low power. For example, assessing the effect on antibiotic dependency would require a sample size of 77 children per group to detect a statistically significant difference.

The study primarily uses subjective by‐proxy reported outcomes. Although we aimed to validate these with quantifiable measures like stool frequency and consistency, and data on PN dependency, the absence of more standardised measures and a placebo arm constitutes limitations that may introduce bias in interpreting the effectiveness of the intervention.

### Therapeutic manipulation of the enteric microflora in inflammatory bowel diseases: antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics [^115o5Yqn]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis are caused by overly aggressive immune responses to a subset of commensal (nonpathogenic) enteric bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterial species is altered in these disorders. Antibiotics can selectively decrease tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species or globally decrease luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations, depending on their spectrum of activity. Alternatively, administration of beneficial bacterial species (probiotics), poorly absorbed dietary oligosaccharides (prebiotics), or combined probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics) can restore a predominance of beneficial Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Current clinical trials do not fulfill evidence-based criteria for using these agents in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but multiple nonrigorous studies and widespread clinical experience suggest that metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin can treat Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (but not isolated ileal disease), perianal fistulae and pouchitis, whereas selected probiotic preparations prevent relapse of quiescent ulcerative colitis and relapsing pouchitis. These physiologic approaches offer considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by rigorous controlled therapeutic trials that consider clinical disease before their widespread clinical acceptance. These agents likely will become an integral component of treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents.

5.12.1 Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD

A systematic review assessed 21 studies in UC. Nine were trials of induction therapy (seven using probiotics and one each prebiotic and synbiotics). The majority assessed the addition of the investigational treatment alongside standard therapy (mostly 5-ASA), with standard therapy alone being used in the control group. Study quality was variable, many being small trials, but overall the majority showed benefit, with statistical significance in 16 of the studies. The largest studies used a mixture containing eight probiotic organisms and overall there is evidence of benefit for this treatment in UC as an addition to standard therapy, with insufficient evidence to recommend other agents. A Cochrane review of probiotics in induction therapy published in 2007 (and so not including the largest studies reported in the systematic review) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy in induction of remission, but that it may improve symptoms in mild to moderate colitis. The remaining trials evaluated maintenance therapy, some with remission induction followed by maintenance therapy. There was a modest benefit in a number of studies, and some showed equivalence to 5-ASA therapy. A variety of agents were used in these studies. Again, a Cochrane review in 2011 concluded that there is insufficient high quality evidence to show benefit in maintaining remission. One study comparing a prebiotic, a probiotic and a synbiotic in UC using quality of life as an end-point concluded that synbiotic therapy was more effective than the other treatments. In conclusion, probiotic therapy may have modest benefits in UC, but should not be routinely used. By contrast to UC, there is no evidence of any benefit in the current literature for these treatments in Crohn's disease.

Further enhancements to FMT efficacy should be explored through supportive measures, including donor and recipient diets, bowel preparation, antibiotic pretreatment, and the use of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. Combination therapy with existing IBD treatments should also be examined. Moreover, the identification of specific microbiota strains that predict FMT success or failure could lead to the development of well-defined single- or multi-strain probiotics, or targeted treatment strategies such as bacteriophages. Finally, the implementation of AI-based technologies will improve the quality and reproducibility of data.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^114CeDaQ]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Notable properties of the gut microbiota include its functionality and resilience. A stable gut community protects the host against invading microorganisms and helps maintain homeostasis, including immune regulation. Nonetheless, disruptions occur owing to dietary shifts, antibiotic use, age or infection, leading to a gut microbiota that can contribute to a range of inflammatory, pathogenic and metabolic conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, metabolic syndrome and atopy. Several strategies have been proposed to modulate the composition and/or function of the gut microbiota, including faecal microbiota transplants, the application of probiotics and other live microorganisms, and the use of non-digestible dietary substrates such as prebiotics.

When the synbiotic concept was first described 25 years ago, the notion that selectively fermentable non-digestible food ingredients (prebiotics) could be combined with probiotics was envisioned. Thus, synbiotics were loosely defined as mixtures of "probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host". The term itself was formed from the Greek prefix 'syn', meaning 'together' and the suffix 'biotic', meaning 'pertaining to life'. Despite the availability of similarly worded definitions, confusion exists among stakeholders, including scientists, about what constitutes a synbiotic –. A general misunderstanding might have been, in part, because the original definition itself — that is, "mixtures of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting bacteria, thus improving host welfare" — was too wordy and lacked precision. In addition, the expansion of the entire '–biotics' category, including terms such as postbioticand pharmabiotic, almost certainly further contributes to confusion. To provide clarity and guidance regarding appropriate use of the term 'synbiotic', in May 2019, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) convened an expert panel of academic scientists to address the current status of synbiotics, including its definition. The outcomes of that meeting and subsequent discussions comprise this Consensus Statement. A summary of key conclusions is shown in Box 1. Herein, we consider applicable efficacy and mechanistic evidence on combination probiotic plus prebiotic products, we recommend the research needed to establish a 'synbiotic' formulation, discuss the safety considerations, and reflect on implications for stakeholders of the synbiotic concept.

### Prebiotics in the management of pediatric gastrointestinal disorders: position paper of the ESPGHAN special interest group on gut microbiota and modifications [^113HZwdF]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Prebiotics are substrates that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit. Compared to probiotics there are few studies with prebiotics in children. Most studies have been performed using infant formula supplemented with prebiotics, while add-on prebiotic supplementation as prevention or treatment of childhood gastrointestinal disorders has rarely been reported. The aim of this position paper was to summarize evidence and make recommendations for prebiotic supplementation in children with gastrointestinal diseases. Recommendations made are based on publications up to January 1, 2023. Within the scope of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition Special Interest Group on Gut Microbiota and Modifications, as in our previous biotic recommendations, at least two randomized controlled clinical trials were required for recommendation. There are some studies showing benefits of prebiotics on selected outcomes; however, we cannot give any positive recommendations for supplementing prebiotics in children with gastrointestinal disorders.

Designing a synbiotic trial

There are multiple ways to design a synbiotic trial intended to examine health effects in the target host. Here, we provide some recommendations based on the criteria established herein to demonstrate complementary or synergistic synbiotics. Pre-specified subgroup analyses should be considered based on the relevant clinical factors (such as sex and age), baseline gut microbiota factors, dietary factors (such as typical dietary fibre intake) or other relevant factors (such as responder analysis). The number of experimental groups or 'study arms' required to prove efficacy and support mechanistic understanding will depend on the existing level of evidence for the component live microorganism(s) and selectively utilized substrate(s) as well as the researchers' intent to determine whether components of the test mixture are complementary or acting as synergistic synbiotics (Table 2).

When selecting the study design and determining the duration of the intervention and (if applicable) of the wash-out period, general recommendations are difficult to make. Factors that will impact these decisions include the live microorganism dose and its ability to persist in situ as well as the characteristics of study subjects; for example, in elderly individuals or persons with slow intestinal transit time, a longer wash-out period could be required compared with a study conducted in younger individuals. Parallel arm designs would be appropriate for studies that aim to demonstrate improvements in metabolic health measures, such as of adiposity or glycaemic control, as these outcomes typically require longer-term interventions (that is, 12 weeks or more). Gut microbiota changes can be rapid (within days). Currently, changes in the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, are not accepted by regulatory bodies as measures of a health outcome.

Responders and non-responders among study participants in intervention studies with probiotics and prebiotics are commonly observed, which could justify including the probability of a positive response as a study end point. In the context of synbiotics, non-responders include individuals for whom little or no change in gut microbiota composition and/or clinical end point occurs compared with placebo. Various reasons for the non-responder phenotype include limited available niches for desired gut microorganisms (either native or introduced as probiotics), limited substrates to support microbial growth, host immune system expressing intolerance for specific microorganismsor a lack of specific microorganisms in the host microbiota. Although many scenarios of formulations for synbiotics can be conceived, we provide both actual and hypothetical examples to illustrate the concept (Box 2).

### Effect of the prebiotic oligofructose on relapse of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a randomized, controlled study [^112wSarB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Ten percent to 20% of patients relapse after successful treatment of their Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea. We set out to determine if the prebiotic oligofructose could alter the fecal bacterial flora and, in addition to antibiotic treatment, reduce the rate of relapse from C difficile infection.

Methods

Consecutive inpatients with C difficile -associated diarrhea were randomly allocated to receive oligofructose or placebo for 30 days in addition to specific antibiotic treatment. Patients were followed up for an additional 30 days. The main end point was the development of further diarrhea. Stools were collected for bacterial culture and C difficile toxin measurement.

Results

One hundred forty-two patients were recruited. Stool culture confirmed the probiotic effect of oligofructose with an increase in fecal bifidobacteria from baseline 8.68 log(10) colony-forming units (cfu)/g to 9.37 log(10) cfu/g at discharge (P < .0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.94), 9.64 log(10) cfu/g at 30 days (P < .0001; 95% CI, 0.74–1.18), and 9.42 log(10) cfu/g at 60 days (P < .0001; 95% CI, 0.56–0.93). Thirty patients experienced a relapse of diarrhea after a median of 18 days (range, 8–34 days). Relapse of diarrhea was more common in those taking placebo (8.3% oligofructose vs 34.3% placebo, P < .001, χ² = 14.35). Patients who relapsed stayed in the hospital longer than those who did not (53 vs 26 days, P = 0.021; 95% CI, 2–28), and there was a longer period of time from commencing metronidazole or vancomycin and their diarrhea settling (6 vs 3 days; p = 0.007; 95% CI, 1.0–5.0).

Conclusions

Fecal cultures confirmed the prebiotic effect of oligofructose. Patients taking oligofructose were less likely to develop further diarrhea than those taking the placebo.

### A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of inulin for the prevention of gut pathogen colonization and infection among patients admitted to the intensive care unit for sepsis [^111FqKHs]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

This trial differentiated itself from prior trials of pre- or probiotics because it tested a specific prebiotic fiber (inulin) and employed a highly rigorous study design which may set a standard for future microbiome-based interventions in the ICU. Adherence to the study intervention was excellent and samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints, without any samples missed. This trial successfully demonstrated that an oral prebiotic fiber supplement can be delivered in the ICU with high fidelity, without any adverse effects.

In ambulatory adults, inulin has large effects on the gut microbiome whereas this trial showed that inulin had few effects on patients in the ICU. Several factors are likely to explain these differences across patient populations. First, unlike cohorts of ambulatory patients or healthy volunteers, the participants in our study all received intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics concurrent with prebiotic inulin including many patients who received multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics. Intravenous vancomycin, which was received by half of the cohort, achieves high gut concentrations; surprisingly sparse data exists on the gut penetration of other intravenous antibiotics. One possible reason that we did not observe greater effects for inulin is that vancomycin or other intravenous antibiotics may have achieved high gut concentrations. These antibiotics, rather than inulin, may have dictated microbiome composition. If this interpretation is correct, it would represent a major obstacle for all gut microbiome-based interventions in the ICU (i.e. for pre- and probiotics alike). In other high-risk populations such as nursing home residents, inulin and other gut microbiome-based interventions could still be viable therapies. Second, in this trial, the characteristics of the gut microbiome at ICU admission was an important determinant of the gut microbiome at subsequent timepoints. Participants were relatively "flat" during the course of the study in SCFA producer levels, alpha-, and beta-diversity. This speaks to the importance of the baseline microbiome at ICU admission, which may already have been shaped by prior antibiotics. More research is needed to delineate the dynamics of the microbiome in the ICU and to understand whether specific factors such as baseline VRE gut colonization may be used to distinguish patients who are unlikely to benefit from a gut microbiome-based intervention. This trial studied prebiotic inulin, and it did not test a probiotic or symbiotic approach to improve the gut microbiome in the ICU. Our results cannot directly comment on alternative strategies, but they argue that gut microbiome-based interventions will need to be highly potent in order to be effective.

### Expert consensus document: the international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of prebiotics [^116BCvFF]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In December 2016, a panel of experts in microbiology, nutrition and clinical research was convened by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics to review the definition and scope of prebiotics. Consistent with the original embodiment of prebiotics, but aware of the latest scientific and clinical developments, the panel updated the definition of a prebiotic: a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit. This definition expands the concept of prebiotics to possibly include non-carbohydrate substances, applications to body sites other than the gastrointestinal tract, and diverse categories other than food. The requirement for selective microbiota-mediated mechanisms was retained. Beneficial health effects must be documented for a substance to be considered a prebiotic. The consensus definition applies also to prebiotics for use by animals, in which microbiota-focused strategies to maintain health and prevent disease is as relevant as for humans. Ultimately, the goal of this Consensus Statement is to engender appropriate use of the term 'prebiotic' by relevant stakeholders so that consistency and clarity can be achieved in research reports, product marketing and regulatory oversight of the category. To this end, we have reviewed several aspects of prebiotic science including its development, health benefits and legislation.

### Probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^1137q9BW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of probiotics beyond simple antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens; (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier activity; and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis. The unraveling of these mechanisms of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of clinical inflammatory bowel disease. While level 1 evidence now supports the therapeutic use of some probiotics in the maintenance treatment of pouchitis, only level 2 and 3 evidence are currently available in support of the use of probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged over the course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials, to investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or multistrain formulation, and the concomitant use of prebiotics, synbiotics or antibiotics, are vital.

### Targeting the human microbiome with antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics: gastroenterology enters the metagenomics era [^113yphES]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions. Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity, relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host. Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders.

### An updated systematic review with meta-analysis: efficacy of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic treatment of patients with severe acute pancreatitis [^115PAvLV]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to systematically review the clinical outcomes of all randomized controlled trials of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and treated with pre/pro/synbiotics.

Methods

A systematic literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that evaluated the clinical outcomes of patients with SAP treated with pre/pro/synbiotics.

Results

Eleven trials comprising 930 patients were included. Patients treated with pre/pro/synbiotics had a significantly shorter hospital stay [weighted mean difference, -4.33 days; 95% confidence interval (CI), -7.71 to -0.95; P = 0.010; I2 = 66.9%] compared with control. In a subgroup analysis where only patients classified as SAP were included, those treated with pre/pro/synbiotics had lower risk of single- or multiple-organ failure (relative risk, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44–0.88; P = 0.995; I2 = 0.0%) and decreased hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -0.65 days; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.41; P = 0.121; I2 = 45.3%) compared with control.

Conclusions

Patients with SAP treated with pre/pro/synbiotics did not have a worse clinical outcome and had lower risk of organ failure and duration of hospital stay. Further studies should examine the optimal timing, type, and dosages of these promising treatments.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^111LpPHm]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Necessary evidence for synbiotics

A synbiotic must contain a live microorganism and a selectively utilized substrate. For complementary synbiotics, the respective components must fulfil the evidence and dose requirements for both a probiotic and prebiotic. Furthermore, the combination must be shown in an appropriately designed trial to confer a health benefit in the target host. A product containing a probiotic and a prebiotic that only has evidence for each component individually, and not as a combination product, should not be called a synbiotic. A key evidentiary requirement for a synergistic synbiotic is that there be at least one appropriately designed study of the synbiotic in the target host that demonstrates both selective utilization of the substrate and a health benefit (Box 2).

Generating this evidence requires appropriately designed, adequately powered experimental trials conducted on the target host. These studies should follow standard human trial design and reporting guidelinesand consider best practices for diet–microbiota research. The study should also meet the criteria outlined in CONSORTand should be registered, including a description of all outcomes, prior to recruitment. These CONSORT criteria include guiding principles for microorganisms, microbiota-related compliance and outcome measures, relevant subgroups, and statistical considerations for evaluating the microbiota as a mediator of clinical effects.

Ideally, the health benefit of a synbiotic would be superadditive, that is, it would exceed the benefit observed for the sum of the individual components. However, owing to the difficulties in demonstrating different levels of health benefit in an efficacy trial, the panel did not insist upon this aspect. Instead, we advocate requiring a measurable, confirmed health benefit of the synbiotic, which is conferred, at least in part, through selective utilization of the substrate(s) provided in the synbiotic. Although in vitro and animal models are used frequently to test the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics –, it is our position that these have not been fully validated as predictive and that definitive tests of these interventions must be performed in the target host. Of course, model experiments can add mechanistic insights, in particular in cases for which available samples from studies in the target host have limited usefulness (for example, faeces, which are not reflective of upstream intestinal microbial or metabolic activities).

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^115gFsu7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Dysbiosis-directed therapies in liver disease — intervention signals and current stance are summarized as follows: Diverse approaches to modify dysbiosis have been used to treat liver disease or its complications, and probiotics have been used with some success in pilot trials in both alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and MASLD, while fecal transplant has shown some exciting results in treating acute AH, cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, a recent large trial of antibiotic therapy showed no benefit in AH, and by contrast, rifaximin and the prebiotic lactulose are well-accepted therapy for HE; overall, dysbiosis therapy as a specific form of therapy for liver disease/complications (other than HE) cannot be recommended at this time.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178wz3H]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Probiotics are often used to prevent antibiotic-induced low-diversity dysbiosis, however their effect is not yet sufficiently summarized in this regard. We aimed to investigate the effects of concurrent probiotic supplementation on gut microbiome composition during antibiotic therapy.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reporting the differences in gut microbiome diversity between patients on antibiotic therapy with and without concomitant probiotic supplementation. The systematic search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)) without filters on 15 October 2021. A random-effects model was used to estimate pooled mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021282983).

Results

Of 11,769 identified articles, 15 were eligible in the systematic review and 5 in the meta-analyses. Quantitative data synthesis for Shannon (MD = 0.23, 95% CI: [(-)0.06–0.51]), Chao1 (MD = 11.59 [(-)18.42–41.60]) and observed OTUs (operational taxonomic unit) (MD = 17.15 [(-)9.43–43.73]) diversity indices revealed no significant difference between probiotic supplemented and control groups. Lacking data prevented meta-analyzing other diversity indices; however, most of the included studies reported no difference in the other reported α- and ß-diversity indices between the groups. Changes in the taxonomic composition varied across the eligible studies but tended to be similar in both groups. However, they showed a potential tendency to restore baseline levels in both groups after 3–8 weeks. This is the first meta-analysis and the most comprehensive review of the topic to date using high quality methods. The limited number of studies and low sample sizes are the main limitations of our study. Moreover, there was high variability across the studies regarding the indication of antibiotic therapy and the type, dose, and duration of antimicrobials and probiotics.

Conclusions

Our results showed that probiotic supplementation during antibiotic therapy was not found to be influential on gut microbiome diversity indices. Defining appropriate microbiome diversity indices, their standard ranges, and their clinical relevance would be crucial.

### Early life antibiotics and childhood gastrointestinal disorders: a systematic review [^1127wtHd]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review with best evidence syntheses on the association between antibiotic exposure in the first 2 years of life and chronic GI disorders during childhood showed strong evidence for this association with IBD and CeD, and moderate evidence for this association with EoE. For the other studied GI disorders, insufficient evidence was found.

The question remains to what extent the association with IBD, EoE and CeD can be attributed to antibiotic exposure itself or to other factors such as infections and parental health seeking behaviour. Infections in early life have been proposed to contribute to the development of chronic GI disordersand it is difficult to differentiate between the role of infections and antibiotics which are prescribed for (suspected) infections. Furthermore, several GI disorders like CeD can remain undiagnosed for a long time. Higher parental health seeking behaviour can both lead to higher use of antibiotics and a higher chance of diagnosing the chronic GI disorder. Therefore, it remains unknown whether antibiotics are the true causative agent in the observed associations or whether they are intermediates in different mechanistic pathways through microbiome perturbations or changes in immune development after (suspected) infections.

Most studies found a clear association between antibiotics in early life and IBD. The study that focused on VEO-IBD, found no association between antibiotics and VEO-IBD. VEO-IBD is considered a different entity from later-onset IBD, since genetics play a far more important aetiological role than microbial dysbiosis. This may explain the lack of an association with early life antibiotics.

The primary goal of antibiotic administration is to prevent detrimental effects of serious and sometimes even life-threatening infections. However, especially in early life, antibiotics are overused, since they are often prescribed for viral upper respiratory tract infections. Given its association with the occurrence of IBD, CeD and EoE, it is highly important to prevent antibiotic overuse by strict adherence to guidelines. If antibiotics are necessary, treatment would be adjusted to minimise dysbiosis. Another possible solution is to shorten the time of antibiotic administration. Oosterloo et al found more health issues in the first year of life after 7 days compared with 2 days of antibiotics in the first week of life. Furthermore, whenever possible, narrow-spectrum antibiotics rather than broad-spectrum should be used, because these specifically reduce the capacity of pathogens to cause disease while leaving commensals unharmed. If adjustment of antibiotic treatment is not possible, interventions that restore or prevent dysbiosis should be considered, such as administration of prebiotics or probiotics or faecal transplants.

### Synbiotics, prebiotics and probiotics for people with chronic kidney disease [^112SihLr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem affecting 13% of the global population. Prior research has indicated that CKD is associated with gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis may lead to the development and/or progression of CKD, which in turn may in turn lead to gut dysbiosis as a result of uraemic toxins, intestinal wall oedema, metabolic acidosis, prolonged intestinal transit times, polypharmacy (frequent antibiotic exposures) and dietary restrictions used to treat CKD. Interventions such as synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics may improve the balance of the gut flora by altering intestinal pH, improving gut microbiota balance and enhancing gut barrier function (i.e. reducing gut permeability).

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics for people with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 October 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) measuring and reporting the effects of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in any combination and any formulation given to people with CKD (CKD stages 1 to 5, including dialysis and kidney transplant). Two authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Forty-five studies (2266 randomised participants) were included in this review. Study participants were adults (two studies in children) with CKD ranging from stages 1 to 5, with patients receiving and not receiving dialysis, of whom half also had diabetes and hypertension. No studies investigated the same synbiotic, prebiotic or probiotic of similar strains, doses, or frequencies. Most studies were judged to be low risk for selection bias, performance bias and reporting bias, unclear risk for detection bias and for control of confounding factors, and high risk for attrition and other biases. Compared to prebiotics, it is uncertain whether synbiotics improve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at four weeks (1 study, 34 participants: MD -3.80 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -17.98 to 10.38), indoxyl sulfate at four weeks (1 study, 42 participants: MD 128.30 ng/mL, 95% CI -242.77 to 499.37), change in gastrointestinal (GI) upset (borborymgi) at four weeks (1 study, 34 participants: RR 15.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 236.23), or change in GI upset (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) at 12 months (1 study, 56 participants: MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.27), because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to certain strains of prebiotics, it is uncertain whether a different strain of prebiotics improves eGFR at 12 weeks (1 study, 50 participants: MD 0.00 mL/min, 95% CI -1.73 to 1.73), indoxyl sulfate at six weeks (2 studies, 64 participants: MD -0.20 μg/mL, 95% CI -1.01 to 0.61; I² = 0%) or change in any GI upset, intolerance or microbiota composition, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to certain strains of probiotics, it is uncertain whether a different strain of probiotic improves eGFR at eight weeks (1 study, 30 participants: MD -0.64 mL/min, 95% CI -9.51 to 8.23; very low certainty evidence). Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether synbiotics improve eGFR at six or 12 weeks (2 studies, 98 participants: MD 1.42 mL/min, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.2) or change in any GI upset or intolerance at 12 weeks because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether prebiotics improves indoxyl sulfate at eight weeks (2 studies, 75 participants: SMD -0.14 mg/L, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.31; very low certainty evidence) or microbiota composition because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether probiotics improve eGFR at eight, 12 or 15 weeks (3 studies, 128 participants: MD 2.73 mL/min, 95% CI -2.28 to 7.75; I² = 78%), proteinuria at 12 or 24 weeks (1 study, 60 participants: MD -15.60 mg/dL, 95% CI -34.30 to 3.10), indoxyl sulfate at 12 or 24 weeks (2 studies, 83 participants: MD -4.42 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.83 to 1.35; I² = 0%), or any change in GI upset or intolerance because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Probiotics may have little or no effect on albuminuria at 12 or 24 weeks compared to placebo or no treatment (4 studies, 193 participants: MD 0.02 g/dL, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). For all comparisons, adverse events were poorly reported and were minimal (flatulence, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain) and non-serious, and withdrawals were not related to the study treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very few studies that adequately test biotic supplementation as alternative treatments for improving kidney function, GI symptoms, dialysis outcomes, allograft function, patient-reported outcomes, CVD, cancer, reducing uraemic toxins, and adverse effects. We are not certain whether synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics are more or less effective compared to one another, antibiotics, or standard care for improving patient outcomes in people with CKD. Adverse events were uncommon and mild.

### Effect of prebiotics on gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in children with intestinal failure: a pilot study [^115tGmyP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Paediatric intestinal failure (IF) is a condition where the functional intestinal mass is insufficient to absorb enough nutrients to support growth and well‐being, requiring extensive nutritional support. IF can result from congenital conditions that necessitate substantial bowel resection, such as short bowel syndrome (SBS) or from impairments in bowel motility or epithelial absorption. Patients experience altered gastrointestinal (GI) functioning, GI symptoms and reduced health‐related quality of life (HRQOL). Challenges include malabsorption and poor tolerance to enteral nutrition, necessitating long‐term parenteral nutrition (PN), crucial for survival but depriving the gut of essential nutrients and substrates for the gut flora. The result is enteropathy, poor epithelial barrier function and altered gut microbiota.

Studies have shown reduced bacterial diversity and proteobacteria overabundance in children with IF. This pro‐inflammatory dominance may increase inflammation and reduce gut integrity. PN duration, enteral nutrition tolerance and dietary fibre intake affect microbiota composition. Dysbiosis and bacterial overgrowth may cause symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea and constipation, further hindering enteral nutrition and prolonging PN dependence. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, though they fail to provide long‐term relief, necessitating repeated courses and increasing resistance risk. Prebiotics, non‐digestible components in food, can beneficially impact gut microbes and potentially reduce GI symptoms and complications. Positive outcomes on GI symptoms and HRQOL have been observed in patients with various GI complaints using prebiotics.

In this study, we explore whether supplementing children with IF with a prebiotic blend can alleviate GI symptoms and, consequently, enhance HRQOL.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^114iS64R]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Scientists

Synbiotics present challenges for researchers, including deciphering mechanisms underlying the health benefit and proving that the microbiota are modulated via complementary or synergistic means. Unless appropriate experimental methods of verification are used, the product under assessment should not be referred to as 'synbiotic'.

As for probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics, it might be possible a priori to stratify study participants to enhance either the magnitude of the response or the number of responders to a given synbiotic treatment. The baseline composition of gut microbiota of study participants could be one useful stratification factor. This stratification might improve mechanistic understanding of observed effects and could be useful for characterizing responders and non-responders. Ultimately, this approach could enable better translation of clinical trial outcomes to those who are likely to benefit.

Scientists involved in the publication process (authors, editors, reviewers) should use the term synbiotic correctly and reject erroneous or unsupported use of the term. Even if a given treatment fails to demonstrate an effect (that is, acceptance of the null hypothesis) in a well-conducted study, such results still warrant publication.

Industry

The business community plays a vital part in translating the outcomes of fundamental and clinical research into commercial products that can benefit consumers. To the extent that industry funds research, it is essential that studies adhere to well-established guidelines to manage conflicts of interest and minimize bias. Further, industry bears the duty of responsible manufacture, quality control and marketing of synbiotic products. It is incumbent on industry to follow good manufacturing practices, engage in truthful labelling and product promotion as well as adhere to appropriate use of the term 'synbiotics'.

Prevention with probiotics — probiotics are not associated with substantial risk of serious adverse events and are generally well tolerated, but the cost and burden of chronic preventive therapy may be substantial and a formal cost-effectiveness analysis has not been conducted. Overall, the panel recommended neither in favor of, nor against, the use of probiotics for primary prevention of pouchitis, and most patients who develop pouchitis will respond well to the initial treatment with a 2- to 4-week course of antibiotics.

### Probiotics and prebiotics in gastrointestinal disorders [^112X8u6r]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the clinical efficacy of probiotics and prebiotics in gastrointestinal disorders and examines the mechanisms of action related to their therapeutic effect.

Recent Findings

The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between different microbial species has extended the known mechanism(s) of action of probiotics beyond simple barrier and antimicrobial effects. It has also confirmed that probiotic bacteria modulate mucosal and systemic immune activity and epithelial function. The progressive unraveling of these mechanisms of action has led to new credence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in clinical medicine. Level I evidence now exists for the therapeutic use of probiotics in infectious diarrhea in children, recurrent Clostridium difficile-induced infections and postoperative pouchitis. Level II evidence is emerging for the use of probiotics in other gastrointestinal infections, prevention of postoperative bacterial translocation, irritable bowel syndrome, and in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Nevertheless, one consistent feature has emerged over the past year: Not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic effects. Future clinical trials will need to incorporate this fact into trial planning and design.

Summary

The use of probiotics and prebiotics as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders is rapidly moving into the "mainstream". Mechanisms of action explain the therapeutic effects and randomized; controlled trials provide the necessary evidence for their incorporation into the therapeutic armamentarium.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^1117rsxd]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Trials for synergistic synbiotics

Studies on a synergistic synbiotic that compare the synbiotic to the control can provide supportive evidence but do not constitute the primary evidence needed to confirm a synergistic synbiotic. Instead, a study including the combination, the substrate alone, the live microorganisms alone and a control should be conducted. Using an appropriate statistical model, the aim is to demonstrate that the combined effect is better than the estimated effects of each component separately. Evidence of selective utilization of the substrate by the co-administered live microorganism must be obtained from the same trial demonstrating the health benefit.

Trials for complementary synbiotics

A two-arm parallel or crossover study would be sufficient to test a complementary synbiotic. The aim is to demonstrate that the combination is better than the placebo group with a relevant health end point. As a demonstrated prebiotic is used to formulate a complementary synbiotic, we do not require that selective utilization by the indigenous microbiota be reconfirmed in this clinical trial.

Measurement of selective utilization

Measurement of selective utilization by the microbiota might involve different approaches, including both in vitro model systems and in vivo studies in the target host. For example, selective utilization of a substrate could be demonstrated experimentally using well-established in vitro gut modelsthat include measurement of substrates and products during a prescribed time course. Ultimately, however, studies must be done in the target host to show that specific microorganisms or taxa had been enriched or their activity enhanced by a particular substrate. For synergistic synbiotics, methods that quantify the live microorganism should be used to show that the target strain has indeed been enrichedand other suitable methods can be used to show that its function has been enhanced. Microbiota features that are useful to measure can include characterization of the overall gut microbial community and microbiota diversity, abundance and/or activity of specific taxa, microorganism–microorganism or microorganism–host proximity, the presence and/or abundance of specific microbial genes or gene clusters of interest, and/or metabolite concentrations.

Prebiotics and synbiotics for traveler's diarrhea prevention — In travelers, a prebiotic containing sodium butyrate and short-chain fatty acids reduced traveler's diarrhea (TD) compared with placebo, with the prebiotic group (4.5%) vs. 40% in the placebo group. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a novel galactooligosaccharide mixture showed a significant reduction in diarrhea in the prebiotic group compared with placebo, whereas an oral synbiotic AKSB (Enterococcus faecium and S. cerevisiae plus fructo-oligosaccharide) failed to show benefit.

Definitions of different pro-, pre-, and synbiotics suggested by different investigators are critically discussed. On the basis of this analysis, the probiotic concept is confined to effects exerted by viable microorganisms but is applicable independent of the site of action and route of administration. It therefore may include sites such as the oral cavity, the intestine, the vagina, and the skin.

Safety measures for synbiotics

Prebiotics and probiotics tested to date have a strong safety record –, and synbiotics formulated with them might also be presumed safe for the same intended uses. However, novel formulations must be suitably assessed for safety. Unfortunately, historically, many probiotic and prebiotic intervention trials have not adequately reported the types and frequency of AEs or serious AEs, perhaps owing to expectations that, as food ingredients, these products were inherently safe or that AEs could be due to failure to comply with norms for reporting harms in RCTs. Nonetheless, clear guidance for reporting AEs and serious AEs is provided by CONSORTand these standards should be followed. Describing such events as "unrelated to the study product", without justification for this statement, is unacceptable.

A systematic review of 384 interventions involving prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics found that no safety-related data were reported in 37% of the RCTs and 89 studies only used generic statements to describe AEs. Up to 98% of studies did not provide a definition of AEs or serious AEs, the number of participant withdrawals due to AEs, or the number of AEs and serious AEs per study group. Taken together, these results are evidence that some studies inadequately collect or report data on AEs. van den Nieuwboer and colleagues,– reviewed the AEs reported in studies with probiotic and synbiotic interventions and classified them according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events system; they found that the incidence of AEs in each category was either no different from or often lower in the control groups than in the treatment group.

Thorough safety assessment of a synergistic synbiotic requires consideration that the added microorganism will express enhanced functionality in the presence of a targeted substrate such as improved growth or altered metabolic or physiological activity in vivo. This aspect suggests that safety assessments conducted on the live microorganism in isolation might not be sufficient to enable a conclusion about its safety when paired with a substrate that alters physiology or might in effect alter the dose delivered in vivo. Implications of such an interaction should be considered when assessing the safety of synergistic synbiotics.

### Association of antibiotic exposure with residual cancer burden in HER2-negative early stage breast cancer [^113p7Fzv]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that antibiotic exposure during IO was associated with a higher RCB among those with stage II/III BC. To our knowledge, this is the only study to describe an association of antibiotic usage with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with BC receiving neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in the curative-intent setting.

Our findings add to previous work which has suggested that the use of antibiotics during IO may be detrimental to treatment outcomes in advanced cancers –. Similar to a study that showed that antibiotic use at the same time as neoadjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with decreased rates of pCR and recurrence-free survival among patients with muscle-invasive muscle bladder cancer, our study suggests that antibiotic use may also deter IO benefit in early-stage breast cancer.

Ours, together with previous studies suggest that the gut microbiome could act as a predictive biomarker for IO treatment response. Modica et al. investigated the impact of the gut microbiome on trastuzumab antitumor efficacy in mice models of HER2-positive BC and found that the antitumor activity of trastuzumab decreased after fecal microbiota transplantation from antibiotic-treated donor mice, suggesting a direct involvement of gut microbiome in the efficacy of trastuzumab as well. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanism by which the gut microbiome modulates systemic and anti-tumor immunity.

Our study was limited by a small sample size and should be replicated in larger breast cancer studies. Higher RCB rates and lower pCR in the ATB+ group may be partly attributable to the cohort having medically sicker patients who required more antibiotics as opposed to the interplay between antibiotics and gut microbiome alone; however, we found no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to exposure to pembrolizumab (number of doses or frequency of treatment delays). We did not analyze the results by the duration of antibiotics, their specific timing relative to IO, or their type, and did not assess the gut microbiome directly. More importantly, the temporal change in gut microbiome composition from baseline to post-antibiotic use in both groups is also lacking. Other unmeasured confounding factors that could potentially alter the gut microbiome composition are also not known. Future research should further investigate how combinations of other inter-connected factors like dietary intake, prebiotics, probiotics, prescription medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors), and gastrointestinal infections (Clostridium Difficile), interact with antibiotics and affect the gut microbiome and responses to IO.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^115ug61s]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Another innovative therapeutic approach is being suggested and recommended in several studies worldwide to reduce the use of antibiotics in the clinical management of these uncomplicated cases. Antibiotic treatment should be used in selected cases such as patients with signs of generalized infection, immunosuppressed patients, or conservative nonantibiotic treatment failure. Two systematic reviews have called antibiotic usage into question. The first systematic review identified three RCTs and reported that antibiotic use did not reduce the duration of symptoms or prevent subsequent complications or recurrence. However, we note that the quality of evidence from the included trials was low because of a high risk of bias, and only patients with modified Hinchey stage Ia and Ib were included, thus excluding immunocompromised patients, those with symptoms of sepsis, or significant comorbidity. Data from a RCT by Chabok and colleagues found that antibiotics may reduce complication risk during treatment [relative risk (RR) 0.49; 95% CI 0.12–1.95], but with no statistical significance. A recent systematic review including eight studies with over 2400 patients found no difference in complication rates between patients taking antibiotics and nonantibiotic usage, with only increasing length of hospital stay without antibiotics. Also, a recent multicenter RCT of systemic antibiotic treatment (1.2 g of amoxicillin clavulanic acid/6 h intravenously for a minimum of 48 h and then switched to oral administration of 625 mg/8 h) versus observation with no antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated AD showed that the observational arm was not associated with poorer outcomes.

Recommended antibiotic regimens include ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole, penicillin derivatives such as ampicillin or piperacillin/tazobactam, and third-generation cephalosporin to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Data do not support intravenous antibiotic treatment over oral treatment, and duration of treatment from 4 days to over 7 days does not seem to have any advantage related to clinical outcomes. It should be emphasized, however, that the choice of antimicrobials is entirely empiric, since no trial has compared the efficacy of the different regimens mentioned above.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^113vqJUz]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

As noted, it is required that the health benefit of the synbiotic mixture be confirmed, even when established probiotic(s) and prebiotic(s) (that is, ones that meet criteria stipulated in respective definitions and are used at efficacious doses) are used to formulate components of the synbiotic. This requirement would account for any potential antagonistic effect of the combination that might diminish the health benefits of each component independently. Although unlikely, such antagonism is theoretically possible, as shown in in vitro studies whereby some carbohydrate substrates increased the production of antimicrobial compounds by probiotics. Depending on which microorganism is able to utilize the substrate, which antimicrobial factors are produced, and which taxa are neutralized or killed by them, such a scenario could lead to positive or negative outcomes. Therefore, in the absence of evidence that the combination product provides a health benefit, a product should simply be labelled as "contains probiotics and prebiotics". Sanders et al.provide a perspective on determining whether evidence from studies using one formulation (for example, a prebiotic or a probiotic alone) can be extrapolated to different formulations (for example, when combining a prebiotic and a probiotic).

Section 7. Antibiotic treatment of ACC

Which is the optimal antibiotic treatment for patients with uncomplicated ACC?

7.1 In uncomplicated ACC, we recommend against the routine use of postoperative antibiotics when the focus of infection is controlled by cholecystectomy. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

An open-label non-inferiority prospective controlled trial by Regimbau et al. randomized 414 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for uncomplicated ACC to either no antibiotics after surgery or continuation of the preoperative antibiotic regimen for 5 days. An imputed intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in the incidence of postoperative infection rates: 17% (35 out of 207) in the no-treatment group compared with 15% (31 out of 207) in the antibiotic group (absolute difference 1.93%; 95% CI − 8.98–5.12).

No studies were found on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC.

Which is the optimal antibiotic treatment for patients with complicated ACC?

7.2 In complicated ACC, we recommend prescribing the antimicrobial regimen based on the presumed pathogens involved and the risk factors for major resistance patterns. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Empiric antibiotic treatment should be commenced according to the most frequently isolated microorganisms, taking into consideration the local trends of antibiotic resistance and the availability of drugs. In biliary infections, Gram-negative aerobes, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, and anaerobes, especially Bacteroides fragilis are the most commonly isolated bacteria. The potential pathogenicity of Enterococci in biliary sepsis remains unclear and specific coverage against these microorganisms is not routinely suggested for community-acquired biliary infections. In case of immunosuppression, i.e. transplant patients, infection lead by Enterococcus spp. should be presumed and pre-emptively treated. The main issue related to antibiotic resistance in biliary tract infections remains the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase by Enterobacteriaceae; this is frequently found in community acquired infections in patients with previous exposure to antibiotics.

### New approaches for bacteriotherapy: prebiotics, new-generation probiotics, and synbiotics [^1174JBoy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The gut microbiota has a significant role in human health and disease. Dysbiosis of the intestinal ecosystem contributes to the development of certain illnesses that can be reversed by favorable alterations by probiotics. The published literature was reviewed to identify scientific data showing a relationship between imbalance of gut bacteria and development of diseases that can be improved by biologic products. The medical conditions vary from infectious and antibiotic-associated diarrhea to obesity to chronic neurologic disorders. A number of controlled clinical trials have been performed to show important biologic effects in a number of these conditions through administration of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics. Controlled clinical trials have identified a limited number of prebiotics, probiotic strains, and synbiotics that favorably prevent or improve the symptoms of various disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, infectious and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants, and hepatic encephalopathy. Studies have shown that probiotics alter gut flora and lead to elaboration of flora metabolites that influence health through 1 of 3 general mechanisms: direct antimicrobial effects, enhancement of mucosal barrier integrity, and immune modulation. Restoring the balance of intestinal flora by introducing probiotics for disease prevention and treatment could be beneficial to human health. It is also clear that significant differences exist between different probiotic species. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics together with bioinformatics have allowed us to study the cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host, furthering insight into the next generation of biologic products.

### The post-hematopoietic cell transplantation microbiome: relationships with transplant outcome and potential therapeutic targets [^111dYPik]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Opportunities for intervention

Therapies aimed at modulating intestinal microbiota function can target bacterial energy sources (prebiotics, diet), the bacterial community itself (antibiotic choice, probiotics, FMT) or its metabolites (postbiotics). Their protective or therapeutic potential has been studied in a number of interventional, predominantly single-arm studies.

Prevention of damage by antimicrobials: making the best antimicrobial choices

Antibiotic stewardship is most commonly considered in terms of its benefits in preventing the emergence of pathogens, but broadly speaking it involves the critical evaluation of antibiotic prescribing and use, to protect patients from all harms (including microbiome disruption) caused by the use of antibiotics, while at the same time effectively treating infections. For example, in a retrospective study, Weber and colleagues observed that rifaximin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic with minimal systemic absorption, was equally effective at preventing infectious complications in allogeneic HCT recipients as ciprofloxacin/metronidazole, while sparing bacterial gut communities. Another retrospective analysis found that treatment of neutropenic fever with broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam, was associated with increased GvHD-related mortality while this was not observed when anaerobic-sparing antibiotics, aztreonam and cefepime, were used. Of note, shortening the duration of administration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients with febrile neutropenia without an identifiable infectious cause has been studied and appears to be safe; however, it remains unclear whether the shortened exposure also reduced intestinal dysbiosis in these patients. Other strategies that are currently being developed to prevent antibiotic-mediated microbial disruption include molecules that degrade or neutralize antibiotic residues in the intestinal tract.

### Fiber supplementation protects from antibiotic-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis by modulating gut redox potential [^115nW8c4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis (AID) is a frequent and serious side effect of antibiotic use and mitigating this dysbiosis is a critical therapeutic target. We propose that the host diet can modulate the chemical environment of the gut resulting in changes to the structure and function of the microbiome during antibiotic treatment. Gut dysbiosis is typically characterized by increases in aerobic respiratory bacterial metabolism, redox potential, and abundance of Proteobacteria. In this study, we explore dietary fiber supplements as potential modulators of the chemical environment in the gut to reduce this pattern of dysbiosis. Using defined-diets and whole-genome sequencing of female murine microbiomes during diet modulation and antibiotic treatment, we find that fiber prebiotics significantly reduced the impact of antibiotic treatment on microbiome composition and function. We observe reduced abundance of aerobic bacteria as well as metabolic pathways associated with oxidative metabolism. These metatranscriptomic results are corroborated by chemical measurements of eH and pH suggesting that fiber dampens the dysbiotic effects of antibiotics. This work indicates that fiber may act as a potential therapeutic for AID by modulating bacterial metabolism in the gut to prevent an increase in redox potential and protect commensal microbes during antibiotic treatment.

### The role of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in combating multidrug-resistant organisms [^1146sDS1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms is increasing worldwide, posing a unique challenge to global health care systems. Novel approaches are needed to combat the spread of infection with these organisms. The enteric microbiome, and in particular the resistome, offers a unique target in both the prevention of infection with these organisms and the acquisition and spread within the community. We highlight a novel approach to combat multidrug-resistant organisms: the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics to manipulate the microbiome and resistome. This review summarizes the published literature and clinical trials related to these products to date, with a focus on efficacious trials. It highlights the probable mechanism of action for each product, as well as its safety profile in selective populations. Ultimately, although further research is needed before a definitive statement can be made on the efficacy of any of these 3 interventions, the literature to date offers new hope and a new tool in the arsenal in the fight against bacterial drug resistance.

### Gut microbiota modulation: a novel strategy for prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer [^115r9A3M]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

Research about the role of gut microbiome in colorectal cancer (CRC) is a newly emerging field of study. Gut microbiota modulation, with the aim to reverse established microbial dysbiosis, is a novel strategy for prevention and treatment of CRC. Different strategies including probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have been employed. Although these strategies show promising results, mechanistically by correcting microbiota composition, modulating innate immune system, enhancing gut barrier function, preventing pathogen colonization and exerting selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells, it should be noted that they are accompanied by risks and controversies that can potentially introduce clinical complications. During bench-to-bedside translation, evaluation of risk-and-benefit ratio, as well as patient selection, should be carefully performed. In view of the individualized host response to gut microbiome intervention, developing personalized microbiome therapy may be the key to successful clinical treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: expert review [^111Tw3B1]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 9 — antibiotic therapy principles for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) emphasize that therapy is largely empirical, aims to modulate rather than eradicate microbiota, and should in principle cover both aerobic and anaerobic enteric bacteria; symptom improvement is reported in 46%–90% and breath test negativity in 20%–75%, a meta-analysis found an overall 70% eradication rate for rifaximin with dosing ranging from 800 mg/d for 4 weeks to 1200 mg/d for 7 days, one uncontrolled trial suggested neomycin plus rifaximin might be effective, recurrence after 1 course can be up to 44% at 9 months and is more likely in older subjects, post-appendectomy, and with chronic proton pump inhibitor use, some patients need repeated courses (eg, the first 5–10 days of every month) or continuous therapy and rotating antibiotic regimens are recommended to prevent resistance, SIBO is not a recognized indication for rifaximin in the United States which may affect insurance coverage, and it is not necessary to repeat diagnostic tests for SIBO after antibiotic therapy if gastrointestinal symptoms respond.

### Gut microbiota manipulation with prebiotics in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized controlled trial protocol [^115Hixnm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The planned double blind, randomized clinical trial will determine whether adding prebiotic to a 6-month weight loss intervention will augment improvements in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis attributed to weight loss alone in the placebo group receiving an identical weight loss intervention but without supplementation. The exploration into the mechanisms of action is critically important in advancing treatment options for NAFLD and this study will specifically address de novo lipogenesis and metagenomic analysis of gut microbiota and their associated metabolic by-products (i.e. VOCs). Ultimately this clinical trial will advance our understanding of the magnitude to which NAFLD can be treated with a dietary intervention aimed at modulating the gut microbiota.

The proposed study design using daily packets to be consumed with water prior to a meal is feasible as indicated by our previous research and is similar to soluble fiber supplements already on the market. More promising, however, is the versatility of prebiotics. Foods supplemented with prebiotics are already in production because the physical properties and sweet taste allows manufactures to decrease the caloric value while maintaining the palatability and texture of the food. This ease of incorporation is important given the surge in interest in manipulation of the gut microbiota to prevent or treat conditions such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease. While other options including fecal transplantation and antimicrobial-based interventions are being tested as viable means to manipulate the gut microbiota, targeted dietary interventions such as prebiotics or probiotics are easy to administer and for the most part have good safety and tolerance records. While both prebiotics and probiotics are promising means to manipulate the gut microbiota, unlike prebiotics, probiotics must remain viable during storage and also be capable of surviving the harsh intestinal environment of the host in order to exert their beneficial effects. Additionally, given the well-established health promoting properties of prebiotics and their tolerability, they could be used not only as a treatment but also as a prophylactic.

This trial will assess the ability of a prebiotic to improve overall health in a group at high-risk for a host of metabolic diseases. Improvement in liver health is expected, as are improvements in other predictors of the metabolic syndrome. Ultimately, the research will provide clinical evidence for a potential low-risk treatment option for NAFLD patients. Should the prebiotic intervention prove beneficial, it could have a significant impact on the ability of health professionals to recommend evidence-based targeted dietary interventions for managing NAFLD.

### Synbiotics, prebiotics and probiotics for solid organ transplant recipients [^114xajVv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Solid organ transplantation has seen improvements in both surgical techniques and immunosuppression, achieving prolonged survival. Essential to graft acceptance and post-transplant recovery, immunosuppressive medications are often accompanied by a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and side effects. Apart from GI side effects, long-term exposure to immunosuppressive medications has seen an increase in drug-related morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and malignancy. Non-adherence to immunosuppression can lead to an increased risk of graft failure. Recent research has indicated that any microbial imbalances (otherwise known as gut dysbiosis or leaky gut) may be associated with cardiometabolic diseases in the long term. Current evidence suggests a link between the gut microbiome and the production of putative uraemic toxins, increased gut permeability, and transmural movement of bacteria and endotoxins and inflammation. Early observational and intervention studies have been investigating food-intake patterns, various synbiotic interventions (antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics), and faecal transplants to measure their effects on microbiota in treating cardiometabolic diseases. It is believed high doses of synbiotics, prebiotics and probiotics are able to modify and improve dysbiosis of gut micro-organisms by altering the population of the micro-organisms. With the right balance in the gut flora, a primary benefit is believed to be the suppression of pathogens through immunostimulation and gut barrier enhancement (less permeability of the gut).

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics for recipients of solid organ transplantation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 9 March 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials measuring and reporting the effects of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics, in any combination and any formulation given to solid organ transplant recipients (any age and setting). Two authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Five studies (250 participants) were included in this review. Study participants were adults with a kidney (one study) or liver (four studies) transplant. One study compared a synbiotic to placebo, two studies compared a probiotic to placebo, and two studies compared a synbiotic to a prebiotic. Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor. Most studies were judged to have unclear (or high) risk of bias across most domains. Of the available evidence, meta-analyses undertaken were of limited data from small studies. Across all comparisons, GRADE evaluations for all outcomes were judged to be very low certainty evidence. Very low certainty evidence implies that we are very uncertain about results (not estimable due to lack of data or poor quality). Synbiotics had uncertain effects on the change in microbiota composition (total plasma p-cresol), faecal characteristics, adverse events, kidney function or albumin concentration (1 study, 34 participants) compared to placebo. Probiotics had uncertain effects on GI side effects, infection rates immediately post-transplant, liver function, blood pressure, change in fatty liver, and lipids (1 study, 30 participants) compared to placebo. Synbiotics had uncertain effects on graft health (acute liver rejection) (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.25; 2 studies, 129 participants; I² = 0%), the use of immunosuppression, infection (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.17; I² = 66%), GI function (time to first bowel movement), adverse events (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.59; I² = 20%), serious adverse events (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.36; I² = 81%), death (2 studies, 129 participants), and organ function measures (2 studies; 129 participants) compared to prebiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights the severe lack of high-quality RCTs testing the efficacy of synbiotics, prebiotics or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients. We have identified significant gaps in the evidence. Despite GI symptoms and postoperative infection being the most common reasons for high antibiotic use in this patient population, along with increased morbidity and the growing antimicrobial resistance, we found very few studies that adequately tested these as alternative treatments. There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients, and findings should be viewed with caution. We have identified an area of significant uncertainty about the efficacy of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients. Future research in this field requires adequately powered RCTs comparing synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics separately and with placebo measuring a standard set of core transplant outcomes. Six studies are currently ongoing (822 proposed participants); therefore, it is possible that findings may change with their inclusion in future updates.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115txB9P]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The main strength of the study is the high level of evidence for our quantitative results as we included only randomized controlled trials in our review and meta-analysis. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis and the most comprehensive review of the topic to date. We followed the strict guidelines of Cochrane recommendations and PRISMA Statement when performing our systematic review and meta-analysis, which is strengthening our results.

Although we have identified all relevant studies published on the topic without setting restrictions on microbial variables, we acknowledge the limited availability of eligible articles. Our strict inclusion criterion of using only results from randomized controlled trials ensured the highest level of evidence, despite potentially reduced the number of included articles and cases. This emphasizes the necessity for further high-quality studies. Due to the small sample sizes and the limited number of studies, the results of the meta-analysis of the investigated diversity indices should be handled with criticism. We could not perform a quantitative synthesis of much of the data either due to insufficient reporting and high variability regarding the methods and indices used to measure and describe the gut microbial composition and diversity. ASVs (amplicon sequence variant) are generally considered more accurate method to represent groups of DNA sequences than OTUs as they do not rely on arbitrary similarity thresholds and can identify individual variants within a taxon. However, due to the lack of available studies meeting inclusion criteria using ASV analysis, our meta-analysis utilized OTU data, which did not however hinder the interpretation of consistent results obtained from before-and-after comparisons. Factors such as the use of different bacterial strains as probiotics, varied type and dose of antibiotics, inclusion of subjects with different health conditions (including both diseased and healthy individuals without infections), as well as variations in age across the included studies, could have contributed to the lack of conclusive evidence regarding efficacy. These factors should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results and highlight the need for further research to better understand the impact of these variables on the outcomes.

How to administer fecal microbiota–based therapies — Fecal microbiota–based therapies should be given upon completion of a course of standard of care antibiotics for recurrent CDI and are to prevent recurrence, not for CDI treatment. Suppressive anti-CDI antibiotics (eg, vancomycin) should be used to bridge standard of care antibiotics until fecal microbiota–based therapies are given. Timing guidance includes stopping antibiotics for CDI 1–3 days before conventional FMT; if a bowel purge is given, FMT can be given 1 day after stopping antibiotics; if no bowel purge is given, 3 days of antibiotics is recommended to allow clearance of oral antibiotics. Rarely, patients will recur rapidly (within 1–2 days of stopping CDI antibiotics).

### Microbiotoxicity: antibiotic usage and its unintended harm to the microbiome [^1127zPiE]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONSIDERING MICROBIOTOXICITY WHEN PRESCRIBING ANTIBIOTICS

We propose the term 'microbiotoxicity' when weighing antibiotic side effects on this multitudinous, complex and oft-neglected organ system. By acknowledging the indispensable role of the microbiome in human health, the duty of care of prescribers should be extended to include their patients' microbiomes. In cases of severe infection, these unfortunate microbiotoxic effects may be entirely justified and unavoidable, and we do not suggest withholding antibiotics when clinically indicated. Rather, each antimicrobial prescription should involve careful weighing of the risk of infection against the risk of antibiotic-induced microbiotoxicity (Fig. 2). Current antimicrobial prescribing guidelines rarely consider these bystander effects on the human microbiome. Although we do not propose ignoring such guidelines, we do recognize that current guidance is necessarily incomplete until microbiome considerations are incorporated. Future strategies for mitigating microbiotoxic effects may include use of probiotics alongside antibiotic courses, with meta-analyses suggesting a role for probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections, although further evidence is needed before these can be widely recommended.

The drivers underlying AMR are multifactorial and deeply entrenched, including antibiotic overuse in animal agriculture, population pressure, sanitation and public health infrastructure. Although clinicians may perceive their own patient's clinical needs to be in conflict with tackling the global AMR crisis, invoking the concept of microbiotoxicity may help reframe this by focussing on their own patient's microbial health. This framework may also assist clinicians communicate and negotiate shared decision-making with their patients, especially as public awareness of the microbiome has increased with news and social media reporting.

For a strong recommendation, for the patient, Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, and for the clinician, Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences. For a conditional recommendation, for the patient, The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and for the clinician, Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences. Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision.

### LB: a useful pharmabiotic for the treatment of digestive disorders [^115WQbVD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dysbiosis, a loss of balance between resident bacterial communities and their host, is associated with multiple diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (nonspecific chronic ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), and digestive functional disorders. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotic organisms and, more recently, pharmabiotics, have been shown to modulate the human microbiota. In this review, we provide an overview of the key concepts relating to probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotic organisms, and pharmabiotics, with a focus on available clinical evidence regarding the specific use of a unique pharmabiotic, the strain Lactobacillus acidophilus LB (Lactobacillus boucardii), for the management of gastrointestinal disorders. Since it does not contain living organisms, the administration of L. acidophilus LB is effective and safe as an adjuvant in the treatment of acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, even in the presence of immunosuppression.

### Efficacy of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic administration in improving growth in children aged 0–59 months living in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Fm4tk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The potential health benefits imparted by pre-, pro- or synbiotics have been the subject of extensive research in the past few decades. These 'functional foods' have been demonstrated to modify and reinstate after antibiotic exposure the pre-existing intestinal flora. Prebiotics are important for the development of the intestinal microbiota and the metabolic and immunological systems of the young child, which may have health consequences later in life. Indeed, mixtures of certain prebiotics, such as short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides, when added to infant formula have been shown to increase bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the infant's gut to levels observed in breastfed infants. Studies have evaluated the effects of probiotics on a large number of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The feasibility, safety and acceptability of synbiotic administration in newborns at the community level, including those who are exclusively breastfed, were confirmed in a study of more than 4,500 newborns in rural areas of India, where a synbiotic reduced neonatal sepsis.

### Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for the treatment and prevention of adult dermatological diseases [^114miLGr]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic supplementation is becoming more prevalent nowadays. Clinical studies have demonstrated some of the medical benefits of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics within dermatology but an evidence-based review of their effects in adults is needed.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify evidence for the use of supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics for the prevention and treatment of dermatological diseases in adults.

Data Sources

We conducted a search of the Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials and EMBASE electronic databases from 1 January 1946 to 11 January 2017.

Study Selection

Trials examining supplementation in the treatment of dermatological diseases using oral or topical probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics in adults over the age of 18 years were selected.

Data Extraction

Of 315 articles, 12 met the inclusion criteria.

Data Synthesis

Nutritional supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics was shown to improve atopic dermatitis (AD) symptomatology, quality of life, or clinical severity in six of nine studies. One study in psoriasis was shown to improve inflammatory markers, and one study suggested that probiotics could be used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of acne.

Conclusion

Preliminary studies are optimistic for the use of some strains of probiotics for symptomatic and clinical improvement in AD, and as adjunctive treatment with antibiotics for acne. Further research is necessary to better assess how probiotics and prebiotics may be used within dermatology.

### Feasibility of a dietary intervention to modify gut microbial metabolism in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^117QVeBz]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Several studies showed that the prebiotics inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) increased intestinal microbiota diversity and decreased disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, there is lack of sufficient prospective clinical data on the role of prebiotics in human recipients of allogeneic HCT, and whether it can impact microbiome structure and metabolites. A recent study tested the prebiotic FOS in recipients of allogeneic HCT. This phase 1 trial found that FOS were safe and tolerable when administered at 10 g per day for 21 days in recipients of allogeneic HCT. However, the effects of FOS on the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites with this trial design were fleeting as FOS administration was not associated with any changes in SCFAs in that study. By contrast, our data demonstrate feasibility and prolonged change in microbiome structure and metabolome. This longitudinal impact on the SCFA, butyrate, when taken in light of and compared to other studies exploring the impact of different RS, highlights that RPS may be the more rational and efficient way to change the structure of the intestinal microbiome and metabolites compared to other RS. However, other differences must also be noted, including study design. Specifically, our study design allowed for longer administration of the dietary intervention, which in turn probably translated into more lasting effects on the intestinal microbiota and metabolites after allogeneic HCT. Second, we administered RPS for the first 100 days after allogeneic HCT because during this time there are multiple known risk factors that can negatively alter the microbiome, such as conditioning regimens, antibiotics and inflammation. We also designed the timing of RPS administration, keeping in mind tolerability in this patient population who experience many GI side effects from their conditioning regimens. The rationale for initiating RPS on day −7 is to precede initiation of myeloablative conditioning because tissue injury ensues during or immediately after conditioning. While there are many potential sources for RPS, we chose RPS produced by Bob's Red Mill because it is easily commercially available, economical and previously well tolerated in healthy volunteers. However, we treated and administered RPS by Bob's Red Mill as a medication to allow for stringent and rational quantifiable administration under research pharmacy and on an investigational new drug (IND) application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Pregnancy outcomes in women taking probiotics or prebiotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Jwpg3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

More randomized studies are required that assess the safety or efficacy of taking prebiotics during pregnancy. Pooling the existing studies, we found no evidence that taking probiotics during pregnancy either increases or decreases the risk of preterm birth or other infant and maternal adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, more homogeneous studies in terms of type of probiotics used, length of exposure and women's characteristics are needed. It is important to note that these results might not apply outside the context of randomized research.

### The path towards microbiome-based metabolite treatment [^111DVeDf]. Nature Microbiology (2017). Medium credibility.

The increasing evidence pointing towards the involvement of the gut microbiome in multiple diseases, as well as its plasticity, renders it a desirable potential therapeutic target. Nevertheless, classical therapies based on the consumption of live probiotic bacteria, or their enrichment by prebiotics, exhibit limited efficacy. Recently, a novel therapeutic approach has been suggested based on metabolites secreted, modulated or degraded by the microbiome. As many of the host-microorganism interactions pertaining to human health are mediated by metabolites, this approach may be able to provide therapeutic efficacy while overcoming caveats of current microbiome-targeting therapies, such as colonization resistance and inter-individual variation in microbial composition. In this Perspective, we will discuss the evidence that supports pursuing the metabolite-based therapeutic approach as well as issues critical for its implementation. In a broader context, we will discuss how recent advances in microbiome research may improve and refine current treatment modalities, and the potential of combining them with metabolite-based interventions as a means of achieving a person-specific, integrated and efficient therapy.

### Postbiotic impact on host metabolism and immunity provides therapeutic potential in metabolic disease [^116xae7R]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Prebiotics and Probiotics

The gut microbiota can be targeted by intake of prebiotics, or probiotics, or the combination of prebiotics and probiotics, also known as synbiotics. Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that have health benefits. Prebiotics are defined as nondigestible food ingredients that promote the growth of microorganisms that have health benefits. A number of studies have shown improvements in aspects of metabolic disease using probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in preclinical animal models, but the efficacy of any of these approaches in human clinical studies is unclear. In addition, safety is a concern given that live microorganism ingestion or manipulation may cause horizontal gene transfer and the potential for pathogen expansion and/or infection. For instance, the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes may lead to increased antibiotic resistance. Probiotics are also difficult to produce in a way that delivers the same effective dose, given the need for standardization of bacterial growth, consistently achieving the same dose after production and transport, and the possibility for evolution of the bacterial strain(s). Moreover, certain bacterial strains require rigorous growth and maintenance conditions (eg, sensitivity to oxygen), presenting logistical problems with transportation and storage. Prebiotics lack specificity and it is not yet clear how prebiotics will be developed to specifically promote the growth of beneficial strains in highly variable communities of bacteria between individuals and even within individuals over time. Fecal microbiota transplantation has also been explored as a potential therapy for metabolic diseases, but this approach has many of the same limitations as probiotics and prebiotics. One of the major issues of these prebiotic and probiotic approaches is lack of mechanisms of action directly implicating the host-microbe responses that underpin changes in host metabolism.

### Meta-analysis of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea and the treatment of Clostridium difficile disease [^113mTM2x]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a common complication of most antibiotics and Clostridium difficile disease (CDD), which also is incited by antibiotics, is a leading cause of nosocomial outbreaks of diarrhea and colitis. The use of probiotics for these two related diseases remains controversial.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD and the treatment of CDD based on the published randomized, controlled clinical trials.

Data Sources

PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, NIH registry of clinical trials, metaRegister, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1977 to 2005, unrestricted by language. Secondary searches of reference lists, authors, reviews, commentaries, associated diseases, books, and meeting abstracts.

Study Selection

Trials were included in which specific probiotics given to either prevent or treat the diseases of interest. Trials were required to be randomized, controlled, blinded efficacy trials in humans published in peer-reviewed journals. Trials that were excluded were pre-clinical, safety, Phase 1 studies in volunteers, reviews, duplicate reports, trials of unspecified probiotics, trials of prebiotics, not the disease being studied, or inconsistent outcome measures. Thirty-one of 180 screened studies (totally 3,164 subjects) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

One reviewer identified studies and abstracted data on sample size, population characteristics, treatments, and outcomes.

Data Synthesis

From 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), probiotics significantly reduced the relative risk of AAD (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.31, 0.58, p < 0.001). From six randomized trials, probiotics had significant efficacy for CDD (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.41, 0.85, p = 0.005).

Conclusion

A variety of different types of probiotics show promise as effective therapies for these two diseases. Using meta-analyses, three types of probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and probiotic mixtures) significantly reduced the development of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Only S. boulardii was effective for CDD.

### Exposure to prescribed medication in early life and impacts on gut microbiota and disease development [^111Rbf1H]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Probiotics or prebiotics

The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) has defined probiotics as "live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host". Early probiotic supplementation promotes the colonisation of protective intestinal microflora and the maturation of gut microbiota. For infants, probiotics exert a direct effect on gut microbiota, including a positive effect on potential protective bacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium, and a negative effect on potential pathological microorganisms, such as Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Veillonella. Similarly, prebiotic administration early in life modulates the gut microbiota composition. Supplementation with prebiotics in early life increases the number of beneficial bacteria, primarily Bifidobacterium and occasionally Lactobacillus, and decreases the populations of opportunistic pathogens, such as Clostridium, E. coli and Enterococci. Population-based studies have demonstrated that early-life supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics confers protection against a range of diseases, including infections, IBD, metabolic diseases, allergic diseases, and NDDs.

### A randomized controlled study protocol of the TOBBI trial: the effect of a 6 weeks intervention with synbiotics on the recovery speed of the gut microbiota after antibiotic treatment in Dutch toddlers [^115z5ipC]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Several strategies have been proposed. Some focus on protecting the gut bacteria by inactivating the active compound of the antibiotic in the gut, other strategies focus on supporting the recovery of the gut community after antibiotics-induced dysbiosis through the use of pro- and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Supplementation with probiotics to support the recovery of gut bacteria after a course of antibiotics in children seem ineffective. In contrast to probiotics, prebiotics can affect the recovery of gut bacteria following antibiotic-perturbation by enhancing the growth of bifidobacteria and beta-lactam producing taxa. Prebiotics are non-digestible food components that acts as a food source for beneficial microorganisms, that promote their growth and activity to support host health. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) are two common types of prebiotics. They are naturally found in either (human) milk, fruits and vegetables and are effective in promoting the growth of bifidobacteria in the gut. In this study, we examine the efficacy of a synbiotic: a probiotic combined with prebiotics which provide nutrients for the probiotic, to overcome the challenges that are faced by supplementing probiotics alone, such as its viability in the gut. The beneficial effects of synbiotics on the gut microbiota are shown in various studies. In vitro supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus combined with the prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) resulted in an increase of the abundance in Bifidobacterium genus and an increase in volatile fatty acids in an adults. A clinical trial demonstrated that term infants delivered by cesarean section who were supplemented with the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and the prebiotics 3'- and 6'-sialyllactose had significantly increased intestinal bifidobacteria counts. Furthermore, another clinical trial showed that cesarean section born infants supplemented with a probiotic combination of Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 and the prebiotic galacto-oligosccharides (GOS) showed a significant increase in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus. An in vivo intervention with GOS and a probiotic mixture of a Lactobacillus strain and three Bifidobacterium strains was also found to modulate human gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of potentially beneficial microbial species, such as Lactobacillus spp. Ruminococcus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. that are negatively associated with obesity. Furthermore, another clinical study showed a reduction in asthma-like symptoms in infants one year after the consumption of a Bifidobacterium strain combined with GOS and FOS. However, trials that study the effect of synbiotics on the recovery speed of the gut microbiome after antibiotics are rare, especially involving human subjects. In a study, where mice were supplemented with a mixture of probiotic strains 3 weeks prior and during an antibiotic treatment preserved the Lactobacillales and expanded the Verrucomicrobiales and Bifidobacteriales order, but did not prevent the depletion of Bacteroidales and the short-term proliferation of Enterobacteriales. Unfortunately the study did not focus on the recovery speed of the microbiome.

### Effect of a milk formula with prebiotics on the intestinal microbiota of infants after an antibiotic treatment [^115WKLSN]. Pediatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Antibiotics exert deleterious effects on the intestinal microbiota, favoring the emergence of opportunistic bacteria and diarrhea. Prebiotics are nondigestible food components that stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria. Our aim was to evaluate the effects on the intestinal microbiota of a prebiotic-supplemented milk formula after an antibiotic treatment. A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was carried out in 140 infants 1–2 y of age distributed into two groups after a 1-wk amoxicillin treatment (50 mg/kg/d) for acute bronchitis. The children received for 3 wk > 500 mL/d of a formula with prebiotics (4.5 g/L) or a control without prebiotics. Fecal samples were obtained on d -7 (at the beginning of the antibiotic treatment), on d 0 (end of the treatment and before formula administration), and on d 7 and 21 (during formula administration). Counts of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus-Enterococcus, Clostridium lituseburiense cluster, Clostridium histolyticum cluster, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides-Prevotella were evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and flow cytometry. Tolerance and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily. Amoxicillin decreased total fecal bacteria and increased E. coli. The prebiotic significantly increased bifidobacteria from 8.17 ± 1.46 on d 0 to 8.54 ± 1.20 on d 7 compared with the control 8.22 ± 1.24 on d 0 versus 7.95 ± 1.54 on d 7. The Lactobacillus population showed a similar tendency while the other bacteria were unaffected. No gastrointestinal symptoms were detected during the prebiotic administration. Prebiotics in a milk formula increase fecal bifidobacteria early after amoxicillin treatment without inducing gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis… [^1115eYpP]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

The pooled evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a reduction in AAD. More research is needed to determine which probiotics are associated with the greatest efficacy and for which patients receiving which specific antibiotics. The use of antibiotics that disturb the gastrointestinal flora is associated with clinical symptoms such as diarrhea, which occurs in as many as 30% of patients. 1, 2 Symptoms range from mild and self-limiting to severe, particularly in Clostridium difficile infections, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is an important reason for nonadherence with antibiotic treatment.
3. Two independent reviewers extracted trial details pertaining to the participants, antibiotics and probiotics interventions and comparators, and results regarding diarrhea, using a standardized form. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The primary outcome was the number of participants with diarrhea in each treatment group.

We also extracted other relevant outcomes such as the severity of diarrhea or measures of stool consistency. We extracted probiotics-related adverse effects such as infections because of the administered organism. When more than 1 active treatment group was investigated, we selected the group first mentioned as the main treatment group. The indications for antibiotic use varied across participants in the included studies. The most common indication for antibiotic use in the identified studies was H pylori treatment. In these 15 RCTs, adjunct probiotic use was associated with benefit. In 31 RCTs, it was specified which AAD incidences required treatment, were classified by the authors as severe, led to participants stopping the antibiotics and probiotics treatment, or involved patients testing positive for C difficile.

Adjunct probiotics treatment was associated with reductions in the number of participants experiencing severe occurrences in the studies that reported the presence or absence of these events. In summary, our review found sufficient evidence to conclude that adjunct probiotic administration is associated with a reduced risk of AAD. This generalized conclusion likely obscures heterogeneity in effectiveness among the patients, the antibiotics, and the probiotic strains or blends. Future studies should assess these factors and explicitly assess the possibility of adverse events to better refine our understanding of the use of probiotics to prevent AAD.

### Probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in… [^1166GQYd]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides, and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis. 6, 7. 11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment. The primary end points of the studies included determining the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the number and type of adverse events. The secondary end points of the trials identified the most beneficial probiotic strains and doses, mean duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and microbiome characteristics. The heterogeneity of these trials was moderate.

Patients who did not complete the studies were excluded from the analysis. In 27 of the 33 trials, the primary investigators defined antibiotic-associated diarrhea as being mild or moderate in severity, and it was diagnosed after patients experienced three or more loose or liquid stools per day for at least 48 hours. Eight probiotic species were studied, either alone or in combination. Analyses indicated that probiotics coadministered with antibiotics moderately reduced the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in this patient population compared with active alternative prophylaxis, placebo, and no treatment. Twenty-four studies encompassing 4, 415 participants reported no serious adverse reactions. Nonsevere adverse effects were experienced by 4% of patients receiving probiotics, which was statistically insignificant.

High-dose probiotics were found to be superior in reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea compared with low-dose probiotics. Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus in dosages of 5 to 40 billion CFUs per day were the most beneficial. Findings from eight trials suggested that probiotics may moderately reduce the mean duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by nearly one day. Low-quality, inconclusive data regarding microbiome characteristics were inconsistent with selective reporting and were not clinically useful.

### Effect of probiotic use on antibiotic administration among care home residents… [^117CeBHA]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Does a dose of a daily oral probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 reduce cumulative systemic antibiotic administration days for all-cause, acute infections in care home residents. Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 310 participants, this daily probiotic combination, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce antibiotic administration over 1 year. Objective To determine whether a daily oral probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 compared with placebo reduces antibiotic administration in care home residents.

Design, Setting, and Participants Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 310 care home residents, aged 65 years and older, recruited from 23 care homes in the United Kingdom between December 2016 and May 2018, with last follow-up on October 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was cumulative antibiotic administration days for all-cause infections measured from randomization for up to 1 year. Results. Quiz Ref IDA systematic review of probiotics to reduce antibiotic use for common infections in infants and children included 17 randomized clinical trials that evaluated 13 probiotic formulations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains singly or combined and found that probiotic use was associated with reduced risk of antibiotic.

Care home residents randomized to receive a daily oral probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 were administered significantly more antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections than those randomized to the placebo group (mean 6. 2 days in the probiotic. Three trial-related adverse events were identified and all were in the placebo group; study product was stopped because of choking risk for 1 participant, because of participant-reported worsening diarrhea for another, and because of participant-reported bloating for the third. Quiz Ref IDThis double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial found that the administration of a daily dose of the probiotic combination, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 to care home residents did not result in significantly fewer cumulative systemic antibiotic administration days for all-cause acute infections.

### Multispecies probiotic for the prevention of antibiotic-associated… [^112hxEBd]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The use of the studied probiotic formulation may be considered for diarrhea prevention during antibiotic treatment in children. Importance The efficacy of multispecies probiotic formulations in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea remains unclear. Objective To assess the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the risk of AAD in children. Interventions A multispecies probiotic consisting of Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, for a total dose of 10 billion colony-forming units daily, for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after. The most thoroughly studied preventive intervention for AAD is the administration of probiotics, defined as "live microorganisms, that when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.

"8 According to a 2019 Cochrane review, 2 probiotics as a group have a moderate protective effect on the prevention of pediatric AAD. The parents were instructed to administer 2 sachets of the study product daily to their children for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after, up to a maximum of 17 days, starting within 24 hours of the first antibiotic dose. In this RCT, a multispecies probiotic did not significantly reduce the risk of AAD when analyzed according to the most stringent definition. However, the participants in the probiotic group had a significantly lower overall risk of diarrhea during the antibiotic treatment and 7 days after when the groups were analyzed regardless of diarrhea etiology. The multispecies probiotic used in this trial did not reduce the risk of AAD when analyzed according to the most stringent definition.

However, we found a beneficial effect of the formulation on the overall risk of diarrhea during and 7 days after antibiotic therapy. The latter outcome corresponds well with the standard approach to AAD in clinical practice. Therefore, the use of the studied probiotic may be considered for diarrhea prevention during antibiotic treatment in children. Our study also shows that the AAD outcome definition has a significant effect on clinical trial results and their interpretation.
