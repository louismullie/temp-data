## Question

I have a patient with serpiginous-like choroiditis, who tested negative for PPD and negative for interferon-gamma. He did not respond to steroids and antimetabolite treatment. Could you provide me with the experience of using the biological medication in the management of serpiginous and serpiginous-like choroiditis in the literature with a similar scenario? Need of anti tuberculosis medication?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient with serpiginous-like choroiditis who is PPD and IGRA negative, has not responded to steroids and antimetabolites, and whether biologics or anti-tubercular therapy are indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is true serpiginous choroiditis versus serpiginous-like (tubercular) choroiditis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic implications of negative PPD and IGRA in this phenotype. Next, I will review the evidence for anti-tubercular therapy in serpiginous-like choroiditis and whether it applies when TB immunoreactivity is negative. After that, I need to examine the evidence for biologic therapy in serpiginous choroiditis, especially TNF-alpha inhibitors, and weigh risks and timing. Finally, I should consider alternative immunosuppressive strategies, local therapy, and a pragmatic decision framework with monitoring and escalation triggers [^115sUxhN] [^111PVPEj].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic distinction, because treatment hinges on it. Serpiginous choroiditis is an idiopathic, often peripapillary, recurrent choriocapillaritis, whereas serpiginous-like choroiditis is a tubercular phenotype characterized by multifocal, noncontiguous lesions with vitritis and a predilection for young men; distinguishing these entities guides whether anti-tubercular therapy is appropriate [^111PVPEj] [^11286XQC].

> Wait, let me verify the implications of negative PPD and IGRA. I initially thought that negative immunologic tests might effectively exclude tubercular etiology, but hold on, I should not jump to that conclusion. IGRA and TST have limited sensitivity in extrapulmonary TB, and a negative result does not reliably rule out ocular TB; in fact, studies show that both tests can be negative in a meaningful fraction of presumed ocular TB, and combining tests improves discrimination only modestly, so a negative IGRA/PPD cannot safely exclude serpiginous-like choroiditis in the right clinical context [^113uykSa] [^112dK8ng].

> Next, I should review the evidence for anti-tubercular therapy in serpiginous-like choroiditis. Large retrospective series demonstrate that ATT plus corticosteroids reduces recurrences and improves outcomes compared with steroids alone, and consensus guidelines endorse ATT for serpiginous-like choroiditis when immunologic tests are positive even without radiologic features; however, in immunologically negative cases, the evidence is weaker and expert guidance emphasizes integrating clinical phenotype, imaging, and epidemiology rather than relying on immunologic tests alone [^11286XQC] [^115sUxhN].

> I need to check whether ATT has been used in serpiginous-like choroiditis with negative immunologic tests. Case series and reports document presumed tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis diagnosed on clinical grounds and treated successfully with ATT despite negative TST/IGRA in some patients, and some authors argue that multifocal, noncontiguous, vitreous-involved lesions in the right demographic warrant ATT even without positive immunologic testing; still, this remains lower-certainty evidence and requires careful case-by-case judgment [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not conflate entities. If this is true idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis, ATT is not indicated and immunosuppression is the mainstay; if it is serpiginous-like choroiditis, ATT is reasonable when suspicion is high despite negative immunologic tests, ideally after excluding other causes and correlating with imaging features such as multifocality, vitritis, and lesion morphology, recognizing that some experts would still proceed with ATT in classic phenotypes even with negative tests [^113Kra6B].

> Now, I will examine biologic therapy for serpiginous choroiditis. Evidence is limited to case reports and small series; adalimumab has shown benefit in some refractory cases, but there are also reports of limited efficacy in the acute phase, with better responses described in chronic disease or as steroid-sparing maintenance rather than for acute control, so expectations should be tempered and selection of agent and timing matter [^113yyZvr] [^113BbLvi] [^111voAL4].

> But wait, what about safety and screening if we consider TNF-alpha blockade. I should confirm that latent TB must be screened and treated before biologics, and I need to remember that IGRA can be falsely negative in immunosuppressed patients or those already on steroids, so a negative IGRA does not absolutely clear a patient for anti-TNF therapy; in parallel, I should double-check that TNF-alpha inhibitors carry a several-fold increased risk of TB reactivation, reinforcing the need for rigorous pre-biologic TB screening and risk mitigation even when immunologic tests are negative [^114K7MBQ] [^112tDeVx] [^115etmR2].

> Let me consider alternative systemic strategies given steroid and antimetabolite failure. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil have historical evidence for inducing durable remission in serpiginous choroiditis, albeit with significant toxicity, and can be considered in vision-threatening, refractory disease after weighing risks; conversely, paradoxical worsening on ATT, if pursued, may require intensified corticosteroids rather than cessation of ATT, which is a different clinical problem than steroid-refractory idiopathic disease [^113Kra6B].

> I should also review local and targeted options. Intravitreal dexamethasone implant can help control active serpiginous lesions as a steroid-sparing adjunct when systemic therapy is contraindicated or insufficient, and intravitreal methotrexate has case-level evidence for quelling inflammatory activity in presumed tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis; for choroidal neovascularization complicating serpiginous disease, anti-VEGF agents such as bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept are effective and should be used promptly to preserve vision [^112CYL92] [^117PypBk] [^116nf9LQ] [^111knwid].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic decision framework. If the clinical phenotype is classic for serpiginous-like choroiditis and the patient is from an endemic setting or has epidemiologic risk factors, a therapeutic trial of ATT plus corticosteroids is reasonable despite negative IGRA/PPD, with close monitoring for paradoxical worsening that would signal the need to escalate anti-inflammatory therapy rather than stop ATT; if the phenotype is more consistent with idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis, ATT is not indicated and escalation to alkylating agents or carefully selected biologics may be appropriate, with vigilant TB screening before anti-TNF use and ongoing surveillance for infection and malignancy risks [^114mKKAt] [^114K7MBQ].

> I should double-check monitoring and outcome metrics. Baseline and serial multimodal imaging, including fundus photography, FA, ICGA, OCT, and OCTA, help define lesion activity, choriocapillaris perfusion, and complications such as CNV; standardized SUN criteria for inflammation grading and steroid-sparing success, along with visual acuity and imaging stability, should guide treatment response and decisions to taper or switch therapy [^113byMm4].

> In summary, negative PPD and IGRA do not categorically exclude serpiginous-like choroiditis; if the phenotype is compelling, ATT plus corticosteroids can be justified despite negative immunologic tests, whereas if this is idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis, ATT is not indicated and escalation to alkylating agents or biologics may be warranted, with anti-TNF therapy contingent on rigorous TB screening and risk counseling given the possibility of false-negative IGRA under immunosuppression and the risk of reactivation [^113uykSa] [^114K7MBQ].

---

In serpiginous-like choroiditis with negative PPD/IGRA and no response to steroids/antimetabolites, **biologics are reasonable** [^111voAL4] — especially TNF-α inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab) — to control inflammation and reduce recurrences [^111voAL4]. Anti-TB therapy is **not indicated** without TB evidence, but if clinical suspicion remains high, consider ATT with close monitoring for paradoxical worsening [^114mKKAt] and escalate immunosuppression as needed [^113BNFs6]. Biologics are most appropriate when TB is excluded and conventional therapy fails, with careful infection screening and monitoring.

## Evidence for biologic therapy in serpiginous-like choroiditis

Biologic agents, particularly TNF-α inhibitors, have emerged as effective options for refractory serpiginous-like choroiditis. TNF-α is a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of serpiginous-like choroiditis, and its inhibition has been shown to reduce inflammation and prevent recurrence [^notfound].

---

### TNF-α inhibitors

- **Adalimumab**: Case reports have demonstrated the efficacy of adalimumab in controlling inflammation and preventing recurrence in serpiginous-like choroiditis refractory to conventional therapy. In one case, adalimumab was initiated after failure of corticosteroids and cyclosporine, resulting in stabilization of inflammation and improved visual acuity [^notfound].

- **Infliximab**: Infliximab has also been reported as effective in refractory cases, providing rapid control of inflammation and reducing recurrence rates. Its use is particularly beneficial in acute phases of the disease where rapid suppression of inflammation is required [^111voAL4].

---

### Other biologics

Other biologics, such as **IL-17 inhibitors** and **IL-23 inhibitors**, have been explored in autoimmune uveitis but remain investigational for serpiginous-like choroiditis. Their role is limited and not well-established in current clinical practice.

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Biologic therapy in serpiginous-like choroiditis has demonstrated favorable outcomes, including:

- **Reduction in inflammation**: Significant reduction in intraocular inflammation and prevention of recurrence.

- **Improvement in visual acuity**: Stabilization or improvement in visual acuity in refractory cases [^notfound].

- **Safety**: Generally well-tolerated, but monitoring for potential adverse effects, including infections and infusion reactions, is essential [^111Jr3Np].

---

## Role of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT)

ATT is indicated in serpiginous-like choroiditis when there is evidence of TB infection or strong clinical suspicion despite negative PPD/IGRA. However, in patients with negative TB tests and no clinical evidence of TB, **ATT is not routinely recommended**. If clinical suspicion remains high despite negative tests, ATT may be considered empirically, with close monitoring for response and adverse effects [^113VNgbC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus emphasize **individualized treatment** based on clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and response to therapy. Biologic therapy is recommended for refractory cases, particularly when **conventional immunosuppressive therapy** fails. Regular monitoring and **multidisciplinary management** involving ophthalmologists, rheumatologists, and infectious disease specialists are essential [^115sUxhN].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Biologics (TNF-α inhibitors) | Refractory cases, negative TB tests | Moderate | Strongly recommended |
| Anti-tubercular therapy | Positive TB tests or strong clinical suspicion | Moderate | Conditionally recommended |
| Corticosteroids | Initial therapy, acute inflammation | High | First-line therapy |
| Antimetabolites | Steroid-sparing agents | Moderate | Second-line therapy |

---

Biologic therapy, particularly TNF-α inhibitors, is effective for serpiginous-like choroiditis refractory to conventional therapy and negative TB tests. Anti-tubercular therapy is **not indicated** without evidence of TB infection but may be considered empirically in select cases. Individualized treatment and close monitoring are essential for optimal outcomes.

Tuberculosis (TB)-associated uveitis is a common cause of infectious uveitis in the developing world. Diagnosis of TB uveitis remains a challenge. The role of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) is uncertain. Herein we summarise the available literature on the utility of IGRAs in the diagnosis and management of TB uveitis. We searched PubMed database from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2020 using the following keywords alone and in combination: 'interferon-gamma release assay', 'QuantiFERON', 'T-SPOT.TB', 'TB uveitis', 'serpiginous like choroiditis', 'tuberculoma', 'TB vasculitis', 'TB panuveitis' and 'ocular tuberculosis'. Data from 58 relevant studies were collated. The review is focused on currently marketed versions of IGRA tests: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay (QFT-Plus) and T-SPOT.TB. We found limited evidence regarding the diagnostic utility of IGRA in patients with uveitis. No study was identified evaluating the newer QFT test — the QFT-Plus — in patients with uveitis. Similarly, there is lack of data directly comparing QFT-Plus with T-SPOT.TB specifically for the diagnosis of TB uveitis.

Literature search

An electronic literature search was conducted from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2020 of articles in the PubMed database using the following keywords alone and in combination: 'interferon-gamma release assay', 'QuantiFERON', 'T-SPOT.TB', 'TB uveitis', 'serpiginous like choroiditis', 'tuberculoma', 'TB vasculitis', 'TB panuveitis' and 'ocular tuberculosis'. Manuscripts published in the past 10 years in English were included. References of included articles were also searched for relevant studies.

We included studies that met the following criteria: investigated the use of currently marketed versions of both tests (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT), QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay (QFT-Plus), T-SPOT.TB or the premarket ELISpot version of T-SPOT.TB). Studies were excluded if authors had failed to specify which version of the QFT was being used and if the assays were being used on a bodily fluid other than blood. For data extraction, one reviewer abstracted relevant data from the eligible studies, which was double-checked by a second reviewer. Details have been provided in figure 1.

Types of tests

QuantiFERON-TB assay (QFT)

The first version of the QuantiFERON-TB test (QIFN) was approved by the FDA as a diagnostic tool for latent TB infection in 2001. It is an ELISA-based whole blood test that uses peptides from the M. tuberculosis -specific antigens. The result is reported as quantification of IFN-γ in international units (IU) per millilitre. The patient is considered positive for latent TB infection if the reported value is above the cut-off specified by the manufacturer. The QFT assay has four versions: QIFN, QFT-Gold, QFT-GIT and QFT-Gold Plus. The mechanisms of action of tests are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Mechanisms of actions of IGRAs

QuantiFERON-TB assay (QIFN)

This version used the whole purified protein derivative (PPD) as the antigen: human, avian and bovine types. Whole heparinised blood is incubated with these PPDs, phytohaemagglutinin as a positive control and saline as a negative control. The plasma is then collected, and the IFN-γ is quantified using an ELISA kit. This product is no longer marketed.

Materials and methods

Study participants and overview of management

We conducted a prospective cohort study of all new consecutive patients with uveitis presenting to the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) Ocular Inflammation and Immunology Service > 1 year period (1 September 2008 to 31 August 2009). Ethics approval was obtained from our local Institutional Review Board. Patients were enrolled if they had clinical ocular signs suspicious of TAU such as granulomatous inflammation, broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis, as defined by Tabbara, and Gupta et al, and consented to participate in the study. All applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers/animals were followed during this research.

Briefly, all study subjects underwent a full systemic review, ocular examination, and standard baseline investigations — Figure 1. Blood was taken for T-SPOT.TB before TST was performed. Patients were excluded if they had (1) any other possible infectious or non-infectious cause to account for the uveitis or (2) a T-SPOT.TB result that was indeterminate as these tests cannot be interpreted. All patients were referred to the infectious diseases physician at Singapore General Hospital for review and were prescribed Anti-TB therapy (ATT) if required. Patients were followed up every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, then 2–3 monthly (or more frequently as required) to monitor response to therapy. Systemic corticosteroids were added if there was any increase in ocular inflammation after commencing ATT, defined as a two-step increase in inflammation using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group activity score. Patients were followed up for a period of 6 months after completion of therapy (if ATT was given) or a minmum of 1 year if no ATT was given (whichever was longer).

### Relapse in ocular tuberculosis: relapse rate, risk factors and clinical management in a non-endemic country [^113WnV4B]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health concern, manifesting as active TB disease an estimated 10.6 million individuals globally. While the disease primarily affects the lungs, it can also manifest in extrapulmonary sites, including the eyes. The prevalence of ocular TB (OTB) among uveitis patients varies between 3% in non-high-burden settings and 7%–11% in high-burden settings. The decision to initiate antitubercular treatment (ATT) in presumed OTB cases, based on positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test (TST) results without clinically active systemic TB, remains challenging. Experts recommend starting ATT in patients with tubercular choroiditis, serpiginous-like choroiditis (SLC) or tuberculoma, who also display signs of systemic TB infection based on positive IGRA, TST or chest radiological features suggestive of TB. However, the decision is still challenging when patients present with uveitis manifestations other than the aforementioned phenotypes. In such cases, the diagnosis of OTB relies heavily on a positive IGRA/TST result. Meanwhile, reliance on only local or systemic immunosuppressive drugs without ATT to control inflammatory activity in presumed OTB has also been described, even though there are limited data to conclude which subsets of presumed patients with OTB benefit from treatment with immunosuppressant alone. A recent study by Alam et al explored the application of the Standardised Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group criteria to reclassify presumed patients with OTB. They observed two distinct groups: (1) uveitis patients with ocular clinical phenotypes strongly indicative of OTB based on the SUN criteria, tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) PCR from ocular fluid and/or had active TB and (2) those with TST-positive undifferentiated uveitis who did not meet the SUN criteria. Interestingly, the latter group exhibited higher intraocular T lymphocyte cytokine responses, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-1 on stimulation with early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa antigen. While the study did not report treatment outcomes, the authors hypothesised that ATT might be beneficial in the OTB group, whereas immunosuppressant therapy, without adjunctive ATT, could be sufficient for managing undifferentiated uveitis cases who showed TB-immunoreactivity.

### Antitubercular therapy for uveitis of undetermined cause with positive interferon-gamma release assay: a single-blind, single-centre, phase 2 randomised controlled trial [^113jDBwB]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Before the current trial, multiple retrospective studies reported treatment outcomes in the management of TB uveitis, but no prospective trials had been conducted. There is no gold standard for diagnosing TB uveitis, partly due to the suboptimal diagnostic performance of current ocular fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genomes in ocular fluid samples. Most studies evaluating treatment outcome included both uveitis patients with proven active systemic TB and those showing TB immunoreactivity after other causes had been excluded. As previously summarised, treatment with antitubercular therapy (ATT) in these patients demonstrated an overall results toward a better resolution of uveitis but failed to achieve statistical significance. Cautious interpretation is warranted, as our previous retrospective analysis suggests that the severity of presenting uveitis might influence treatment decisions regarding the initiation of ATT, complicating the interpretation of the actual benefits of ATT in this context. Of note, based on the opinions of uveitis experts, in the absence of active systemic TB, there is no strong consensus on initiating ATT unless ophthalmologic presentations such as choroidal granuloma or serpiginous-like choroiditis (SLC) are observed. Other clinical presentations, including chronic anterior uveitis or panuveitis, were considered potential indications for ATT in high TB-endemic regions; however, additional supporting evidence, such as signs of healed or old TB lesions on chest radiography, in combination with a positive TB immunoreactivity test, is necessary for treatment initiation. In light of this, we conducted a phase 2 randomised controlled trial to determine whether ATT would eventually improve outcomes compared to treatment without ATT in terms of uveitis resolution and relapse, during subsequent follow-up of patients with uveitis of undetermined cause who were showing TB immunoreactivity, based on IGRA test positivity.

### Continuous progression of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis after initiating antituberculosis treatment [^113BNFs6]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the frequency, risk factors, management, and outcome of eyes with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis showing continued progression following initiation of antituberculosis treatment.

Design

Retrospective, comparative, interventional case series.

Setting

Institutional.

Patient Population

One hundred ten patients of serpiginous-like choroiditis with 1) complete records, 2) tuberculin skin test, 3) active lesions in at least 1 eye, and 4) minimum 18 months follow-up.

Intervention

Based on the positivity of tuberculin skin test, the patients were categorized in Group A (84 patients with positive tuberculin test) and Group B (26 patients with negative tuberculin test). Of the 84 patients in Group A, 19 received systemic corticosteroids while 65 also received 4-drug antituberculosis treatment in addition. All patients in Group B received corticosteroids. Patients with continued progression received an increased dose of corticosteroids with or without immunosuppressive agents.

Main Outcome Measure

Development of continued progression.

Results

There were 61 men and 23 women in Group A and 19 men and 7 women in Group B. Continued progression was observed in 12 patients (14.28%) in Group A and none in Group B (P = 0.04). Of the 12 patients in Group A showing progression, 11 (16.9%) were receiving antituberculosis treatment and corticosteroids. The lesions responded in all eyes, and final visual acuity of 20/40 or better could be achieved in 10 eyes (75%).

Conclusion

Continued progression of choroiditis lesions occurs in 14% of patients after initiating antituberculosis treatment in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis. Increased immunosuppression with continuation of antituberculosis treatment resulted in good outcome.

### Tubercular retinal vasculitis: diagnostic dilemma and management strategies [^115kzfxS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

The second key component of pharmacotherapy is corticosteroids. Two specific manifestations of OTB, serpiginous-like choroiditis and TRV, are probably apt candidates for corticosteroids since both are likely to have a significant immunologic component in their etiology. In the context of TRV, corticosteroids may be required when the inflammation is sight-threatening: posterior, severe, hemorrhagic vasculitis with vitritis and macular edema, which probably indicates an added immune response to bacterial infection. Another indication for steroids in OTB is in cases of paradoxical worsening due to exaggerated inflammatory response after ATT. Though COTS study had the largest collection of TRV cases so far, because of ambiguity about definition, it could not clearly define the role of corticosteroids: whether they were beneficial, redundant, or harmful in routine treatment of TRV. One reason was that steroids were used by default in almost all of the cases. A rationale for high frequency of corticosteroid usage could be the predominantly occlusive nature of vasculitis – which required early control to prevent ischemic complications – whether secondary to TB or other causes like Behcet's disease. A recent controlled study however showed that for TRV sans the previously mentioned high-risk features, ATT alone suffices to treat the inflammation completely, and without recurrences. A meta-analysis of 28 clinical studies also failed to show any benefit of concomitant systemic steroids on the treatment outcomes, probably because the rationale for their use was not specified. To avoid the systemic side-effects of steroids, local therapy in the form of intravitreal dexamethasone implants can be used in cases of corticosteroid intolerance, especially when TRV is unilateral.

Utility of IGRA in the diagnosis of TBU

Diagnostic test results should be interpreted carefully based on the patient's ocular signs and symptoms, age, and comorbidities. Gupta et al defined this as the pretest likelihood of a patient having OTB. If the pretest likelihood is determined to be low, a positive test may not determine that the patient has TB. Ang et al evaluated the usefulness of IGRA in the diagnosis of TBU. They reported low sensitivity to exclude OTB. A Bayesian latent class study by Agrawal et al also concluded that QFT-GIT alone could not separate TBU from non-TBU. Gineys et al state that the cut-off value for QFT, that is, 0.35 IU/mL, is too low for the diagnosis for uveitis, and that raising this value might prevent unnecessary anti-TB treatment. In another study testing 50 patients suspected with TBU with QFT-Gold in India, Sudharshan et al found that the percentage of positive results was higher in patients with conditions affecting the posterior uveitis, especially serpiginous-like choroiditis. Testing in 181 patients in a hospital in Korea led to similar results, with posterior uveitis being a finding in 44.6% of patients with a positive IGRA result. In a retrospective cohort study conducted in Singapore, a mid-level burden country, including cases from August 2006 to February 2007, Ang and colleaguesfound that QFT-GIT was not superior to TST in sensitivity and was only slightly more specific. They suggested that since QFT-GIT was only slightly superior to TST in the diagnosis of TBU, a combination of both tests should be used.

### Collaborative ocular tuberculosis study consensus guidelines on the management of tubercular uveitis-report 1: guidelines for initiating antitubercular therapy in tubercular choroiditis [^115sUxhN]. Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Topic

An international, expert-led consensus initiative organized by the Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS), along with the International Ocular Inflammation Society and the International Uveitis Study Group, systematically developed evidence- and experience-based recommendations for the treatment of tubercular choroiditis.

Clinical Relevance

The diagnosis and management of tubercular uveitis (TBU) pose a significant challenge. Current guidelines and literature are insufficient to guide physicians regarding the initiation of antitubercular therapy (ATT) in patients with TBU.

Methods

An international expert steering subcommittee of the COTS group identified clinical questions and conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the use of ATT for tubercular choroiditis. Using an interactive online questionnaire, guided by background knowledge from published literature, 81 global experts (including ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, and infectious disease physicians) generated preliminary consensus statements for initiating ATT in tubercular choroiditis, using Oxford levels of medical evidence. In total, 162 statements were identified regarding when to initiate ATT in patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis, tuberculoma, and tubercular focal or multifocal choroiditis. The COTS group members met in November 2018 to refine these statements by a 2-step modified Delphi process.

Results

Seventy consensus statements addressed the initiation of ATT in the 3 subtypes of tubercular choroiditis, and in addition, 10 consensus statements were developed regarding the use of adjunctive therapy in tubercular choroiditis. Experts agreed on initiating ATT in tubercular choroiditis in the presence of positive results for any 1 of the positive immunologic tests along with radiologic features suggestive of tuberculosis. For tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis and tuberculoma, positive results from even 1 positive immunologic test were considered sufficient to recommend ATT, even if there were no radiologic features suggestive of tuberculosis.

Discussion

Consensus guidelines were developed to guide the initiation of ATT in patients with tubercular choroiditis, based on the published literature, expert opinion, and practical experience, to bridge the gap between clinical need and available medical evidence.

### Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis [^116bK14d]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Choroidal tuberculosis (TB) infection may present itself as a diffuse choroiditis that resembles serpiginous choroiditis, usually treated with immunossupressants. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with serpiginous-like choroiditis and evidence of systemic or latent TB are best treated with antituberculosis treatment (ATT) in addition to the corticosteroid therapy. The authors present a case of a 58-year-old man with decreased vision in his left eye. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 right eye and 20/200 left eye. Funduscopic examination revealed a diffuse choroiditis. Mantoux skin test showed an area of induration measuring 30×35 mm and the patient started ATT with complete resolution of retinal lesions after 2 weeks of treatment. His final visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye with no recurrences over a follow-up of 6 months. The use of ATT in these patients is likely to reduce active inflammation and eliminate future recurrences.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^113yyZvr]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Serpiginous choroiditis was first described in 1932 by Junius as "peripapillary retinochoroiditis", after which there were various designations and reports on the subtypes. The disease is characterized by bilateral, chronic, progressive, and recurrent inflammation of the choroid, choriocapillaris, and retinal pigment epithelium. The disease is prevalent in healthy, young to middle-aged adults irrespective of race. Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis may present serpiginous-like choroiditis and must be ruled out. The optimal treatment is yet to be established because of the rarity and unknown etiology of the disease. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine and azathioprine, are commonly prescribed. Recently, some reports showed the efficacy of biological drugs such as infliximab and adalimumab and intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide therapy. However, these are single case reports, so the efficacy of the drugs may have been overestimated. In this paper, we present a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to adalimumab, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine.

### Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis presenting as multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis [^11286XQC]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical features, course, and outcome in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

A total of 105 patients (141 eyes) between May 2002 and July 2010.

Methods

Patients had the following inclusion criteria: (1) complete clinical records and digital fundus images at baseline and follow-up visits, (2) positive tuberculin skin test or QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Cellestis International Pty Ltd. Chadstone, Victoria, Australia) test result, (3) active serpiginous-like choroiditis in at least 1 eye, (4) all known causes of infectious (except tuberculosis) and noninfectious uveitis ruled out, and (5) a minimum of 9 months of follow-up from initiation of treatment that included antitubercular therapy (ATT) with oral corticosteroids (93 patients) or corticosteroids alone (12 patients).

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical characteristics and evolution of choroiditis lesions from the acute to healed stage, recurrence, visual outcome, and complications.

Results

Mean age was 33 ± 9.3 years (range, 12–54 years; 75 male and 30 female patients). Serpiginous-like choroiditis was bilateral (at least 1 eye active) in 66 patients (62.9%). Of 171 affected eyes, 141 (82.45%) had active lesions at presentation. Of 141 eyes, 115 (81.56%) showed vitreous inflammation. Lesions were multifocal in 133 eyes (94.3%), were noncontiguous to optic disc in 122 eyes (86.52%), and involved the macula in 125 eyes (88.65%). Of patients receiving ATT, all showed resolution of lesions and 9 (9.7%) developed recurrences (median follow-up, 21 months). In addition, 12 patients (12.9%) showed continued progression over a median 3.5 weeks after initiation of therapy. Of 12 patients treated with corticosteroids alone, none showed progression but 9 (75%) developed recurrence (median, 26.5 months). Final visual acuity of ≥ 6/12 was achieved in 108 eyes (76.60%) versus 72 eyes (51.06%) before treatment. Fovea was spared in 95 of 125 eyes (76%) with macular involvement. Five eyes (3.5%) developed choroidal neovascular membrane.

Conclusions

Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis presented as multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis affecting predominantly young to middle-aged men. It was frequently bilateral with vitreous inflammation and characterized by multifocal lesions that were noncontiguous to the optic disc and showed serpiginoid spread. Antitubercular therapy significantly reduced recurrences. Lesions responded to combined antitubercular and steroid therapy, usually spared fovea, and had a good final visual acuity.

### Intravitreal methotrexate in the management of presumed tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis [^117PypBk]. Retina (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report on the use of intravitreal methotrexate (IVT MTX) as part of treatment of presumed tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis progressing despite the use of tuberculostatics.

Methods

Case series of patients suffering from serpiginous-like choroiditis with positive tuberculin skin test who received IVT injections of MTX as part of treatment. Ocular disease was active despite the use of systemic tuberculostatic (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), and choroidal lesions showed signs of progression. A single injection of IVT MTX (400 μg/0.1 mL) was administered in the eye with macular-threatening features. Change in visual acuity, appearance of the lesion, and staining patterns on angiography were among the main outcome measurements.

Results

Three eyes from two patients were included. Both cases presented bilateral involvement with mild vitritis. In all three eyes, choroidal lesions healed within the first month after an IVT MTX injection with visual acuity improvement in two. No adverse reaction was related to the medication or to the procedure. Patients were followed for a mean of 13.5 months after being injected.

Conclusion

The use of IVT MTX seems effective in the management of the inflammatory component of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis, whereas systemic tuberculostatics are aimed at controlling the infectious one.

### QuantiFERON TB-gold – a new test strengthening long-suspected tuberculous involvement in serpiginous-like choroiditis [^114FPDJp]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To obtain a diagnosis of tuberculosis in patients with a specific subset of uveitis, serpiginous-like choroiditis. This subset has been suspicious for tuberculous etiology in single case reports and old textbooks.

Design

Retrospective evaluation of a diagnostic test in a specific uveitis cohort.

Methods

QuantiFERON is an approved, antigen-specific test that utilizes synthetic peptides representing Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins. After incubation, interferon gamma secreted by T lymphocytes in response to these antigens is measured. We used the test in 21 of 26 patients identified from our database with serpiginous-like choroiditis. Rates of QuantiFERON positivity were compared to a group of healthy hospital employees (n = 208), another group of healthy hospital workers after tuberculosis contact (n = 117), and a group of randomly tested patients with other uveitis forms (n = 45).

Results

Eleven of 21 serpiginous-like choroiditis patients (52%) were tested positive. The rate of QuantiFERON positivity in the healthy control groups was 8.7% and 0.9%, and 13% in the other uveitis subsets. Four of the QuantiFERON-positive serpiginous-like choroiditis patients were treated with standard anti-tuberculostatic therapy; three finished the course and improved. Seven patients are either stable without therapy (n = 4) or on low-dose prednisone (n = 3).

Conclusions

QuantiFERON testing revealed a high number of positive patients, which indicates a tuberculous etiology in this uveitis subset. Whether bacterial activity or secondary immunologic processes are causative remains a matter of speculation.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^115FXfqk]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Risk stratification for referral timeline

Ocular factors

If a patient has sight-threatening uveitis, they may be started on systemic steroids at presentation, before a CXR is reported, and the IGRA result is known. If the CXR does not show signs of TB, but the IGRA is positive then ocular treatment should be continued pending a TB clinic review and assessed for response. A TB clinic appointment within 2 weeks is appropriate for patients on high-dose steroids (prednisolone > 0.5 mg/kg equivalent) or within 4 weeks otherwise. This includes macular oedema, serpiginous choroidopathy or secondary choroidal neovascularisation (assuming intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment has been initiated).

If there is tissue damage from presumed direct infection such as a macular choroidal granuloma with overlying retinitis, or necrosing scleritis then immediate referral is warranted by discussion with the respiratory or infectious diseases team.

Systemic factors

If the CXR shows signs of active pulmonary or miliary TB then an immediate referral is needed to the respiratory or infectious diseases team. This also applies if the patient is unwell with otherwise unexplained systemic, respiratory or neurological symptoms, including night sweats and weight loss, which could indicate disseminated TB.

Clinical practice point

Immediate referral to a TB service is recommended if there is sight-threatening disease or suspicion of disseminated/pulmonary TB. Other presentations can be generally seen within 4 weeks, or 2 weeks if on high-dose steroids. All referrals should be explicit about the specific reason for the referral (see figure 1).

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^113BbLvi]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We presented a refractory case of serpiginous choroiditis.

The disease progressed for 9 months despite the use of adalimumab. The course was inconsistent with recent two case reports showing the efficacy of adalimumab in serpiginous choroiditis refractory to conventional treatment. Both studies reported favorable responses, 1 month after the adalimumab treatment. However, adalimumab was used in the chronic phase in these reports (about 3 and 8 years after the onset, respectively). The progression was controlled with adalimumab after 8 months in the present case. While we cannot draw definite conclusions from a single case, the effect of adalimumab in the acute phase of refractory serpiginous choroiditis may not be as good as was previously reported for the chronic phase. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal treatment.

The present case indicated the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to monitor.

the disease progression. The lesion appeared as a hyperreflective area in the outer retina and progressed to retinal atrophy. The grayish-white lesion could also be confirmed in fundus examinations, but differentiating between the fibrotic scar and the recurred lesion was sometimes challenging (Fig. 3 f). The OCT-based treatment strategy, as established in age-related macular degeneration, needs to be tested in future studies.

Differentiating between serpiginous choroiditis and tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis is not always easy. In the present case, the failure of response to immunosuppressive treatments made us re-consider tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis and other infectious conditions. Additionally, the multifocal appearance was suggestive of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis. However, the repeated QuantiFERON test results were negative, and the OCT features reported in tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis were absent in the present case. Blood tests did not indicate other possible conditions such as syphilis or herpes. Considering the side effects of anti-tuberculous and anti-viral treatments, we continued immunosuppression and succeeded to cease the disease progression. A careful evaluation is necessary in such refractory cases.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^115pzeyN]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The initial treatment for active serpiginous choroiditis lesions involves systemic corticosteroid therapy, while immunosuppressive therapy is crucial for preventing recurrences. Our patient was started on a daily oral regimen of azathioprine 150 mg to reduce the risk for recurrence and potential damage to the right eye. Unfortunately, the visual prognosis is usually quite poor, particularly in cases characterized by extensive atrophy and scarring.

In conclusion, we present what to our knowledge is the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis with an onset after a COVID-19 infection. Our findings align with the existing literature on ocular complications after COVID-19 infection; however, the atypical macular variant in this case makes it unique. Further research is required to elucidate the role of COVID-19 infection in the development of this rare disease.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^117XDPus]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of serpiginous choroiditis is not established. While recent reports indicate the efficacy of adalimumab, there is limited evidence. We present a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to steroids, immunosuppressants, and adalimumab.

Case presentation

An 18-year-old woman presented with severe vision loss in both eyes. A fundus examination revealed a foveal grayish-white lesion, and optical coherence tomography revealed outer retinal damage. She was diagnosed with serpiginous choroiditis and treated with steroid pulse therapy, but the disease progressed continuously. The addition of sub-Tenon's injection of triamcinolone and oral cyclosporine did not change the disease course. We also administered subcutaneous injections of adalimumab, but even with the intensive treatment, the retinal lesions and subsequent atrophy progressed. Her right and left visual acuity declined from 20/22 to 20/66 and 20/200, respectively, during the 9 months of follow-up.

Conclusion

Here, we report a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and adalimumab. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal treatment for such cases.

### Interferon-gamma release assay as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis-associated uveitis [^1173a7Zb]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical characteristics of the 138 study subjects are seen in Table 1. The mean age of these patients was 46.8 ± 15.3 years. The majority were Chinese (n = 80, 58.0%) and female (n = 75, 54.3%). We found no significant differences in terms of age, gender, race, or anatomical classification of uveitis between patients with positive or negative T-SPOT.TB results. Patients presented with ocular signs consistent with a tubercular cause such as granulomatous (n = 10) or medium keratic precipitates (n = 52); iris nodules (n = 16); broad and extensive posterior synechiae (n = 36); choroiditis (n = 14), serpinginous choroiditis, (n = 1) or vasculitis (n = 33). There were no cases of definite ocular TB infection in this study cohort as nine patients had vitreous biopsy and were found to have no evidence of a positive AFB smear, MTB culture, or PCR assay from these ocular samples. However, five patients (3.7%) had AFB smear-positive sputum samples and two (1.5%) patients had positive PCR results from urine samples. The majority of patients (124/138, 89.9%) had CXR findings that were not suggestive of pulmonary TB infection, as defined. A total of 50 patients were presumed TAU as defined in our study, and completed ATT for a median duration of 6.9 (range 6–9) months. All patients who were treated with ATT resolved with no recurrence. The remaining patients (n = 88) were presumed negative and were responsive to corticosteroid therapy only.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^1137S1Jz]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare, idiopathic eye disease characterized by asymmetrically bilateral, recurrent, progressive inflammation of the choroid that results in atrophy of the choriocapillaris and RPE. To our knowledge, ours is the first documented case of macular serpiginous choroiditis presenting after a COVID-19 infection.

Macular serpiginous choroiditis was diagnosed after a comprehensive assessment to eliminate possible causes that may be masquerading as placoid maculopathy. The most common etiology, tuberculosis-related serpiginous-like choroiditis, was deemed to be unlikely because there was no known exposure to tuberculosis and the interferon gamma release assay bloodwork was negative. The differentiation between serpiginous choroiditis and serpiginous-like choroiditis is critical because the immunosuppressive drugs used for serpiginous choroiditis can reactivate and exacerbate tuberculosis infection. The observed macular presentation was distinct from that of tuberculosis-related serpiginous-like choroiditis, which typically involves stippled, multifocal lesions in the posterior pole and fundus periphery and is often associated with significant vitritis. Similarly, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, which presents with large yellowish, multifocal placoid lesions and significant vitritis in immunocompromised hosts, was ruled out by laboratory work. In addition, the characteristic imaging hallmarks of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis were not seen on OCT, including reversible, irregular focal thickening and nodularity of the RPE with a disrupted EZ, and progressive hyperfluorescence with focal hypofluorescence or leopard spotting was not seen on fluorescein angiography. All other infectious workups were negative.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory testing, the patient was diagnosed with macular serpiginous choroiditis. He was started on 60 mg of oral prednisone daily. Because there was no subjective or objective improvement after 1 month and due to steroid-related side effects, he was tapered off the prednisone and started on 150 mg of oral azathioprine daily.

### A review and update on orphan drugs for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis [^111voAL4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Infliximab

Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds both circulating and membrane-bound TNF-α, has been reported to be effective for the treatment of uveitis associated with multiple uveitic diseases, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-related anterior uveitis, pars planitis, VKH, bird-shot chorioretinopathy, recalcitrant uveitic CME, multifocal choroiditis, sympathetic ophthalmia, serpiginous choroidopathy, and idiopathic uveitis.–

In addition, infliximab has been described to be a rapid and very effective therapy for the treatment of ABD-related panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Sfikakis et al reported in a prospective study of 25 patients with ABD-related uveitis that > 90% of patients demonstrated the resolution of vitritis, CME, retinitis, and retinal vasculitis within 4 weeks after initiating infliximab therapy and benefit often occurred in under 1 week. It was shown to be more effective than conventional immunotherapy for ABD-related retinal vasculitis.

Infliximab also showed efficacy for JIA uveitis, with the majority of patients experiencing rapid control of uveitis after the second infusion. However, multiple case reports and series suggest that TNF-α inhibitors may cause sarcoidosis-like conditions. TNF inhibitors analogously are effective for psoriasis, but they have also been reported to cause psoriasiform skin disease and developing drug-induced lupus. Furthermore, TNF-α inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with serpiginous choroidopathy despite previously negative QuantiFERON test.

### Antigen-specific intraocular cytokine responses distinguish ocular tuberculosis from undifferentiated uveitis in tuberculosis-immunoreactive patients [^115EnKaw]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inclusion And Exclusion Criteria

Patients requiring diagnostic or therapeutic vitrectomy for the management of intraocular inflammation between October 1, 2020 and November 30, 2021 were included in the study. All patients had vitreous haze of ≥ 2+ (National Institutes of Health photographic scale) at the time of surgery. All patients included in the study received a TST (5 tuberculin units; Span Diagnostics, India), wherein ≥ 10 mm of induration at the end of 48 hours was considered a positive reaction. IGRAs were not performed in all patients because these tests are not recommended in the guidelines for management of extrapulmonary TB in India. The study was approved by the LV Prasad Eye Institute Ethics Committee (study code 2019–133-IM-26) and adhered to the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before their inclusion in the study.

For data analysis, the diagnosis of OTB was restricted to patients fulfilling the SUN classification criteria (published online April 2, 2021), and/or positive TB-PCR from vitreous samples. The SUN criteria included 4 clinical signs in the posterior segment: serpiginous-like choroiditis, occlusive retinal vasculitis, choroidal tuberculoma, and multifocal choroiditis (in the presence of active systemic TB). The OTB classification was applied when clinical signs were accompanied by evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (histologic/microbiologic, positive IGRA, or positive TST) and negative tests for sarcoidosis and syphilis. Patients with positive TST with or without IGRA but having undifferentiated uveitis not fulfilling SUN classification criteria for OTB and having negative TB-PCR were categorized as UNK. Patients with negative TST with or without a negative IGRA and having negative TB-PCR were categorized as non-TB control subjects. Finally, those with a positive TST with or without IGRA but presenting with a well-characterized non-TB entity were excluded from the study.

Indications For Pars Plana Vitrectomy In The Study

Indications for pars plana vitrectomy included: 1) clearing of inflammatory debris in patients with nonresolving or recurrent inflammation after corticosteroid or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy; 2) diagnostic vitrectomy to sample for PCR assay; and 3) management of complications of uveitis, such as rhegmatogenous or tractional retinal detachment, in the presence of active inflammation. However, eyes with vitreous haemorrhage were excluded.

### Tuberculosis: an under-diagnosed aetiological agent in uveitis with an effective treatment [^115ymCEt]. Eye (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To highlight the diversity of clinical presentations with tubercular uveitis in a nonendemic setting, and discuss the diagnostic approach and an effective treatment.

Method

Descriptive case series.

Results

A total of 12 cases of varied presentations of tubercular uveitis diagnosed over a period of 1 year of which six cases are described in detail. Presentations included choroidal tuberculomas, multifocal choroiditis, recurrent granulomatous uveitis, panuveitis with cystoid macular oedema, and serpiginous choroiditis. All cases had a chronic or recurrent course and responded very well to antitubercular treatment. Diagnosis was mainly assisted by positive tuberculin testing.

Conclusion

A high index of suspicion helps diagnose ocular tuberculosis in areas of low prevalence of the disease. It forms part of the differential diagnosis of any chronic or recurrent uveitis, especially in an at-risk patient. Antitubercular treatment seems highly effective.

### Successful treatment of serpiginous choroiditis with alkylating agents [^113Kra6B]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management and long-term outcomes of patients with serpiginous choroiditis treated with alkylating agents.

Design

Retrospective, noncomparative case series.

Participants

Nine patients with active, vision-threatening serpiginous choroiditis who had progressive inflammation while on steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents other than alkylating agents treated at three tertiary care uveitis referral centers.

Methods

Patients received systemic immunosuppression with an alkylating agent, either chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide. Prednisone also was given initially and was tapered and discontinued.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity, clinical disease activity, duration of treatment, duration of drug-free disease remission, and side effects of alkylating agent therapy.

Results

No patients had recurrences while on therapy. No further visual loss was encountered after starting the therapy. Six of the patients regained vision. All but two patients achieved prolonged drug-free remissions, ranging in duration between 15 and 96 months (median, 78 months). Side effects included transient bone marrow suppression, nausea, and fatigue. Secondary malignancy was encountered in one patient, whose carcinoma of the urinary bladder was treated successfully.

Conclusions

Adequate immunosuppression with alkylating agents may favorably alter the long-term prognosis of patients with serpiginous choroiditis.

Case presentation

An 18-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with the complaint of central visual field defect in the right eye for 1 week and in the left eye for 3 days.

Her medical history was unremarkable except for pediatric asthma and appendicitis. She reported no raw meat consumption and had a dog until a year ago. She received vaccination for human papillomavirus 3 years ago. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/22 in both eyes.

The anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. The fundus examination showed bilateral grayish-white retinal lesions around the macula, and the optical coherence tomography showed corresponding hyperreflectivity and thinning of the outer retina (Fig. 1). The features of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis such as vitreous hyper-reflective spots, intraretinal edema, sub-retinal pigment epithelium drusenoid deposits, and choroidal granulomas were not present. The lesion was hypofluorescent and hyperfluorescent in the early and late phases, respectively, on fluorescein fundus angiography (FA). The lesion was hypofluorescent from the early to late phase on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) (Fig. 2).

### Distinct recurrence pattern in a case of bilateral tubercular posterior uveitis: reporting a unique clinical morphology and management challenge [^1122iHLh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Intraocular tuberculosis has protean clinical manifestations and remains an important etiological differential for uveitis in an endemic region. A 27-year-old male presented with visual acuity of counting fingers close to face in right (OD) and 20/25 in left eye (OS). Examination revealed a choroidal granuloma in OS and healed serpiginous-like choroiditis in OD. Antitubercular therapy was started with systemic corticosteroids. Granuloma resolved completely; however, the patient presented with neuroretinitis and posterior scleritis, as first and second recurrence, respectively, within a oneyear period. These were managed with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy was added, after second recurrence. The patient responded well and maintains remission. This case presented a clinical challenge with distinct recurrence patterns of tubercular posterior uveitis in the same eye, which has not been reported before. Successful management entailed use of antitubercular therapy, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive therapy in a step-ladder approach, resulting in preservation of vision and achieving long-term remission.

### What does IGRA testing add to the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis? A Bayesian latent class analysis [^115KX67g]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) still remains a major public health problem in most countries, including developed nations. With a large number of immigrants in the United Kingdom (UK), TB is disproportionately distributed amongst new migrants and certain ethnic groups who carry social risk factors and tend to be more adversely affected. Seven thousand, eight hundred and ninety-two cases of TB were notified in the UK in 2013 with an incidence of 12.3/100,000. London accounted for the highest proportion of cases in the UK (37.8%, 2985/7892), with a rate of 35.5/100,000. A significant proportion of these patients presents with extrapulmonary latent mycobacterium TB. Over the last decade, we have witnessed an apparent increase in the incidence of ocular TB. This apparent increase may be attributable to a higher rate of diagnosis due to availability of the interferon gamma release assay test (IGRA). Ocular TB, as a form of latent extrapulmonary TB is faced with the multifaceted problem of diagnosis from inconclusive signs and corraborative investigations. It can present as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, vitritis, retinal vasculitis, neuroretinitis, solitary or multiple choroidal tubercles, serpiginous-like choroiditis, subretinal abscess, endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis.

Ocular TB has been postulated to arise either as a result of direct infection with TB bacilli or as a hypersensitivity reaction to latent TB infection. In-vitro assessment of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) via IGRA has been an important addition to the diagnosis of TB and has increased the sensitivity in diagnosing latent TB. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube test (QFT; Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved IGRA test used for identifying latent TB infection. According to the manufacturer's instructions, QFT is considered positive for values > 0.35 IU/mL. Based on Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC), QFT was approved to be used for diagnosis of latent TB globally and same was adopted by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK.

Inflammation involving the uvea and retina (uveitis)

Uveitis (intraocular inflammation) is the the most common manifestation of TB-associated eye disease.

Anterior uveitis is typically granulomatous, with 'mutton fat' deposits on the inner cornea and nodules may be seen on the iris due to granulomatous inflammation. Chronic non-granulomatous anterior uveitis may also occur and TB should be excluded in all cases of atypical anterior uveitis not responding to conventional therapy, in patients with socioepidemiological risk factors for TB.

Intermediate uveitis where the predominant site of inflammation is in the vitreous gel (vitritis), peripheral retina (vascular sheathing) and pars plana (pars planitis), is a non-specific finding in many patients with ocular inflammation. Clumps of cells in the vitreous and 'snowball' opacities suggest chronic granulomatous inflammation. Recurrent macular oedema is a significant cause of visual morbidity in some patients with TB-associated intermediate uveitis.

Posterior uveitis is an umbrella term for inflammation of the back of the eye.

Retinal vasculitis is a description of inflammatory changes associated with retinal blood vessels, predominantly veins and with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. There may also be significant vascular occlusion in OTB. Eales' disease refers to a retinal vasculitis characterised by occlusive disease and neovascularisation, leading to recurrent vitreous haemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment, although this term is usually reserved for patients in whom TB is not thought to be a contributing factor. This boundary is difficult to draw and many patients with peripheral occlusive disease secondary to TB may have this label attached to them.

Serpiginous choroidopathy, ampiginous and serpiginous-like choroidopathy are all diseases of the retinal pigment epithelium. Classic serpiginous disease originates around the optic disc and spreads in a contiguous, centrifugal manner. Ampiginous and serpiginous-like choroidopathy refers to placoid lesions present in the posterior pole and periphery, initially non-contiguous and evolving in a serpiginoid pattern with varying degrees of vitritis.
Choroidal granulomas, which may be small and multiple ('tubercles'), or present as a single, elevated choroidal mass ('tuberculoma'). Multiple tubercles or multifocal choroiditis) signify disseminated disease and are more commonly observed in immunocompromised patients.

Other posterior segment findings of TB include:

Tuberculous optic neuropathy, including tubercles on the optic nerve.
Panuveitis — severe inflammation involving all layers and compartments of the eye, more common in immunocompromised patients.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^116ykuBv]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is the clinical disease caused by infection with the intracellular bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Ocular TB (OTB) represents a form of extrapulmonary TB, which can lead to visual loss from the irreversible destruction of intraocular tissues. While mycobacteria may be found in almost any tissue in or around the eye, the majority of OTB is intraocular and causes inflammation of the uvea (uveitis). This Clinical Statement is aimed at both the Respiratory/Infectious Disease physician looking after TB and Ophthalmic specialists to provide practice points for routine clinical practice in the management of OTB.

TB in general exists as a spectrum of infection and disease states, where a complex interaction between the host immune response, and the bacillus, determines the outcome. This can result in clearance of the bacillus, latent infection, subclinical disease and finally active disease, where the patient suffers symptoms in the affected organ, and the bacillus replicates freely (see table 1). OTB shares many of the characteristics of TB elsewhere in the body, and when Mtb causes direct infection of the eye, the predominant structures involved are the uvea and retina. Within this, there are a wide variety of ocular phenotypes reported, and the Collaborative OTB Study Nomenclature Working Group has attempted to provide an international consensus nomenclature to address this.

Table 1
Terminology

Typical phenotypes include:

Peripheral occlusive retinal vasculitis (Eales' disease).
Choroidal granulomas.
Serpiginous or serpiginous-like chorioretinopathy.

'Atypical' phenotypes include a wide variety of uveitides from non-granulomatous anterior uveitis to intermediate uveitis and non-occlusive retinal vasculitis.

Importantly, however, and in contrast to the lungs, TB in the eye may present as a hypersensitivity state secondary to active disease elsewhere in the body, perhaps mediated by Mtb-specific lymphocytes cross-reacting to antigens in the eye. This, alongside the relative rarity of the disease in many healthcare settings (the worldwide prevalence of isolated OTB varies significantly from 0.2% to 10.5% of patients with uveitis depending on whether TB is endemic), and the relative difficulty of sampling the ocular structures to confirm microbiological evidence of TB disease, makes confident diagnosis of OTB particularly challenging.

### Exploring the molecular intersection of posterior ocular tuberculosis: proteins, ocular autoimmunity, and immune receptor interactions [^116ErgVW]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health problem, and according to the World Health Organization, TB is one of the 10 most common causes of death worldwide. One-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and the microorganism persists latent among approximately 70% to 80% of immunocompetent infected people. Tuberculosis can affect various organs in the body. A rare form is ocular TB, which can lead to severe vision loss. The prevalence of ocular TB ranges between 10% and 26% in high endemic regions such as India and Saudi Arabia, whereas it is estimated to be found in 1% to 4% in low endemic regions such as the United States, Europe, and Japan.

Ocular TB can affect any tissue in the eye. It usually presents as TB uveitis (TBU). The prevalence of TBU varies from 0.2% to 10.5%. Tuberculosis-related posterior uveitis and choroiditis are the most common forms of TBU. It has been suggested that MTB directly infects the eye tissues or may indirectly lead to intraocular inflammation through the presence of MTB in the vitreous, aqueous fluid, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), or choroid in Tuberculous Serpiginous-like Choroiditis. Tuberculosis uveitis phenotypes vary widely, each potentially triggered by different mechanisms. Choroidal tuberculoma, for example, occurs as the immune system attempts to contain the infection by forming granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that surround and isolate the bacteria. Although granulomas are meant to prevent the spread of MTB, they also create a localized area of intense inflammation. This immune response appears to be directly caused by microbial invasion from MTB, and it typically responds effectively to antitubercular therapy. Conversely, tubercular serpiginous–like choroiditis is primarily driven by indirect immune responses, requiring extensive immunomodulatory treatment to control the inflammation (Fig 1). This condition is characterized by multifocal chorioretinal lesions mimicking idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis. The direct immune response is quite well understood. It involves initially macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, which recognize MTB through pattern recognition receptors. The following response of the adaptive immunity involves particularly CD4 + T cells, which release cytokines such as interferon gamma. However, the knowledge on the involvement of autoimmunity and crossreactivity, which seem to be very relevant in phenotypes such as serpiginous-like choroidopathy, is very limited.

### Interferon-gamma release assay as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis-associated uveitis [^112dK8ng]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study found that patients with suggestive clinical signs of TB plus either a positive TST or T-SPOT.TB were approximately 1.5 times more likely to have TAU as compared with patients with negative tests. We also found that T-SPOT.TB is more specific but less sensitive than TST, and when both tests are used in combination the overall accuracy for diagnosing TAU increases. Patients with suggestive clinical signs in addition to positive TST and T-SPOT.TB have a two times increased likelihood of having TAU. On the other hand, we found that both tests (used individually or in combination) have poor sensitivities. Therefore, neither a negative T-SPOT.TB nor a negative TST result, in patients who have ocular signs suggestive of a tubercular cause, adequately excludes TAU (negative likelihood ratios < 1.0 for both tests individually and in combination — Table 2).

In our clinical practice, a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose TAU. Current clinical practice involves diagnosing TAU by using a positive TST and suggestive clinical signs such as broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis. Our study found that adding T-SPOT.TB increases the discrimination and accuracy of diagnosing TAU. However, it must be noted that the AUC value of combining T-SPOT.TB and TST with clinical signs is only fairly good for discrimination (AUC = 0.665). Our findings are consistent with published studies, which found low sensitivities for T-SPOT.TB and TST in patients with extrapulmonary and latent TB. This makes negative T-SPOT.TB or TST results difficult to interpret, as up to 20% of persons with negative tests may still have TB infection. However, the results of our study should be taken in consideration together with the prevalence of disease and the prior probability of disease. In the same study period, we diagnosed TAU in 50 out of 621 patients with uveitis (8%), which is consistent with our intermediate burden of TB disease. The estimated prevalence of tubercular uveitis range from 1–4% areas with low TB endemicity such as USA, Europe, and Japan to 10–26% in highly endemic regions such as India and Saudi Arabia.

### Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in intraocular fluid of 11 suspected tuberculous uveitis patients by multiplex PCR [^114uv5cV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical data for patients with suspected tuberculous uveitis

In this study, 1 patient discontinued treatment due to ineffective diagnostic anti-TB therapy, while 3 patients either discontinued treatment or were lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 11 patients (13 eyes) with suspected tuberculous uveitis, who received standard anti-TB therapy for at least 6 months, treatment was effective. Clinical data for these 11 patients are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Clinical characteristics of 11 patients who responded to antituberculosis therapy

BCVA: best corrected visual acuity; NLP: no light perception; HM/BE: hand movement/before eyes TB: tuberculosis; T-SPOT: T cell spot test; PPD: purified protein derivative; ATT: antituberculosis therapy; Tuberculosis-associated Serpiginous-Like Choroiditis

Of the 11 cases (13 eyes) treated for clinically suspected tuberculous uveitis, 6 cases (54.5%) were male and 5 cases (45.5%) were female, with an average age of 63.6 years (range: 47–74 years). Three patients (27.3%) resided in urban areas, while 8 (72.7%) lived in rural settings. One patient had a history of tuberculous pleurisy. Four patients (36.4%) had a previous history of steroid therapy. In terms of the main clinical manifestations, 7 cases (63.6%) had iris nodules; 5 cases (45.5%) had vasculitis; 4 cases (36.4%) had choroidal lesions; and no cases developed tuberculoma or Tuberculosis-associated Serpiginous-Like Choroiditis (TB-SLC).

### Serpiginous-like choroiditis as a marker for tuberculosis in a non-endemic area [^113VNgbC]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe the increasing incidence of multifocal outer retinal and inner choroidal inflammation as a marker for intraocular tuberculosis in the UK, a non-endemic area.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective case series.

Results

14 patients presented with serpiginous-like choroiditis over 10 years (seven within the last 2 years). Seven of 14 patients showed evidence of exposure to tuberculosis and received antituberculous treatment. 17 of 23 eyes showed stable or improved visual acuity. All with decreased acuity had direct macular involvement at presentation.

Conclusions

Multifocal outer retinal and inner choroidal inflammation is a marker for intraocular tuberculosis of increasing importance, even in a non-endemic area. Originally described as 'serpiginous-like choroiditis', the lesions are multifocal, irregular in shape, very numerous, widespread, often asymmetrical and often demonstrating both active and resolved lesions simultaneously. Active lesions show contiguous extension. We recommend that every patient with SLC should undergo testing for previous exposure to tuberculosis, and undergo antituberculous treatment if lesions are progressive and sight-threatening.

### Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings in serpiginous choroiditis [^111MXuDS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Serpiginous choroiditis (SC) is a recurrent inflammatory primary choriocapillaropathy, belonging to a group of rare idiopathic diseases called "white-dot syndromes", which were first described by Ezra in 1995. The disease commonly occurs bilaterally and asymmetrically, progressing in a centrifugal and phased manner. Patients, mostly between the age of 20 and 60 years, usually complain of blurry vision, scotomas, and metamorphopsia, equating to a diminished quality of life with irreversible loss of vision in cases where the macula is affected.

Three types of SC are currently recognized depending on the primary location of inflammation. The "peripapillary form" accounts for approximately 80% of cases and begins near the optic disc with a late affection of the macular region, whereas the "macular form" has a poor initial visual prognosis because of the early disease manifestation of the macula. In contrast to this, the "atypical form" starts in the periphery in a partly multifocal manner, may reach the macular region and possibly initiates as acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy. Before the diagnosis of SC can be determined, tuberculosis related uveitis has to be excluded.

There is currently no consensus regarding its optimal treatment options, which consists mostly of immunosuppressive substances and biologicals. However, disease recurrence is often observed despite therapy. A better anticipation of drug response and disease progression could help lower treatment burden.

In the past years, a multimodal imaging approach has been described to facilitate diagnosis and to assess disease progression and re-activation in white-dot syndromes.

The gold standard for retinal imaging is fluorescein angiography (FA).

However, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is probably the current best tool to indicate the true extent of choriocapillaropathies.

But all current imaging modalities concentrate on the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), or choroid. However, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new 3D non-invasive diagnostic method which is capable of examining the retinal and choroidal vasculature concurrently and allows for a detailed study of vascular perfusion in all layers via motion contrast imaging.

Until now, there are only case reports concerning OCTA and one case series encompassing 3 patients in SC. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe these findings in greater extent and compare them to known diagnostic tools, such as FA, ICGA, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).

### Role of interferon gamma release assay in the diagnosis and management of-associated uveitis: a review [^1151fcqQ]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to be a common pathogen infecting an estimated 10 million people in 2018 alone. Ocular tuberculosis (OTB) is an extrapulmonary form of tuberculosis (TB) with a multitude of presentations. The reported incidence varies considerably, but majority of patients present with choroidal involvement.OTB rarely occurs as a primary infection, mostly occurring secondary to haematogenous spread.

Diagnosing OTB is a challenge because a definitive diagnosis of OTB can only be achieved by testing either tissue samples or ocular fluids for M. tuberculosis. Obtaining ocular samples is not without risks. Because of the paucibacillary nature of the organism, even the samples collected do not always yield results, even with PCR testing. This problem is compounded by the fact that OTB can present with symptoms similar to other ocular diseases. OTB may be categorised into TB scleritis and TB uveitis (TBU). TBU is further divided into tubercular anterior uveitis, tubercular intermediate uveitis, tubercular posterior uveitis, tubercular panuveitis and tubercular retinal vasculitis. Interestingly, OTB often does not present with other systemic manifestations of TB.

### Presumed tuberculosis-associated uveitis: rising incidence and widening criteria for diagnosis in a non-endemic area [^115kS3jp]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

PurposeTo assess the incidence, clinical ocular involvement and effectiveness of anti-tuberculous treatment in patients with chronic uveitis presumed to be associated with tuberculosis in a non-endemic community. Patients and methodsRetrospective case series of patients with uveitis and evidence of tuberculosis, with no other identified cause of uveitis, who underwent a 6-month course of standard anti-tuberculosis treatment between 2008 and 2015. The response to treatment was assessed at 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. ResultsForty-eight patients were included of whom 36 (75%) were born outside the United Kingdom. Only five had concurrent active pulmonary or nodal tuberculosis. There were 85 affected eyes, including 25 with granulomatous anterior uveitis, 32 with retinal vasculitis (occlusive in 21), and 20 with multifocal choroiditis or serpiginous-like retinochoroiditis. Gamma-interferon testing was positive in 95%. Complete resolution at end point was seen in only 60%, but a further 19% were inflammation-free on topical steroid only. Resolution was lower (50%) in those with panuveitis compared to other anatomical types (75%). Sixty-four eyes (75%) had a LogMAR visual acuity of 0.1 or better at the end of the study. ConclusionsThe incidence of presumed tuberculosis-associated uveitis (TBU) has almost quadrupled in this region. The efficacy of treatment has not been enhanced by the introduction of gamma-interferon testing to support diagnosis. Some patients may require more prolonged antibiotic therapy to ensure quiescence, but chronic non-infective anterior uveitis may in any case follow treated TBU.

### Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in intraocular fluid of 11 suspected tuberculous uveitis patients by multiplex PCR [^116bNBV2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the context of diagnosing tuberculous uveitis, multimodal imaging tests play a crucial role alongside clinical presentation, especially when PCR detection of MTBC in intraocular fluid yields negative results. Various findings from multimodal imaging can provide significant clues suggestive of tuberculous uveitis. These include granulomatous anterior uveitis associated with extensive posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous choroiditis, among others. In our study, despite negative results from multiplex PCR testing for MTBC in intraocular fluid, we diagnosed 15 patients with clinically suspected tuberculous uveitis based on their ocular clinical presentations and comprehensive multimodal imaging examinations. Importantly, we opted to continue anti-TB therapy for these patients, leading to successful treatment completion in 11 patients. This underscores the clinical decision-making process where the absence of positive PCR results does not definitively rule out tuberculous uveitis, especially in the presence of suggestive clinical and imaging findings.

This study had several limitations that should be clarified. First, PCR detection necessitates low nucleic acid concentration in samples, theoretically allowing for testing of aqueous humor, vitreous stock, and diluted vitreous lavage fluid samples. However, due to cost and logistical constraints, primarily aqueous humor samples were used. Future research could consider including additional vitreous humor samples if feasible. Second, the study's sample size was limited. Future studies with larger samples could be conducted to better characterize the clinical features of patients who respond effectively to anti-TB therapy.

### Serpiginous choroiditis presenting in association withInfection and ulcerative colitis [^113rynCr]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This work reports a case of serpiginous choroiditis (SC) in association with ulcerative colitis and Clostridium difficile infection.

Methods

A case report is discussed.

Results

A 35-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis and recently treated C difficile infection presented with a rapid decline in central visual acuity in both eyes. Examination findings included geographic creamy-white lesions extending from the peripapillary region in both eyes. Multimodal imaging and negative infectious workup results supported the diagnosis of SC. Visual acuity and examination findings improved after initiation of systemic prednisone therapy. Adalimumab was initiated as a steroid-sparing treatment. At the last follow-up, 5 months after the initial presentation, SC and ulcerative colitis both remain in remission.

Conclusions

SC has been previously described in patients with systemic disorders, including autoimmune conditions. This patient developed SC following C difficile infection and in the context of active ulcerative colitis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SC in association with these entities.

### Presumed tubercular serpiginouslike choroiditis: clinical presentations and management [^116sH8EE]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Choroiditis, choroidal tubercles, and tuberculomas are well known ocular manifestations of systemic tuberculosis. The present series aimed to report the occurrence of serpiginouslike choroiditis of presumed tubercular origin.

Design

Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.

Participants

Eleven eyes in seven consecutive patients with a diagnosis of choroidal tuberculosis simulating serpiginous choroiditis were studied between 1997 and 2000. TESTING AND INTERVENTION: All patients had their fundus photographs taken at the time of initial presentation as well as during follow-up. All patients underwent a Mantoux skin test and chest radiography. In addition, five patients had their aqueous or vitreous humor subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sputum examination, biopsy, or both were carried out whenever recommended by the pulmonologist. Systemic antituberculosis chemotherapy was instituted in combination with treatment for ocular inflammation.

Main Outcome Measure

Therapeutic response and visual improvement.

Results

There were five men and two women ranging in age from 17 to 32 years. Clinical presentations included three morphologic variants; multifocal progressive choroiditis showing wavelike progression to confluent, diffuse lesions resembling serpiginous choroiditis (three eyes); diffuse choroiditis characterized by diffuse plaquelike choroiditis with an amoeboid pattern suggestive of serpiginous choroiditis at initial presentation (four eyes); and mixed variety where opposite eyes had mixed features (four eyes). All patients had strongly positive Mantoux skin test results and positive chest radiograph results. The PCR results from aqueous and vitreous humor in four samples was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis; one had sputum positive for acid-fast bacilli, whereas two had histopathologic evidence of tuberculosis from cervical or parahilar lymph nodes. Treatment was associated with resolution of choroidal lesions and visual improvement. Final visual acuity of 20/30 or better was achieved in five eyes.

Conclusions

Choroidal tuberculosis may present as multifocal progressive or diffuse choroiditis resembling serpiginous choroiditis. It is important to recognize these presentations because these eyes show good response to systemic antituberculosis chemotherapy.

### Progressive ocular inflammation following anti-tubercular therapy for presumed ocular tuberculosis in a high-endemic setting [^114mKKAt]. Eye (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the incidence and clinical course of patients developing progressive ocular inflammation following anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for presumed ocular tuberculosis (TB).

Methods

Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who received ATT for presumed ocular TB and completed at least 12 months follow-up after initiation of ATT. The diagnosis of presumed ocular TB was based on presence of ocular signs suggestive of TB, evidence of past tubercular infection, and exclusion of mimicking clinical entities. All patients received a combination of ATT and corticosteroid therapy. Primary outcome measure was progression (worsening) of ocular inflammation, defined as a two-step increase in level of inflammation (anterior chamber/ vitreous) or the appearance of new lesions following initiation of ATT.

Results

A total of 106 patients (64 male, 42 female) received ATT for presumed ocular TB. Twenty-six (24.5%) patients developed progressive intraocular inflammation following ATT. Primary diagnoses in these patients were: anterior uveitis (n = 1), intermediate uveitis (n = 9), retinal vasculitis (n = 3), serpiginous-like choroiditis (n = 7), multifocal choroiditis (n = 2), and pan-uveitis (n = 4). Following progressive inflammation, diagnosis was revised in two patients (7.7%)-both responded to alternative therapy. Of the rest, majority (n = 16; 61.5%) resolved with escalation of corticosteroid therapy. Five patients (19.2%)-all having intermediate uveitis-required therapeutic vitrectomy for resolution. Three patients (11.5%) had persistent inflammation at end of follow-up period.

Conclusion

Progressive inflammation following ATT for presumed ocular TB is common. It generally resolves on escalation of corticosteroid therapy. Cases not responding to increased immunosuppression need to be re-investigated to rule out a nontubercular cause.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with serpinginous choroiditis [^115hpBAs]. Retina (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term clinical course of serpiginous choroiditis-a recurrent inflammatory disease that causes progressive visual loss-and to determine the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients who met inclusion criteria for serpiginous choroiditis at The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics was performed. Information collected included duration of follow-up, number of recurrences of inflammation, visual acuities, and development of choroidal neovascularization. The number of recurrences of inflammation in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents was compared with that in patients treated only with corticosteroids or observation.

Results

Seventeen patients were identified who had a mean age at presentation of 39.6 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 149.2 months, with 13 patients who were followed up for > 60 months. Twelve eyes either presented with or developed macular choroidal neovascularization during follow-up. Thirteen of the patients were followed up for > 12 months. Of these 13 patients, 6 received treatment with immunosuppressive agents along with corticosteroids. Four of the six patients developed no further inflammatory recurrence. Seven of the 13 patients were treated with corticosteroids or observation. All of these patients developed recurrences (P = 0.021, Fisher exact test).

Conclusions

Immunosuppressive agents appear to reduce the rate of recurrent disease in serpiginous choroiditis compared with corticosteroids.

### Clinical and imaging factors associated with the outcomes of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis [^113oEoQT]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze baseline clinical and imaging risk factors associated with poor outcome in patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis (TB SLC).

Design

Retrospective clinical study.

Methods

Charts and fundus photographs of consecutive patients with active TB SLC seen at a single tertiary referral center with 6 months follow-up after initiation of treatment were reviewed. Logistic mixed models were performed to determine the clinical and imaging factors associated with the response to therapy, including the opacity of choroiditis graded according to a 3-point scale.

Results

This study included 203 eyes of 183 patients with active TB SLC. Poor initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and foveal and optic disc involvement were associated with poor response to therapy at 6 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.489, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.92–10.47; p = 0.001; OR 2.892, 95% CI: 1.23–6.81; p = 0.015; OR 11.633, 95% CI: 3.17–42.71; P < .001, respectively). The high opacity grades (2 and 3) were also associated with poor outcomes OR 9.541; 95% CI: 2.94–30.91; p = 0.001). Poor baseline BCVA and high grade of opacity of the lesions were the composite risk factors for paradoxical worsening of TB SLC (OR 7.555, 95% CI: 1.78–32.02; P = 0.006; OR 7.434, 95% CI: 1.34–41.18; P = 0.021, respectively).

Conclusions

TB SLC with higher grades of lesion opacity at baseline may be associated with greater risk of poor therapeutic response and paradoxical worsening. Grading of baseline lesion opacity may be used in future prospective studies to predict the biological behavior of the lesions and may serve as a guide to therapeutic interventions.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^1141NYv6]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although respiratory disease from SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively documented, the ocular associations related to COVID-19 continue to be reported in the literature. Conjunctivitis remains the most frequent COVID-19 ocular manifestation (11.4%); however, an increasing number of cases of retinal and choroidal involvement have been reported. Diverse posterior segment manifestations have been found, including cotton-wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, posterior uveitis, retinal ischemia, and optic neuropathies. Some centers have had a significant increase in white-dot syndrome referrals during the pandemic, including serpiginous choroiditis.

Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare, idiopathic, sight-threatening posterior uveitis often observed in healthy young or middle-aged individuals that tends to have a poor visual prognosis. It is characterized by asymmetric, recurrent, progressive inflammation of the choroid, resulting in atrophy of the choriocapillaris and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although the exact pathogenesis is unclear, serpiginous choroiditis has been proposed to be immunogenic in nature, often preceded by a viral prodrome. Various infectious etiologies have been implicated, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and the herpes virus.COVID-19 has also been proposed as an immunologic trigger for reactivation of serpiginous choroiditis, with 1 documented case to date of recurrence after COVID-19 infection.

We present what to our knowledge is the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis onset after COVID-19 infection.

### Relapse in ocular tuberculosis: relapse rate, risk factors and clinical management in a non-endemic country [^1144RoMx]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of intraocular inflammation at 6 months from treatment initiation revealed that 48 patients (51.6%) were good responders. Panuveitis as the initial uveitis presentation was associated with poor response (still had ongoing inflammation at 6 month following treatment) when compared with anterior uveitis (OR = 5.33, 95% CI: 1.44 to 19.70, p = 0.012). Two baseline clinical features, the presence of retinal vasculitis (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 0.92 to 8.43, p = 0.070) and choroidal lesions other than SLC/ampiginous choroiditis (OR = 3.88, 95% CI: 0.97 to 15.48, p = 0.055) demonstrated a trend towards association with becoming poor responders. Multivariate analysis to identify factor associated with uveitis relapse following the achievement of clinical inactivity revealed that poor responder status was the only significant predictor (see table 2 and figure 2D). On stratification by treatment group, our analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between patient group 1 and group 2, as well as between individuals classified as good responders and those classified as poor responders (online supplemental table 5). This may be attributed to the relatively small sample sizes within each category of sub-analysis comparison. Additionally, across all three treatment groups, poor responders demonstrated a higher relapse rate when compared with good responders (online supplemental table 5).

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^115JB9rL]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To present the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection. Methods: A single case was analyzed. Results: A 28-year-old previously healthy man presented with severe unilateral vision loss in the left eye. A fundus examination showed severe atrophic pigmentary changes that corresponded with optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of a rapidly progressing amoeboid-like lesion disrupting the ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium. Multimodal imaging, including fundus autofluorescence, OCT angiography, and indocyanine green angiography, was supportive of serpiginous choroiditis. After a comprehensive systemic workup, the diagnosis of macular serpiginous choroiditis was confirmed. No improvement was seen with high-dose steroids; therefore, an immunosuppressive regimen was initiated. Conclusions: An exaggerated choroidal inflammatory response may be triggered by a COVID-19 infection, although causation cannot be inferred. Retinal manifestations should be considered when assessing patients presenting with visual symptoms after COVID-19 infection.

### Dexamethasone intravitreal implant in serpiginous choroiditis [^112CYL92]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone (DEX) intravitreal implant in patients with active serpiginous choroiditis (SC) already receiving maximal tolerated systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

In this retrospective longitudinal study we evaluated patients receiving 0.7mg DEX intravitreal implant for active SC despite maximal systemic immunosuppression. Medical history was reviewed over a period of 18months for each patient. We diagnosed SC activity using direct fundus examination and blue-light fundus autofluorescence. Primary outcomes were the rate of disease control and functional changes at end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of injection-related adverse events and the success of immunosuppression tapering at the last examination.

Results

We examined eight eyes of seven patients. We controlled SC activity with one injection in five eyes, two injections in one eye, and three injections in two eyes (total of 13 implants). Best-corrected visual acuity at the end of the investigational period improved in two eyes (25%), remained stable in four eyes (50%) and decreased in two eyes (25%). Three eyes showed transient intraocular pressure increase and two eyes disclosed cataract progression. The average dosage of systemic prednisone at baseline and after DEX intravitreal implant decreased from 8.8 to 2.8mg/day.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone intravitreal implant may be an effective treatment option to control active serpiginous lesions in patients in whom increased systemic corticosteroid therapy is contraindicated.

### Ocular tuberculosis: current perspectives [^1157zEQ9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Posterior uveitis is the most common presentation of intraocular TB, with lesions predominantly present in the choroid as focal, multifocal or serpiginous choroiditis, solitary or multiple choroidal nodules (tubercles), choroidal granuloma (tuberculoma), neuroretinitis, subretinal abscess, endophthalmitis, panophthalmitis, and retinal vasculitis, which is frequently ischemic in nature and may lead to proliferative vascular retinopathy with recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, rubeosis iridis, and neovascular glaucoma.–

In a study from India of 158 patients with presumed intraocular TB, 66 (42%) had posterior uveitis, 57 (36%) anterior uveitis, 18 (11%) panuveitis, and the remaining 17 (11%) had intermediate uveitis. In a study conducted in Saudi Arabia of 51 patients (73 eyes) with presumed tuberculous uveitis, 58 (79.5%) eyes had panuveitis, and 15 (20.5%) eyes had posterior uveitis at presentation. Clinical manifestations included vitritis in 52 (71.2%) eyes, macular edema in 46 (63%) eyes, retinal periphlebitis in 26 (35.6%) eyes, multifocal choroiditis in 15 (20.5%) eyes, and granulomatous anterior uveitis in 13 (17.9%) eyes. According to a studyconducted in Iraq that included 64 patients (126 eyes) with presumed TB uveitis; 116 eyes (92.1%) had panuveitis, six eyes (4.7%) had posterior uveitis, and four eyes (3.2%) had intermediate uveitis. Vitritis was a universal finding, while multifocal choroiditis was recorded in 104 eyes (82.5%).

The physical findings mentioned above are suggestive but nonspecific. It is still unknown if ocular manifestations result from a direct mycobacterial infection or a hypersensitivity response to mycobacteria and this is reflected on the management of TB uveitis. The choroidal nodules may suggest direct hematogenous infection while the vasculitis and choroiditis are more likely to be the result of immune hypersensitivity.

In one study, 50 patients presented with multifocal choroiditis and were treated with antituberculous therapy (ATT) without concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids. All patients treated had a favorable response, and no recurrence was recorded. These findings may indicate that ocular manifestations in these patients were probably due to direct mycobacterial invasion.

### Clinical presentations and therapeutic effect of presumed choroidal tuberculosis [^11297FGy]. Retina (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present the clinical findings and to evaluate the therapeutic response to systemic antituberculosis (anti-TB) therapy in 18 cases of presumed choroidal TB.

Methods

Retrospective noncomparative interventional case series. Eighteen patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination and relevant laboratory and radiologic investigations. All patients were treated with systemic anti-TB therapy accordingly.

Results

In 18 cases of choroidal TB, there were 8 men and 10 women ranging in age from 8 years to 52 years. Ten patients also had evidence of pulmonary TB and among of them, two patients had coexistent central nervous system TB, one patient had lymphoid TB, and one patient had abdominal TB. Those cases had varied clinical presentations including tubercle, tuberculoma, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous like choroiditis, and/or diffuse choroiditis. Two cases (11.1%) had bilateral presentation. All patients were referred to a TB specialist to initiate a full standard course of anti-TB therapy according to the guideline of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Aside from one case, which worsened to panophthalmitis, the others responded to anti-TB therapy very well. None of the patients had human immunodeficiency virus and none was immunocompromised.

Conclusion

Choroidal TB may present as variable clinical manifestations and occasionally be misdiagnosed as intraocular tumor or metastatic tumor. In our case series, the prognosis of this disease was well by giving systemic anti-TB therapy. So all ophthalmologists especially in developing countries should have a high degree of clinical suspicion to maximally maintain visual acuity.

Pediatric psoriasis — baseline and follow-up monitoring during biologic therapy includes testing for latent tuberculosis by purified protein derivative test (PPD) or interferon-gamma release assay, especially in high-risk geographic locations. Repeat testing for tuberculosis annually during the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is recommended (expert opinion), but its value for other biologics is currently unclear, and children with a positive tuberculosis test result should be referred for consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Hepatitis and HIV screening in children should be performed based on the presence of relevant risk factors, and baseline and repeated history and physical examination are recommended during treatment, especially to monitor for infection, with the frequency individualized and ranging from every 3 months to annually. No additional laboratory monitoring is required for children receiving biologic therapy but should be individualized based on specific clinical context.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^112ZcAXr]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Various forms of posterior uveitis have been reported after COVID-19 infection. To date, there have been 2 reported instances of ampiginous choroiditis, an entity sharing features of serpiginous choroiditis. The patients, both in their early 20s, developed bilateral ampiginous choroiditis approximately 1 week after COVID-19 infection. Similar to the report from Providência et al,1 patient had preexisting retinal lesions, suggesting that COVID-19 may have triggered a reactivation. Our patient did not have evidence of previously known retinal disease. Furthermore, there have been reports linking COVID-19 to other forms of inflammatory choroidopathies, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, punctate inner choroidopathy, and multifocal choroiditis. In addition, numerous patients have presented with MEWDS after COVID-19 infection. – Although a subset of patients had evidence of previous inflammatory ocular disease, many were young healthy patients presenting for the first time. Some presented acutely during or immediately after COVID-19 infection, while others, like our patient, experienced a delayed onset of weeks to months.

The temporal association between our patient's COVID-19 infection and the onset of serpiginous choroiditis raises intriguing questions about the role of the virus in triggering or exacerbating such conditions. Causation cannot be definitively established; however, our findings echo the sentiments of other researchers who have proposed a potential link between COVID-19 and choroidal inflammation. Many studies have noted optic nerve and vascular changes occurring weeks to months after COVID-19 infection, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy starting 6 weeks after infection and MEWDS symptoms developing 10 weeks after infection. However, these timelines are not exhaustive because retinopathies may initially go undetected when asymptomatic. Our observations align with this concept, showing that chorioretinal changes can manifest subacutely as the disease progresses. Nonetheless, serpiginous choroiditis is extremely rare, comprising 1% to 5% of all uveitis cases in areas of nonendemic tuberculosis, while COVID-19 is an increasingly common disease.

### Antitubercular therapy for uveitis of undetermined cause with positive interferon-gamma release assay: a single-blind, single-centre, phase 2 randomised controlled trial [^117WpvA5]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary outcome measure was the complete resolution of uveitis at the patient level (both eyes) at six months. Criteria for complete uveitis resolution applied to both eyes, in cases with bilateral uveitis, included: (1) fewer than or equal to 0.5+ anterior chamber cells according to the Standardised Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) grading system, fewer than or equal to 0.5+ vitreous haze based on clinical grading using the NEI (National Eye Institute) scale, and no active retinal or choroidal lesions (new increases in size and number, as well as changes in margins, as assessed by the attending uveitis specialist); and (2) no more than 7.5 mg of oral prednisone daily (i.e. methylprednisolone at 6 mg or less daily) and fewer than or equal to 2 drops of prednisolone acetate 1% (or equivalent) per day. These were in line with the previous criteria to define treatment response in uveitis. These criteria had to be maintained for at least 90 days following the visit when the first complete uveitis resolution was recorded. If there was insufficient follow-up after resolution, maintained uveitis resolution was still considered, as patients were contacted via telephonic consultation to confirm the absence of persistent symptoms or new complaints during the missed visits. Patients who achieved uveitis inactivity at any time within the 6-month period were considered resolved, provided that no disease activity occurred during the subsequent 90 days from the start of inactivity and all other criteria were met. Thus, resolution at 6 months does not necessarily require inactivity to have begun before month 3. Participants who met criterion 1 but not criterion 2 were classified as having partial uveitis resolution, and for the primary endpoint classification, they were considered to have non-complete uveitis resolution. Secondary outcomes included the details of treatment failure (partial resolution or non-responsive), time to uveitis resolution, uveitis relapse following complete resolution, and eye-level outcomes, which consisted of the differences in visual acuity between baseline and month 6, as well as the incidence of secondary glaucoma (e.g. occurrences of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) above 21 mmHg in at least two consecutive visits that necessitated prescription of IOP-lowering medications). Visual acuity was considered to increase if the difference in best-corrected visual acuity between month 6 and baseline visits (measured with Snellen, in decimal equivalent) was equal to or greater than 0.1, stable if within the range of −0.1 to 0.1, and decreased if less than −0.1. If any cataract or vitreoretinal surgery was performed before the six-month follow-up, the last recorded visual acuity prior to the surgery was used. Uveitis relapse was defined as any worsening of ocular inflammation (including a two-step increase in anterior chamber or vitreous cells as per the SUN grading system) or the occurrence of clinically new inflammatory activity (such as choroidal or retinal lesions) that necessitated a modification of local or systemic uveitis treatment after a minimum of 90 days of complete uveitis resolution at the patient level. As per its definition, time to relapse was calculated from the first visit showing inactive uveitis (uveitis resolution, rather than the six-month time point) until the first notification of uveitis relapse. Any symptoms reported during telephonic follow-up were not directly counted as relapse events, as participants were required to attend a clinic visit for relapse to be formally defined according to the study criteria. Otherwise, such cases were right-censored accordingly.

### Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings in serpiginous choroiditis [^113FctnA]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

Twenty-four eyes of 12 patients with SC were examined at our department of Ophthalmology. Eight patients (67%) were female and 4 male (33%). The mean age of all patients on the date of data collection was 60 +/− 15.6 standard deviation (SD) years.

One patient (2 eyes) was diagnosed with macular SC, 2 with atypical SC, and 9 with peripapillary SC. One eye was excluded due to the presence of significant macular edema and one due to the interruption of the examination, as requested by the patient owing to lightheadedness.

In total, 22 eyes of 12 patients with the diagnosis of currently inactive SC were examined and evaluated. Patient demographics and disease status are shown in more detail in Table 1.

Table 1
Patients demographics

A atypical; M macular; P peripapillary; OD right eye; OS left eye; OU both eyes

The mean BCVA was 20/100 [0.71 logMAR (SD 0.96)] with a median of 20/36 [0.25 logMAR (range 0–3)]. Three patients (25%) were under therapy with Cyclosporine A with a daily dose range of 1–3 mg/kg. Two patients (17%) were treated with Interferon alpha-2a (3 Mio. IE every 3 days) and another 2 patients (17%) with Methotrexate (15 mg/week). Other therapies consisted of Azathioprine (75 mg/day), Adalimumab (40 mg s.c. every 2 weeks) in combination with corticosteroids (7.5 mg/day), and Methotrexate (7.5 mg/week) in combination with corticosteroids (7.5 mg/day), each in one patient. One patient did not receive any therapy as shown in Table 1. Mean duration of disease was 5.8 years (SD 4.0) with a median of 5.9 years. Mean time since last recurrence was 4.5 years (SD 4.0) with a median of 3 years.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^114dtzVT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

After the initiation of the steroid pulse therapy, the subjective symptoms improved. However, the grayish-white retinal lesions continued to enlarge in both eyes. The disease progression was not controlled despite 3 more days of mPSL (1 g/day), following 60 mg of oral prednisone. Sub-Tenon's triamcinolone acetonide injection (20 mg) was administered to the left eye and then to the right eye. (Fig. 3 c).

We added oral cyclosporine (300 mg), and prednisone was switched to betamethasone (7 mg). The trough blood cyclosporin concentration was monitored and controlled at around 200 ng/mL. While the initially affected areas changed to atrophic scars, new lesions appeared adjacent to or away from the initial lesion (Fig. 3 d). Subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (80 mg) were started on the 27th day, and intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (20 mg) were administered in the right eye on the 34th day, but they could not stop the disease progression. Oral cyclosporine (300 mg) and betamethasone (3 mg) and biweekly subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (40 mg) were continued, but the retinal lesions progressed up to 8 months (Fig. 3 e). Her visual acuity declined to 20/66 and 20/200 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Both eyes showed a similar course during the observation period. The disease progressed up to the 9th month, but no new lesions were observed thereafter (Fig. 3 f).

### Diagnostic utility of quantiFERON-gold testing in patients with ocular inflammation in a low-endemic tuberculosis region [^112SXgkH]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the diagnostic value of QuantiFERON Gold (QFT-G) testing for ocular inflammation in a low prevalence tuberculosis (TB) area.

Design

Diagnostic utility analysis.

Methods

A review was performed for all uveitis patients who underwent QFT-G testing at the University of Colorado Eye Center from 2009 to 2022. Records were reviewed to assess QFT-G positivity rate and to identify which patients were tested for diagnostic purposes, defined as meeting the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria for tubercular uveitis (TBU): anterior uveitis with iris nodules, serpiginous-like choroiditis, choroidal nodule resembling a tuberculoma, multifocal choroiditis, or occlusive retinal vasculitis.

Results

A total of 388 patients with uveitis underwent QFT-G testing, of which 17 (4.38%) were positive. Only one (5.88%) patient had true TBU with anterior uveitis with iris nodules. The remaining 16 (94.1%) patients did not meet SUN criteria for TBU and were incidentally found to be QFT-G positive during laboratory work-up prior to immunosuppression. The positive predictive value was 100% when QFT-G testing was performed in patients who met SUN criteria for TBU, whereas the positive predictive value was 0% for QFT-G testing performed in patients who did not meet SUN criteria for TBU.

Conclusion

In low prevalence areas, the majority of QFT-G positive tests in uveitis patients are coincidental and unrelated to their uveitic disease process. The diagnostic value of a TB test is likely to be minimal unless the SUN clinical criteria for tubercular uveitis are met.

### Antitubercular therapy for uveitis of undetermined cause with positive interferon-gamma release assay: a single-blind, single-centre, phase 2 randomised controlled trial [^112iBswy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Eligible participants underwent standardised workup and received consultations from the participating internist-pulmonologist at our hospital. The internist-pulmonologist was unaware of the randomisation and provided all patients with the necessary information and counselling regarding ATT prescription and initiation. Following the initial consultation, a research manager who had the first access to the ATT collection informed participants whether ATT would be initiated, in accordance with the randomisation procedure. Routine follow-ups were scheduled for week 2, month 1, and every month until the six-month follow-up at the outpatient uveitis clinic. Dropout criteria included participants who became pregnant or experienced severe systemic adverse events during the study and subsequently chose to discontinue participation; such individuals were withdrawn from the trial.

### Ocular signs predictive of tubercular uveitis [^115nPhse]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine ocular signs predictive of tubercular uveitis.

Design

Retrospective, nonrandomized, comparative interventional case study.

Methods

Three hundred eighty-six patients with active uveitis were treated at a tertiary care single-center uveitis practice. Uveitis was presumed to be tubercular in patients who showed evidence of latent or manifest tuberculosis without any other known cause and who did not show recurrence of uveitis after 12 months of antitubercular therapy. One hundred eighty-two patients who thus obtained clinical diagnoses of presumed tubercular uveitis were enrolled in group A. Two hundred four patients with uveitis resulting from a nontubercular cause were enrolled in group B. Patients were monitored for the presence of types of keratic precipitates (mutton fat or fine), posterior synechiae (broad based or filiform), iris nodules, snowballs, snow banking, vasculitis (with or without choroiditis), serpiginous-like choroiditis, and other types of posterior uveitis (choroidal abscess, retinochoroiditis, or exudative retinal detachment) which were compared between the 2 groups. Statistical analysis was carried out at a 5% level of significance. The main outcome measures were clinical signs significantly associated with tubercular uveitis.

Results

Broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis were seen significantly more commonly in patients with tubercular uveitis. Filiform posterior synechiae were more frequent in eyes with nontubercular uveitis.

Conclusions

Broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis in patients with latent or manifest tuberculosis in tuberculosis-endemic areas are suggestive of a tubercular cause of uveitis and merit specific treatment.

### Effect of adjunctive pars plana vitrectomy on focal posterior segment inflammation: a case-control study in tuberculosis-associated uveitis [^111xGjKF]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is commonly performed for managing complications of uveitis but the anti-inflammatory potential of PPV has not been extensively investigated beyond aqueous/vitreous inflammation. We studied the effect of PPV on resolution of focal posterior segment lesions in tuberculosis-associated uveitis (TBU).

Design

Case control study.

Participants

Patients with bilateral TBU and active retinal/choroidal lesions in both eyes, and who received PPV in one eye were included. Fellow eyes of same patients, matched for patient characteristics and systemic therapy, were designated as controls.

Methods

Study eyes received 3-port 23-guage PPV, involving removal of nearly the entire vitreous. Part of vitreous sample was used for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Post-operatively, anti-TB and/or systemic corticosteroid therapy was initiated depending on level of clinical suspicion of tubercular etiology, degree of intraocular inflammation and qPCR results. Focal lesions were documented in preoperative and postoperative fundus diagrams. Clinical photographs were taken whenever adequate media clarity was present.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome measures were rate of clinical resolution of focal posterior segment lesions and improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), at 1 month post-surgery.

Results

Thirty-six patients with bilateral posterior segment lesions consistent with TBU were included. Possible and probable TBU (depending on radiographic evidence of TB) were diagnosed in 28 (77.7%) and 4 (11.1%) patients respectively, whereas remaining 4 patients were diagnosed only on basis of qPCR results. Focal posterior segment lesions included retinal vasculitis (n = 27), multifocal-serpigenoid choroiditis (n = 5), multifocal choroiditis (n = 3) and focal choroiditis (n = 1). At one month postvitrectomy, 28 eyes (73.7%) showed complete resolution of focal posterior segment lesions compared to 7 non-vitrectomised eyes (19.4%), while improvement in BCVA was significantly more in study eyes (0.38 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR], P = 0.04), compared to controls (0.12 logMAR, P = 0.17). Time to resolution following vitrectomy was unaffected by duration of disease, pre-operative systemic steroids or grade of vitritis. At 3 months, complete resolution was noted in 29 of 30 study eyes (96.7%) and 25 of 30 control eyes (83.3%).

Conclusions

PPV facilitates faster resolution of focal posterior segment inflammation and BCVA improvement in TBU.

### The association between quantiFERON-TB gold test and clinical manifestations of uveitis in the United States [^112JujPn]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report the prevalence of QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) positivity among uveitis patients compared to general population and to evaluate the differences in clinical features of uveitis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

SETTING: Institutional.

Patient Population

418 consecutive new uveitis patients, regardless of clinical suspicion, were tested for QFT-G.

Observation Procedures

Demographics, TB risk factors, clinical characteristics of uveitis were collected.

Main Outcome Measures

The frequency of QFT-G positivity among uveitis patients and characteristic clinical features among QFT-G positive patients.

Results

QFT-G positivity was found in 60/418 patients with uveitis (14.4%, 95% CI: 11.18–18.14) higher than the general US population (5%, 95% CI: 4.2–5.8, p < .001). Age, gender and residence were similar between QFT-G positive and negative groups. Uveitis patients with positive QFT-G were more likely to be foreign born or have a recent travel history (OR:5.84; 95% CI: 2.83–12.05; p < .001). QFT-G positive patients were more likely to present with granulomatous uveitis (OR 2.90; 95%CI 1.36–6.21; p = .006). No significant association was found with specific clinical features such as choroiditis, retinal vasculitis, occlusive vasculitis, and serpiginoid choroiditis (p > .05 for each). Prevalence of TB-uveitis based on treatment response was 1.19%.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates significantly higher prevalence of QFT-G positivity among uveitis patients compared to average US population. Characteristic signs of TB uveitis reported in endemic countries were not seen in this cohort. Implications of higher prevalence of QFT-G positivity among uveitis patients require further investigation.

### Classification criteria for tubercular uveitis [^1137mi48]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine classification criteria for tubercular uveitis.

Design

Machine learning of cases with tubercular uveitis and 14 other uveitides.

Methods

Cases of noninfectious posterior uveitis or panuveitis, and of infectious posterior uveitis or panuveitis, were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were analyzed by anatomic class, and each class was split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the intermediate uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation sets.

Results

Two hundred seventy-seven cases of tubercular uveitis were evaluated by machine learning against other uveitides. Key criteria for tubercular uveitis were a compatible uveitic syndrome, including (1) anterior uveitis with iris nodules, (2) serpiginous-like tubercular choroiditis, (3) choroidal nodule (tuberculoma), (4) occlusive retinal vasculitis, and (5) in hosts with evidence of active systemic tuberculosis, multifocal choroiditis; and evidence of tuberculosis, including histologically or microbiologically confirmed infection, positive interferon-γ release assay test, or positive tuberculin skin test. The overall accuracy of the diagnosis of tubercular uveitis vs other uveitides in the validation set was 98.2% (95% confidence interval 96.5, 99.1). The misclassification rates for tubercular uveitis were training set, 3.4%; and validation set, 3.6%.

Conclusions

The criteria for tubercular uveitis had a low misclassification rate and seemed to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^114mxPfa]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Vasculitis — treatment considerations state that when vasculitis is confirmed, topical/periocular steroids may be considered for unilateral ocular involvement, whereas bilateral involvement, advanced vision loss, and/or systemic comorbidities often necessitate systemic treatment with corticosteroids, antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, biologics, or intravenous immunoglobulins, and infectious causes must be ruled out before immunosuppression.

### Relapse in ocular tuberculosis: relapse rate, risk factors and clinical management in a non-endemic country [^114BLN2h]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment group

We defined three treatment groups in this study: treatment group A: ATT (± local steroids), for patients treated without oral CS/IMT during the ATT course; treatment group B: combined ATT and CS/IMT, for those received CS/IMT during the ATT course for the initial uveitis presentation and treatment group C: without ATT, if no ATT was being given and the patient was only treated with local and/or systemic IMT. IMT involved a range of therapeutic drugs, including steroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (ie, methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil) and biologics (ie, anti-TNF and anti-IL-6 therapies) that was prescribed in a stepwise manner.

Good and poor responders

We assessed inflammatory activity at 6 months following treatment initiation for the initial uveitis in all patients. Good responders were defined as patients who met all of the following criteria at the first 6 months of treatment for initial uveitis episode: (1) absence of active inflammation in the retina, choroid, episclera or sclera, with both eyes showing ≤ 0.5+ AC or vitreous cells; (2) oral prednisone or its equivalent reduced to < 10 mg daily; (3) topical 1% prednisolone acetate (or equivalent) reduced to no more than two drops daily and (4) discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy with the exception of prednisone use < 10 mg daily. Patients who did not achieve these criteria were considered as poor responders.

Clinical inactivity

Clinical inactivity in this context was determined by a period of at least 90 days where both eyes exhibited AC cells ≤ 0.5+, vitreous cells/haze ≤ 0.5+ and the absence of any other form of clinically active uveitis, such as retinal or choroidal lesions. This assessment was conducted by the attending uveitis specialist, based on slit lamp examination and considering the results of any multimodal imaging modalities that were performed. In line with this definition, our study included patients who fulfilled the 'remission' criteria established by SUN, as well as those who achieved clinical inactivity while maintaining their anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive medication, reflecting the scenarios encountered in real-world clinical practice.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^114K7MBQ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Take-home messages

- Testing for and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) should be targeted to high risk groups who are at increased risk of progression to active tuberculosis.
- Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a key cytokine in protective host immunity against M. tuberculosis infection. The risk of incident tuberculosis (TB) in patients latently infected with M. tuberculosis increases substantially, from 4 to 5 fold over baseline in the case of infliximab, after initiation of anti-TNF therapy.
- TST is an inadequate tool for screening patients for LTBI before commencing anti-TNFα agents because of poor specificity in BCG-vaccinated individuals and poor sensitivity in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) on conventional immunosuppressants e.g. methotrexate and steroids.
- T-cell interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) detect interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released ex vivo from pre-sensitised M. tuberculosis -specific T cells in response to selected proteins which, unlike PPD, are highly specific for M. tuberculosis. Extensive published literature suggests that IGRA are a more specific and probably a more sensitive test for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection than the TST in immunocompetent persons.
- The limited available published data in patients with IMID on disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) who are candidates for TNF blockade shows that IGRA results agree poorly with TST results and are more closely associated with the presence of risk factors for LTBI than TST, suggesting that IGRAs maintain diagnostic sensitivity for LTBI better than TST in this key population. However, preliminary data suggests that in patients who are already on anti-TNF treatment the IFN-γ response is significantly reduced and negative IGRA results should therefore not be interpreted as implying absence of infection.
- IGRAs are a promising adjunct for screening patients with IMID prior to TNF blockade, but more data are required to validate their precise role in this setting.

### Pitfalls in the management of TB-associated uveitis [^111stRXU]. Eye (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study is to highlight the pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis (TB)-associated uveitis.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of case records of four patients with TB-associated uveitis.

Results

In cases 1 and 2, failure to treat tubercular uveitis with anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) and unopposed steroid therapy led to a serious systemic consequence — development of intra-cranial tuberculoma. In case 4, similar failure to initiate ATT caused recurrent disease (focal choroiditis) in the eye. All four cases showed appearance of new lesions or worsening of existing lesions in the eye, following initiation of ATT. Such paradoxical reactions resolved by adding/increasing corticosteroid therapy.

Conclusion

TB-associated uveitis needs a strong index of suspicion for diagnosis and a combined anti-tubercular plus anti-inflammatory therapy for successful outcome.

### Role of anti-tubercular therapy in uveitis with latent / manifest tuberculosis [^111KNe11]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the role of anti-tubercular therapy in uveitis with latent/manifest tuberculosis (TB).

Design

Retrospective, interventional case series.

Methods

A total of 360 patients from uveitis clinic with following inclusion criteria were studied: 1) complete clinical records of visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination, intraocular pressure, complications if any, and treatment records at the baseline and at all follow-up visits; 2) a documented positive tuberculin skin test (10 mm of induration or more) at 48 to 72 hours; 3) evidence of active uveitis, i.e., cellular reaction in the anterior chamber with or without keratic precipitates, and/or active vitreous inflammation, retinal vasculitis, choroiditis, or neuroretinitis; 4) all known causes of infectious uveitis except TB and known noninfectious uveitic syndromes ruled out; and 5) a minimum one year of follow-up from the initiation of treatment. Of these, 216 patients (Group A) received four-drug anti-tubercular therapy and corticosteroids, and 144 patients (Group B) received corticosteroids alone. The main outcome measure was recurrence of inflammation after minimum six months of initiating treatment in each group.

Results

Recurrences reduced significantly (P < .001) in Group A (15.74%) as compared to Group B (46.53%) over a median follow-up of 24 and 31 months, respectively. The patients treated with anti-tubercular therapy with corticosteroids had decreased risk of developing recurrence of uveitis by approximately two-thirds as compared to those treated with corticosteroids alone.

Conclusion

Addition of anti-tubercular therapy to corticosteroids in uveitis patients with latent/manifest TB led to significant reduction in recurrences of uveitis.

### Placoid lesions of the retina: progress in multimodal imaging and clinical perspective [^113jyEP6]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Placoid lesions of the retina may be secondary to a wide spectrum of acquired inflammatory conditions that have been reported as single entities with different presentation and clinical course. These conditions include acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, persistent placoid maculopathy, serpiginous choroiditis, serpiginous-like choroiditis, relentless placoid chorioretinitis and acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. In this article, we will group these conditions under the name of 'placoids'. The recognition of the specific condition may be challenging in clinical practice, often resulting in diagnostic and therapeutic delay. Given the complex nature of placoids and their similarities, a systematic approach including differentiating between infectious and non-infectious aetiologies increases the chance of reaching the correct diagnosis. Detailed history and comprehensive clinical examination are the first steps to formulate a diagnostic hypothesis that should be corroborated by multimodal imaging and appropriate investigations. The advent of multimodal imaging has made it possible to extensively study placoids and revealed a constellation of specific findings that may help clinicians in the diagnostic process. The treatment of the conditions other than syphilis is complex and sometimes challenging. Our article is aimed at giving an overview of the individual entities associated with placoids and discussing the differential diagnosis. A practical and systematic approach is then proposed.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^112tDeVx]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

T-cell interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are more specific and probably more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test (TST) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) and suspected LTBI who are candidates for anti-TNF therapy are at a significant risk of TB reactivation yet are prone to false-negative TST results because they are already on immunosuppressive medications. The role of these new blood tests in this patient population is therefore of considerable interest but is currently unclear. The limited published evidence-base shows that agreement between IGRA and TST results is poor in patients with IMID compared to patients without IMID, due to lower proportions of TST-positive results in patients with IMID. Discordant TST-positive, IGRA-negative results are associated with prior BCG vaccination and discordant TST-negative, IGRA-positive results are associated with steroid therapy. Notably, positive IGRA results are more closely associated with the presence of risk factors for LTBI than TST. The percentage of indeterminate IGRAs can be up to 12%. IGRA results in patients already taking anti-TNF agents currently remain uninterpretable. Given the clinical imperative to prevent reactivation of TB in patients starting anti-TNF therapy, screening algorithms should maximise diagnostic sensitivity for detection of LTBI. Therefore, a positive result to either an IGRA or TST, in addition to currently recommended clinical screening for risk factors for LTBI, should prompt consideration of preventive treatment of LTBI in this population.

### Idiopathic multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy [^114hnFzC]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report nine cases of multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy.

Methods

A retrospective observational case series of eyes with multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy. Multimodal imaging findings were reviewed and presented.

Results

Fifteen eyes of 9 patients (6 women and 3 men), with a mean age of 48.1 years (median, 46 years; range, 23–74 years), presented with multifocal choroiditis serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy. All 15 eyes presented with serpiginoid peripapillary changes and had discrete patches of atrophy or punched-out scars in the posterior pole or periphery. Eleven eyes (73.3%) had cone-shaped retinal pigment epithelium elevations on optical coherence tomography, 10 eyes (66.7%) had mild vitritis, and 4 eyes (26.7%) had peripheral curvilinear streak lesions. Three eyes (20%) had choroidal neovascularization. All patients responded well to treatment with systemic immunosuppression, local corticosteroid injections, and/or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections.

Conclusion

Multifocal choroiditis may present with peripapillary chorioretinal changes resembling a serpiginous-like choroiditis in addition to the classic findings of patches of atrophy or punched-out scars in the posterior pole or periphery, cone-shaped retinal pigment epithelium elevated on optical coherence tomography and peripheral curvilinear streak lesions.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^113byMm4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

If, after a period of 6 months of ATT, patients with a diagnosis of presumed OTB continue to experience recurrent flare-ups, require ongoing high-dose steroid maintenance or augmentation of immunosuppression to control uveitis, or who exhibit progression of chorioretinitis or vasculitis on clinical examination or retinal imaging, then it would be concluded that ATT was ineffective and the cause of the ocular inflammation likely not to be TB.

It may be challenging to differentiate deterioration due to active disease (or a failure of treatment) from deterioration due to sequelae of inflammation. For instance, in a patient with retinal vasculitis who develops neovascularisation, treatment with ATT may be successful in achieving improvement in inflammation, however, the patient may still suffer recurrent vitreous haemorrhage. Similarly, in a patient with chorioretinitis, ATT may bring about control of inflammation, however, patients may still develop choroidal neovascularisation requiring antiVEGF therapy. Such scenarios require a good understanding of the condition and the ability to explain such situations to the affected patient.

In summary, the response of different manifestations of uveitis are measured with different ocular assessments. AC cells and vitreous haze measurement are standardised by SUN grading. A reduction in steroid load or other immunosuppressants are valid favourable outcomes.

Clinical practice points

Visual acuity alone is insufficient as a measure of outcome from treatment.
Improvement in fundus imaging can be used as an outcome measure when chorioretinitis and/or retinal vasculitis is affecting the peripheral retina.
The SUN criteria are useful standardised methods of assessing uveitis activity.
A reduction in steroid dose (typically below 7.5 mg per day) can be used as an outcome measure.

### Detection of type 1 choroidal neovascular membranes using optical coherence tomography angiography in tubercular posterior uveitis [^1175yTyk]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and multimodal imaging features of Type 1 inflammatory choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis and response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

Methods

In this study, multimodal imaging was performed using OCTA, enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Correlation of OCTA with other imaging modalities in the detection of CNV was performed. The changes in CNV configuration after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy were assessed.

Results

In this study, nine eyes (8 patients; 5 females; mean age: 32.5 ± 11.57 years) with diagnosis of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis were included. All the eyes had presence of low-lying pigment epithelial detachments on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography. Using OCTA, it was possible to detect Type 1 CNV in all eyes. Type 1 CNV networks comprised fine anastomotic network of vessels, some of which had a hairpin loop configuration. After anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, there was a decrease in branching and anastomosis. The visual acuity significantly improved from 0.49 ± 0.26 (20/60 Snellen equivalent) at baseline to 0.26 ± 0.17 (20/36 Snellen equivalent) (P = 0.03) in all eyes.

Conclusion

Type 1 CNV can occur among patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis, leading to significant visual loss even in the healed stages of the disease. Optical coherence tomography angiography can help in the detection of Type 1 CNV where conventional multimodal imaging, including fluorescein angiography and OCT, fails to make a definitive diagnosis and thereby guide the initiation of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

### Is tuberculin skin testing reliable during anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa therapy? A case report and review of the literature [^111p6aJp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The increased risk to patients on anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa therapy of developing active tuberculosis supports screening of these patients for latent tuberculosis infection. The current practice of determining the presence of latent tuberculosis infection primarily, and often entirely, depends on the use of tuberculin skin testing (TST). We report a patient with psoriasis on long-term etanercept therapy who had a negative TST result and a positive interferon-gamma release assay result. Similar cases have also been found through a review of the literature. These findings suggest that TST might be unreliable during long-term anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa therapy. QuantiFeron-TB Gold testing may be a more appropriate primary test in patients with risk factors for false-negative TST results.

### Antitubercular therapy for uveitis of undetermined cause with positive interferon-gamma release assay: a single-blind, single-centre, phase 2 randomised controlled trial [^115MhPKm]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis is an umbrella term for intraocular inflammation caused by infectious or non-infectious causes. Currently, more than 30 diseases associated with uveitis have been identified. However, more than one-third of clinical uveitis cases lack definitive aetiologies, falling under the category of "uveitis of undetermined cause" or idiopathic. In clinical practice, uveitis is considered infectious until proven otherwise. Therefore, systematic investigations using various diagnostic tests, along with multidisciplinary consultations are often required. In cases of non-infectious uveitis, immunosuppressants — starting with systemic corticosteroids administered locally, systemically, or both — are the mainstay of treatment. For infectious uveitis, appropriate antimicrobial treatment is essential for achieving uveitis resolution; otherwise, the condition maintains and may worsens even into blindness such as in tubercular uveitis.

Among the infectious causes of uveitis, tuberculosis (TB) is an aetiology that must always be considered. According to the 2024 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of TB in Indonesia was 387 cases per 100,000 population. Consequently, Indonesia is classified as a high TB burden country and ranks as the second highest globally. In countries with a high incidence of TB, such as Indonesia, uveitis associated with concurrent active systemic TB accounts for 8% of newly referred uveitis cases in our setting. Interestingly, among patients with uveitis of undetermined cause, some exhibited TB immunoreactivity as detectable through interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) or tuberculin skin tests (TST). Up to 40% of all referred uveitis patients at our centre were classified as having uveitis of undetermined cause with a positive IGRA. The clinical characteristics of these patients revealed that the majority did not present with the classical manifestations typically associated with TB-related uveitis. Importantly, more than one-third of the affected eyes were already categorised as "blind" at the time of initial presentation to our centre. In the absence of confirmatory evidence of active TB, these patients were often treated empirically for presumed TB, underscoring both the diagnostic uncertainty and the serious risk of irreversible vision loss. Moreover, the proportion of such patients slightly exceeded the rate of positive TB immunoreactivity in the general population in Indonesia (approximately 35% of the general population), raising concerns that the presenting uveitis may represent a true manifestation of extrapulmonary TB in the eye.

### Intravitreal aflibercept for choroidal neovascularization associated with chorioretinitis: a pilot study [^115inwce]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In addition to the well-known causes of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pathologic myopia, and angioid streaks, CNV may develop as a complication of chorioretinitis, with an incidence of 2%. The prevalence of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis varies among different entities, and commonly occurs in presumed ocular histoplasmosis (3.8%), toxoplasmosis (TX, 0.3%–19%), punctate inner choroidopathy (17%–40%), idiopathic multifocal choroiditis (33%), and serpiginous choroiditis (SC, 4.7%). CNV has also been reported in up to 9% of patients with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease.

There is no uniform consensus on the management of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis because of the lack of randomized or controlled clinical trials, which have not been performed due to the rarity of this condition.

There are different treatment strategies for chorioretinitis-associated CNV, including photodynamic therapy (PDT),–anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents such as bevacizumab and ranibizumab,–surgery, local and systemic corticosteroids, and combinations of these methods.

A review article published in 2014 describes the three main therapies available for CNV secondary to chorioretinitis in the last decade as PDT, intravitreal bevacizumab, and intravitreal ranibizumab. Aflibercept (EYLEA ®, Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc, Tarrytown, NY, USA), initially named VEGF Trap-Eye, is the most recent anti-VEGF agent to be granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (2011) for the treatment of neovascular AMD. The ocular formulation of aflibercept has been specifically purified and buffered to minimize the risk of eye toxicity when injected intravitreally. To the authors' knowledge, there are no published articles describing the use of intravitreal aflibercept in this pathology. However, in 2017, a short-term study showed that off-label intravitreal ziv-aflibercept is safe and effective in a small series of patients with CNV secondary to choroiditis.

The purpose of this report was to evaluate the potential benefits of intravitreal aflibercept injections for the treatment of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis.

### OCT angiography imaging in serpiginous choroidopathy [^111f2vwj]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report OCTA findings in 3 cases, 2 active and 1 inactive, of serpiginous choroidopathy (SC) and describe OCTA changes in response to treatment.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Participants

We studied 6 eyes of 3 patients with SC.

Methods

Retrospective case series of 3 patients with SC undergoing multimodal imaging, including OCTA. In 1 treated eye, both pre- and posttreatment images were compared.

Main Outcome Measures

Description of OCTA findings in patients with SC.

Results

In the active phase, OCTA images show an apparent absence of the choriocapillaris with variable outer retinal and retinal pigment epithelial thickening. After treatment, OCTA of previously active lesions demonstrates a partial reappearance of the choriocapillaris, especially at lesion margins. In inactive SC, the choriocapillaris, along with the retinal pigment epithelium and outer retina, is notably absent.

Conclusions

Optical coherence tomography angiography suggests absence of choriocapillaris in both active and inactive phases of SC with partial reestablishment following treatment. Although the exact pathogenesis of SC is not elucidated by these findings, OCTA images allow us to better evaluate choroidal involvement.

### Systemic therapies for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future [^111LjvQL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

The advent of biologic medical products ('biologics') has been a major landmark in the treatment of inflammatory disease. Drugs such as the anti-TNF agents (e.g. etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) and the anti-CD20 agent rituximab have already revolutionized the management of many rheumatic diseases, and the impact is now being realized within ophthalmology. The development of a biologic should arise out of a knowledge of the pathogenesis of the inflammatory disease, and be targeted to inhibit or modulate specific components. This approach has been taken for uveitis with the potential to be more effective in controlling disease with less impact on the patient's overall health. Leading the charge within ophthalmology are the anti-TNF therapies. We among others have undertaken a program of work which has investigated the role of TNF-α in the pathogenesis of uveitis, leading to the development of an anti-TNF-α fusion protein (TNFr-Ig) in 1996 which we evaluated first in an animal model of uveitis, and subsequently in a Phase II/proof of concept clinical trial in 2004. In this study, 71% of the patients achieved complete cessation of intraocular inflammation following TNFr-Ig therapy and a reduction in concomitant immunosuppression was possible in 65% of cases. Importantly TNFr-Ig therapy appeared to be effective across uveitic subtypes, including Behçet's disease, idiopathic intermediate uveitis, multifocal choroiditis and sympathetic ophthalmia. These findings are supported by a large body of work from other groups, and subsequent reviews and editorials have highlighted the impact of anti-TNF-α therapies in ophthalmic practice.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^1153y126]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the left macula at initial presentation showed mild attenuation of the foveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) (Figures 1 and 2A). Focal hyperreflectivity of the inner choroid was noted nasal to the foveal center (Figure 2A). Although hyperreflective foci was seen in the vitreous on OCT, no vitreous cells were seen clinically at the initial visit and subsequent visits. On near-infrared reflectance imaging, there was a group of multiple, small, round, hyperreflective lesions nasal to the fovea that localized to the hyperreflective choroidal findings on OCT (Figure 1). One month later, after observation only, the patient presented to the retina clinic with severe atrophy of the outer retina and inner retina that was apparent on OCT (Figure 2B). Near-infrared reflectance imaging showed expansion of the hyperreflective lesion through the macula, with an amoeboid-like shape (Figure 2B).

Figure 1.
Near-infrared reflectance of (A) the right eye and (B) the left eye on initial presentation (1 month before referral to the retina clinic). (C–H) Near-infrared reflectance and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images show cuts of the left eye through the hyperreflective choroidal lesions. Arrows on OCT show the hyperreflective spots in the inner choroid that correspond with the hyperreflective areas nasal to the fovea seen on near-infrared reflectance. There is mild attenuation of the external limiting membrane, ellipsoid zone, and retinal pigment epithelium interdigitation lines. The neurosensory retina appears otherwise normal.

Figure 2.
Serial progression of near-infrared reflectance and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the left eye performed (A) at the patient's initial presentation to the eye clinic, (B) 4 weeks later, (C) 5 weeks later, and (D) 4 months after the initial visit. Near-infrared reflectance shows an irregular area of hyperreflectivity at the macula that corresponds with the hyperreflective foci in the outer retina and choroid on OCT. Over time, there is significant atrophy of the outer and inner retina with disruption of the ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium. Four months after the initial visit, a new pigment epithelial detachment is seen. In addition, there is a notable change in choroidal thickness over time as follows: 342 µm at the initial presentation, 378 µm at 1 month, and 233 µm at 4 months.

### Intravitreal bevacizumab for choroidal neovascularisation in serpiginous choroiditis [^116nf9LQ]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effects of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in the treatment of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to serpiginous choroiditis (SC).

Design

Non-randomised, interventional case series.

Participants

Seven patients (seven eyes) affected by juxtafoveal CNV (six eyes) and subfoveal CNV (one eye) associated with SC were recruited.

Methods

Each patient underwent an ophthalmological examination, including measurement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After a first IVB injection (1.25 mg), patients were evaluated monthly over a 12-month follow-up. Further re-treatments were performed on the basis of detection of any type of fluid on OCT and/or presence of leakage on FA. The primary outcome considered was the median change in BCVA, as well as the proportion of eyes gaining at least 5 and 10 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters at the end of the 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included median changes in central macular thickness (CMT) and number of injections over the planned follow-up.

Results

Median BCVA changed from 0.3 to 0.4 LogMAR. A functional improvement of at least 5 and 10 ETDRS letters was obtained in two eyes (28%) and one eye (14%), respectively, at the 12-month examination. Four eyes (57%) had stable BCVA, whereas one eye (14%) experienced a two-line decrease. Median CMT at baseline was 261 μm, decreasing to 196 μm at the 12-month examination. The median number of IVB injections was 1 in 12 months.

Conclusions

IVB can achieve anatomical stabilisation of CNV secondary to SC, avoiding a decline in visual acuity, in almost 90% of cases over a 12-month follow-up.

### Intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of inflammatory choroidal neovascularization [^111knwid]. Retina (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of individualized repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis) on visual acuity and central foveal thickness in patients with choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) associated with various ocular inflammatory clinical entities.

Methods

Our study was a retrospective, noncomparative, interventional, and observational case series. Sixteen eyes of 15 consecutive patients diagnosed with inflammatory CNV treated with repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab were evaluated. The underlying diagnoses were toxoplasmosis (n = 4), serpiginous choroidopathy (n = 2), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 5), multifocal choroiditis (MFC, n = 3), and scleroderma (n = 2). All patients underwent monthly optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and fluorescein angiography/indocyanine green angiography every 1 month after every injection and then every 3 months. Optical coherence tomography scans and fluorescein angiography were performed by the same experienced physician. Repeated intravitreal injections were performed when persistent/recurrent fluid on OCT and/or signs of active CNV on angiography were present. Changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity and central foveal thickness were statistically analyzed.

Results

The mean follow-up time was 70.4 ± 24 weeks (17.6 months; range, 44–116 weeks [11–29 months]). The mean number of injections performed was 2.3, and the mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 55 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.9 ± 0.4 [mean ± SD]) at baseline to 70.3 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.6 ± 0.4) at the end of the follow-up, a statistically significant change compared with baseline (P < 0.0001). The mean letter gain was 15.3 letters, and best-corrected visual acuity improved in 14 of 16 patients (88%) and remained stable in 2 patients (12.5%) without any patient demonstrating deterioration. The mean central foveal thickness (although not excessively increased at baseline) improved from 285 ± 20 μm at baseline to 233 ± 21 μm (statistically significant compared with baseline, P < 0.0001) at the end of the follow-up. At the end of the follow-up, all patients demonstrated CNV regression, and retinal pigment epithelial atrophy surrounding the regressed CNV was developed in 11 of the 16 eyes (68.8%). During the same period, no CNV recurrence was observed and no injection-related complications such as cataract, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, or exacerbation of uveitis were noted.

Conclusion

Overall, our findings suggest that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab have shown promising results in visual acuity improvement and a decrease in macular thickness in patients with inflammatory CNV. Of course, further studies are needed to confirm the exact benefit and standardize the optimal treatment regimen.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^115etmR2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — anti-TNF safety, pregnancy, and pretreatment screening: The safety profile of anti-TNF agents is generally favorable, but a small percentage of patients may experience severe adverse events, and a meta-analysis of 21 anti-TNF clinical trials including 5,356 patients with CD found that anti-TNF therapy did not increase the risk of serious infection, malignancy, or death compared with placebo. In addition, these agents are safe to use during preconception planning, throughout pregnancy and post partum. Before anti-TNF therapy is considered for use in patients with CD, pretreatment screening for infections and laboratory abnormalities is required; testing for latent and active tuberculosis should be undertaken as well as assessment of particular risk factors for exposure. Interferon-γ release assays are likely to complement the tuberculin skin test and are preferred in patients who are Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinated, if available. If latent tuberculosis is detected, initiation of chemoprophylaxis with antituberculous therapy should be initiated for several weeks before administration of anti-TNF therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Managing paradoxical TB-IRIS includes evidence from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial showing that prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) reduced a combined endpoint of days hospitalized plus outpatient therapeutic procedures, with more rapid symptom and radiographic improvement and no reduction in mortality, noting life-threatening neurological cases were excluded; for central nervous system involvement, corticosteroids (either intravenous dexamethasone or oral prednisone) are described as beneficial at presentation. If 4 weeks of prednisone is insufficient, a more gradual steroid taper over 2 to 3 months is recommended (BIII) and should be guided by repeated clinical assessment; corticosteroids should be avoided in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, and case reports describe responses to TNF-blockers or thalidomide in steroid-refractory, prolonged IRIS.
