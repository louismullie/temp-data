## Question

what would be some treatment goals for someone with bipolar disorder with moderate depression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for examples of treatment goals for someone with bipolar disorder with moderate depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and baseline severity assessment. Then, I should delineate acute-phase symptomatic targets and evidence-based pharmacologic choices. Next, I will integrate functional recovery aims and psychosocial strategies, followed by maintenance-phase relapse prevention, adherence, and safety monitoring. Finally, I should embed shared decision-making and measurement-based reassessment, ensuring I double-check areas where the evidence is mixed or limited before concluding with an integrated summary across phases [^1138i4WV] [^111YAcCH] [^114NSftn].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline severity, because moderate bipolar depression is frequently misclassified as unipolar depression, which risks inappropriate treatment; about 60% of bipolar patients initially receive an incorrect unipolar diagnosis, so I need to screen for past mania/hypomania, family history, mixed features, and substance use, and establish a baseline with validated scales such as MADRS and CGI-BP-S to quantify "moderate" severity and track change over time [^116y4x86] [^112wqq9D] [^115iBkGY] [^113YzVTW].

> I should confirm safety and setting next; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outpatient care without checking suicide risk, self-harm potential, psychosis, or severe functional compromise, since these factors guide level of care and goals, and both APA and bipolar-specific guidelines emphasize matching care setting and functional goals to severity and support systems before initiating treatment plans [^113Ehed7] [^114DNCbX] [^1132hWd6].

> I will now define acute symptomatic goals over roughly 1–6 weeks; the immediate target is at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms with a trajectory toward remission, often MADRS ≤ 12 by week 6, while actively preventing a treatment-emergent switch; lurasidone shows a clinically meaningful advantage over placebo on MADRS with response and remission benefits emerging by week 2, and atypical antipsychotics used in this context have not shown increased YMRS scores or switch risk versus placebo in mixed-feature populations, which reassures me about mood stability during acute treatment [^113YzVTW] [^115SBwYP].

> Wait, let me verify pharmacotherapy selection against contemporary guidance; AAFP highlights quetiapine or cariprazine as monotherapies for acute bipolar depression, and also supports lurasidone combined with lithium or valproate, while RCTs and meta-analyses support lurasidone's efficacy as monotherapy in bipolar depression with improvements in symptoms and disability, so reasonable first-line selections here include quetiapine, cariprazine, or lurasidone with consideration of combination with lithium/valproate based on patient factors and tolerability [^1171DHch] [^117HSYZq] [^111hejmB] [^113YzVTW].

> Hold on, I should verify the stance on antidepressants; antidepressant monotherapy is not supported for acute bipolar depression by VA/DoD and carries concern for affective destabilization highlighted in FDA labeling, and although adjunctive antidepressants show at best modest, context-dependent benefits with antipsychotic backbones and no clear signal for increased switching, their role should be reserved for severe or resistant cases with close monitoring for switches or mixed features [^117V3BQe] [^115yb38F] [^111o1c3H].

> Next, I should review functional recovery goals running concurrently with acute symptom reduction; symptom remission is necessary but insufficient — functional restoration and quality of life need explicit targets, so I will incorporate psychoeducation early and add evidence-based psychotherapies such as CBT, family-focused therapy, or interpersonal/social rhythm therapy as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy to improve depressive symptoms, adherence, and real-world functioning [^114NSftn] [^111YAcCH] [^115fTBje] [^117T5tCS] [^116m4rXS].

> Let me consider maintenance-phase goals after acute stabilization; preventing recurrence — especially depressive relapse, which occurs earlier and more frequently than mania — is paramount, with STEP-BD showing time to 25% depressive recurrence around 21 weeks, so I should maintain the effective acute regimen when tolerated and favor agents with evidence for prophylaxis against depressive episodes such as lithium, lamotrigine, and valproate, while acknowledging that contemporary guideline appraisals caution about limited or mixed evidence for some agents' prevention of bipolar depressive recurrences, which means I need to individualize and continuously re-evaluate [^113VjmS9] [^116wHn9c] [^112YHnmj] [^115Xvdsm].

> I should double-check adherence strategies because nonadherence drives relapse and morbidity; up to half of patients do not take medications as prescribed, and abrupt lithium discontinuation is associated with rapid recurrence, so I will use psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and family support to strengthen alliance and more than double adherence rates, aligning these strategies with shared decision-making to sustain long-term stability [^113K9kG9] [^111fSGEp] [^111YAcCH].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability monitoring as a continuous goal; with atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, I need to systematically monitor weight, metabolic parameters, extrapyramidal symptoms, and sedation, educate about rare but serious risks like neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and maintain continuous suicide risk assessment given the markedly elevated suicide risk in bipolar depression; initially I noted tracking "dropouts due to adverse events" citing lower rates with olanzapine-fluoxetine versus olanzapine or placebo, but wait, I should verify — those were overall dropout rates, not necessarily adverse-event–related, so I should not over-attribute the difference to adverse events without specific data [^114gzNYy] [^115yb38F] [^114Rws5a] [^116hc7xZ].

> But wait, what if mixed features are present; I need to ensure antidepressants are not destabilizing in such contexts, and prefer atypical antipsychotics with demonstrated efficacy in MDEs with mixed features such as lurasidone, cariprazine, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, or lumateperone, given data showing depressive symptom reduction without increased switch risk versus placebo, which reassures me about safety when subthreshold hypomanic symptoms are in play [^113XLLmr] [^115SBwYP] [^115yDLUz].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of patient-centered care; strengthening the therapeutic alliance, using shared decision-making, and explicitly negotiating tolerability trade-offs improves adherence and outcomes, while addressing core patient and system conflicts around medications and care quality supports realistic, sustainable treatment plans that patients can follow over time [^111YAcCH] [^114MzTvR] [^112dFC9i] [^117NKEEN].

> I need to ensure a clear reassessment loop; early improvement by weeks 1–3 on a mood stabilizer may signal a subgroup that does not require adjunctive antidepressants, whereas lack of response by week 6 should prompt a careful re-check of diagnosis, adherence, comorbidities, and drug levels, with stepwise escalation such as adding lithium or valproate to lurasidone, and if still refractory, consider cautious adjunctive antidepressants or other evidence-informed strategies while closely monitoring for switches, using measurement-based care with MADRS and CGI-BP-S to guide adjustments rather than relying solely on impression [^112eZKFW] [^117HSYZq] [^111o1c3H] [^1154pNpc] [^111wajMa] [^1127zhQT] [^113YzVTW].

> To synthesize across phases, I should confirm diagnosis and safety, aim for acute symptom response and remission with mood-stabilizing regimens that minimize switch risk, pursue concurrent functional recovery with psychoeducation and psychotherapy, transition to maintenance preventing depressive relapse through evidence-informed pharmacotherapy and adherence supports, and embed continuous safety monitoring, shared decision-making, and measurement-based reassessment to individualize care and improve long-term quality of life and functioning [^112wqq9D] [^113YzVTW] [^111hejmB] [^111YAcCH] [^113VjmS9] [^113K9kG9] [^114gzNYy] [^114NSftn].

In moderate bipolar depression, treatment goals prioritize **symptom reduction and functional recovery** [^114nPjRg] while preventing relapse and minimizing adverse effects [^1171DHch] [^1138i4WV]. Recommended goals include:

- **Reduce depressive symptoms**: Aim for at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms and achieve remission (MADRS ≤ 12) [^1138i4WV] [^113YzVTW].
- **Prevent mood switching**: Use mood stabilizers [^1171DHch] or atypical antipsychotics [^111hejmB] to minimize risk of mania/hypomania [^114nPjRg].
- **Improve functioning**: Restore social, occupational, and daily functioning [^114NSftn] [^114DNCbX] to pre-episode levels [^1171DHch].
- **Enhance adherence**: Address side effects and use psychoeducation [^111fSGEp] to improve medication adherence [^113K9kG9] [^1171DHch].
- **Reduce suicide risk**: Monitor and manage suicidal ideation and behaviors [^111hoSFj] [^115iBkGY] [^1171DHch].
- **Promote self-management**: Encourage sleep hygiene, regular routines, and healthy lifestyle habits [^116XN7a4] [^115fTBje] [^1171DHch].
- **Prevent relapse**: Implement maintenance therapy and regular monitoring to sustain remission [^116wHn9c] [^114gzNYy] [^1171DHch].

These goals should be **individualized and regularly reassessed** to sustain improvement and quality of life [^111YAcCH].

### Efficacy of lurasidone in adults with bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of its impact on depressive symptoms and disability [^111hejmB]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Bipolar depression (BDD) is the predominant polarity in bipolar disorder type I and poses challenges for diagnosis, treatment, and associated disability. Over the last 20 years, the FDA has approved new drugs for BDD, including lurasidone. This study summarizes the literature on lurasidone's efficacy in treating BDD, focusing on depressive symptoms and disability.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), following PRISMA reporting guidelines. Our findings demonstrate that lurasidone reduces depressive symptoms in adults with bipolar depression, as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MD -3.05 [95% CI, -4.48 to -1.62]) and the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Scale (MD -0.42 [-0.60 to -0.25]). It also improves associated disability, as measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale (MD -1.92 [-3.29 to -0.55]). While these results are promising, further RCTs are needed to confirm lurasidone's efficacy and assess its role in long-term therapeutic strategies.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^113YzVTW]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

- **Lurasidone**: A post hoc analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted by McIntyre et al, evaluating the efficacy of lurasidone treatment in 485 participants with BD-I, of which 272 had mixed features (defined as having a YMRS score ≥ 4). The lurasidone dosage groups were 20–60 mg/day (starting dose: 20 mg/day for 7 days) and 80–120 mg/day (20 mg/day on days 1–2, 40 mg/day on days 3–4, 60 mg/day on days 5–6, and 80 mg/day on day 7). After day 7, doses were adjusted to optimize efficacy and tolerability. The study assessments included MADRS, CGI-BP-S, YMRS, QIDS-SR, SDS, and Q-LES-Q-SF.

Lurasidone treatment was associated with a significantly greater LS mean change in MADRS total score from baseline to week 6 compared to placebo (–15.7 vs. –10.9; p = 0.001; effect size, 0.48). Superiority in MADRS score compared to placebo was seen in the lurasidone group from week 2 to endpoint. The differences between lurasidone dosage groups were nonsignificant (p = 0.127). There was a significantly greater percentage of responders (≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total at LOCF endpoint) in the lurasidone group compared to placebo (51.1% vs. 32.2%; p = 0.003; NNT = 6; LOCF endpoint). Similarly, the percentage of remitters (MADRS total ≤ 12 at LOCF endpoint) was significantly greater in the lurasidone group than the placebo group (39.6% vs. 24.4%; p = 0.014; NNT = 7; LOCF endpoint).

As in previous editions, these guidelines are organized into eight sections, including the introduction. Foundations of management discuss the epidemiology of BD, screening and diagnostic considerations, the importance of monitoring risk for suicide, the chronic disease management model, and patient‐centred care (including shared decision-making), as well as the importance of incorporating psychoeducation and other psychosocial treatment strategies into treatment. Additional information on the presentation and hierarchical rankings of treatment options for acute mania and depression is reviewed and includes descriptions of clinical features that may help direct treatment choices. The importance of long‐term maintenance treatment and promotion of treatment adherence for mood stability, as well as hierarchical rankings of treatment options, are discussed. An expert review of the available evidence for treatments of bipolar II disorder (BDII) and recommendations based on those findings are presented. The management issues related to specific populations, including women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, older adults, and those with psychiatric or medical comorbidity, are each discussed. Finally, the principles of medical monitoring and an overview of safety and tolerability concerns for recommended treatments are provided.

### Acute and maintenance treatments for bipolar depression [^116y4x86]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder are symptomatic about half of the time, experiencing depression more often than mania or hypomania. Because patients usually seek treatment during a depressive episode rather than a manic episode, bipolar depression is commonly misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. Providing an accurate and timely bipolar depression diagnosis is critical for the proper treatment of the patient.

Some FDA-approved treatments are helpful during acute and maintenance phases of therapy, but there is a significant unmet need for effective bipolar depression treatments with favorable side-effect profiles. Newer agents offer the promise of improvements in tolerability, but additional research is needed to actualize this promise into better treatments for patients struggling with bipolar depression.

### Defining and achieving recovery from bipolar disorder [^114NSftn]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Management of bipolar disorder is in many ways similar to the management of schizophrenia, as the goals in treating both disorders include avoiding rehospitalization, managing behavioral symptoms, and promoting functional recovery. This review will define functional recovery in bipolar disorder, discuss relapse prevention, and consider some implications for treatment.

The most notable implication for treatment is that clinicians need to use stricter criteria when defining recovery in bipolar disorder. Recovery should not be defined merely by symptomatic remission or even syndromal remission; rather, recovery should include symptomatic recovery, syndromal recovery, functional recovery, and a return to an acceptable quality of life for the patient.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^111k89Ti]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Consensus on pharmacological strategy for depressive episodes:

None of the choices were categorized as a first-line treatment for depressive episodes in elderly patients. Second-line treatments for depressive episodes in elderly patients included quetiapine monotherapy (6.3 ± 2.3), lithium monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.5), lamotrigine monotherapy (5.9 ± 2.6), combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.5), and combination therapy of lamotrigine and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.3).

Antidepressant use was categorized as a third-line treatment for depressive episodes in BP-I (3.8 ± 2.2) and a second-line treatment in BP-II (4.4 ± 2.3). When the respondents were asked to rate the use of adjunctive antidepressants concomitantly with an ongoing mood stabilizer for persistent depressive episodes, no specific antidepressant was categorized as a first-line treatment for both BP-I and BP-II. The second-line treatment included mirtazapine (5.4 ± 2.6) and escitalopram (5.3 ± 2.7) for BP-I, and escitalopram (5.7 ± 2.7), sertraline (5.5 ± 2.6), and mirtazapine (5.5 ± 2.6) for BP-II.

### Outcomes to monitor when treating bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [^117JeSRQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The long-term goals of treating both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are to achieve remission, promote functional recovery, prevent relapse, and improve patients' subjective response. To meet these goals in patients with bipolar disorder, management of the acute episodes of mania, depression, and mixed symptomatology is necessary and may help to maintain favorable patient behavior and avoid hospitalization. In this review, definitions of remission, recovery, and relapse are compared and contrasted between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to highlight the similarities and, most notably, the differences in assessments between the two conditions. The implications for the treatment of bipolar disorder stem from the ideology that underlies many studies in schizophrenia.

### Areas of uncertainties and unmet needs in bipolar disorders: Clinical and research perspectives [^115iBkGY]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

This review discusses crucial areas related to the identification, clinical presentation, course, and therapeutic management of bipolar disorder, a major psychiatric illness. Bipolar disorder is often misdiagnosed, leading to inappropriate, inadequate, or delayed treatment. Even when bipolar disorder is successfully diagnosed, its clinical management presents several major challenges, including how best to optimize treatment for an individual patient and how to balance the benefits and risks of polypharmacy.

We explore major unmet needs in the diagnosis and management of bipolar disorder, including improvement in the adequate recognition and intervention in at-risk and early-disease stages. There is also a need for the identification of reliable warning signs and prevention of relapses in unstable and rapid cycling patients, treatment of refractory depression, and prevention of suicide. Taken together, there are several promising opportunities for improving treatment of bipolar disorder to deliver medical care that is more personalized.

### Pharmacological interventions for the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder: A systematic review of controlled trials [^116wHn9c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating all clinically relevant pharmacological interventions for the prevention of relapse in people with bipolar disorder. Thirty-four trials were included in the review. Direct comparisons with placebo and with lithium were available for most drugs. Additionally, there were direct comparisons of valproate vs. olanzapine, imipramine vs. lithium plus imipramine, olanzapine plus mood stabilizers vs. mood stabilizers, and perphenazine plus mood stabilizers vs. mood stabilizers.

Methodological quality varied across studies, and the strength of evidence was not equal for all treatments or for all comparisons. There is evidence from placebo-controlled trials for the efficacy of lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine as maintenance therapy for the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. Three drugs have a significant effect in the prevention of manic relapses (lithium, olanzapine, and aripiprazole) and three in the prevention of depressive symptoms (valproate, lamotrigine, and imipramine).

Imipramine is little used in practice due to concerns about adverse effects. The significant effects of olanzapine and aripiprazole were demonstrated in selected responsive bipolar I patients only. Despite widespread use in clinical practice, there is little evidence to support the efficacy of combination therapy.

### The importance of facilitating adherence in maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder [^111fSGEp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for patients with bipolar disorder differ depending on the phase in which the patient presents. During maintenance treatment, the goal of therapy should be for patients to become stable and improve their quality of life. However, the most challenging barrier to effective treatment of bipolar disorder is patient nonadherence with clinician-recommended therapy. A strong treatment alliance between patients and clinicians to provide good social support can help patients adhere to treatment.

### Clinical indicators for the use of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar I depression [^112eZKFW]. Bipolar Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines provide little practical information on the clinical characteristics of bipolar I patients who are likely to benefit from the combination of a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant. Rather, guidelines simply state that an adjunctive antidepressant is recommended in cases of 'severe' depression. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical and demographic differences between patients who remitted on a mood stabilizer alone and patients who subsequently required an adjunctive antidepressant to achieve stabilization.

We retrospectively compared the pharmacological treatment strategies of 39 patients with bipolar I disorder who were in a depressive episode. Patients who did not respond to mood stabilizer monotherapy were prescribed an adjunctive antidepressant. We evaluated the clinical differences at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 3 of treatment between patients stabilizing on a mood stabilizer alone and those who did not remit until they subsequently received an adjunctive antidepressant.

- **Results**: Patients who required an adjunctive antidepressant had significantly higher total Hamilton Depression Rating (HRS-D) scores at weeks 1, 2, and 3 of treatment, but not at baseline. Patients who remitted on mood stabilizer monotherapy were more likely to be married, achieved stabilization in less time, presented with higher Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores, and experienced the previous episode of depression more recently than patients who required an antidepressant.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that rapid improvement after achieving stabilization with mood stabilizer monotherapy is indicative of a subgroup of bipolar I patients who might not require adjunctive antidepressant treatment.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^116hc7xZ]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The OFC treatment group had 16/37 (43.2%) responders, defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in total MADRS score and < 2 combined hypo/manic symptoms, measured by YMRS, after the treatment period. 46/173 (26.6%) of the participants taking olanzapine responded, and 27/166 (16.3%) of the placebo group responded. When compared to placebo, both combined treatment (OR = 3.91; 95% CI, 1.80–8.49; p = 0.0006) and olanzapine monotherapy (OR = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.14–3.34; p = 0.014) showed significantly higher response rates.

There were significantly lower dropout rates in the combined treatment group (29.7%) compared to olanzapine monotherapy (53.8%) and placebo (59.6%): olanzapine monotherapy vs. combined treatment (OR = 2.67; 95% CI, 1.23–5.75; p = 0.12); placebo vs. combined treatment (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.61–7.54; p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in dropout rates between the olanzapine and placebo groups (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.84–2.01; p = 0.227).

The switch rates to mania/hypomania were 8.5% (7/82) for combined treatment, 6.8% (24/351) for olanzapine, and 7.9% (28/355) for placebo (χ² = 0.426, df = 2, p = 0.808).

Two RCTs evaluating the effect of pharmacological treatment in persons with MDD and BD with mixed features were identified.

### Systemic challenges in bipolar disorder management: A patient-centered approach [^112dFC9i]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

As part of a series of Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded large‐scale retrospective observational studies on bipolar disorder treatments and outcomes, we sought the input of patients and their family members to develop research questions. We aimed to identify systemic root causes of patient‐reported challenges with management in order to guide subsequent studies and initiatives.

- **Methods**: Three focus groups were conducted where patients and their family members (total n = 34) formulated questions around the central theme, "What do you wish you had known in advance or over the course of treatment?" In an affinity mapping exercise, participants clustered their questions and ranked the resulting categories by importance. The research team and members of our patient partner advisory council further rated the questions by expected impact on patients. Using a Theory of Constraints systems thinking approach, several causal models of management challenges and their potential solutions were developed with patients using the focus group data.

- **Results**: A total of 369 research questions were mapped to 33 categories revealing 10 broad themes. The top priorities for patient stakeholders involved pharmacotherapy and treatment alternatives. Analysis of causal relationships underlying 47 patient concerns revealed two core conflicts: for patients, whether or not to take pharmacotherapy, and for mental health services, the dilemma of care quality vs. quantity.

- **Conclusions**: To alleviate the core conflicts identified, management requires a coordinated multidisciplinary approach that considers both pharmacological and alternative treatment strategies.

### New approaches in managing bipolar depression [^112r9h19]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Historically, the pharmacologic treatment of bipolar depression has not been well studied. New data are beginning to emerge regarding the efficacy of new medications and the use of combinations of mood stabilizers and antidepressants in the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar depression. We reviewed data from recent randomized, controlled trials of mood stabilizers and antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression, as well as naturalistic studies examining the risk of switching and depressive relapse with ongoing antidepressant treatment.

### Abilify [^115yb38F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Screening patients for bipolar disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

It should be noted that Abilify is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population.

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify. Rare cases of NMS occurred during Abilify treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.

### An evidence-based medicine strategy for achieving remission in bipolar disorder [^113CJjo8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several classes of drugs for achieving an acute response in bipolar mania and depression. For many years, clinical response has been the primary outcome in the majority of short-term efficacy studies. However, there is a growing consensus that the optimal goal in the long-term management of bipolar disorder is remission. The purpose of this article is to briefly summarize the clinical importance of remission in bipolar disorder and to review data on the effectiveness of available treatments for achieving and sustaining remission.

### Adjunctive antidepressants for the acute treatment of bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o1c3H]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

The depressive phase of bipolar disorder causes significant functional impairment and disease burden. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression have long been a subject of debate.

- **Aims**: To synthesize evidence of the effectiveness, risk of mood switching, and tolerability of adjunctive antidepressants in acute bipolar depression compared to using mood stabilizers or antipsychotics alone.

- **Method**: Multiple databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, including open-label and double-blinded studies, for patients aged 18 or older with acute bipolar depression. These studies compared efficacy and adverse events in those who used adjunctive antidepressants versus those who did not. Risk of bias and outcomes were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. This study has PROSPERO registration CRD42016037701.

- **Results**: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Adjunctive antidepressants showed no significant effect on improving response rate (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23). Subgroup analysis showed that adjunctive antidepressants with antipsychotics had a small but significantly better response rate compared to antipsychotics alone, which was not seen with adjunctive antidepressants with mood stabilizers. However, that finding was limited by studies predominantly using olanzapine as the antipsychotic medication. Adjunctive antidepressants had no clinically significant impact but a small statistically significant impact on improving depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.24 to -0.02). There was no association with increased mood switch (RR = 0.97).

### Challenges in the management of bipolar depression [^111tLRp5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression has started to receive more attention in clinical trials only relatively recently, despite the fact that patients spend more time in the depressed phase than in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. The diagnosis and management of bipolar depression are challenging; many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to symptom similarities with unipolar depression or other illnesses and/or comorbidities. Untreated or inappropriately treated bipolar depression adds to the burden of illness and is associated with a greater risk of suicide.

Treatment options include lithium, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and traditional antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, traditional antidepressants are recommended with caution due to their potential risk of switching patients into mania. Some atypical antipsychotics have shown efficacy in bipolar depression, although longer-term studies are warranted.

The choice of treatment for different subgroups of patients with bipolar depression, including those with comorbid anxiety, may vary and also needs further study. Other important issues that require further investigation include the recognition of the core features of bipolar depression and the threshold symptoms for treatment, as well as the optimal treatment choices for monotherapy or combination therapy, and acute versus long-term management of bipolar depression.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^112T6Byd]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence from RCTs is at the core of the recommendations in these guidelines; nonetheless, RCTs are not the only source of clinically useful information, particularly when evaluating maintenance therapy. RCTs offer relatively limited follow-up timeframes, while for some patients, maintenance therapy may extend across decades. Furthermore, new medications are often assessed in studies with an enriched design (including only patients who have responded to the medication under study in the acute phase), limiting the generalizability of positive findings to patients who responded to the medication acutely.

Useful data can be obtained from large, often whole-population databases constructed from electronic medical records or electronic patient registries. These databases hold large numbers of patients that would be difficult to obtain in RCTs. In some instances, they allow comparisons of multiple treatments, making it possible to evaluate differences in rates of rare events such as less common side effects or suicide.

Patient cohorts followed in a specific setting provide another source of informative data. Their main advantage is usually the length of observation, in some instances reaching several decades. However, this comes at the cost of generalizability, in terms of both patient selection and non-random treatment allocation.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^113Ehed7]. APA (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, specifically with respect to the setting of care, the APA 2010 guidelines recommend considering several factors. These include the patient's symptom severity, co-occurring psychiatric or general medical conditions, available support system, level of functioning, and the patient's ability to adequately care for themselves when determining an appropriate setting for treatment.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^117T5tCS]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Unlike conventional meta-analyses, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis assesses moderator variables at the level of each participant, which generates more precise and less biased estimates. The objective of this study was to investigate whether psychological therapy reduces depression symptoms in people with Bipolar I and II disorders and examine whether baseline depression has a moderating effect on treatment outcomes. Through the use of several electronic databases, a systematic search was conducted. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating a psychological intervention for adults diagnosed with Bipolar I or II disorder. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full texts. The authors of the included studies were asked to provide IPD from their trials. A multilevel model approach was used to analyze the data.

From the 7,552 studies found by our searches, six studies with 668 study participants were eligible. Intervention significantly reduced depression scores. There was a significant association between baseline depression and post-treatment depression scores. There was no statistically significant interaction between condition allocation and baseline depression score. When IPD from the two most comparable studies were analyzed, CBT had reduced depression scores relative to the comparator condition. The study included patient data from only six studies which were heterogeneous in terms of intervention type, outcome measure, and comparators. Overall, the psychological interventions tested significantly reduced bipolar depression scores.

### Prevalence and correlates of burden among caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder [^113zsBYF]. Bipolar Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Caring for a relative with schizophrenia or dementia is associated with reports of high caregiver burden, symptoms of depression, poor physical health, negligence of the caregiver's own health needs, elevated health service use, low use of social supports, and financial strain. This study presents the design and preliminary data on the costs and consequences of caring for a relative or friend with bipolar disorder from the Family Experience Study, a longitudinal study of the primary caregivers to 500 patients enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder.

- **Methods**: Subjects were primary caregivers of 500 patients with bipolar disorder diagnosed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Affective Disorder Evaluation. Caregivers were evaluated within one month after patients entered the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program using measures of burden, coping, health/mental health, and use of resources and costs.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine percent, 52%, and 61% of caregivers, respectively, experienced moderate or higher burden in relation to patient problem behaviors, role dysfunction, or disruption of household routine. High burden caregivers reported more physical health problems, depressive symptoms, health risk behavior and health service use, and less social support than less burden caregivers. They also provided more financial support to their bipolar relative.

- **Conclusions**: Burdens experienced by family caregivers of people with bipolar disorder are associated with problems in health, mental health, and cost.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^114ndcob]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

After removing duplicate studies, two reviewers (NX, LY) independently screened the article titles and abstracts for relevance against the eligibility criteria and resolved all discrepancies via discussion. The same protocol was followed for full-text screening.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction of the included studies was conducted by one reviewer (NX) using a piloted data extraction template. The information to be extracted was established a priori and included: (1) author(s) and publication year, (2) study design, (3) sample size, (4) definition of mixed features used, (5) dosage, (6) study assessment(s), and (7) outcome(s) of interest.

- **Quality assessment**: Two independent reviewers (NX and LY) used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Studies (RoB2) to assess the included RCTs' risk of bias. All conflicts were resolved via discussion.

### Self-management and bipolar disorder — a clinician's guide to the literature 2011–2014 [^116XN7a4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This review provides clinicians and individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) with an overview of evidence-based skills shown to be effective in BD and amenable to self-management. These include psychoeducation; monitoring moods, medications, and social function; sleep hygiene; setting goals and relapse plans; and healthy lifestyles, such as physical activity, healthy eating, weight loss and management, and managing medical comorbidities. Currently available self-management resources for BD are summarized by mode of delivery: workbooks, mobile technologies, internet, and peer-led interventions.

Regardless of the self-management intervention or topic, the research suggests that personally tailored interventions of longer duration and greater frequency may be necessary to achieve maximal benefit among individuals with BD. Means to support these self-management interventions as self-sustaining identities are critically needed. It is hoped that the recent investment in patient-centered research and care will result in best practices for the self-management of BD by mode of delivery. Since self-management of BD should complement rather than replace medical care, clinicians need to partner with their patients to incorporate and support advances in self-management for individuals with BD.

### Expanded treatment options and addressing unmet needs in the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder [^1127zhQT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder presents on a spectrum, with bipolar depression at one end and bipolar I on the other, and a host of other presentations in between. In addition to its many permutations and the difficulty of differentiating between diagnoses, comorbidities, incorrect treatment, and low self-report contribute to delayed diagnoses and inappropriate or delayed treatment. Once a diagnosis is reached, the latest evidence of the safety and efficacy profiles of existing and emerging treatments adds to the complexity when developing treatment strategies for patients with bipolar disorder.

As guidelines are updated and new treatments become available, developing individualized treatment regimens is key, and collaboration between clinician, patient, and family is critical in optimizing patient outcomes. New treatment options can reduce some of the side effect burdens associated with treating bipolar disorder, and clinicians should use measurement-based care to assess whether treatment changes are necessary, which requires engaging with the patient to monitor efficacy and manage side effects. It is important to ensure that the patient and family understand the information to foster informed decision-making and create a better therapeutic alliance. Involving patients in designing their own treatment strategies according to their tolerability criteria can help combat the 90% nonadherence rate and ultimately lead to better patient care.

### Evidence-based treatment strategies for treatment-resistant bipolar depression: A systematic review [^111wajMa]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment resistance in bipolar depression is a common clinical problem that constitutes a major challenge for the treating clinician due to a paucity of treatment options. The objective of this paper was to review the evidence for treatment options in treatment-resistant bipolar depression, as found in randomized controlled trials, with special attention to the definition and assessment of treatment resistance.

- **Methods**: A Medline search (from database inception to May 2012) was performed using the search terms treatment resistance or treatment refractory and bipolar depression or bipolar disorder. This was supplemented with 43 separate searches using various pharmacologic agents or technical interventions as search terms.

- **Results**: Only seven studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies examined the effects of ketamine (n = 1), (ar)modafinil (n = 2), pramipexole (n = 1), lamotrigine (n = 1), inositol (n = 1), risperidone (n = 1), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (n = 2).

- **Conclusions**: The available level I evidence for treatment strategies in resistant bipolar depression is extremely scarce. Although the response rates reported are reassuring, most of the strategies remain experimental. There is an urgent need for further study in homogeneous patient samples using a clear concept of treatment resistance.

### Mood swing and mood stabilizer: How specific are these terms [^113MajyL]. Bipolar Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

In the DSM-IIIR in 1987, the category title for depressive and bipolar disorders was changed from affective disorders to mood disorders. Within a short period of time thereafter, "mood swing" and "mood stabilizer" became very commonly used terms in psychiatry with bipolar implications.

- **Methods**: Terms and definitions in recent texts, articles, and dictionaries pertaining to mood fluctuations have been reviewed.

- **Results**: The term "mood" was seldom part of psychiatric terminology until the late 1970s. "Mood swing" and "mood stabilizer", as used in the psychiatric literature, are primarily nonspecific and often misleading concepts — particularly as a basis for treatment decisions. Affective fluctuations and shifts to irritability and/or anger in persons with personality and depressive disorders are being viewed by many in the mental health field as cyclically biphasic (between depressed to elated), which is clearly at variance with research findings.

- **Conclusions**: More data-based research on mood variations is needed to authoritatively remedy this situation.

### Managing bipolar disorder from urgent situations to maintenance therapy [^113PctYK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment for bipolar disorder consists of two goals: managing urgent situations and transitioning patients into maintenance therapy. Patients with bipolar disorder who present in urgent situations, including symptoms of suicidality, aggression, occupational impairment, legal involvement, and psychosis, require quick and efficient identification and resolution of symptoms. Once patients are stabilized, clinicians must implement maintenance therapy to manage behavioral symptoms, promote optimal functioning, and ultimately achieve full, functional recovery.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^116LE4iN]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of nonrefractory patients with the disorder. Therefore, not surprisingly, most treatment recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities depend heavily on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little direction for the clinician regarding optimal next steps for non- or partial-responders and those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given this, and the paucity of RCTs at later treatment junctures, we thought it appropriate to begin a discussion of the quality of the data that some experts in the field might consider when choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations.

We acknowledge that many other clinical investigators may prefer very different sequences. Nonetheless, we believe the suggestions offered here might be useful to some clinicians in the field, potentially initiating discussions of other options in the literature. At the same time, they provide a preliminary outline for a new series of much-needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice. Given the very wide range of the quality of the data and clinical principles on which the suggestions are based, only minimal references are included, and a comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option would be outside the scope of this manuscript.

### Differential diagnosis of major depressive disorder versus bipolar disorder: Current status and best clinical practices [^112aqkQ6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide psychiatrists and other health care professionals who treat patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder with a set of best practices, tools, and other methods. These resources aim to enhance their ability to accurately diagnose major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, and to reach this diagnosis sooner, considering specific patient-related circumstances and comorbidities.

### Systemic challenges in bipolar disorder management: A patient-centered approach [^117NKEEN]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

In our study, the highest priority for bipolar disorder (BD) patients is better evidence on individualized pharmacotherapy and its alternatives, with emphasis on management of suicidal thoughts and manic states. The challenges in BD management appear to be driven by two interacting systemic core conflicts: for the patient, seeking versus avoiding pharmacotherapy; for the provider, quantity versus quality of care. The conflicts underlying patient decision-making should be investigated as a target for psychoeducational interventions, with particular emphasis on mitigating the loss of BD positives.

Implementation of advanced operational excellence approaches for health system improvement should be more fully investigated in the domain of mental health care, with an emphasis on maximizing the benefits to patients with limited visit time and resources. BD management requires a "system overhaul" that supports patients in accessing mental health services, obtaining sufficient provider visit time, having their condition diagnosed early and accurately by means of objective tools, and receiving personalized multidisciplinary care, including psychosocial support.

### Differential item functioning of DSM-IV depressive symptoms in individuals with a history of mania versus those without: An item response theory analysis [^111hoSFj]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Although major depression is characteristic of both bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, there is disagreement as to whether there are distinct features of depression that differentiate these two conditions. The primary aim of this study was to use methods based in item response theory to evaluate differences in DSM-IV depression symptom endorsement in an epidemiological sample of individuals with a history of mania (i.e. bipolar depression) versus those without (i.e. unipolar depression).

Clinical interview data were drawn from a subsample of 13,058 individuals with bipolar or unipolar depression who had participated in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Using these data, a two-parameter item response model was used to estimate differential item functioning of DSM-IV depressive symptoms between these two groups.

Differences in severity parameter estimates revealed that suicidal ideation and psychomotor disturbance were more likely to be endorsed across most levels of depression severity in bipolar versus unipolar depression. Differences in discrimination parameter estimates revealed that fatigue was significantly less discriminating in bipolar versus unipolar depression.

Equating for level of depression symptom severity, study results revealed that suicidal ideation and psychomotor disturbance are endorsed more frequently in bipolar versus unipolar depression. Study data also suggested that fatigue may be endorsed more frequently in unipolar relative to bipolar samples.

Updated treatment guidelines are available for maintenance therapy for bipolar I disorder. These guidelines can assist clinicians in making informed treatment decisions, including pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions tailored to the individual characteristics of their patients. This CME activity outlines the recommendations for first-line treatment and subsequent steps. Additionally, it provides reasons why clinicians might not initiate maintenance with the highest ranked first-line options.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^115SBwYP]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

There is a need to provide up-to-date, clinically translatable data as it relates to the treatment of a major depressive episode (MDE) with mixed features.

- **Methods**: PubMed and OVID were searched from inception to July 22, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of pharmacological agents for adults with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) in an MDE with mixed features were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Studies (RoB2).

- **Results**: A total of seven studies were included in this systematic review. The studies identified were all short-term acute studies ranging from 6 to 8 weeks. Treatment with lurasidone, olanzapine, cariprazine, lumateperone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone was associated with a statistically significant reduction of depressive symptoms in MDEs with mixed features. Only lumateperone is studied in both BD subtypes [bipolar I disorder (BD-I), bipolar II disorder (BD-II)] and MDD, wherein efficacy in mixed features was the prespecified primary outcome. Lurasidone has a single study in MDD, while ziprasidone has data in a mixed sample of BD-II and MDD. Data for the other agents in mixed features is post hoc. Co-occurring hypomanic symptoms generally improved, and there was no significant difference between the above treatments and placebo with respect to hypomanic symptom severity intensification or treatment-emergent affective switching.

- **Conclusion**: Select atypical antipsychotics are effective in alleviating depressive symptoms in persons with mixed features.

### Effective treatment of bipolar depression: Monotherapy and combination strategies [^115dE17W]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Managing patients with bipolar disorder remains a challenge due to its chronic nature. In addition, bipolar depression remains understudied even though patients spend more time in depressive episodes than in manic ones. Effective treatment requires an accurate and timely diagnosis, psychoeducation, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and implementation of elements of the chronic care model. Pharmacologic strategies for treating bipolar depression differ from those for bipolar mania as well as those for unipolar depression and require knowledge of the efficacy and safety of agents including mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants both as monotherapy and in combination.

### Long-term treatment of bipolar depression and other issues [^113jX93p]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a highly episodic illness, and many patients require long-term or lifelong treatment to maintain a stable mood. Because depression is the dominant pole of both bipolar I and bipolar II disorder, maintenance therapy must prevent depressive recurrence. Although numerous treatment options exist for bipolar disorder, few have data supporting both short-term and long-term efficacy for bipolar depression. When choosing among treatments, clinicians must consider the existing evidence for the long-term effectiveness of various pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions for controlling all types of mood events.

### A model of the economic impact of a bipolar disorder screening program in primary care [^111BqYsG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Unrecognized bipolar disorder in patients presenting with a major depressive episode may lead to delayed diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and excessive costs. This study models the cost-effectiveness of screening for bipolar disorder among adults presenting for the first time with symptoms of major depressive disorder.

- **Method**: A decision-analysis model was used to evaluate the outcomes and cost over five years of screening versus not screening for bipolar disorder. Screening was defined as a one-time administration of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire at the initial visit, followed by a referral to a psychiatrist for patients screening positive for bipolar disorder. Health states included correctly diagnosed bipolar disorder, unrecognized bipolar disorder, and correctly diagnosed major depressive episodes. Model outcomes included rates of correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder and discounted costs (2006 US dollars) of screening and treating major depressive episodes. Literature was the primary source of data and was collected from September 2007 through March 2009.

- **Results**: According to the model, 1,000 adults in a health plan with 1 million adult members annually present with symptoms of major depressive disorder. An additional 38 patients were correctly diagnosed with depression (unipolar or a major depressive episode) or bipolar disorder (440 with screening vs. 402 without screening) through a one-time screening for bipolar disorder. Estimated five-year discounted costs per patient were $36,044 without screening and $34,107 with screening, resulting in savings of $1,937 per patient.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^117R5Yub]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In addressing these issues, researchers must carefully assess and account for heterogeneity through sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, or by considering alternative statistical approaches to ensure the robustness and reliability of their meta-analytic findings. Individual patient-level data meta-analysis is one means of addressing clinical and methodological diversity.

Here, we report the outcome of our IPD-MA of studies of psychological therapies where bipolar depression level was measured at intake and post-treatment. We hypothesized that psychological therapies are effective in reducing depressive symptoms for people living with Bipolar I and II disorders. We also hypothesized that those with higher levels of depression at baseline stand to benefit the most from receiving the treatment.

### Predictors of recurrence in bipolar disorder: Primary outcomes from the systematic treatment enhancement program for bipolar disorder (STEP-BD) [^113VjmS9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Little is known about clinical features associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder receiving treatment according to contemporary practice guidelines. The authors investigated features associated with the risk of recurrence.

The authors examined prospective data from a cohort of patients with bipolar disorder participating in the multicenter Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study for up to 24 months. For those who were symptomatic at study entry but subsequently achieved recovery, the time to recurrence of mania, hypomania, mixed state, or a depressive episode was examined using Cox regression.

Of 1,469 participants symptomatic at study entry, 858 (58.4%) subsequently achieved recovery. During up to 2 years of follow-up, 416 (48.5%) of these individuals experienced recurrences, with more than twice as many developing depressive episodes (298, 34.7%) compared to those who developed manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes (118, 13.8%). The time until 25% of the individuals experienced a depressive episode was 21.4 weeks, and until 25% experienced a manic/hypomanic/mixed episode was 85.0 weeks. Residual depressive or manic symptoms at recovery and the proportion of days depressed or anxious in the preceding year were significantly associated with shorter time to depressive recurrence. Residual manic symptoms at recovery and the proportion of days of elevated mood in the preceding year were significantly associated with shorter time to manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode recurrence.

Recurrence was observed significantly based on these findings.

### Selecting appropriate treatments for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder [^1143utf9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Long-term management of bipolar disorder is a crucial component of treatment because the recurrence of the illness negatively affects patients' daily lives and increases their risks for poor health and suicide. An ideal maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder is relatively simple to take, prevents recurrence of both manic and depressive episodes, and is well-tolerated over the long term. Although many different types of medications are used for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder, none can be considered ideal for a majority of people with bipolar disorder, and each specific form of therapy has different strengths and limitations.

Clinicians need to be aware of unique efficacy and side effect factors when choosing long-term therapy and consider treatment components, goals, and individual patient characteristics, which are essential to the successful long-term management of bipolar disorder. Additionally, several forms of psychotherapy specifically tailored to the needs of people with bipolar disorder should be considered as an adjunct to medication.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111YAcCH]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Due to the chronic, relapsing, and remitting nature of bipolar disorder, a long-term, multidisciplinary approach to management is needed. The Chronic Disease Management Model outlines several important principles to enhance long-term care for these individuals and their families. After basic clinical management, including attention to diagnosis, comorbidity, and medical health has been established, patient health education and pharmacotherapy should be the initial and foundational steps for all patients. Ideally, the patient will be connected to a healthcare team which includes at least one other healthcare professional (typically a nurse), in addition to the psychiatrist, for psychoeducation, ongoing monitoring, psychosocial support, and referral to community resources. All patients should have access to a primary care provider to attend to mental and physical health needs. If the patient is stable and discharged to primary care, the mental healthcare system should provide support directly to the primary care provider with attention to continuity of care. Additional psychosocial treatments may also be selected to fit the specific needs and preferences of the patient.

- **Therapeutic alliance**: A strong therapeutic alliance is central to improving treatment adherence and outcomes. Providers should encourage individuals to actively participate in treatment planning, using a shared decision-making approach. Whenever possible, family members or key friends should be included as part of the treatment process.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^113XLLmr]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Mixed features specifier applies to either a hypomanic, manic, or major depressive episode (MDE) and is defined and operationalized in the "Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition Text Revision" (DSM‐5‐TR) as three or more non‐overlapping "opposite polarity" symptoms. In addition to the aforementioned DSM‐5‐TR definition of mixed features, other definitions have been proposed that define mixed features with different severities of depressive and hypomanic symptoms. The predominance of depressive symptoms and episodes in bipolar disorder (BD) and their defining feature in major depressive disorder (MDD) indicates that a major depressive episode (MDE) with mixed features is a common presentation in clinical practice. Convergent evidence indicates that mixed features proxy a more complex illness presentation, including severity, suicidality, non‐recovery, chronicity, recurrence, and comorbidity. Moreover, the presence of mixed features contributes to misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis in individuals with BD.

It has been reported that conventional antidepressants are suboptimally effective in the treatment of MDEs with mixed features. Individuals living with MDEs and mixed features exhibit greater susceptibility to treatment‐related affective destabilization. Taken together, there is an urgent need to identify safer and more effective treatment strategies for individuals experiencing MDEs with mixed features as part of BD or MDD. Herein, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Bipolar disorder maintenance treatment: Monitoring effectiveness and safety [^114gzNYy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. The goal of treatment is to shorten or prevent mood episodes without increasing cycle frequency, thereby extending the duration of well periods. Treatment guidelines recommend mood stabilizers as first-line medications. Several atypical antipsychotics are also approved as monotherapy or as adjuncts to mood stabilizers for maintenance treatment.

Combination therapy with two mood stabilizers, or with a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic, may be necessary to achieve or maintain remission of the patient's symptoms. When treating patients with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics during the maintenance phase, physicians should systematically monitor for adverse effects, particularly weight gain and tolerability issues. Addressing these issues in a timely manner is essential to enhance treatment adherence and improve patient outcomes.

### Assessment of the psychometric properties of the 17- and 6-item Hamilton depression rating scales in major depressive disorder, bipolar depression and bipolar depression with mixed features [^113bfcgf]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2019). Low credibility.

Assessing therapeutic response in depression requires scales that adequately measure the core symptoms of depressive symptomatology. The main goal of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) and the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D6) in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), bipolar depression, and bipolar depression with mixed features. We conducted a reanalysis of a pragmatic clinical trial in an outpatient clinic for mood disorders that included eight weeks of follow-up.

A Mokken analysis was performed to evaluate the unidimensionality of the HAM-D17 and HAM-D6, and the Spearman correlation was used to assess concurrent validity between the HAM-D17, the HAM-D6, and quality of life scale (SF-36 and WHOQOL-BREF) scores. A total of 237 patients with a mean age of 40.2 years (± 11.7) were included. According to the DSM-IV criteria, 58 (24.5%) were diagnosed with MDD, and 73 (30.8%) were diagnosed with bipolar depression. Bipolar depression with mixed features was diagnosed in 106 (44.7%) patients according to the DSM-IV and supplemented by the Cincinnati criteria.

- **HAM-D6 scale performance**: Only the HAM-D6 scale proved to be unidimensional, showing strong homogeneity for evaluating MDD, moderate homogeneity for bipolar depression, and weak homogeneity for bipolar depression with mixed features.
- **Correlations**: Both the HAM-D17 and the HAM-D6 had inverse, significant correlations at baseline with SF-36 and WHOQOL-BREF scores.

This is the first study to include bipolar depression patients with mixed features in an assessment of HAM-D.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^113cVP6G]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine ultimately must proceed on the basis of what works for an individual patient. Data from randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for making clinical judgments. However, there are many pitfalls to this assumption. Patients are highly selected for homogeneity for the RCTs and typically do not represent the range and complexity of patients in the general population. There is little room for generating clinical predictors of response, as only half the patients receive the active medication; real responders cannot be readily separated from placebo responders, and secondary analyses of possible predictors and subgroups have methodological limitations that are frowned upon by the FDA and many journal editors and referees.

The most egregious deficit is that there are rarely sufficient RCTs in patients with bipolar disorder to cover the whole range of first-, second-, or third-line treatments. Even when an RCT does exist in a given area, it often provides no guidance for the clinician interested in knowing what might be the next best option for nonresponders. Another problem is that most treatment guidelines take the perspective that most patients are responsive to initial treatment. In reality, many patients, perhaps the majority in some settings, present with complex late-stage illness that shows considerable treatment refractoriness, which is rarely addressed in RCTs. These treatment-refractory patients are often excluded from industry-sponsored RCTs.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and international society for bipolar disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^113K9kG9]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Concordance between clinician and patient views of illness and treatment is a crucial determinant of adherence and reinforces the need for a collaborative approach to the treatment alliance. Asking about adherence behavior and attitudes in a non-judgmental manner and exploring the reasoning behind poor adherence are important parts of treatment, as up to half of patients do not take their medications as prescribed. Unrecognized treatment non-adherence can lead physicians to believe that the patient is non-responsive, resulting in unnecessary dose increases (especially problematic for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index), medication switches, or adjunctive medications. Treatment withdrawal may precipitate recurrence; 50%-90% of patients discontinuing lithium experience a recurrence within 3–5 months, with rapid lithium discontinuation associated with greater recurrence risk than gradual discontinuation. Withdrawal of other mood stabilizers also predicts recurrence. Risks for hospitalization, suicide, and lost productivity are also increased with non-adherence or discontinuation. A variety of patient, disorder, and treatment-related risk factors for non-adherence or partial adherence are outlined in Table 16.

- **Table 16: Risk factors for partial adherence or non-adherence to medication**.

Meta-analyses suggest that interventions aimed at engaging patients in treatment may more than double adherence compared to treatment as usual or other control groups. Brief psychoeducational interventions, motivational interviewing, and enhancing family support have been found to be beneficial in improving adherence.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^111iLyzW]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

By conducting a one-stage IPD-MA, all patient data from all studies were combined, with individuals nesting within studies. Multilevel linear mixed models were used and clustered at the study level to be able to detect and control for the unobserved heterogeneity between studies. Baseline depression score, age, and gender were included as covariates.

As part of the primary analysis, we examined how condition allocation affected depression outcomes. Afterward, we examined whether baseline depression moderated treatment outcomes. The outcome variable was the HAM-D posttreatment score, while condition allocation, baseline HAM-D depression score, age, and gender were included as predictors. An interaction between baseline depression scores and treatment outcomes was incorporated into the multilevel linear regression model to determine if baseline depression scores were a moderator of treatment outcomes.

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 28.0.1.0. A multilevel modelling approach was used to address both hypothesis 1, which predicted that psychological therapies are effective in reducing depressive symptoms for people living with Bipolar I and II disorders, and hypothesis 2, which predicted that treatment will be most effective for individuals with higher levels of depression. Multilevel modelling was used because individuals (level 1) were nested within studies (level 2). HPS scores were included as a level 2 predictor. In terms of data preparation, it is essential that fixed effects in multilevel models be easily interpreted within the context of the research goals.

Approximately 60% of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) who present with depression are misdiagnosed as having unipolar depression, which may lead to inappropriate treatment and potential worsening of symptoms. Several factors may interfere with a positive screen and an accurate BD diagnosis, especially substance use disorders. By facilitating effective communication with patients, implementing diagnostic criteria, and using assessment tools, clinicians can accurately identify the often subtle indicators of the disorder and recommend individualized treatment. Whichever pharmacologic is prescribed, it is important to tailor treatment for patients with BD by considering the disease course, potential adverse effects, and comorbidities.

### Effectiveness of adjunctive antidepressant treatment for bipolar depression [^1154pNpc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Episodes of depression are the most frequent cause of disability among patients with bipolar disorder. The effectiveness and safety of standard antidepressant agents for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression) have not been well studied. Our study was designed to determine whether adjunctive antidepressant therapy reduces symptoms of bipolar depression without increasing the risk of mania.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned subjects with bipolar depression to receive up to 26 weeks of treatment with a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy or a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo, under conditions generalizable to routine clinical care. A standardized clinical monitoring form adapted from the mood-disorder modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, was used at all follow-up visits. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criterion for a durable recovery (8 consecutive weeks of euthymia). Secondary effectiveness outcomes and rates of treatment-emergent affective switch (a switch to mania or hypomania early in the course of treatment) were also examined.

- **Results**: Forty-two of the 179 subjects (23.5%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy had a durable recovery, as did 51 of the 187 subjects (27.3%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo (P = 0.40). Modest nonsignificant trends favoring the group receiving adjunctive therapy were observed.

### Treatment strategies for bipolar depression [^112YHnmj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Resolving acute bipolar mood episodes is only one part of an overall strategy for treating bipolar disorder. Successful prevention of mood episode relapse, particularly bipolar depressive episodes, through effective continuation and maintenance therapies can greatly improve patient functioning and outcomes. Little evidence is available to guide decisions on the treatment of bipolar depression, especially in the maintenance phase, and additional research into effective options is urgently needed.

General strategies for treating patients with bipolar disorder include continuing the acute pharmacotherapeutic regimen into the maintenance phase and considering tolerability.

### Practical strategies for assessing and stabilizing bipolar patients in urgent situations [^113ECBeH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

For patients with bipolar disorder in urgent situations, psychiatric and nonpsychiatric clinicians should employ practical approaches to achieve optimum outcomes and ensure safe and rapid reduction of symptoms. This includes considering the treatment setting, clinician-patient relationship, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. Because biological, psychological, and social factors affect both the development and the treatment of acute bipolar states, treatment should address each factor to manage the illness.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^116m4rXS]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Unlike conventional meta-analyses, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis assesses moderator variables at the level of each participant, which generates more precise and unbiased estimates. The objective of this study was to investigate whether psychological therapy reduces depression symptoms in people with Bipolar I and II disorders and examine whether baseline depression has a moderating effect on treatment outcomes. Through several electronic databases, a systematic search was conducted. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating a psychological intervention for adults diagnosed with Bipolar I or II disorder. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full texts. The authors of the included studies were asked to provide IPD from their trials. A multilevel model approach was used to analyze the data. From the 7,552 studies found by our searches, six studies with 668 study participants were eligible. Intervention significantly reduced depression scores. There was a significant association between baseline depression and post-treatment depression scores. There was no statistically significant interaction between condition allocation and baseline depression score. When IPD from the two most comparable studies were analyzed, CBT had reduced depression scores relative to the comparator condition. The study included patient data from only six studies, which were heterogeneous in terms of intervention type, outcome measure, and comparators. Overall, the psychological interventions tested significantly reduced bipolar depression scores.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar depression in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114nPjRg]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar depression constitutes a major public health problem due to its substantial burden of disease. Although pharmacological interventions are available, guidelines require updated evidence synthesis to improve their recommendations. To inform evidence-based prescribing, we investigated the comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions with each other or placebo in adults with acute bipolar depression (Type I, Type II, or not otherwise specified), excluding those with substance misuse, unipolar depression, or schizophrenia. The search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, and LILACS from database inception up to April 13, 2023. Criteria for eligibility were a duration of 2–16 weeks with masked outcome assessments. We included combination, add-on design, and monotherapy studies. The co-primary outcomes were depressive symptoms, examined with standardized mean differences (SMDs), and manic switch, examined with odds ratios (ORs). We also investigated dropouts due to any reason, inefficacy, adverse events, and important side-effects as secondary outcomes. The confidence in the evidence was evaluated using Confidence-In-Network-Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020171726.

- **Results**: We analyzed data from 101 randomized controlled trials covering 20,081 participants.

### Activated depression: Mixed bipolar disorder or agitated unipolar depression [^115btLmG]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The combination of depression and activation presents clinical and diagnostic challenges. It can occur in either bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, manifesting as increased agitation as a dimension of depression. What is called agitation can consist of expressions of painful inner tension or disinhibited goal-directed behavior and thought. In bipolar disorder, elements of depression can be combined with those of mania. In this case, the agitation, in addition to increased motor activity and painful inner tension, must include symptoms of mania related to goal-directed behavior or manic cognition. These diagnostic considerations are important, as activated depression potentially carries increased behavioral risk, especially for suicidal behavior. Optimal treatments for depressive episodes differ between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.

### Response, remission, and recovery in bipolar disorders: What are the realistic treatment goals [^114MzTvR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder presents particular challenges with regard to assessing response to therapy. Criteria for determining remission and recovery have been suggested for mood disorders, but the clinical usefulness of these terms in bipolar disorder is elusive. Formal psychological rating scales may be impractical in a routine medical practice setting. As an alternative, clinicians might probe for information about particular "signal events", such as sleep disturbances, that may herald mood fluctuations. The ultimate goal of bipolar management should be complete and sustained remission, whenever possible, although most patients will not achieve this status for any significant length of time. Furthermore, overaggressive management might entail pushing medication doses to intolerable levels. Individual treatment goals should always take into account patient acceptance of side effect burden, allowing for trade-offs between treatment effect and quality of life. Noncompliance with therapy, notoriously common among patients suffering from bipolar disorder, can stem from drug side effects, treatment ineffectiveness, or even treatment success if the patient misses the manic symptoms. Despite effective treatment, relapse is common. Realistic treatment goals should strive for sustained symptom abatement while maximizing patient quality of life from visit to visit.

### The presentation, recognition and management of bipolar depression in primary care [^114Rws5a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of major depression and mania or hypomania. Most patients experience chronic symptoms of bipolar disorder approximately half of the time, most commonly subsyndromal depressive symptoms or a full depressive episode with concomitant manic symptoms. Consequently, patients with bipolar depression are often misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder. Individual patient characteristics and population screening tools may be helpful in improving recognition of bipolar depression in primary care.

Health risk behaviors, including tobacco use, sedentary activity level, and weight gain, are highly prevalent in patients with bipolar disorder, as are comorbid chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Patients with bipolar illness have about an eight-fold higher risk of suicide and a two-fold increased risk of death from chronic medical illnesses. Recognition of bipolar depression and its associated health risk behaviors and chronic medical problems can lead to the use of appropriate interventions for patients with bipolar disorder, which differ in important ways from the treatments used for major depressive disorder. These topics are reviewed in detail in this article.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115pPEmt]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder encompasses a spectrum of diagnostic subgroups primarily divided according to the severity of mood elevation experienced during acute episodes. On this spectrum, BDI is placed at one pole due to the presence of threshold manic episodes in which features include inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, psychomotor agitation, and risky behavior that leads to significant functional impairment. These episodes may include psychotic features and/or necessitate hospitalization.

At the other end of the spectrum, cyclothymia is characterized by a subthreshold presentation of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that, while chronic, do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode or manic/hypomanic episode. BDII sits between the two conditions with hypomanic episodes qualitatively like manic periods but, although distinct and observable, are not of sufficient duration or severity to cause significant functional impairment, hospitalization, or psychosis. Individuals with BDII also experience threshold depressive episodes.

The DSM‐5 has replaced the BD not otherwise specified (NOS) category in DSM‐IV with two new categories: other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder. Additionally, DSM‐5 includes substance/medication‐induced bipolar and related disorder and bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. For a more detailed discussion of diagnostic categories, the reader is advised to consult DSM‐5 and recent Royal Australian publications.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and international society for bipolar disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1132hWd6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological treatment for acute bipolar depression**: Lithium, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and other agents such as antidepressants have all been investigated for efficacy in managing bipolar depression. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability. Recommendations are summarized in Table 14.

- **Table 14**: Hierarchical rankings of first and second-line treatments recommended for management of acute bipolar I depression.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Examination of a patient presenting in a depressed state should include an assessment of the nature and severity of depression and associated symptoms, risk of suicide or self-harm behavior, ability to adhere to a treatment plan, availability of a psychosocial support network, and functional impairment. Laboratory investigations should also be completed. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (e.g. ambulatory or inpatient), with consideration given to management of safety risks. Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a depressive episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to alcohol or drug use, medications, other treatments, or a general medical condition. Patients should be supported to discontinue stimulant use and limit nicotine, caffeine, drug, and alcohol use. The course of illness and treatments used in prior episodes should be assessed.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^115yDLUz]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

There is a need to provide up-to-date, clinically translatable data related to the treatment of a major depressive episode (MDE) with mixed features. PubMed and OVID were searched from inception to July 22, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of pharmacological agents for adults with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) in an MDE with mixed features were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Studies (RoB2).

A total of seven studies were included in this systematic review. The studies identified were all short-term acute studies ranging from 6 to 8 weeks. Treatment with lurasidone, olanzapine, cariprazine, lumateperone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone was associated with a statistically significant reduction of depressive symptoms in MDEs with mixed features. Only lumateperone is studied in both BD subtypes [bipolar I disorder (BD-I), bipolar II disorder (BD-II)] and MDD, wherein efficacy in mixed features was the prespecified primary outcome. Lurasidone has a single study in MDD, while ziprasidone has data in a mixed sample of BD-II and MDD. Data for the other agents in mixed features is post hoc. Co-occurring hypomanic symptoms generally improved, and there was no significant difference between the above treatments and placebo with respect to hypomanic symptom severity intensification or treatment-emergent affective switching.

Select atypical antipsychotics are effective in alleviating depressive symptoms in persons with MDEs with mixed features.
