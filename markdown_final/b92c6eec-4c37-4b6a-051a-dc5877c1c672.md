## Question

Does otezla lower immune system

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Otezla (apremilast) "lowers" the immune system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "lowers the immune system" means clinically versus colloquially. Then, I should verify apremilast's mechanism of action and whether it is immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory. Next, I will review safety data for serious infections, opportunistic infections, and malignancy. After that, I should check guideline positions and real-world evidence, including COVID-19 data. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer with practical counseling points and exceptions, making sure I don't overstate anything without evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead. "Lowers the immune system" in medicine typically implies broad immunosuppression that increases susceptibility to serious infections, opportunistic infections, or malignancy, as seen with agents like methotrexate, cyclosporine, or TNF inhibitors; by contrast, targeted immunomodulation can reduce specific inflammatory pathways without globally suppressing host defenses, which is a different risk profile altogether [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check the mechanism of action. Apremilast is a selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP, which shifts signaling toward less pro-inflammatory and more anti-inflammatory mediators; it downregulates TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-γ while upregulating IL-10, but it does not cause lymphocyte depletion or broad cytotoxic immunosuppression, so it is best described as immunomodulatory rather than immunosuppressive [^d683ae65] [^906be446] [^e6e5fb21].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the clinical infection signal. In pooled randomized trials and long-term safety analyses, apremilast shows low rates of serious infections and serious opportunistic infections, and it lacks the boxed warnings for serious infections seen with JAK inhibitors; observational data also suggest a lower infection risk compared with methotrexate and adalimumab, which supports a relatively favorable infection profile in routine use [^a5e9dde7] [^eeddde63].

> Next, I should review COVID-19–era data because that stress-tests infection risk. Multiple reports and reviews suggest apremilast can be continued during the pandemic in uninfected patients, with case series and cohort observations indicating milder COVID-19 courses in patients on apremilast compared with some biologics; while not definitive, this aligns with its mechanism and safety profile and is reflected in dermatology guidance recommending continuation in the absence of active infection [^fb225724] [^4a191b24].

> I will now examine guideline positions to ensure I'm aligned with best practice. The AAD/NPF guidelines emphasize apremilast's favorable safety profile, including the absence of routine laboratory monitoring requirements, and position it as a reasonable option for patients with comorbidities or infection risk considerations; ACR/NPF PsA guidance similarly allows apremilast in patients with recurrent infections or when oral therapy is preferred, again reflecting a lower infection liability than many immunosuppressants [^d8714c13] [^0424854a].

> But wait, what if the user is concerned about malignancy or tuberculosis reactivation? I should double-check those. Unlike TNF inhibitors, apremilast has not been associated with increased malignancy risk in long-term pooled analyses, and there is no signal for TB reactivation, which is consistent with its non-cytotoxic, non-depleting mechanism; this further distinguishes it from classic immunosuppressants [^a5e9dde7] [^eeddde63].

> Let me consider special populations to ensure I'm not missing an exception. In patients with severe renal impairment, dose reduction is recommended, but this is pharmacokinetic rather than an immunologic safety issue; in pediatrics, safety and growth monitoring are advised, yet the infection profile remains acceptable in trials. In older adults, vigilance for GI effects and dehydration is prudent, but again this does not translate into broad immunosuppression [^6e887e1e] [^ebf00bc8] [^a7cef43c].

> I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Apremilast does not "lower the immune system" in the sense of broad immunosuppression; it is an immunomodulator that reduces specific pro-inflammatory cytokines while preserving host defense, with low rates of serious infections and no requirement for routine infection-related lab monitoring, making it a safer systemic option for many patients, including those with higher infection risk or comorbidities where immunosuppression would be undesirable [^d683ae65] [^a5e9dde7] [^d8714c13].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical counseling is accurate. Patients should be counseled on early gastrointestinal adverse effects and weight loss, and clinicians should screen for depression given the small signal observed in trials; importantly, patients can generally receive vaccinations, including live vaccines, without the same precautions required for biologics, though shared decision-making is always wise, and any active infection should prompt holding therapy while it is treated [^6e887e1e] [^58c97890] [^4a191b24].

Otezla (apremilast) **does not broadly suppress the immune system** like traditional immunosuppressants. It is a selective PDE4 inhibitor that **modulates inflammation** by increasing cAMP and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23) while sparing broader immune function [^d683ae65] [^906be446]. Clinically, it is not associated with increased risks of serious infections, opportunistic infections, or malignancy, and **does not require routine lab monitoring** for immunosuppression [^a5e9dde7] [^eeddde63] [^d8714c13]. However, it can cause gastrointestinal side effects and rare mood changes, so patients should be monitored for these [^6e887e1e] [^0835e813].

---

## Mechanism of action and immune effects

- **PDE4 inhibition**: Apremilast inhibits PDE4, increasing intracellular cAMP and shifting signaling toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype [^d683ae65].
- **Cytokine modulation**: Reduces TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-γ, and increases IL-10, without broad immune suppression [^906be446] [^c5a191b8].
- **Selective effect**: Unlike immunosuppressants, it does not deplete immune cells or broadly impair host defense [^d683ae65].

---

## Clinical evidence on immune suppression

- **Infection risk**: Clinical trials and real-world data show no significant increase in serious or opportunistic infections versus placebo or active comparators [^a5e9dde7] [^eeddde63].
- **Malignancy risk**: No increased malignancy risk has been observed in long-term studies [^a5e9dde7] [^eeddde63].
- **COVID-19 data**: Observational data suggest no excess COVID-19 risk and possibly milder disease courses, though evidence is limited [^fb225724] [^4a191b24].

---

## Safety profile and monitoring

- **Common adverse effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, headache, and weight loss are most frequent; most are mild to moderate and self-limited [^6e887e1e] [^273000b3].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Rare depression and suicidal ideation have been reported; screen patients with a history of depression [^0835e813] [^6b493c99].
- **Monitoring**: No routine lab monitoring is required, but monitor weight and mood during therapy [^d8714c13] [^6e887e1e].

## Comparison with other immunosuppressive therapies

| **Attribute** | **Apremilast (otezla)** | **Traditional immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate, biologics)** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Selective PDE4 inhibition | Broad immune suppression |
| Infection risk | Low | Higher |
| Malignancy risk | No increase observed | Variable; some increased risk |
| Lab monitoring | Not required | Required |
| Route | Oral | Oral or injectable |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines endorse apremilast for moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, including in patients with comorbidities or infection risk, given its favorable safety profile [^541d7c63] [^227ae88d] [^0424854a]. It is **especially useful when immunosuppression is undesirable** or contraindicated [^d8714c13].

---

## Special considerations

In severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), **reduce the dose to 30 mg once daily** [^6e887e1e]. Use in pregnancy only if benefits outweigh risks; **animal data suggest fetal risk**, though human data are limited [^4378ca2b] [^dc021295].

---

Otezla **does not cause broad immune suppression**; it selectively modulates inflammation with a favorable safety profile and no need for routine lab monitoring. It is a valuable option for patients who need systemic therapy but should avoid immunosuppression, with monitoring for GI and mood effects [^d683ae65] [^a5e9dde7] [^d8714c13].

Mild to Moderate Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Trial in Adults

Apremilast was evaluated in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (PSOR-4) in adult subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . A total of 595 subjects were randomized to receive apremilast 30 mg twice daily (297 subjects) or placebo twice daily (298 subjects) during the placebo- controlled phase of the trial. The trial also included an open label extension phase during which all subjects received apremilast 30 mg twice daily. Overall, the safety profile observed in the apremilast group during the placebo- controlled phase was consistent with the safety profile previously established in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Introduction

Psoriasis, a chronic systemic inflammatory disease involving the skin, is the result of dysregulated immune responses. 1 In Japan, psoriasis is reported to affect approximately 0.34% of the population, 2 similar to prevalence reported in other Asian populations, but lower than the 1–3% seen in other global populations. 3 In Japan, approximately 60% of total psoriasis cases occur in men. 2 Because psoriasis is a chronic disease, the long‐term treatment goals are to maximize symptom control while minimizing safety risks. For patients with moderate to severe disease, however, the clinical benefits of currently available systemic treatment options are often compromised by safety and tolerability issues. 4, 5

Apremilast (Otezla; Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA) is an oral, small‐molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that works within immune cells to regulate the production of pro‐inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)‐17, IL‐23 and tumor necrosis factor‐α, and anti‐inflammatory mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. 6, 7, 8 In phase 2 clinical studies in patients with psoriasis, apremilast decreased lesional skin epidermal thickness, inflammatory cell infiltration and the expression of pro‐inflammatory genes, including IL‐17A, IL‐23 and IL‐22. 9 Phase 2 and 3 studies have demonstrated apremilast is effective, has an acceptable safety profile, and is generally well tolerated in patients with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 In a phase 2b dose‐finding study conducted in the United States and Canada, apremilast administered p.o. at 20 or 30 mg b.i.d. was efficacious, safe and well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 10 This report describes the results of a phase 2b randomized, placebo‐controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of apremilast in the treatment of Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for up to 68 weeks.

Behçet's Disease Clinical Trials

OTEZLA was evaluated in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (BCT-002) in adult subjects with Behçet's Disease (BD) with active oral ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . A total of 207 subjects were randomized to receive OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily or placebo twice daily. Titration was used over the first 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . After Week 12, all subjects received treatment with OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily. Subjects ranged in age from 19 to 72, with a mean age of 40 years.

Diarrhea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection were the most commonly reported adverse reactions (see Table 5). The proportion of subjects with BD who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the placebo-controlled period of the trial, was 2.9% for subjects treated with OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily and 4.9% for placebo-treated subjects.

Other adverse reactions reported in subjects on OTEZLA in psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and Behçet's Disease clinical trials are :

Gastrointestinal Disorders: Gastroesophageal reflux disease
Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity
Investigations: Weight decrease
Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Decreased appetite
Nervous System Disorders: Migraine
Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: Cough

### Clinical characteristics and safety profiles of Japanese psoriasis patients who continued apremilast treatment for 6 and 12 Months: a post hoc analysis of an apremilast postmarketing surveillance study [^ff24dae0]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Psoriasis, a chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease, not only affects the skin but also impacts comorbid burden potentially resulting in psoriatic arthritis and metabolic syndrome/dysfunction. It is an immune‐mediated disease characterized by excessive stimulation of T cells, leading to the formation of thickened, scaly plaques on the skin.

Apremilast (Otezla tablets, Amgen K.K. Tokyo, Japan), a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, suppresses the production of cytokines involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. Apremilast efficacy and safety have been confirmed in international clinical trials, but real‐world clinical practice data in Japanese psoriasis patients are limited. Recently, a postmarketing surveillance study of apremilast we published showed that orally administered apremilast was well tolerated and effective in Japanese patients with plaque psoriasis (PsO) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), with a consistent safety profile in real‐world settings relative to randomized clinical trials with no new safety signals. Here, we performed a post hoc analysis of the postmarketing surveillance study and evaluated the patient characteristics, persistence rate, effectiveness, and safety profiles of psoriasis patients who continued apremilast during the first 6 months and between 6 and 12 months.

1 INTRODUCTION

Plaque psoriasis (or psoriasis vulgaris; PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are complex, multifactorial, chronic immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the skin and joints respectively and are associated with a high disease burden and significantly impaired health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).

One of the key inflammatory pathways in PsO pathogenesis involves the phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4)‐mediated degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a key intracellular second messenger, which promotes an increase in pro‐inflammatory mediators and a decrease in anti‐inflammatory mediators.

Apremilast (Otezla®; Amgen Inc.) is an orally administered, small molecule that selectively inhibits PDE4, resulting in increased intracellular cAMP levels and subsequent downstream effects on intracellular pathways involved in innate and adaptive immunity as well as in non‐immune cells.These effects suppress the production of a broad range of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor‐α, interleukin (IL)‐17, and IL‐23 and promote the expression of anti‐inflammatory cytokines such as IL‐10.As apremilast acts early in the inflammatory cascade, it is thought to lead to a broader and more balanced regulation of inflammatory mediators than biological agents that target a specific mediator.

Apremilast has been studied extensively in clinical trials of patients with PsO and PsA including the phase 2b PSOR‐005 studyand phase 3 ESTEEM 1 and 2 studies,,which showed that apremilast reduced the severity and extent of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and was well tolerated. Furthermore, the phase 3 PALACE 1–4 studies,,,demonstrated the clinical benefits and favorable safety profile of apremilast among patients with PsA. In a phase 2b study conducted in Japan,apremilast demonstrated similar efficacy and tolerability to the phase 2 and phase 3 studies conducted in multiple countries,,,,confirming that data from the pivotal phase 3 studies can be extrapolated to Japanese patients. Based on those studies, apremilast was approved in Japan in 2016 for the treatment of PsO in patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies as well as for the treatment of PsA.This post‐marketing surveillance (PMS) study was conducted to investigate the safety and effectiveness of apremilast in Japanese patients with PsO and PsA treated in real‐world clinical practice.

### Mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of apremilast for psoriasis [^906be446]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease with manifestations resulting from a dysregulated immune response. In psoriatic skin, expression of all phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) isoforms (A-D), part of a family of enzymes known to regulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels and immune homeostasis, is elevated compared with healthy controls. Agents that inhibit the enzymatic activity of PDE4, the predominant PDE in most immune cells, exert well-recognized anti-inflammatory effects. Apremilast is a selective PDE4 inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. In vitro and in vivo investigations have demonstrated the beneficial impact of apremilast treatment on PDE4 activity, inflammatory signal expression, and dermal psoriasiform signs. In patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, treatment with apremilast is associated with significant reductions in plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-17F, IL-17A, IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor-α compared with placebo as early as week 4; decreases in cytokine levels were sustained with continued treatment. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that while changes in IL-17F are the most important predictor of improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores, apremilast exerts synergistic attenuating effects among a key group of cytokines involved in the pathology of psoriasis, and these effects correlate with improved skin symptoms. These in vitro and clinical data demonstrate that the beneficial effects of apremilast on known inflammatory mediators are associated with its clinical efficacy. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(8):835-840.

### Apremilast in psoriatic arthritis [^0d47b15e]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Apremilast is a small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The efficacy and safety of apremilast in PsA have been demonstrated in four phase III trials. The compound has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe PsA in the United States and in Europe. Apremilast also shows efficacy in psoriatic skin disease. Its mode of action is based on an increase of immune-regulatory cAMP in immune cells, which is mediated through the inhibition of the cAMP-degrading enzyme PDE4. Higher levels of cAMP inhibit cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, such as TNF-alpha or IL-23, resulting in clinical improvement.

### Apremilast for immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced psoriasis: a case series [^ca295461]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Apremilast is an orally available phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for treatment of adults with moderate to severe psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. PDE4 inhibition leads to the accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which gives rise to both an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages, such as IL-10, as well as a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-22, and IL-13.Apremilast has shown clinical efficacy in both skin and arthritic psoriasis. Generally, the safety of apremilast at a dosage of 30 mg bid appears to be sound, given the most frequent adverse events include light-to-mild nausea and diarrhea during the first weeks of treatment. Apremilast's safety profile is further emphasized by the absence of tuberculosis reactivation, serious infections, and malignancies.For this reason, it is regarded more as an immunomodulating agent rather than an immunosuppressant drug.

5.1	Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported during post marketing surveillance. Avoid the use of OTEZLA/OTEZLA XR in patients with known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulation. If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions develop during treatment, discontinue OTEZLA/OTEZLA XR and institute appropriate therapy.

5.2	Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting

There have been reports of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting associated with the use of OTEZLA. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting. Patients who reduced dosage or discontinued OTEZLA generally improved quickly. Consider OTEZLA/OTEZLA XR dosage reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.

5.3	Depression

Treatment with apremilast is associated with an increased incidence of depression. Before using OTEZLA/OTEZLA XR in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior, carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with OTEZLA/OTEZLA XR. Advise patients, their caregivers, and families of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with OTEZLA/OTEZLA XR if such events occur.

Plaque Psoriasis Involving the Genital Area

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (PSOR-5 [NCT03777436]) was conducted in 289 adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the genital area. Subjects had a modified static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia (sPGA-G) score of ≥ 3 (moderate or severe), sPGA score of ≥ 3 (moderate or severe), and had an inadequate response or were intolerant to topical therapy for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the genital area.

Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg twice daily (n = 143) or placebo twice daily (n = 146) for 16 weeks. At Week 16, the placebo group was switched to receive OTEZLA and the OTEZLA group remained on drug through Week 32. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved a modified sPGA-G response (defined as a score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline) at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects who achieved an sPGA response (defined as a score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline) at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 4-point improvement in the 11-point Genital Psoriasis Itch Numeric Rating Scale (GPI-NRS) item score within the Genital Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (GPSS) at Week 16, among subjects with a baseline GPI-NRS score of ≥ 4.

Subjects ranged in age from 18-81 years, with a median age of 44 years. The proportions of subjects with a modified sPGA-G score of 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe) at baseline were 86.9% and 13.1%, respectively. The proportions of subjects with a sPGA score of 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe) at baseline were 88.6% and 11.1%, respectively. Baseline BSA involvement was < 10% for 57.4% of the subjects and ≥ 10% for 42.6% of the subjects. The mean baseline GPI-NRS score was 6.5. Of the enrolled subjects, 78.9% did not receive prior conventional systemic therapy and 84.4% were biologic-naïve.

The proportions of subjects who achieved a modified sPGA-G response, sPGA response, and GPI-NRS response are presented in Table 10.

14.1	Adult Psoriatic Arthritis

The safety and efficacy of OTEZLA was evaluated in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (PsA-1 [NCT01172938], PsA-2 [NCT01212757], and PsA-3 [NCT01212770]) of similar design. A total of 1493 adult subjects with active PsA (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) despite prior or current treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy were randomized. Subjects enrolled in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. One qualifying psoriatic skin lesion of at least 2 cm in diameter was required in Trial PsA-3. Previous treatment with a biologic, including TNF blockers was allowed (up to 10% could be TNF blocker therapeutic failures). Across the three trials, subjects were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 496), OTEZLA 20 mg (n = 500), or OTEZLA 30 mg (n = 497) given orally twice daily. Titration was used over the first 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Subjects were allowed to receive stable doses of concomitant methotrexate [MTX (≤ 25 mg/week)], sulfasalazine [SSZ (≤ 2 g/day)], leflunomide [LEF (≤ 20 mg/day)], low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone a day), and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the trial. Treatment assignments were stratified based on small molecule DMARD use at baseline in Trials PsA-1, PsA-2 and PsA-3. There was an additional stratification of body surface area (BSA) > 3% with psoriasis in Trial PsA-3. The subjects who were therapeutic failures of > 3 agents for PsA (small molecules or biologics), or > 1 biologic TNF blocker were excluded.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at Week 16. Placebo-controlled efficacy data were collected and analyzed through Week 24. Subjects whose tender and swollen joint counts had not improved by at least 20% were considered non-responders at Week 16. Placebo non-responders were re-randomized 1:1 in a blinded fashion to either OTEZLA 20 mg twice daily or 30 mg twice daily following the titration schema [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . OTEZLA subjects remained on their initial treatment. At Week 24, all remaining placebo subjects were re-randomized to either 20 mg twice daily or 30 mg twice daily.

Subjects with subtypes of PsA were enrolled across the three trials, including symmetric polyarthritis (62.0%), asymmetric oligoarthritis (27.0%), distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint arthritis (6.0%), arthritis mutilans (3.0%), and predominant spondylitis (2.1%). The median duration of PsA disease was 5 years. Subjects received concomitant therapy with at least one DMARD (65.0%), MTX (55.0%), SSZ (9.0%), LEF (7.0%), low dose oral corticosteroids (14.0%), and NSAIDs (71.0%). Prior treatment with small molecule DMARDs only was reported in 76.0% of subjects and prior treatment with biologic DMARDs was reported in 22.0% of subjects, which includes 9.0% who had failed prior biologic DMARD treatment.

Clinical Response in Subjects with Psoriatic Arthritis

The percent of subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Trials PsA-1, PsA-2, and PsA-3 are presented in Table 6 below. OTEZLA ± DMARDs, compared with Placebo ± DMARDs resulted in a greater improvement in signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis as demonstrated by the proportion of subjects with an ACR 20 response at Week 16.

OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily resulted in improvement for each ACR component, compared to placebo at Week 16 in Trial PsA-1 (Table 7). Consistent results were observed in Trials PsA-2 and PsA-3.

Treatment with OTEZLA resulted in improvement in dactylitis and enthesitis in subjects with pre-existing dactylitis or enthesitis.

### Apremilast: a novel oral treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^d683ae65]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease associated with several co-morbidities and negative impacts on a patient's quality of life. Despite the advances in biologic therapy, there are still unmet needs in the treatment of psoriasis, as current treatments are limited in terms of long-term efficacy, tolerability, safety, route of administration, and cost. Apremilast is an oral, small-molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that works intracellularly by blocking the degradation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, resulting in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels in phosphodiesterase 4-expressing cells. This inhibition results in the reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators, and an increased expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, providing apremilast with an anti-inflammatory rather than immunosuppressive mode of action. Apremilast offers a novel therapeutic option for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and may fulfill some of the unmet needs in patients with psoriasis. Potential advantages of apremilast include moderate activity for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and efficacy in difficult-to-treat forms of psoriasis, a good safety profile, no need of laboratory prescreening or ongoing monitoring for laboratory parameters, owing to the absence of organ toxicity, a potentially advantageous weight loss effect, and a convenient oral administration and dosing. Cost effectiveness and health economics considerations will be decisive in determining the ultimate place of apremilast in the therapeutic armamentarium for psoriasis.

### Apremilast in dermatology: a review of literature [^13e736ce]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Apremilast is an orally administered small molecule that specifically inhibits the phosphodiesterase-4 enzyme and modulates the immune system by increasing the levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and inhibiting IL-2 & 8, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. It is FDA approved for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and oral ulcers of Behcet's disease. More recently, apremilast has been used off-label to treat varied dermatological diseases where systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents were not effective. We review the efficacy and safety of apremilast in the treatment of aphthous stomatitis, Behçet's disease, chronic actinic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, lichen planus, and discoid lupus erythematosus in cases where standard treatment has failed.

### Apremilast prevents blistering in human epidermis and stabilizes keratinocyte adhesion in pemphigus [^da34a0d8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Epidermal integrity is critically dependent on desmosomes, intercellular junctions required for proper adhesion. The adhesive function of desmosomes is maintained by desmosomal cadherins of the desmoglein (Dsg) and desmocollin (Dsc) subfamilies, which are linked to the keratin filament cytoskeleton via several plaque proteins, including plakoglobin (Pg), plakophilins (Pkp) and desmoplakin (Dp) in the epidermis,. Additionally, desmosomes regulate signaling pathways to adapt cellular behavior and differentiation,.

Pemphigus is a life-threatening bullous autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies against Dsg1, Dsg3, Dsc3 as well as other antigens cause flaccid blistering in the epidermis and in mucous membranes of the oral cavity and elsewhere –. Mechanisms leading to loss of keratinocyte cohesion comprise direct inhibition of Dsg3 interaction and dysregulation of a plethora of intracellular signaling pathways upon autoantibody binding –. Dsg1 and Dsg3 act as signal transducers and regulate autoantibody-specific signaling pathways,. Signaling molecules contribute to the loss of intercellular adhesion and comprise p38MAPK, PLC, Erk, ADAM10 and Src. In contrast, cAMP represents a cellular rescue mechanism –. Pemphigus autoantibodies slightly increase cAMP in keratinocytes. This mechanism is sufficient to prevent loss of intercellular adhesion when augmented pharmacologically. Besides, cAMP strengthens cadherin-mediated adhesion in different tissues and enhances desmosomal adhesion in cardiomyocytes via phosphorylation of Pg at S665,.

In pemphigus, therapeutic strategies range from unspecific immunosuppression, targeted immunotherapy such as immune-apheresis and rituximab depleting autoantibody-producing B cells to experimental methods which are not yet clinically approved,–. All these strategies modulate the immune system of the patients and thus are associated with considerable side effects. A precise understanding of the mechanisms leading to loss of intercellular adhesion as well as therapeutic approaches to stabilize desmosomes in keratinocytes would fulfill an unmet medical need.

During the past years, several phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors were developed and clinically applied,. Among them, apremilast is clinically approved for treatment of psoriasis and Behcet disease –. Recently, a pemphigus patient has been treated successfully with apremilast. However, therapeutic effects of apremilast were mainly attributed to the immune system and effects on keratinocytes have not been investigated yet. Here, we demonstrate that apremilast is effective to abrogate epidermal blistering in pemphigus and enhances desmosomal anchorage to the cytoskeleton and thus may represent a new treatment approach in pemphigus.

### Efficacy and safety of apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis over 52 weeks: a phase III, randomized controlled trial (ESTEEM 2) [^de4882f5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, regulates immune responses associated with psoriasis.

Objectives

ESTEEM 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg twice daily for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

This phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized adults to apremilast or placebo (2 : 1). At week 16, placebo patients switched to apremilast. At week 32, apremilast patients achieving ≥ 50% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) were rerandomized (1 : 1) to continue apremilast or receive placebo. Upon loss of 50% of PASI improvement obtained at week 32, patients rerandomized to placebo resumed apremilast.

Results

The modified intention-to-treat population (full analysis set) included 137 placebo and 274 apremilast patients. At week 16, significantly more apremilast patients achieved PASI 75 (28·8%), PASI 50 (55·5%) and static Physician's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (20·4%) vs. placebo (5·8%, 19·7%, 4·4%, respectively; P < 0·001). Most patients rerandomized to apremilast at week 32 had a PASI 50 response at week 52 (80%). Patients treated with apremilast showed significant improvements in quality of life (as assessed by the Dermatology Life Quality Index) and pruritus at week 16 compared with placebo (P < 0·001). The exposure-adjusted incidence of adverse events did not increase with continued apremilast treatment for up to 52 weeks. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection.

Conclusions

Apremilast was effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis over 52 weeks.

Plakoglobin S665 phosphorylation is critical for keratinocyte adhesion and epidermal integrity

In cardiomyocytes, positive adhesiotropy was dependent on the desmosomal plaque protein Pg and its phosphorylation at S665 via protein kinase A (PKA). In accordance, overexpression of a phospho-deficient Pg-mutant (Pg-S665A) abolished positive effects of cAMP increase on cardiomyocyte adhesion. Similarly, in keratinocytes PKA contributes to protective cAMP signaling in pemphigus and H89 abolishes the protective effects of apremilast. Because we observed that Pg is also phosphorylated at S665 in keratinocytes when cAMP levels were increased by incubation with apremilast both in vitro and ex vivo, we further investigated the role of Pg S665-phosphorylation for keratinocyte adhesion. To this end, we established a previously unreported Pg-S665A-phospho-deficient knock-in mouse model and derived murine keratinocytes from these mice.

Although mice bearing the Pg-S665A mutation were viable and showed no histologic epidermal alterations, epidermis was fragile and the desmosomal composition of keratinocytes was critically altered. The pemphigus antigens Dsg1 and Dsg3 were downregulated and the keratin cytoskeleton was severely compromised. This was recapitulated in cultured keratinocyte cell lines in which phospho-deficiency of Pg at S665 drastically impaired intercellular adhesion.

Apremilast as a new treatment paradigm to stabilize keratinocyte adhesion in skin diseases

Apremilast is a well-established therapeutic approach in psoriasis –. However, the mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of apremilast were up to now attributed to modulation of the immune system. For pemphigus, a recent case report in which a chronic, non-responsive PV patient was successfully treated with apremilast underlines the clinical importance of apremilast in treatment of skin diseases. Here, we report that PDE4-inhibition by apremilast not only affects the immune system, but also leads to a protective cAMP increase and strengthens intercellular adhesion in keratinocytes. Importantly, apremilast at a concentration of 1 µM abolished blister formation in vivo in a neonatal pemphigus mouse model. This is important as a well-established drug administration of 2×30 mg p.o./ day leads to comparable plasma concentrations without severe side effects.

### Efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of apremilast in recalcitrant plaque psoriasis: a phase II open-label study [^1b6dbae6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Apremilast, a small molecule specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4, works intracellularly to modulate pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. This phase II, multicenter, open-label study evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of apremilast in patients with recalcitrant plaque psoriasis.<BR>

Methods

This multicenter, open-label study comprised four phases: pre-treatment (≤35 days), treatment (12 weeks), extension (12 weeks), and observational follow-up (4 weeks). Patients with recalcitrant plaque psoriasis received apremilast 20 mg BID for 12 weeks. Responders (≥75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI-75]) continued treatment and non-responders (< PASI-75) were titrated to apremilast 30 mg BID through week 24. Efficacy assessments included change in static Physician's Global Assessment, PASI, and body surface area, and proportion of patients achieving PASI-50, PASI-75, and PASI-90. Other assessments included adverse events, lesional skin biopsies to assess changes in epidermal thickness, and immunohistochemistry to assess changes in peripheral blood subsets.

Results

A total of 30 patients were enrolled. At week 12, 67% of patients had a ≥1-point improvement in static Physician's Global Assessment, meeting treatment effect criterion. Mean percent decreases (improvements) from baseline were -59% for PASI score and -53% for body surface area. Most adverse events were mild. Median reduction in epidermal thickness was 34% at week 12 (P=0.083); five patients showed absence of keratin 16. Significant reductions in CD11c, CD3, and CD56 indicate that apremilast reduced myeloid dendritic cell, T-cell, and NK-cell or NK-T-cell infiltration into the epidermis and dermis. Reduced inflammatory leukocytes, with a pattern of broad, partial inhibition, suggested reduced IL-23/Th17 and Th22 response pathways.

Conclusions

These results confirm apremilast's biological and clinical activity and support ongoing studies in psoriasis. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00521339.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to OTEZLA during pregnancy. Information about the registry can be obtained by calling 1-877-311-8972 or visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing-study/otezla/.

Risk Summary

Available pharmacovigilance data with OTEZLA use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, but these data are extremely limited. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies with apremilast, OTEZLA/OTEZLA XR may increase the risk for fetal loss. In animal embryo-fetal development studies, the administration of apremilast to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis resulted in dose-related increases in abortion/embryo-fetal death at dose exposures approximately 2-times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (MRHD) and no adverse effect at an exposure of 1.4-times the MRHD. When administered to pregnant mice, during organogenesis there were no apremilast-induced malformations up to exposures 4-times the MRHD (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal loss. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune mediated, systemic inflammatory skin disease with a reported prevalence of 0.6%–4.8% in the general population. Bipolar disorder (BP) is a severe episodic psychiatric disorder that ranks as the fourth leading cause of disability. Recent evidence suggests that genetic and immunological factors play a significant role in the development of both disorders. Studies have also shown a higher association of psychiatric disorders among patients with psoriasis. Moreover, several autoimmune comorbidities have been reported in association with BP. Here, we describe a young woman with BP who developed psoriasis after 1 year of developing BP and showed exacerbations in psoriasis lesions with each manic episode. We also highlight the safe and efficacious use of apremilast for psoriatic lesions in the woman.

Abstract

Apremilast, an oral, small‐molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, works intracellularly within immune cells to regulate inflammatory mediators. This phase 2b randomized, placebo‐controlled study evaluated efficacy and safety of apremilast among Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In total, 254 patients were randomized to placebo, apremilast 20 mg b.i.d. (apremilast 20) or apremilast 30 mg b.i.d. (apremilast 30) through week 16; thereafter, all placebo patients were re‐randomized to apremilast 20 or 30 through week 68. Efficacy assessments included achievement of 75% or more reduction from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (‐75; primary) and achievement of static Physician Global Assessment (; secondary) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (minimal) at week 16. Safety was assessed through week 68. At week 16,‐75 response rates were 7.1% (placebo), 23.5% (apremilast 20; P = 0.0032 vs placebo) and 28.2% (apremilast 30; P = 0.0003 vs placebo);response rates (score of 0 or 1) were 8.8% (placebo), 23.9% (apremilast 20; P = 0.0165 vs placebo) and 29.6% (apremilast 30; P = 0.0020 vs placebo). Responses were maintained with apremilast through week 68. Most common adverse events (s) with placebo, apremilast 20 and apremilast 30 (0–16 weeks) were nasopharyngitis (8.3%, 11.8%, 11.8%), diarrhea (1.2%, 8.2%, 9.4%), and abdominal discomfort (1.2%, 1.2%, 7.1%), respectively. Exposure‐adjusted incidence of theses did not increase with continued apremilast treatment (up to 68 weeks). Apremilast demonstrated efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through 68 weeks that was generally consistent with prior studies.

Discussion

Pemphigus therapies rely on therapeutic strategies to suppress the immune system and are associated with severe side-effects. In contrast, no medication is available that directly targets adhesion of human keratinocytes. Therefore, we characterized whether apremilast-induced protective cAMP signaling may be effective to prevent acantholysis in PV and investigated the underlying mechanisms. We found that apremilast prevented PV-IgG-induced epidermal blistering in human epidermis ex vivo and in a murine pemphigus mouse model in vivo. In human epidermis, PV-IgG-induced loss of keratin filament anchorage was rescued by apremilast. These results were supported in vitro where apremilast abrogated PV-IgG-mediated loss of keratinocyte adhesion and blocked keratin filament reorganization, which is a morphological hallmark in pemphigus present in both patients’ skin lesions and human skin models,. We established a Pg-S665-phospho-deficient mouse model and found that phosphorylation of Pg at S665 is crucial for maintenance of epidermal integrity and keratinocyte adhesion.

Apremilast enhances cAMP signaling in keratinocytes and stabilizes keratinocyte adhesion in pemphigus

cAMP increase regulates cadherin-mediated adhesion in various tissues. For instance, for VE-cadherin, cAMP increase was reported both to stabilize VE-cadherin at the cell membrane and to contribute to proper barrier function of the endothelium. Further, cAMP increase in cardiomyocytes led to a phenomenon referred to as positive adhesiotropy and had a direct effect on adhesive strength of cardiac desmosomes. Adrenergic signaling induced redistribution of Dsg2 towards cell borders of cardiomyocytes and strengthened intercalated discs on the ultrastructural level,.

Here, we show that apremilast via protective cAMP signaling in keratinocytes is a promising approach to target loss of desmosomal adhesion in pemphigus patients. Apremilast prevented blister formation in a human ex vivo model as well as in a murine passive transfer PV model in vivo. In line with this, we reported previously that cAMP increase induced by the combination of the adenylate cyclase (AC) activator forskolin with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (F/R) similar to the β-sympathomimetic isoprenaline abolished loss of desmosomal adhesion caused by pemphigus autoantibodies in vitro and in a passive immune transfer mouse model in vivo.

Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults

The safety of OTEZLA was assessed in 1426 subjects in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily or placebo twice daily. Titration was used over the first 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 83 years, with an overall median age of 46 years.

Diarrhea, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection were the most commonly reported adverse reactions (see Table 4). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for subjects taking OTEZLA were nausea (1.6%), diarrhea (1.0%), and headache (0.8%). The proportion of subjects with plaque psoriasis who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction was 6.1% for subjects treated with OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily and 4.1% for placebo-treated subjects.

Severe worsening of psoriasis (rebound) occurred in 0.3% (4/1184) subjects following discontinuation of treatment with OTEZLA.

OTEZLA was evaluated in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (PSOR-3) in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . A total of 302 subjects were randomized to receive OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily or placebo twice daily. The most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred at a higher rate in the OTEZLA group than in the placebo group were: diarrhea (31% vs. 11%), nausea (22% vs. 6%), headache (12% vs. 5%), and vomiting (6% vs. 2%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of any adverse reaction during the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the trial was 6% for subjects who received OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily and 3% for subjects who received placebo. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment were diarrhea (3% vs. 0%), nausea (1.5% vs. 1%), and vomiting (1.5% vs. 0%) in the OTEZLA group compared to placebo.

### Apremilast in chronic recalcitrant erythema nodosum leprosum: a report of two cases [^e5ce6e6e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a severe immune reaction commonly encountered as a complication in patients with multibacillary leprosy. Management of chronic ENL in leprosy is challenging and necessitates the use of systemic immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids and thalidomide. No single drug is universally effective and most current therapeutic agents carry a significant risk of systemic toxicity. Apremilast is an orally effective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with a potent immunomodulatory action and is clinically effective in inflammatory conditions like chronic plaque psoriasis. We report two patients with poorly controlled chronic ENL, despite the use of multiple therapeutic agents. Both patients demonstrated significant clinical improvement with apremilast, without any adverse effects, thereby suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic option in chronic ENL. What's already known about this topic? Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune-mediated reaction in patients with multibacillary leprosy, with chronicity and recurrences frequently reported. Management of chronic ENL requires systemic immunosuppressants like corticosteroids, which may not be universally effective and carry a risk of serious toxicity. Apremilast is an oral immunomodulator with good efficacy in inflammatory conditions like chronic plaque psoriasis. What does this study? Apremilast may be an effective therapeutic agent in patients with chronic ENL.

### Apremilast prevents blistering in human epidermis and stabilizes keratinocyte adhesion in pemphigus [^ae7346dc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Interestingly, it was reported recently that cAMP levels are increased and AC9 was upregulated in psoriatic skin modelsand that β2-adrenergic receptors are downregulated in psoriatic skin lesions. Therefore, it was postulated that cAMP may contribute to psoriatic hyperproliferation. However, considering our observation that increased cAMP may serve as a rescue pathway in pemphigus, the findings may also be interpreted in the way that positive adhesiotropy induced by adrenergic signaling is a general rescue pathway in inflammatory skin disorders. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the fact that apremilast is an effective and safe therapeutic mediator in psoriasis, which may also have direct effects on keratinocytes. Various case reports showed a simultaneous occurrence of PV and psoriasis, and an elevated risk for pemphigus was suggested for patients suffering from psoriasis, suggesting a similar predisposition for both diseases by dysregulated cAMP signaling in keratinocytes. Furthermore, apremilast was beneficial in a clinical study on palmoplantar keratoderma, which at least in part may also be caused by effects of apremilast on keratin filament organization in keratinocytes.

Taken together, our data provide a novel therapeutic approach in pemphigus to enhance protective cAMP signaling in keratinocytes through apremilast. In addition, we demonstrate an to our knowledge unreported mechanism involved in desmosome regulation via cAMP-induced Pg phosphorylation at S665, which strengthens Dp recruitment and intermediate filament anchorage of desmosomes (Fig. 7G). Therefore, we propose a new paradigm according to which apremilast may be effective to treat skin diseases, including psoriasis and pemphigus not only by modulation of the immune system but rather also via direct effects on keratinocytes.

An open-label, single-arm pilot study investigated the biological and clinical effects of oral apremilast 20 mg once daily in patients with severe plaque-type psoriasis. Of the 19 patients enrolled, 17 completed the study. Of the 19 subjects, 14 (73.7%) showed improvement in their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores following a 29-day treatment phase. Among these responders, T cells were reduced by 28.8% and 42.6% in the dermis and epidermis, respectively. Epidermal thickness was also reduced by a mean of 20.5% from baseline.

More recently, a phase IIb, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial for the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis with oral apremilast was completed. Patients were randomly assigned to apremilast 10 mg twice daily, apremilast 20 mg twice daily, apremilast 30 mg twice daily, or placebo. By week 16, a 75% improvement in PASI scores (PASI75) was achieved in 6% (5/88) assigned placebo, 11% (10/89) assigned apremilast 10 mg, 29% (25/87) assigned 20 mg, and 41% (36/88) assigned 30 mg. Significant differences from placebo were seen with apremilast 20 mg and 30 mg (P <0.0001), but not 10 mg. Reported adverse events were most frequently mild to moderate and included nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, headache, gastroenteritis, and dyspepsia. Of the eight serious adverse events, none were judged to be related to apremilast.

Currently there are two phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM2) investigating the use of oral apremilast 30 mg in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These trials include a 52 week randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled phase, with primary endpoints measured at week 16, in addition to a 4-year extension phase.

We reviewed phase III randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial results for apremilast and tofacitinib for efficacy and safety in psoriasis.

Results

Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 after 16 weeks for apremilast was between 28.8% and 33.1%. PASI 75 was 39.5% after 12 weeks on tofacitinib 5 mg, and 63.6% after 12 weeks on tofacitinib 10 mg. Common side effects for both drugs included nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. Gastrointestinal disturbance was common for apremilast. Dyslipidemia and infections were more common with tofacitinib than placebo.

Conclusion

Both new oral medications, apremilast and tofacitinib, appear to be effective in treating psoriasis

### Efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^88a97312]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated disease of the skin and joints. Plaque psoriasis is the most common clinical phenotype of psoriasis. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of plaque psoriasis. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. This systematic review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing apremilast 20mg twice daily (BID) and 30mg BID with placebo for its efficacy on plaque psoriasis. We searched the Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. We sought to evaluate the following outcomes: psoriasis area and severity index score (PASI)-50, PASI-75, PASI-90, static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA), and adverse events. The risk ratio (RR) was used to represent dichotomous outcomes and adverse events, and the data were pooled using the inverse variance weighting method. Eight RCTs that enrolled 2635 participants were deemed eligible. Apremilast 30mg BID and 20mg BID were significantly more efficacious than placebo in achieving PASI-75 over 16weeks (RR=4.60, 95% CI 3.29-6.41, and RR=3.15, 95% CI 1.96-5.07, respectively). Apremilast 30mg BID showed a significantly higher rate of adverse events than the placebo (RR=1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.33), whereas apremilast 20mg BID did not exhibit any significant difference (RR=1.13, 95% CI 0.91-1.42). This meta-analysis demonstrated that apremilast monotherapy is an effective therapeutic option for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with acceptable tolerability and safety profile.

### Apremilast monotherapy in DMARD-naive psoriatic arthritis patients: results of the randomized, placebo-controlled PALACE 4 trial [^451af32b]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The two most common AEs were diarrhoea and nausea, which generally occurred early (within the first 2 weeks of treatment) and usually resolved within 4 weeks in the vast majority of cases without the need for treatment or intervention. Although many conventional PsA agents require ongoing laboratory monitoring for safety concerns, no clinically meaningful effects on laboratory measurements were observed with apremilast up to week 52. The safety profile observed here is similar to that in previous investigations of apremilast in PsA and psoriasis.

PsA is a chronic immune disease typically emerging after psoriasis onset and often requiring long-term treatment. For patients with polyarticular disease or with refractory oligoarthritis, early institution of DMARDs has become the standard of care. However, these agents have demonstrated marginal efficacy in PsA and are associated with potential long-term toxicities requiring ongoing laboratory monitoring. In the TIght COntrol in Psoriatic Arthritis study, when MTX (alone or with concomitant csDMARDs or biologics) was given as part of a tight control regimen in DMARD-naive patients, patients had higher clinical outcomes; however, they also experienced a higher frequency of AEs such as respiratory tract infection, nausea, fatigue and gastrointestinal upset compared with standard therapy. SAEs were also more frequently reported in the tight control group. While efficacious in PsA, biologic therapy is not broadly prescribed in DMARD-naive patients and requires ongoing safety monitoring; these injectable therapies also may be burdensome for some patients. Access to effective treatment for PsA may be limited due to a lack of experienced specialists concerned with the somewhat burdensome monitoring required for agents such as MTX and biologics. The new warnings put forth by the Food and Drug Administration on the use of NSAIDs limit the use of these agents in PsA patients, especially those with underlying cardiovascular risk factors or those with a history of gastrointestinal and renal complications.

### Apremilast for treatment of recalcitrant aphthous stomatitis [^3f7a0759]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Apremilast is an orally administered small molecule that specifically inhibits phosphodiesterase-4 and modulates the immune system by increasing the levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibiting interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-γ, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor production.It is US Food and Drug Administration approved for treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but has been used off label in treating various inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis,chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis,lichen planus,and Behçet disease.In a recent multicenter, placebo-controlled phase II study, apremilast was found to be effective in treating oral and genital ulcers of Behçet disease, with 71% of patients achieving complete clearance by week 12.Pentoxifylline, an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has been reported previously to be marginally effective in treating RAS as a second-line agent.However, to the best of our knowledge, treatment of RAS with apremilast has not been reported thus far. It appears to be an effective agent through reducing proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-23, and interferon-γ and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10.Apremilast has shown a good safety profile with most frequent side effects being nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and headache.Cases of diarrhea and nausea occur in approximately 17% of patients and are generally mild to moderate in severity. The side effects usually begin during the first 2 weeks of apremilast treatment and resolve within 4 weeks.Treatment strategies include adequate hydration, taking medication with small and more frequent meals, and avoiding caffeine, dairy, and artificial sweeteners. Further options include bulk-forming agents, bismuth subsalicylate, and loperamide.

Our case shows a rapid and substantial response of recalcitrant aphthous lesions to apremilast. However, further studies are needed to prove its efficacy and safety.

### Efficacy of apremilast in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis: a randomised controlled trial [^aac13115]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Apremilast, a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4, works intracellularly to modulate proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediator production, and doses of 20 mg twice daily have shown efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in a 12-week phase 2 study. We assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of different doses of apremilast in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

In this phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, patients (aged ≥18 years) with moderate to severe psoriasis were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive oral placebo or apremilast 10, 20, or 30 mg twice daily at 35 US and Canadian sites between Sept 24, 2008, and Oct 21, 2009. At week 16, patients in the placebo group were assigned apremilast 20 or 30 mg twice daily until week 24. Randomisation was generated with a permuted-block randomisation list via interactive voice response system. For the first 16 weeks, treatment assignment was concealed from both investigators and participants. During weeks 16-24, investigators and participants all knew that treatment was active, but the dose was concealed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving at least 75% reduction from baseline psoriasis area and severity index (PASI-75) at week 16. Analyses were by intention to treat; missing values were imputed by last-observation-carried-forward. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00773734.

Findings

89 patients were randomly assigned apremilast 10 mg, 87 apremilast 20 mg, and 88 apremilast 30 mg twice daily; 88 were assigned placebo. At week 16, PASI-75 was achieved in five patients (6%) assigned placebo, ten (11%) assigned apremilast 10 mg, 25 (29%) assigned 20 mg, and 36 (41%) assigned 30 mg. Apremilast 10 mg did not differ significantly from placebo in achievement of the endpoint (odds ratio 2·10; 95% CI 0·69-6·42); for both apremilast 20 mg (6·69; 2·43-18·5; p<0·0001) and apremilast 30 mg (11·5; 4·24-31·2; p<0·0001), the differences from placebo were significant. Most adverse events (96%) were mild or moderate; at least 5% of patients had nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia (placebo), gastroenteritis, or dyspepsia. Eight serious adverse events occurred (three each, placebo and apremilast 20 mg; two, apremilast 30 mg); none were judged to be related to apremilast. Apremilast had no apparent effect on the results of haematological, urinalysis, immunological or inflammation, serum chemistry, or electrocardiographic tests.

Interpretation

Apremilast, given orally at 20 or 30 mg twice daily, seems to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Our results support continuing, longer-term studies.

Adiposity

There were reductions in weight and BMI with apremilast treatment across all time points compared with baseline, with a mean weight loss of 2.2 kg (95% CI 1.4, 3.0; P < 0.001) and a mean BMI decrease of 0.8 kg/m 2 (95% CI 0.5, 1.2; P < 0.001) by the end of the study. While waist circumference decreased significantly at month 1 and hip circumference at month 3, there was no overall change in waist:hip ratio at the end of the study (Fig. 2). A total of 7.6% (4/53) and 20.4% (10/49) of participants lost >5% body weight after 3 and 6 months of treatment, respectively.

When assessing the nature of weight loss with apremilast on MRI, there were reductions in total abdominal fat volume [mean decrease 0.52 L (95% CI 0.08, 0.96), P = 0.022], including ASAT volume [mean decrease 0.37 L (95% CI 0.05, 0.68), P = 0.022]. There were no significant changes in ectopic fat compartments, including VAT, liver fat fraction or muscle fat infiltration, nor in fat-free muscle volume (Table 2). There was no significant change in mean adipocyte diameter or the distribution of small, medium and large adipocytes with apremilast treatment (Table 3).

Aside from a negative correlation between weight change and patient global activity, there was no correlation between weight change and remaining disease activity parameters (Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online). There was no significant difference in achievement of MDA in those who lost weight compared with those who gained weight after 6 months treatment (MDA achievement 17.6% vs 14.3%, respectively; P = 1.00).

Apremilast contraindications and precautions—The safety profile of apremilast is a positive feature and it can be used in a wide variety of patients, including those with complex medical issues in which other systemic agents are contraindicated. Although severe renal impairment is not a contraindication, it does warrant a dose decrease to 30 mg daily instead of twice daily. For any individual experiencing weight loss (> 5% from baseline) due to apremilast, consideration should be given to its discontinuation. Patients prone to dehydration (eg, the elderly) should be aware that GI adverse effects may be more severe and could result in hospitalization. There have been no significant studies evaluating the effect of apremilast on human pregnancies.

### COVID-19 patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on biologic immunosuppressant therapy vs apremilast in north Spain [^fb225724]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments are critical for the management of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Similar to those illnesses, the lung injury and acute respiratory distress shown in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are the result of a disruption in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This hyperinflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), associated with the severity of the coronavirus disease, is called the cytokine storm. There is a growing concern regarding how patients on immunosuppressant biologic therapies might be at higher risk of being infected and whether they need to discontinue their treatment preemptively. Clinical data on COVID-19-infected patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis are still scarce. Here, we presented seven cases of these type of patients. The patient infected with COVID-19 on apremilast and the one on apremilast with infected spouse showed the best safety profile and mildest symptoms. One of the secukinumab patients also presented a relatively good outcome. Infliximab patients and the one with serious comorbidities showed the worst outcome. Even though more clinical data are yet needed to draw strong conclusions, apremilast could be a safer alternative for dermatology and rheumatology patients in case of clinically important active infection.

### Safety and effectiveness of apremilast in Japanese patients with psoriatic disease: results of a post-marketing surveillance study [^37dd8b3c]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

An increase in prescription of apremilast among oral PsO drugs (mainly because of its improved safety profile) was shown in a single‐center studyand a similar trend was also reported in an epidemiological survey of PsO patients in the Japanese Society for Psoriasis Research.Apremilast, with its convenient oral administration and anti‐inflammatory effect but not immunosuppressive mode of action, favorable safety profile, as well as no requirement for laboratory monitoring, offers a unique therapeutic option for patients with PsO and/or PsA.

Our study has several limitations including the non‐comparative open‐label, non‐randomized study design. This could result in selection bias, information bias, and attrition bias, all of which could affect the study results. It should also be noted that previous clinical and observational studies typically reported TEAEs rather than ARs (events reported by physicians other than those assessed as “not related” by physicians [including unknown/not specified]), as assessed in the current study. This makes direct comparison of results with previous studies difficult. Finally, the number of patients with PsA was relatively small, making the results in this population more difficult to generalize compared with results associated with patients with PsO.

In conclusion, this large, observational, PMS study demonstrated that orally administered apremilast was not associated with new safety signals and is well tolerated and effective in Japanese patients with PsO and/or PsA.

### Successful treatment of refractory folliculitis decalvans with apremilast [^ff1caa42]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present a patient with conventional therapy-refractory folliculitis decalvans, successfully treated with apremilast only. Because interruption of treatment and resumption of therapy resulted in recurrence and renewed remission, respectively, it is likely that apremilast suppressed the inflammatory reaction in folliculitis decalvans. The pathogenesis of this disease is not fully understood. Staphylococcus is thought to have a direct or indirect pathogenic role in the etiology and may be responsible for the dominant neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate. A defective immune system also increases the risk of folliculitis decalvans, with several familial cases reported. Mechanical factors and structural abnormalities, such as the plicate scalp in this patient, may play an additional role.

T cells (CD3 + and CD4 +), intercellular adhesion molecule 1, interferon gamma, and IL-4 and -8 are upregulated in folliculitis decalvans, being responsible for the neutrophil migration into the dermis. Gradually, fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor beta also become upregulated and are thought to mediate the scarring reaction.Apremilast, as a specific phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, suppresses innate and adaptive immune cells, including neutrophils and T cells. Reduced generation of spontaneous reactive oxygen species and of neutrophilic extracellular traps was observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with apremilast.Apremilast also leads to downregulation of various proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-6, -8, -12, -17, and -23, and to the upregulation of immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-10.The inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 therefore alters the cytokine composition and generates an anti-inflammatory state, likely leading to control of the inflammation. Because neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cell in folliculitis decalvans, the inhibitory effect of apremilast on neutrophil activity could explain the rapid beneficial effect observed in this case.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a successful therapy of folliculitis decalvans with phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition; after prolonged treatment, a taper of apremilast will show whether full remission is possible in this patient who did not respond to conventional therapies. The rapid effectiveness of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition introduces new therapeutic options for folliculitis decalvans and warrants further investigation. Prospective studies with bigger patient cohorts will verify the eventual general value of apremilast for folliculitis decalvans.

### Use of apremilast for the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^931d2cfb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to present effectiveness and tolerability of apremilast in a cohort of 21 patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor psoriatic arthritis (ICI-PsA) and/or immune checkpoint inhibitor psoriasis (ICI-PsO).

Methods

This multicenter study combined data from patients treated with apremilast after experiencing ICI-PsO and/or ICI-PsA. Patients taking apremilast before ICI initiation and patients with preexisting autoimmune disease before ICI therapy were also included. Response to apremilast was determined as complete, partial, or none as determined by improvement in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading after drug initiation.

Results

There were 21 patients who used apremilast for either ICI-PsO and/or ICI-PsA, but only five of these patients had de novo ICI-PsO and/or ICI-PsA. Of these five patients, four had partial response or improvement in their immune-related adverse event with apremilast, although there were intolerances in three of these patients. Of the 21 total patients, 16 had a relevant preexisting autoimmune disease, indicating a likely flare of the underlying disease with ICI therapy. Flares occurred much sooner for patients with ICI-PsA (4 weeks) compared to patients with ICI-PsO only (39.7 weeks), although the majority of both groups had grade II severity. Among the 13 patients with preexisting disease and no exposure to apremilast before ICI therapy, all patients in the ICI-PsO-only group (100%) responded to apremilast with either a complete or partial response, whereas only 57% of patients in the ICI-PsA group had complete or partial response. Twenty-nine percent of patients in the entire cohort had to discontinue apremilast due to intolerability. Thirty-eight percent of the entire cohort had progression of cancer or death at last follow-up after being on apremilast.

Conclusion

This study highlights the potential benefit of apremilast for the treatment of ICI-PsO, both de novo and PsO flare, with less of an apparent benefit for ICI-PsA. Thirty percent of patients in the whole group had to discontinue apremilast due to intolerance. Apremilast may be an attractive therapeutic option for either condition given that it is not immunosuppressive, but further prospective observational studies with larger patient numbers are needed.

To our knowledge, 3 case reports have been published, in which apremilast monotherapy was used for the treatment of EP., Apremilast is well tolerated and offers a mild side-effect profile compared with biologics and immunosuppressants.In summary, we believe that apremilast shows promise for patients with multiple comorbidities and is unreliable in terms of follow-up for drug monitoring. However, further studies are required to confirm its efficacy to endorse its use as a recommended treatment for EP.

### Apremilast as a potential treatment for moderate to severe dermatomyositis: a retrospective study of 3 patients [^d085d3cd]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

By inhibiting PDE-4, apremilast increases the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, leading to decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, thus inhibiting Th1 response.Apremilast may also block Th2 response by interfering with the level of IL-6 secreted by type 2 macrophages.Although the mechanism of action of apremilast in dermatomyositis is unknown, we suggest that apremilast can be a potential treatment for dermatomyositis through interfering with the Th1 and Th2 response.

Apremilast, although not cytotoxic, can cause significant diarrhea and other gastrointestinal effects.Apremilast is a well-tolerated oral medicine that can be added to other immunomodulating agents to maximize the therapeutic response in recalcitrant dermatomyositis. Our observations are based on a small number of patients, and further studies are needed to better understand the role of apremilast in the treatment of dermatomyositis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 1493 patients who enrolled in Trials PsA-1, PsA-2, and PsA-3, a total of 146 (9.8%) psoriatic arthritis patients were 65 years of age and older, including 19 (1.3%) patients 75 years and older. No overall differences were observed in the safety profile of geriatric patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger adult patients < 65 years of age in the clinical trials.

Of the 1257 subjects who enrolled in two placebo-controlled plaque psoriasis trials (PSOR-1 and PSOR-2), a total of 108 (8.6%) plaque psoriasis patients were 65 years of age and older, including 9 (0.7%) patients who were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences were observed in the safety or effectiveness in geriatric patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger adult patients < 65 years of age in the clinical trials.

Because patients 65 years of age or older may be at a higher risk of complications such as volume depletion or hypotension from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, monitor geriatric patients closely for such complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

### Long-term real-world effectiveness of deucravacitinib in psoriasis: a 52-week prospective study stratified by prior apremilast or biologic therapy [^cacdf73a]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

These results may be possible because prior biologic treatment might modulate the patients' immune system and affect the steric structure of TYK2 or its affinity for deucravacitinib. Since this was not a clinical trial, patients previously treated with biologics were directly switched to deucravacitinib without clear washout periods. Further studies should set a clear washout period for biologic‐experienced patients to accurately evaluate clinical outcomes. Alternatively, five out of 15 biologic‐experienced patients in this study experienced treatment failures to biologics, and this population might potentially have poorer responsiveness to treatments for psoriasis generally. One recent study specifically investigated 14 patients with at least two biologic therapy failures and reported that 64% achieved partial or complete responses to deucravacitinib, with an average response time of 2.6 months. Although that study involved a small sample size and short follow‐up period, the authors concluded that deucravacitinib may be a feasible treatment option even for patients with multiple systemic treatment failures.Further studies using a larger cohort should evaluate the responsiveness to deucravacitinib in patients with biologic therapy failures. In addition, biologic‐experienced patients in this study accounted for 17.2% of total patients, a rather limited population, and were of older age with higher rate of arthritis compared to biologic‐naive patients (median [IQR] 73 [66.0–81.5] vs 61 (50.5–75.0) years; 26.7% vs 8.4%), which may influence the treatment responsiveness. Further studies should be conducted using a cohort with a higher proportion of biologic‐experienced patients, and the results should be adjusted for confounding factors such as age or presence of arthritis.

There are several limitations in this study. First, the study was conducted at a single institution. Second, only Japanese patients were included. Third, the number of biologic‐experienced patients was small. Fourth, we did not stratify patients by specific comorbidities, the types of biologics previously used, or the number of biologic switches. Last, because we did not perform formal statistical testing due to baseline differences and lack of a control group, our comparisons between subgroups (e.g. apremilast‐experienced vs apremilast‐naive, biologic‐experienced vs biologic‐naive) are descriptive only, and differences should be interpreted with caution. This was an observational study without a control group, which limits the ability to draw universal conclusions from the findings.

### Apremilast as a treatment for morphea: a case series [^9510183c]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Apremilast is an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of PDE4 that was approved for moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in 2014. Apremilast's therapeutic action is likely related to the modulation of various inflammatory cytokines via increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

The pathogenesis of morphea, while not completely understood, is partly related to immune dysregulation and inflammation via T helper 2 cell-related cytokines, including interleukin 4 and IL-6, that drive fibrosis.

In a recent study, PDE4 blockade with apremilast had antifibrotic effects in animal models of skin fibrosis. By limiting M2 macrophage differentiation and IL-6 release, apremilast reversed fibrosis and prevented fibrosis progression. This study suggested that the inflammation-driven fibrosis in morphea might respond to PDE4 inhibition.

Thus, we tried apremilast in 5 patients with biopsy-proven morphea and with inadequate responses or intolerable side effects to other treatments. Apremilast improved the appearance of morphea in our patients. Specifically, we saw reduction of erythema and lesion size, cessation of new lesion formation, softening of lesions, and decreased vessel dilation and dermal atrophy. One patient saw additional improvement in hand arthralgias, which are associated with morphea.Positive results appeared to occur rapidly, with 4 patients reporting improvement in 1 month or less. At the time of manuscript preparation, 3 patients remained on apremilast. Case 3 chose to temporarily discontinue treatment in preparation for pregnancy, and case 5 discontinued treatment due to nausea.

Many treatments are used for morphea, including topical and intralesional corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus, calcipotriene, systemic immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, and phototherapy. However, little evidence exists to support the efficacy of these treatments for morphea.Further, systemic immunosuppressants have serious adverse effects and require routine laboratory testing, and phototherapy is time-intensive, causing several of our patients to defer or discontinue these treatments. Apremilast does not require routine laboratory testing. A common side effect of apremilast is gastrointestinal upset that usually occurs within the first month and resolves over time.In our study, 2 patients experienced nausea, which resolved in 1 patient with a smaller dose, and no patients reported diarrhea.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis [^7155e94a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head to head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents (acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, methotrexate), small molecules (apremilast, tofacitinib, ponesimod), anti-TNF alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab), anti-IL12/23 (ustekinumab), anti-IL17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), anti-IL23 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab), and other biologics (alefacept, itolizumab) for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to December 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant RCTs. We searched the trial results databases of a number of pharmaceutical companies and handsearched the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology meetings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic and biological treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate to severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI) 90) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE; we evaluated evidence as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing.

Main Results

We included 109 studies in our review (39,882 randomised participants, 68% men, all recruited from a hospital). The overall average age was 44 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo controlled (67%), 23% were head-to-head studies, and 10% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and placebo. We have assessed all treatments listed in the objectives (19 in total). In all, 86 trials were multicentric trials (two to 231 centres). All of the trials included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment at less than 24 weeks after randomisation); in fact, all trials included in the network meta-analysis were measured between 12 and 16 weeks after randomisation. We assessed the majority of studies (48/109) as being at high risk of bias; 38 were assessed as at an unclear risk, and 23, low risk.Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90.In terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. Small molecules were associated with a higher chance of reaching PASI 90 compared to conventional systemic agents.At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, all of the anti-IL17 agents and guselkumab (an anti-IL23 drug) were significantly more effective than the anti-TNF alpha agents infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, but not certolizumab. Ustekinumab was superior to etanercept. No clear difference was shown between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. Only one trial assessed the efficacy of infliximab in this network; thus, these results have to be interpreted with caution. Tofacitinib was significantly superior to methotrexate, and no clear difference was shown between any of the other small molecules versus conventional treatments.Network meta-analysis also showed that ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90: the most effective drug was ixekizumab (risk ratio (RR) 32.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.61 to 44.60; Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 94.3; high-certainty evidence), followed by secukinumab (RR 26.55, 95% CI 20.32 to 34.69; SUCRA = 86.5; high-certainty evidence), brodalumab (RR 25.45, 95% CI 18.74 to 34.57; SUCRA = 84.3; moderate-certainty evidence), guselkumab (RR 21.03, 95% CI 14.56 to 30.38; SUCRA = 77; moderate-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 24.58, 95% CI 3.46 to 174.73; SUCRA = 75.7; moderate-certainty evidence), and ustekinumab (RR 19.91, 95% CI 15.11 to 26.23; SUCRA = 72.6; high-certainty evidence).We found no significant difference between all of the interventions and the placebo regarding the risk of serious adverse effects (SAEs): the relative ranking strongly suggested that methotrexate was associated with the best safety profile regarding all of the SAEs (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; SUCRA = 90.7; moderate-certainty evidence), followed by ciclosporin (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.10; SUCRA = 78.2; very low-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.36; SUCRA = 70.9; moderate-certainty evidence), infliximab (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.00; SUCRA = 64.4; very low-certainty evidence), alefacept (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55; SUCRA = 62.6; low-certainty evidence), and fumaric acid esters (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.99; SUCRA = 57.7; very low-certainty evidence). Major adverse cardiac events, serious infections, or malignancies were reported in both the placebo and intervention groups. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to very low certainty for just over half of the treatment estimates in total, moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be considered with caution.Considering both efficacy (PASI 90 outcome) and acceptability (SAEs outcome), highly effective treatments also had more SAEs compared to the other treatments, and ustekinumab, infliximab, and certolizumab appeared to have the better trade-off between efficacy and acceptability.Regarding the other efficacy outcomes, PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1, the results were very similar to the results for PASI 90.Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for a third of the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab are the best choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate to severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence. At class level, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents, too. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured between 12 to 16 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficiently relevant for a chronic disease. Moreover, low numbers of studies were found for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 44 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice.Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs. Methotrexate appeared to have the best safety profile, but as the evidence was of very low to moderate quality, we cannot be sure of the ranking. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies as well.In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve patients, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents.

### Effect of the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast on cardiometabolic outcomes in psoriatic disease-results of the immune metabolic associations in psoriatic arthritis study [^2972c1af]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Following apremilast treatment, we observed weight loss, principally of abdominal subcutaneous fat, and improvement in psoriatic disease activity. Improvement in disease activity appeared independent of weight change. Our study is in keeping with a previous post-hoc analysis of the Efficacy and Safety Trial Evaluating the Effects of Apremilast in Psoriasis 1 and 2 (ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2) phase 3 trials that revealed a mean weight loss of 1.51 kg (. 3.85) after 16 weeks of apremilast treatment (compared with 0.01 kg with placebo). Given that we have recently shown individuals with PsA have a metabolically adverse body composition with greater visceral and ectopic liver fat, which is in turn associated with increased cardiometabolic disease propensity, we wished to ascertain whether weight loss with apremilast altered these regions. While there was a reduction in abdominal subcutaneous fat with apremilast, we did not observe any significant reductions in visceral or liver fat. These latter findings may be limited by the small sample size and relatively short duration of the substudy.

In addition to the site of weight loss, assessment of adipocyte morphology can provide useful information on associated metabolic comorbidities. Enlarged subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes have been shown to be an independent predictor of type 2 diabetes. Further, a decrease in adipocyte cell size in those undergoing bariatric surgery has been shown to be more strongly associated with improved insulin sensitivity than a change in fat mass per se. Despite a mean weight loss with apremilast, we did not observe any significant change in adipocyte size in this cohort. This may relate to the much more modest nature of weight loss with apremilast compared with that of bariatric surgery.

Despite previous studies demonstrating an association between weight loss and improved psoriatic disease activity, there was no significant correlation between these parameters in the current study. This may relate to the more modest nature of weight loss with apremilast compared with stringent calorie reduction in these studies and suggests the principal mechanism of action of apremilast in PsA is likely through immune modulation rather than direct metabolic effects.

### Apremilast mechanism of efficacy in systemic-naive patients with moderate plaque psoriasis: pharmacodynamic results from the UNVEIL study [^c5a191b8]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacodynamic (PD) subanalyses of clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis demonstrated the efficacy of apremilast correlated with reductions in cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

Objective

This PD subanalysis of a phase IV, randomized, controlled trial (UNVEIL) in systemic-naive patients with moderate plaque psoriasis (psoriasis-involved body surface area [BSA] 5%-10%; static Physician's Global Assessment [sPGA] = 3) evaluated the relationship between efficacy and changes in inflammatory biomarkers with apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) versus placebo.

Methods

Patients were randomized (2:1) to apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood samples were analyzed for interleukins (IL)-17A, -17F, -22, and -23; cardiometabolic biomarkers (leptin; adiponectin; apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, B, and E); and the number of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, regulatory T cells, and total T cells at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Correlations were examined between percentage change in biomarkers and efficacy (based on PGAxBSA).

Results

Of 221 randomized patients, 38 were included in PD analyses (placebo, n = 12; apremilast, n = 26). Median percentage reductions in plasma cytokine levels were significantly greater with apremilast versus placebo for IL-17A (P < 0.05), IL -17F (P < 0.001), and IL-22 (P < 0.01) at Week 4 and IL-22 (P < 0.05) at Week 16. At Week 16, in patients receiving apremilast, improvement in PGAxBSA significantly correlated with change in IL-17A (r = 0.45, P = 0.04). Adipokines, apolipoproteins, and T-cell population levels were largely unchanged.

Conclusion

Clinical improvements in psoriasis correlated with apremilast-mediated decreases in IL-17A without significantly affecting systemic IL-23 levels, adipokines, or Th17 and regulatory T-cell numbers.

### Clinical efficacy, speed of improvement and safety of apremilast for the treatment of adult psoriasis during COVID-19 pandemic [^0975702d]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Time to improvement is a crucial characteristic for effective treatments of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis. Apremilast is a recently approved drug, belonging to the small molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, whose optimal safety and efficacy profile is somewhat affected by slow activity rate in clinical trials. Real world case series are suggesting a more consistent improvement, and with this additional personal investigation on 48 patients, we signal that 58% of patients achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 50, and 19% PASI 75 improvement in the first 8weeks of treatment. Results at 16-week are remarkable, with overall 55% of patients achieving PASI 75, 21% PASI 90 and 14% PASI 100. Only 8 patients (18, 6%) had slightly improved, although satisfied with the regimen, and determined to continue. Noteworthy, our population was rather problematic in terms of comorbidities (86%), and resistance to other treatments, with only 28% naïve to systemics, including biologics. Moreover, the observation period includes the Italian outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic, and further information on apremilast safety are provided, no one of the patients having stopped treatment. In such a critical period, the apremilast satisfactory speed of therapeutic response in a real-world setting has further strengthens patient's compliance to remain safely at home, which is the best strategy to limit contagion.

### Successful treatment with secukinumab in an HIV-positive psoriatic patient after failure of apremilast [^a9e4394e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease characterized by an IL23/IL17‐oriented immune activation and keratinocyte hyperproliferation and can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons. There is not full agreement on the prevalence of HIV‐associated psoriasis that may result similar to the general population.Psoriasis might worsen or be firstly detected when HIV infection is diagnosed, further affecting the quality of life of HIV patients. Furthermore, the progression of HIV seems to correlate with worsening of psoriasis.The management of these patients is a challenge as any therapy must be carefully considered. Immunosuppressive drugs as methotrexate and cyclosporine should be avoided due to the risk of opportunistic infections, while TNF‐alpha blockers and ustekinumab should not be started during an active infection because they may potentially give rise to a multitude of infections, so should be contraindicated for HIV patients even if some authors suggested safety modalities for their use.Nevertheless, single case reports have shown that treatment with other biologics (such as anti‐IL17) or oral small molecules (i.e. apremilast) may be successful and safe in HIV‐patients affected by moderate–severe psoriasis.,,Here we describe our clinical experience with an anti‐ IL17A monoclonal antibody, secukinumab, in an HIV positive psoriatic man who failed an initial treatment with apremilast.

### Complete resolution of erythrodermic psoriasis with first-line apremilast monotherapy [^72d6f5bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is the most serious type of psoriasis with high morbidity and mortality. First-line recommended therapies for EP, cyclosporine and infliximab have significant adverse effects. Cyclosporine increases the risk of hypertension, leucopenia, infections and renal failure. Infliximab increases the risk of reactivation of tuberculosis, hepatitis B and histoplasmosis, and increases risk for hepatitis, autoantibody formation, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disorders, pancytopenia, lymphoma and skin cancer. An effective drug with a much safer side effect profile will be of significant benefit in EP. The phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast is U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Adverse effects of apremilast reported are headache, nausea, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, potential for depression and weight loss. We report complete and long-standing resolution of EP with first-line apremilast monotherapy. Apremilast may be an effective option with comparatively minor side effects for EP.

Apremilast toxicity—In the ESTEEM 1 trial, the most common adverse effects were diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, tension headache, and headache. In those experiencing GI adverse effects, 70% to 80% occurred within the first 2 weeks, 75% to 80% were mild in severity, and 60% to 65% resolved within the first month. Depression was reported in approximately 1% of patients. Appropriate discussion and patient counseling are thus recommended before apremilast therapy initiation to prevent worsening of pre-existing depression or suicidality. Decreases of 5% to 10% in body weight occurred in 12% of patients treated with apremilast compared with 5% treated with placebo.

### Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in the treatment of Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: efficacy, safety and tolerability results from a phase 2b randomized controlled trial [^b1c20244]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The safety profile of apremilast did not raise any new safety signals, and rates of AEs, SAEs and discontinuations were similar to those previously reported with apremilast from randomized phase 3 studies in psoriasis 11, 12 and psoriatic arthritis. 13, 14 In line with these prior studies, most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation. No pattern of increased risk of major adverse cardiac events, malignancies or serious infections was observed with apremilast treatment versus placebo. The relatively small numbers of these events occurred primarily among patients receiving apremilast 20 mg b.i.d.; by contrast, few such events were seen with the higher apremilast 30 mg b.i.d. dose. Changes in clinical laboratory parameters were not clinically meaningful, and marked abnormalities were transient and showed no treatment‐related pattern. Weight loss was observed with apremilast treatment, as has been reported previously. 11, 12 The average changes in weight at the end of the apremilast exposure period (0–68 weeks) were relatively small, and the majority of current patients maintained their weight within ±5% of baseline. Among patients with weight loss of more than 5%, there were no overt clinical consequences.

Systemic treatment options for Japanese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis include oral treatments such as cyclosporin and etretinate, and the injectable biologic agents adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, brodalumab and ixekizumab. 24 Although these therapies have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials, the long‐term use of systemic therapies is often limited by safety considerations (e.g. risk of infection and malignancy, nephrotoxicity after chronic administration of cyclosporin, teratogenicity risk by etretinate, the development of neutralizing antibodies and/or potential reactivation of tuberculosis with immunosuppressive biologic therapy). Phototherapy may also be inconvenient for patients due to the requirement for frequent visits or hospitalization in the clinical setting in Japan. In addition, because the introduction of biologics in Japan is restricted to Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA) board‐approved core hospitals that have at least one full‐time JDA board‐certified dermatologist on staff, most community dermatologists are not allowed to initiate biologic therapy by themselves for psoriasis patients who visit their clinics regularly.

### Safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in psoriatic patients treated with biologics: a real life experience [^5082d456]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Vaccination is the most effective method to prevent and control the COVID‐19 infection and biologics are not considered a contraindication for vaccination.The Italian Society of Medical, Surgical, Aesthetic Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (Società Italiana di Dermatologia medica, chirurgica, estetica e delle Malattie Sessualmente Trasmesse—SIDeMaST) along with other dermatologic societies and task forces (International Psoriasis Council, Italian National Psoriasis Foundation) strongly recommends vaccination in all psoriatic subjects,; only in selected patients with potential contraindications, the decision to do the vaccination should be personalized and shared between the patient and the physician.The burning question is that safety data are lacking since patients taking drugs affecting the immune system were excluded from clinical trials leading to vaccine approbation. Moreover, it seems that vaccination could worsen psoriasis considering that vaccination may induce the T helper 1 stimulation producing high level of TNFα, IFNγ, and IL2. In the summary of product characteristic of the biological drugs, it is recommended to avoid the use of live or live‐attenuated vaccines. Among vaccines, mRNA ones are based on liposome‐formulated uracil‐modified mRNA decreasing the toll‐like receptor 7 stimulation, and therefore potentially attenuate the risk of autoimmune disease flare.A potential but uncommon association between some vaccinations (influenza, BCG, tetanus diphtheria, pneumococcal polysaccharide) and the onset or the exacerbation of psoriasis was previously documented,but SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines data are limited in psoriatic patients and the all vaccine instructions delegate to clinicians the decision to vaccinate such patients.Only one Italian study is available on safety and efficacy of SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines in four psoriatic patients treated with biologics without experiencing any psoriatic flare and/or cutaneous and systemic manifestations.Similar results were observed in three patients treated with apremilast undergoing SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine.Successively, another Italian experience reported 11 cases of psoriasis exacerbation within 14 days from the vaccination (Pfizer mRNABNT162b2, Moderna mRNA‐1273 or AstraZeneca‐Oxford AZD1222), mainly (81.8%) after the 2nd dose.Interestingly, six cases (54.5%) of them were observed in subjects under biologic treatment.

### Apremilast and biologics: characteristics of patients treated with apremilast before, during, or after a biological treatment [^7a5d8a33]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Apremilast is an oral small molecule approved for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and oral ulcers associated with Behçet's disease. This research was conducted to describe the characteristics of patients who received treatment with apremilast for a skin disorder, either before, during, or after a biological treatment, with the aim of analyze the reasons that lead to start this drug in real clinical practice or suspend it for another. A total of 41 patients were enrolled: nine (22.0%) had received biological treatment prior to apremilast, seven (17.0%) both before and after apremilast and 25 (61.0%) after apremilast. One patient received concomitant treatment with adalimumab and apremilast. Most patients (85.4%) received apremilast as treatment for psoriasis. Reasons for starting apremilast were lack of efficacy with previous treatments (85.4%) and adverse effects or contraindication to previous treatments (14.6%), without statistically significant differences between patients who had received a previous biologic and those who had not. Drug survival was not influenced by previous biological treatment, but we found an increased risk of drug discontinuation in patients with chronic kidney disease (log-rank p = 0.028). The main reason of apremilast withdrawal was lack of adequate disease control (60.0%), most of whom required treatment with biologics. Therefore, despite the extensive development of new therapies for psoriasis and other dermatological conditions, apremilast is a widely used drug even in patients who are candidates for biologic treatment. Its initiation is more frequent due to poor disease control than because of other therapies contraindications.

At screening, > 10% of patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis reported a history of depression (Online Resource 3). During the placebo-controlled period, rates of depression were slightly higher in apremilast patients (4.51/100 patient-years) versus placebo patients (1.94/100 patient-years) but still low overall (1.78/100 patient-years all apremilast exposure). These findings are consistent with a study that concluded that rates of anxiety and depression were similar among patients treated with apremilast and those treated with other systemic psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis treatments.

Diarrhea and nausea were the most common TEAEs among patients treated with apremilast, occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment, and resolved within 30 days. During the phase II Behçet’s syndrome study, a single reduction in apremilast dose was allowed to mitigate gastrointestinal adverse effects.

Pooled safety findings were consistent with prior studies of apremilast in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Behçet’s syndrome, including the pivotal ESTEEM, PALACE, and RELIEF studies; common TEAEs were consistent with those previously reported and were mild-to-moderate in severity [–,–].

Other treatments for plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Behçet’s syndrome may be associated with safety risks not observed with apremilast. For example, JAK inhibitors are systemic treatments that have been associated with liver abnormalities, which are not commonly reported with apremilast. JAK inhibitors also pose a potential risk of thrombotic events, malignancies, and other serious cardiovascular events, whereas this analysis showed low incidence after apremilast exposure. Unlike apremilast, which had low rates of serious infections and serious opportunistic infections, some biologics may be associated with higher risk of infections with long-term use. Similarly, the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and upadacitinib, which are approved for psoriatic arthritis treatment, have a boxed warning for serious infections. Findings were consistent with an observational cohort study which found that apremilast had a significantly decreased risk of infection compared with both methotrexate and adalimumab. Of note, in a retrospective cohort study, while patients with psoriasis were found to have 18% greater odds of incident coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), apremilast use was associated with decreased odds (adjusted odds ratio: 0.70) of incident COVID-19 compared with patients receiving topical therapy only.

Infliximab (TNF-α inhibitor) combination therapy options include topical steroids with a vitamin D analogue, acitretin, methotrexate, and apremilast; infliximab may be combined with topical steroids and a vitamin D analogue to augment efficacy, but “rigorous evidence supporting this combination is lacking”; acitretin “may be added to infliximab to increase efficacy” and “may also reduce the development of cutaneous SCC”; for methotrexate there are “substantial and convincing data,” it “reduces the immunogenicity of infliximab,” and “the addition of methotrexate to infliximab should be considered strongly for all patients,” with studies in PsA in which “as many as 50%” also received methotrexate; apremilast may be combined but “the long-term safety of this combination is unknown,” and “data are also too limited to advise combination of infliximab with other currently available biologic therapies” because “the risk of significant adverse events is unknown.”

Apremilast efficacy in plaque psoriasis—ESTEEM 1 randomized 844 patients to apremilast 30 mg twice daily (n = 562) or placebo (n = 282); at week 16 PASI 75 was 33.1% versus 5.3% (P < .001). Among 154 PASI 75 responders rerandomized at week 32, 61.0% of 77 continuing apremilast maintained PASI 75 at week 52, whereas 83.1% of 77 switched to placebo lost PASI 75 and only 11.7% achieved PASI 75; adverse events from week 0–16 occurred in 69.3% with apremilast versus 55.7% with placebo.

5 Conclusion

Japanese real‐world data uncovered that Japanese psoriasis patients generally continued apremilast and received benefits from long‐term systemic treatment despite experiencing adverse reactions. Adequate management of gastrointestinal symptoms in the early stage of treatment and continued persistence with apremilast are expected to improve patients' quality of life and provide long‐term disease control.

### Considerations for safety in the use of systemic medications for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic [^4a191b24]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for at least 2546527 cases and 175812 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common, chronic, inflammatory skin conditions, with immune dysregulation as a shared mechanism; therefore, mainstays of treatment include systemic immunomodulating therapies. It is unknown whether these therapies are associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility or worse outcomes in infected patients. In this review, we discuss overall infection risks of nonbiologic and biologic systemic medications for psoriasis and AD and provide therapeutic recommendations. In summary, in patients with active infection, systemic conventional medications, the Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib, and biologics for psoriasis should be temporarily held until there is more data; in uninfected patients switching to safer alternatives should be considered. Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23 inhibitors are associated with low infection risk, with IL-17 and IL-23 favored over IL-12/23 inhibitors. Pivotal trials and postmarketing data also suggest that IL-17 and IL-23 blockers are safer than tumor necrosis factor alpha blockers. Apremilast, acitretin, and dupilumab have favorable safety data and may be safely initiated and continued in uninfected patients. Without definitive COVID-19 data, these recommendations may be useful in guiding treatment of psoriasis and AD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^f051fa1f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Adalimumab combination therapy and phototherapy—Adalimumab can be combined with topical steroids and a topical vitamin D analogue to increase response, and data have been collected regarding the safety and efficacy of adalimumab combined with methotrexate in patients with psoriasis, including findings that patients taking adalimumab and methotrexate were more likely to have clear or almost clear skin compared with methotrexate monotherapy; methotrexate can have the potential to reduce the immunogenicity of adalimumab. Combining adalimumab with apremilast has also been reported, but the long-term efficacy and safety of this regimen are unknown, and adalimumab may also be combined with cyclosporine to increase treatment efficacy in the short term according to limited data from case reports and series. The combination of adalimumab with NB-UVB may accelerate and improve the clearance of psoriatic lesions, and in a 24-week, open-label study using adalimumab 40 mg every other week plus NB-UVB phototherapy 3 times a week for 12 weeks, at week 12, 19 patients (95%) achieved PASI 75, 15 patients (75%) achieved PASI 90, and 11 patients (55%) achieved PASI 100; however, it is important to consider that the long-term safety of this combination has not been well studied. Although many systemic agents have immunosuppressive effects, acitretin is considered to have a negligible effect on the immune system and is frequently added to adalimumab in palmoplantar psoriasis to increase efficacy without increasing immunosuppression.

### Management of treatment-resistant acquired perforating dermatosis with apremilast: a novel therapeutic approach [^9dcae4d8]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The management of APD presents a significant therapeutic challenge due to its chronic and often treatment-resistant nature.Traditional treatment strategies involve addressing the underlying medical conditions, commonly chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus, and alleviating symptoms. Considering its established efficacy in other inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis and Behcet’s disease,, the patient was started on apremilast.

Apremilast is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in controlling inflammatory responses by regulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. In doing so, apremilast results in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukins (IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23) and interferon-gamma, while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10.Phosphodiesterase 4 is widely expressed among various cells, including natural killer cells, macrophage, lymphocytes, and keratinocytes. In addition to modulating cytokine production, apremilast reduces the production of leukotriene B4, nitric oxide synthase, and matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in processes such as epidermal thickening and neutrophil chemotaxis.In the context of APD, apremilast’s anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects may help to mitigate local inflammation and reduce the formation of abnormal tissue structures.Apremilast has a relatively favorable adverse effect profile (including nausea, diarrhea, headaches, weight loss, and mood changes) and requires minimal routine laboratory monitoring.

Our patient experienced remarkable improvement with apremilast, and her APD has remained stable over the past year while continuing the therapy. This outcome aligns with a previous case report, where a patient with Down syndrome and 2 different types of perforating dermatoses --elastosis perforans serpiginosa and perforating folliculitis-- experienced marked improvement on apremilast 30 mg twice daily, with no recurrence after 3 months.However, unlike the reported case involving elastosis perforans serpiginosa and perforating folliculitis, our patient presented with APD. This outcome highlights the potential of this therapy in refractory cases of APD and warrants further exploration.

### A sharp decrease of Th17, CXCR3 +-Th17, and th17.1 in peripheral blood is associated with an early anti-IL-17-mediated clinical remission in psoriasis [^c2ac618d]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Psoriasis—an immune-mediated skin disease—implicates in its pathophysiology by circulating pro-inflammatory cell populations, cytokines, and their interactions with the epidermis. The direct effect of approved anti-interleukin- (IL-)17A and anti-IL-17R biologic therapy on immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes’ (PBMCs) relative sub-population frequencies in psoriasis patients has not yet been described. Using multiparameter flow cytometry we examined T-cell subpopulations characterized by CCR6, CCR4, and CXCR3 chemokine receptor surface expression at baseline and after initiation of biologic therapy in PBMCs collected from 30 psoriasis patients. Increased CD3 + CD4 + CXCR3 +, CD3 + CD4 + CCR6 + CCR4 + CXCR3 + (CXCR3 + -Th17), and CD3 + CD4 + CCR6 + CCR4 - CXCR3 + (Th17.1) cell populations were observed in patients with psoriasis in comparison to healthy individuals (n = 10). IL-17 therapeutic blockade decreased CD3 + CD4 + CCR6 +, CD3 + CD4 + CXCR3 +, CD3 + CD4 + CCR6 - CXCR3 + (Th1), CD3 + CD4 + CCR6 + CCR4 + (Th17), CD3 + CD4 + CCR6 + CCR4 + CXCR3 + (CXCR3 + -Th17), and CD3 + CD4 + CCR6 + CCR4 - CXCR3 + (Th17.1) cell populations in responding psoriasis patients. Moreover, CD3 + CD4 - CCR6 +, CD3 + CD4 - CXCR3 +, CD3 + CD4 - CCR6 + CCR4 + (Tc17), and CD3 + CD4 - CCR6 - CXCR3 + (Tc1) percentages were also inhibited. Modulation of the same cell sub-populations was also assessed in patients treated with methotrexate (n = 4), apremilast (n = 4), and anti-IL-23 biologic treatment (n = 4). In our study, the levels and functional capacity of peripheral pro-inflammatory Th1, Th17, and additional CCR6 + T cell sub-gated populations from psoriasis patients that were treated with anti-IL-17 or anti-IL-17R targeted biologic therapy were explored for the first time. Our data clearly demonstrate that early anti-IL-17 mediated clinical remission is accompanied by a significant decrease of Th1, Th17, CXCR3 + -Th17, and Th17.1 cells.

### Apremilast inhibits inflammatory osteoclastogenesis [^c2dd72e7]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is associated with bone erosion and inflammation-induced bone loss, which are mediated by osteoclasts (OC) and modulated by inflammatory cytokines. Apremilast (APR) (a selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor) is efficacious in PsA and acts by inhibiting cytokine production. However, there are no direct data informing whether and how APR affects osteoclast formation in humans.

Methods

Osteoclastogenic cytokine production by activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured in the presence and absence of APR. Effects of APR on osteoclast differentiation were tested (i) in co-cultures of activated PBMCs and human CD14+ blood monocytes as well as (ii) in CD14+ blood monocytes stimulated with activated-PBMCs supernatant, TNF or IL-17A. Bone resorption was measured on OsteoAssay plates. Effects of APR on ex vivo osteoclast differentiation were compared in PsA, pre-PsA and psoriasis patients, as well as in healthy controls.

Results

APR significantly impaired the expression of key osteoclastogenic cytokines in activated PBMCs. Furthermore, APR dose-dependently and significantly inhibited activated PBMC-driven osteoclast differentiation and ex vivo osteoclast differentiation of PBMCs derived from PsA and pre-PsA patients, but not from psoriasis patients or healthy controls. TNF and IL-17A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis and osteolytic activity of CD14+ blood monocytes from PsA patients was also significantly inhibited by APR. Finally, APR inhibited expression of the key osteoclast fusion protein dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein.

Conclusion

Phosphodiesterase 4 targeting by APR not only inhibits osteoclastogenic cytokine production, but also directly suppresses inflammation-driven osteoclastogenesis. These data provide initial evidence that APR has the potential to provide a direct bone protective effect in PsA.

### Efficacy and safety of apremilast for the treatment of Japanese patients with palmoplantar pustulosis: results from a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^0a785f41]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment for PPP includes topical treatments (e.g. corticosteroids and active vitamin D3), oral systemic treatments (e.g. acitretin or etretinate, cyclosporine, methotrexate), phototherapy, biologic injectable treatments, and granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis [,–]. However, many of these treatments are contraindicated in certain patient populations and are associated with side effects ranging from skin atrophy with corticosteroids to increased risk of malignancy with phototherapy and biologics. In addition, PPP can be very recalcitrant, and many patients with PPP do not fully respond to their treatment, highlighting an unmet medical need in this patient population.

Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, including palmoplantar psoriasis. PDE4 degrades cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a key regulator of inflammatory signaling. Inhibition of PDE4 with apremilast causes an increase in cAMP, which inhibits production of several inflammatory cytokines that are related to the pathogenesis of PPP, such as TNF-α, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-8. Due to its mechanism of action and efficacy in other cytokine-mediated diseases [–,], apremilast theoretically may also be an effective treatment for PPP. However, until this study, the efficacy and safety of apremilast for the treatment of PPP had not been studied in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. This randomized, phase 2 study (NCT04057937) evaluated the efficacy and safety of apremilast versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PPP after inadequate response to topical treatment in Japan.

### Comparison of risankizumab and apremilast for the treatment of adults with moderate plaque psoriasis eligible for systemic therapy: results from a randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded phase IV study (IMMpulse) [^e4ef599f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of psoriasis with risankizumab has demonstrated superior efficacy to other treatments, such as adalimumab, ustekinumab and secukinumab.

Objectives

This study compared the efficacy and safety of risankizumab and apremilast in adults with moderate plaque psoriasis eligible for systemic therapy. It also evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching to risankizumab vs. continuing apremilast in patients who did not achieve ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75 nonresponders) after 16 weeks of treatment with apremilast.

Methods

This 52-week, phase IV, multicentre, randomized, open-label, efficacy assessor-blinded study (NCT04908475) enrolled patients (aged ≥ 18years) with a diagnosis of moderate chronic plaque psoriasis (≥ 6months) and who were candidates for systemic therapy. The enrolled patients (randomized 1 : 2) received subcutaneous risankizumab (150mg at weeks 0 and 4) or oral apremilast (30mg twice daily). At week 16, all patients treated with apremilast were re-randomized (1 : 1) to risankizumab or apremilast, stratified by week-16 PASI 75 response. The co-primary outcomes in period A at week 16 were the achievement of ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) 0/1 with a two-grade or better improvement from baseline. At week 52, the primary endpoint in period B was the achievement of PASI 90 in PASI 75 nonresponders with apremilast at week 16. Safety was monitored throughout the study. All patients who received one dose of treatment were included in the efficacy and safety analysis.

Results

At baseline, 118 and 234 patients were assigned to receive risankizumab and apremilast, respectively. At week 16, PASI 90 was achieved by 55.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 47.0-64.9] and 5.1% (95% CI 2.3-8.0), and sPGA 0/1 by 75.4% (95% CI 67.7-83.2) and 18.4% (95% CI 13.4-23.3), respectively. In period B, among PASI 75 nonresponders with apremilast at week 16, 83 switched to risankizumab and 78 continued apremilast. At week 52, 72.3% (95% CI 62.7-81.9) who switched to risankizumab achieved PASI 90 vs. 2.6% (95% CI 0.0-6.1) who continued apremilast. The most frequent adverse events (reported in ≥ 5%) in risankizumab-treated patients were COVID-19 infection and nasopharyngitis. Diarrhoea, nausea and headache were most frequent among apremilast-treated patients.

Conclusions

For patients with moderate psoriasis, treatment with risankizumab demonstrated superior efficacy to those treated with apremilast, including those who did not benefit from prior treatment with apremilast. The safety profile of risankizumab was similar to prior studies, and no new safety signals were identified. These results show that, compared with apremilast, risankizumab treatment can significantly improve clinical outcomes in systemic-eligible patients with moderate psoriasis.

Apremilast—dosing, adverse effects, interactions, monitoring, and special populations in psoriasis: Patients should initially start at a lower dose (10 mg), which is titrated up over 5 days to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects, and thereafter apremilast is dosed 30 mg by mouth twice daily; the dosage titration schedule is Day 1—10 mg (AM), Day 2—10 mg (AM & PM), Day 3—10 mg (AM); 20 mg (PM), Day 4—20 mg (AM & PM), Day 5—20 mg (AM); 30 mg (PM), Day 6—30 mg (AM & PM). The most common adverse effects are diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infections, and headache, and those 65 and older are prone to experience dehydration and its complications. Apremilast may be associated with the emergence or worsening of depression; discuss the risk of depression with patients in advance of therapy. Apremilast is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450, and use with strong inducers of cytochrome P450 (eg, rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) may result in decreased efficacy and is not recommended. In severe renal impairment, apremilast should be reduced to 30 mg once daily (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). A small percentage of patients may lose weight; weight should be monitored regularly, and if weight loss occurs (>5% from baseline), discontinuation of apremilast should be considered. Routine laboratory screening and monitoring can be considered on an individual basis, and this starred statement is supplemental information that is expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations. There is currently no strong evidence to support the combined use of apremilast with other systemic or phototherapy treatments for psoriasis. Pregnancy use is restricted: should only be used in pregnancy if benefit justifies potential risk to fetus.

### Comparative effectiveness of targeted immunomodulators for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^02f13673]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The comparative effectiveness of available targeted immunomodulators for moderate-to-severe psoriasis has not been evaluated.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of targeted immunomodulators for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Systematic literature review of placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomized trials of 8 targeted immunomodulators that evaluated clinical benefits or harm. The primary outcome was a 75% improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. We also conducted a network meta-analysis adjusted for placebo response to perform indirect comparisons between agents.

Results

In the network meta-analysis, the targeted immunomodulators ordered by increasing relative risk (demonstrating greater likelihood) of achieving a 75% improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index relative to placebo were as follows: apremilast (6.2), etanercept (9.6), adalimumab (13.0), ustekinumab (14.0), secukinumab (15.4), infliximab (16.2), brodalumab (17.3), and ixekizumab (17.9). Ixekizumab, brodalumab, and infliximab were all statistically superior to ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, and apremilast; results were similar to those of head-to-head studies where data were available.

Limitations

Much of the evidence is short-term (covering 10-16 weeks); limited direct comparisons.

Conclusions

The interleukin 17A inhibitors are more effective in achieving clearance than ustekinumab, and they are generally more effective than etanercept, adalimumab, and apremilast.

### Generalized pustular psoriasis treated with apremilast in a patient with multiple medical comorbidities [^7f04f031]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current treatment options for GPP include first-line therapies of cyclosporine, methotrexate, acitretin, and infliximab, as well as second-line therapies of adalimumab, etanercept, psoralen plus ultraviolet A light phototherapy, and topical therapies.Of these, cyclosporine and infliximab are considered first line in patients with severe, acute disease because of their quick onset of action. While a recent study has suggested that biologic therapies pose a minimal to no risk of hepatitis C reactivation in low-risk patients with psoriasis,the outcome in patients with significant comorbidities remains unknown. Therefore, of the therapies listed above, none were appropriate for this patient because of his history of active hepatitis C infection, chronic liver disease, and active malignancy.

Apremilast is an oral small-molecule PDE-4 inhibitor that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in 2014. PDE-4 inhibition increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in immune cells, leading to decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines tumor necrosis factor–α, interferon-γ, interleukins (ILs)-12 and -23, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL4, and increased levels of antiinflammatory cytokines, including IL-10.The pharmacokinetics of apremilast are not affected by hepatic impairment and the drug is not hepatotoxic. In addition, apremilast is not contraindicated in patients with active infection or malignancy. Therefore, apremilast was chosen for this patient.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of apremilast for the treatment of GPP. Because of the patient's placement into palliative care, the impact of apremilast on his hepatitis C and progression of his malignancy is uncertain, but apremilast for a psoriasis patient with hepatitis C has been previously reported.This case shows that apremilast can be a potentially effective and safe option for the treatment of adult-onset GPP arising from plaque psoriasis.

### Apremilast long-term safety up to 5 years from 15 pooled randomized, placebo-controlled studies of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Behçet's syndrome [^eeddde63]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis of 15 placebo-controlled clinical studies, including 4183 patients treated with apremilast 30 mg twice daily, confirms the safety of long-term apremilast use in patients with plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, or oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s syndrome. EAIRs for serious events and events of special interest were low (< 1%) in patients treated with apremilast 30 mg twice daily despite significant exposure. Apremilast provides a therapeutic option with established long-term safety and a favorable benefit–risk profile for patients with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, or Behçet’s syndrome requiring chronic, systemic therapy.

Active psoriatic arthritis with predominant enthesitis—treatment-naive and after OSM—has conditional recommendations based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. In treatment-naive PsA with predominant enthesitis, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologic is recommended over an OSM as a first-line option; apremilast may be used instead of a TNFi biologic if the patient prefers an oral therapy or has contraindications to TNFi, and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended over starting an OSM unless specified comorbidities are present. Tofacitinib is recommended over apremilast, with apremilast may be used instead of tofacitinib in patients with recurrent infections. In patients with active PsA with predominant enthesitis despite treatment with an OSM, a TNFi, an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i), or an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor (IL-12/23i) is recommended over switching to another OSM, with apremilast allowed for those preferring oral therapy or with recurrent infections or contraindications to TNFi biologics. Within biologics, a TNFi is recommended over an IL-17i or IL-12/23i; an IL-17i or IL-12/23i may be used instead of a TNFi in patients with severe psoriasis or contraindications to TNFi; an IL-17i is recommended over an IL-12/23i; and an IL-12/23i may be used instead of a TNFi in patients who prefer less frequent drug administration or instead of an IL-17i in patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
