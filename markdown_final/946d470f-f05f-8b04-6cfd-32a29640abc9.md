## Question

Can a pt with MCC on Immune therapy after surgery reduce his iv tx from every 2 wks to monthly safly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with Merkel cell carcinoma who is receiving post-surgical immunotherapy can safely reduce the frequency of intravenous treatment from every 2 weeks to monthly, and what evidence supports that change. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is adjuvant therapy after complete resection or treatment for residual or metastatic disease. Then, I should verify the standard dosing schedules for the approved agents and whether any guideline-endorsed de-escalation strategies exist. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic rationale for extended dosing intervals and any clinical data on reduced-frequency regimens. After that, I need to assess safety and efficacy trade-offs, including recurrence risk and immune-related adverse events. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline monitoring if de-escalation is considered.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the answer hinges on whether this is adjuvant therapy after complete resection or treatment of measurable disease. In completely resected MCC, adjuvant immunotherapy is investigational and not standard of care outside trials, though the ADMEC-O randomized phase 2 trial tested nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for 1 year versus observation, suggesting that monthly dosing is feasible in the adjuvant setting, albeit with modest absolute improvements in disease-free survival and without mature overall survival data, so any de-escalation here would still be off-protocol and should be individualized [^c25b5e81] [^7b43a4c1]. In contrast, for recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic disease not amenable to curative surgery or radiation, standard-of-care immunotherapy uses every-2-week or every-3-week dosing, and there is no guideline-endorsed routine switch to monthly intervals, so changing to monthly would be a departure from evidence-based practice and warrants caution [^e53effed] [^6b652144].

> Wait, let me verify the standard dosing schedules for the approved agents so I don't misstate them. Avelumab is dosed at 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, pembrolizumab is 200 mg IV every 3 weeks or 2 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks, and nivolumab is typically 240 mg IV every 2 weeks or 480 mg IV every 4 weeks in other indications, though in MCC the pivotal datasets and guidelines emphasize every-2-week or every-3-week schedules rather than routine monthly dosing for advanced disease [^dbeec28e] [^66525e6b] [^2023cda9] [^e53effed]. Hold on, I should double-check that nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks is not the MCC standard; indeed, the MCC-specific trials and NCCN listings reflect every-2-week or every-3-week regimens, whereas every-4-week nivolumab is more characteristic of other tumor types and the adjuvant MCC trial, reinforcing that monthly dosing is not the established norm for metastatic MCC management [^e53effed] [^c25b5e81].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic rationale for extended intervals, because receptor occupancy and pharmacokinetics matter. Anti–PD-1 antibodies have prolonged PD-1 receptor occupancy that can persist for up to roughly 100 days after a single dose, which theoretically supports extended dosing in selected patients, but this is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for MCC-specific outcomes [^8b6c669d]. Let me consider whether any MCC cohorts actually tested reduced-frequency dosing; yes, a small retrospective series including MCC patients reported that after achieving disease control on standard schedules, switching to every-3-month dosing yielded high 3-year progression-free survival in MCC, but the sample was tiny and the design was retrospective, so this cannot be generalized to routine practice without prospective validation [^26bfbf2a].

> Next, I should review safety and efficacy trade-offs, because de-escalation could reduce toxicity but increase recurrence risk. Across avelumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab, grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events occur in about 5% to 21% and immune-related adverse events are generally manageable with guideline-directed immunosuppression, so the safety incentive to reduce frequency is real but not overwhelming in most patients [^c9ea72c0] [^2ee05e80]. But wait, what if we lower dosing frequency too much in patients without a complete response; data suggest patients who never achieve a complete response have higher progression risk even after more than a year of therapy, so elective de-escalation in partial responders may be unsafe and could compromise durable control, which argues against routine monthly dosing in advanced disease [^8b6c669d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should synthesize a risk-stratified approach. For patients with completely resected MCC who are already receiving adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks within a trial or carefully selected real-world context, continuing monthly dosing is reasonable given the ADMEC-O regimen, though the absolute benefit is modest and decisions should be individualized with close surveillance [^c25b5e81]. For patients with measurable disease on standard every-2-week or every-3-week therapy, routine de-escalation to monthly dosing is not supported by guidelines or robust evidence and should generally be avoided outside a clinical trial, especially if there is residual disease or a partial response rather than a complete response [^e53effed] [^6b652144]. If logistics or toxicity are compelling, a cautious, individualized de-escalation could be considered only after sustained disease control, with explicit counseling about uncertain benefit and enhanced imaging surveillance, ideally in a multidisciplinary setting and preferably within a study framework [^f38d6d3d].

> I need to ensure I address practical monitoring if de-escalation is pursued despite the limitations. Let me first confirm surveillance standards: for high-risk MCC, clinical exams and imaging every 3–6 months for the first 2–3 years are recommended, with consideration of MCPyV serology in seropositive patients, and any change in frequency or dose should be accompanied by tighter early follow-up to detect early progression [^711403f1] [^dfd35f28]. I should double-check that this applies across settings; yes, NCCN and ESMO-aligned guidance endorse risk-adapted imaging and frequent clinical assessments in the first few years, which is particularly important if therapy is modified off-protocol [^711403f1] [^dfd35f28].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Monthly immunotherapy dosing is not the standard for post-surgical MCC with measurable disease, where every-2-week or every-3-week regimens remain guideline-based, and switching to monthly risks undertreatment outside a trial [^e53effed] [^6b652144]. Monthly nivolumab is acceptable within the adjuvant ADMEC-O regimen but reflects an investigational strategy with modest DFS gains and no OS maturity, so it should not be extrapolated to metastatic disease management without evidence [^c25b5e81]. If de-escalation is contemplated for compelling reasons, it should be reserved for patients with durable disease control, ideally after a complete response, with shared decision-making, close surveillance, and consideration of clinical trial enrollment to capture outcomes and minimize harm [^8b6c669d] [^f38d6d3d].

---

In select patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) who have achieved a **complete response** on immune therapy after surgery, reducing intravenous treatment from every 2 weeks to monthly can be considered, but this is not standard practice and should be individualized [^8b6c669d]. The rationale is that PD-1 blockade can sustain clinical benefit with extended dosing intervals, and small series suggest maintained disease control with reduced-frequency regimens [^26bfbf2a]. However, **evidence is limited** and largely extrapolated from melanoma and small MCC cohorts; thus, decisions should be guided by response, durability, and patient factors, with close surveillance and shared decision-making [^8b6c669d]. If considered, it is reasonable to continue treatment for at least 12 months and monitor closely for recurrence [^8b6c669d].

---

## Evidence supporting reduced-frequency immunotherapy

- **Pharmacokinetic rationale**: Anti–PD-1 agents have prolonged PD-1 receptor occupancy (up to ~100 days), supporting extended dosing intervals without immediate loss of efficacy [^8b6c669d].

- **Clinical evidence**: A retrospective cohort of 23 patients with advanced melanoma or MCC who achieved disease control on standard PD-1 therapy and then switched to every-3-month dosing had a 3-year PFS of 100% in MCC, suggesting durable control with reduced frequency [^26bfbf2a].

- **Elective discontinuation data**: In MCC patients who achieved complete response and received ≥ 1 year of PD-1 therapy, 84% remained progression-free ≥ 1 year after stopping, indicating durable benefit in selected responders [^8b6c669d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current NCCN and SITC guidelines do not provide a **standard recommendation** for reducing immunotherapy frequency in MCC; they emphasize individualized care, shared decision-making, and consideration of clinical trial enrollment when available [^7b43a4c1] [^f38d6d3d]. Expert consensus suggests that in patients with a complete response after ≥ 1 year of therapy, **elective discontinuation or de-escalation may be reasonable** after discussing risks and benefits [^8b6c669d].

---

## Risks and benefits of reducing treatment frequency

| **Potential benefits** | **Potential risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduced treatment burden and improved quality of life | Increased risk of recurrence, particularly in partial responders or those with high-risk features [^8b6c669d] |
| Lower risk of immune-related adverse events | Limited evidence supporting reduced-frequency dosing in MCC |
| Cost savings and improved adherence | Uncertainty about long-term durability of response |

---

## Patient selection criteria

Careful selection is essential; **favorable candidates** include those with:

- **Complete response**: Confirmed complete response on imaging after ≥ 1 year of therapy [^8b6c669d].

- **Low-risk features**: Early-stage disease, negative margins, no immunosuppression, and MCPyV-positive status [^a98301f7].

- **Good performance status**: ECOG 0–1 and no significant comorbidities [^c8aff95e].

Conversely, **patients with partial response, high-risk features, or immunosuppression** should not have their frequency reduced outside a clinical trial [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If frequency is reduced, **close surveillance is critical**:

- **Imaging**: Every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then annually [^711403f1].

- **Clinical exams**: Every 3–6 months, with heightened vigilance for recurrence [^711403f1].

- **Patient education**: Prompt reporting of new lesions or symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Reducing immunotherapy frequency from every 2 weeks to monthly may be reasonable in **select MCC patients** who have achieved a complete response after ≥ 1 year of therapy, but this is not standard practice and should be individualized. Decisions should be made through shared decision-making, with careful consideration of response, durability, and patient-specific factors, and with close surveillance for recurrence [^8b6c669d]. If considered, continue treatment for at least 12 months and monitor closely for recurrence.

The optimal duration of treatment ICI in metastatic cancers is uncertain, especially for patients who do not achieve radiologic complete remission. Many face progressive disease after discontinuation of ICI. Extending treatment, however, often poses logistical challenges. In a retrospective study on 23 patients with advanced melanoma (n = 18) or MCC (n = 5) received ICI therapy at reduced dose frequency every 3 months after initial disease control at standard dose frequency. After frequency reduction, the 3-year progression-free survival was 73% in melanoma and 100% in patients with MCC. However, among a cohort of 65 patients, those 25 who achieved a complete response (CR) on positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging seem to maintain lasting responses even after discontinuing treatment for a year. Only two patients (8%) experienced a recurrence following the cessation of avelumab treatment.

Background

Immunotherapy is emerging as an alternative treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma, but its long-term effects on response, survival, and safety are not well established. High-quality evidence is needed to estimate the efficacy of this treatment and to review the characteristics of patients and tumors that might improve outcomes.

Objective

To summarize efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.

Methods

A systematic review was performed for studies published in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. Two reviewers examined the literature and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated the proportions for objective responses, progression-free survival, overall survival, and treatment-related adverse events. Associations between objective response rate and immunobiologic markers were analyzed.

Results

Six clinical trials of 201 patients treated with immunotherapy were included. The objective response rate was 51% (95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.62; I 2 = 37.1%) and grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 18% (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.29; I 2 = 49.5%) of patients. No significant difference was observed between response rates and immunobiologic characteristics.

Conclusions

A significantly reduced tumor diameter with durable response rates and a safe profile are obtained with immunotherapy. Similar response rates achieved on either subgroup of viral status or programmed death ligand 1 expression suggests that it might act on multiple, unexplored pathways.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer that is highly radiosensitive and immunogenic. Immunotherapy is the primary treatment of advanced disease, and immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk resectable MCC. Emerging biomarkers of tumor burden are becoming increasingly important in identifying high-risk patients and in post-treatment surveillance. Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of anti-PD-(L)1 treatment and second-line options for patients with MCC refractory to immunotherapy. This review covers the characteristics and management of MCC including recent innovations and areas of active investigation.

In a subgroup of the CheckMate 358 trial described above, 39 patients with MCC (AJCC Stage IIA-IV) were treated with two doses of nivolumab in a neo-adjuvant setting. Of the 36 patients who underwent surgical intervention 4 weeks after therapy start, 17 (47%) achieved a complete pathological response (pCR). Among 33 patients who underwent radiological tumor evaluation before surgery, 18 (55%) showed a tumor reduction of 30% or more. Again, the clinical response was independent of MCPyV, PD-L1, or tumor mutational burden status of the respective tumors. After a median follow-up of 20.3 months, the median RFS and overall survival (OS) had not been reached; however, RFS significantly correlated with pCR and radiological response at the time of surgery. No patient with a pCR experienced tumor recurrence during the follow-up period. Three ongoing clinical trials addressing the effect of different ICI therapies, i.e. cemiplimab (NCT04975152), pembrolizumab (NCT05496036), and the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab (NCT06151236), in the neoadjuvant setting. Unfortunately, none of these prospective trials is randomized or exceeds number of patients treated in the subgroup of the CheckMate 358 trial.

In a phase 2 multicenter trial (ADMEC-O, registered under NCT02196961), patients with MCC with no evidence of disease after complete surgical resection of lesions, regardless of stage but with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio at 20 academic medical centers in Germany and the Netherlands. The assigned treatments were either nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for a duration of 1 year or observation. Stratification was based on stage (AJCC stages 1–2 versus stages 3–4), age (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years), and sex. The primary endpoint was landmark RFS at 12 and 24 months, evaluated in the intention-to-treat populations. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety assessments.

For primary locally advanced (if curative surgery and curative RT not feasible), Preferred options are Avelumab and Pembrolizumab, Other Recommended is Retifanlimab-dlwr, and Useful in Certain Circumstances includes Neoadjuvant Nivolumab. For recurrent locally advanced (if curative surgery and curative RT not feasible), Preferred options are Pembrolizumab and Retifanlimab-dlwr, Other Recommended is Avelumab, and Useful in Certain Circumstances is none. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. When available and clinically appropriate, enrollment in a clinical trial is recommended. Data from non-randomized trials in patients with MCC demonstrate that rates of durable response are improved with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade compared with cytotoxic therapy. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV Nivolumab and has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV Nivolumab.

Conclusions

Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of MCC biology, diagnosis and therapy; however, major research challenges remain. A striking molecular dichotomy exists between VP-MCC and VN-MCC, although the biological and clinical consequences of this difference — including critical pathways for tumorigenesis — are incompletely understood. Furthermore, the MCC cell of origin remains unknown. Finally, continued progress in improving patient outcomes will require the validation of additional therapeutic options in order to augment the gains provided by surgery, radiotherapy and immunotherapy.

### Radiotherapy in the multidisciplinary management of merkel cell carcinoma [^611857eb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

The management of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) requires multidisciplinary care for optimal patient outcomes. Radiotherapy (RT) is most commonly used as adjuvant therapy to improve locoregional control in patients with MCC who undergo surgery. Additionally, it can sometimes be used as definitive monotherapy for patients who decline or are not candidates for surgery and as palliative treatment in those with metastatic MCC. This article discusses the indications, treatment considerations, and recommended dose prescriptions for RT in the management of early- and advanced-stage disease. Considerable hope exists that immunotherapy advances will synergize with RT to further enhance clinical outcomes.

### Adjuvant immunotherapy with nivolumab versus observation in completely resected merkel cell carcinoma (ADMEC-O): disease-free survival results from a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial [^c25b5e81]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an immunogenic but aggressive skin cancer. Even after complete resection and radiation, relapse rates are high. PD-1 and PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors showed clinical benefit in advanced MCC. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition in completely resected MCC (ie, a setting without an established systemic standard-of-care treatment).

Methods

In this multicentre phase 2 trial, patients (any stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1) at 20 academic medical centres in Germany and the Netherlands with completely resected MCC lesions were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for 1 year, or observation, stratified by stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer stages 1-2 vs stages 3-4), age (<65 vs ≥65 years), and sex. Landmark disease-free survival (DFS) at 12 and 24 months was the primary endpoint, assessed in the intention-to-treat populations. Overall survival and safety were secondary endpoints. This planned interim analysis was triggered when the last-patient-in was followed up for more than 1 year. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02196961) and with the EU Clinical Trials Register (2013-000043-78).

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2014, and Aug 31, 2020, 179 patients were enrolled (116 [65%] stage 3-4, 122 [68%] ≥65 years, 111 [62%] male). Stratification factors (stage, age, sex) were balanced across the nivolumab (n=118) and internal control group (observation, n=61); adjuvant radiotherapy was more common in the control group. At a median follow-up of 24·3 months (IQR 19·2-33·4), median DFS was not reached (between-groups hazard ratio 0·58, 95% CI 0·30-1·12); DFS rates in the nivolumab group were 85% at 12 months and 84% at 24 months, and in the observation group were 77% at 12 months and 73% at 24 months. Overall survival results were not yet mature. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 48 [42%] of 115 patients who received at least one dose of nivolumab and seven [11%] of 61 patients in the observation group. No treatment-related deaths were reported.

Interpretation

Adjuvant therapy with nivolumab resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 9% (1-year DFS) and 10% (2-year DFS). The present interim analysis of ADMEC-O might suggest clinical use of nivolumab in this area of unmet medical need. However, overall survival events rates, with ten events in the active treatment group and six events in the half-the-size observation group, are not mature enough to draw conclusions. The explorative data of our trial support the continuation of ongoing, randomised trials in this area. ADMEC-O suggests that adjuvant immunotherapy is clinically feasible in this area of unmet medical need.

### Immunotherapy for merkel cell carcinoma: a turning point in patient care [^b46e6cac]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

Immunomodulatory therapies have had a profound impact on the cancer treatment landscape, and MCC is no exception. Indeed, response rates to single-agent immune checkpoint inhibition seem to compare favorably to those of other tumor types. With the recent FDA approval of avelumab for previously-treated advanced MCC, patients with MCC now have a new treatment option beyond chemotherapy. The results of the trials described above led to the inclusion of avelumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab in the January 2018 NCCN guidelines as preferred treatment options for patients with disseminated disease. Although data are still preliminary, it appears that rates of MCC regression in treatment-naïve patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1-pathway blockers may exceed those of patients who were previously treated. These findings require validation in larger patient cohorts, but suggest that immune checkpoint blockade may be most efficacious when used in the first-line setting. Furthermore, responses appear to be durable, unlike those seen with cytotoxic chemotherapy and hence, these agents are becoming the new standard-of-care for treating patients with metastatic or unresectable MCC.

103However, ICPi pneumonitis may not clinically improve after > 48 hours of corticosteroid therapy, at which time it is deemed steroid-refractory. There is no standard immunosuppressive therapy for this clinical situation; however, options include infliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immune globulin, or cyclophosphamide, based on two large retrospective experiences. 137; autoantibodies, such as anti-SSA, and anti-SSB, have occasionally been found, but most patients tend to be seronegative. Arthritis can occur at any time during treatment with some patients first experiencing symptoms many months after initiation of ICPi therapy. 155ICPi was discontinued in all 13 patients. Eleven patients were treated with corticosteroids, and nine patients improved. One patient with thrombotic microangiopathy did not improve, despite glucocorticoids, and another patient transiently improved but then worsened.

Two additional patients did not receive immunosuppression and did not recover renal function. 156-159Although some patients may be treated with PD-1 pathway blockers with preservation of their allografts by having adjustments in their immunosuppressive agents, 161this approach should only be considered with multidisciplinary input from renal transplant nephrology team.

### Merkel cell carcinoma: evolving therapeutics, continued challenges [^bd7d3561]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

3.9 Emerging Research and Precision Oncology

Emerging research focuses on the immune microenvironment of MCC, including the role of T‐cell infiltration and tumor‐associated macrophages in shaping immunotherapy responses. Tertiary lymphoid structures within tumors may correlate with improved immunotherapy outcomes, offering insights into patient‐specific prognostic factors and guiding precision treatment strategies. Advances in genomic and molecular profiling continue to drive personalized approaches, enabling clinicians to predict responses to immunotherapy and radiotherapy with greater accuracy.

In summary, survival outcomes for MCC have improved with advancements in multimodal therapies, particularly immunotherapy and molecular profiling. While localized MCC benefits from surgery and adjuvant RT, metastatic disease now relies on ICIs as standard of care. Comprehensive surveillance and further research into the molecular underpinnings of MCC will continue to refine treatment protocols, offering hope for improved prognosis and quality of life in this aggressive malignancy.

The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-017 (NCT02267603) and KEYNOTE-913 (NCT03783078), two multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trials that enrolled 105 patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MCC who had not received prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.

Patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (KEYNOTE-017) or 200 mg (KEYNOTE-913) every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months.

The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1.

Among the 105 patients enrolled, the median age was 73 years (range: 38 to 91), 79% were age 65 or older; 62% were male; 80% were White, race in 19% was unknown or missing, and 1% were Asian; 53% had ECOG PS of 0, and 47% had ECOG PS of 1. Thirteen percent had stage IIIB disease and 84% had stage IV. Seventy-six percent of patients had prior surgery and 51% had prior radiation therapy.

Efficacy results are summarized in Table 95.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive neuroendocrine cancer of the skin with increasing incidence. Due to the aggressive nature of this cancer, patients often present with local-regionally advanced disease. Patients with large, bulky primary tumors or in-transit metastases are best managed with a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic immunotherapy. For patients with unresectable disease or bulky nodal disease, the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is a topic of active investigation with the most efficacious combinations and timing of multi-modality treatment still undefined. Several promising local and systemic therapies are under investigation for patients with local-regionally advanced MCC.

### Advanced merkel cell carcinoma – A focus on medical drug therapy [^6a402aa1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive non-melanoma skin cancer with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment of choice for primary and locoregional MCC is complete surgical removal with sentinel lymphonodectomy and postsurgical radiotherapy of tumor basin and locoregional lymph nodes. In nonresectable and advanced tumors, drug therapy is indicated. While cytotoxic chemotherapy has resulted in higher response rates, overall survival remained nearly unaffected. With a better insight into tumor development and biology, new treatment s became available. Immune checkpoint inhibitors result in durable responses with a better safety profile that classical combined chemotherapy. Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with and without radiotherapy help to overcome acquired drug-resistance. New compounds for vaccination and oral use are on the horizon. Despite all progress, treatment of MCC remains a challenge that needs close interdisciplinary teamwork.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) systemic therapy and approved immunotherapies—Immunotherapy should be considered within the broader context of available therapies for MCC, and both avelumab and pembrolizumab are indicated specifically for patients with advanced forms of the disease. For patients with unresectable tumors or with contraindications to surgery or radiation, systemic therapy should be considered, with reasons including inability to achieve microscopically negative margins, medical unfitness for surgery or radiation, or treatment-related morbidity that would significantly impact quality of life. Among systemic options, chemotherapy has not demonstrated durable benefit as an initial treatment for advanced MCC nor as an adjuvant therapy at any disease stage; immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the new standard for advanced MCC, often with long-lasting responses.

### Nationwide multidisciplinary consensus on the clinical management of merkel cell carcinoma: a Delphi panel [^c6c326fb]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy has been extensively studied in MCC in recent years.

To date, different immune checkpoint inhibitors (avelumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab)have been shown to be active in the treatment of advanced MCC: in 2017 the European Commission approved avelumab as monotherapy for the treatment of mMCC, regardless of the line of therapy.

A Delphi conference has been organized, involving various Italian centers with a focus on metastatic disease, to show how patients with MCC are managed and to share the expertize of all the specialties potentially involved in the clinical management of the disease, such as surgery, immunology, medical oncology, RT, and dermatology, integrating skills and different know-how. The aim is to revise the state of art of MCC, to highlight the Italian expert perspective regarding important issues in clinical practice of management of MCC, and to address some of the limitations of the current NCCN guideline on the topic. Ultimately, this manuscript is a consensus statement on the multidisciplinary management of MCC developed by an Italian group, using a robust methodology, referencing important trials and articles in the field and highlighting areas of ongoing controversy of international interest.

### Is immunotherapy the only treatment some people need?-NCI (...) [^93737d2e]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy and… Nothing Else. Studies Test Potential Paradigm Shift in Cancer Treatment, by Carmen Phillips For some people with cancer, is 6 months of immunotherapy the only treatment they might ever need. Or just 4 weeks of immunotherapy followed by minor surgery. Results from several small clinical trials suggest that these scenarios may be bona fide possibilities for some people with what are called locally advanced cancers. That means their tumors are largely restricted to their original location but there may be some cancer in nearby lymph nodes. About half of the trial participants received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab for up to 6 months and then chose to have surgery to remove whatever tumor tissue remained after the immunotherapy treatment. More than half of these patients had no evidence of cancer in the tissue removed during surgery, called a pathologic complete response.

Studies test immunotherapy alone or followed by surgery In the MD Anderson trial, patients—in consultation with their doctors—made the decision to have surgery after immunotherapy or continue with immunotherapy only. Overall, tumors shrank substantially in 27 patients following treatment with pembrolizumab. Among the 17 patients who opted for surgery, 10 had a pathologic complete response. The findings, Dr. Ludford and the team wrote, suggest that a short course of immunotherapy could be a “definitive approach” for people with locally advanced MSI-high or dMMR tumors—that is, it could be their sole treatment. Last year, even more impressive results were reported from a similar but smaller trial conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. That trial included 12 people with rectal cancer whose tumors were MSI-high or dMMR. Patients in the trial received a single dose of the ICI ipilimumab and two doses of the ICI nivolumab over 4 weeks.

After completing that treatment, all patients had surgery to remove any remaining tumor. During a presentation of the trial’s results at the ESMO meeting, the lead investigator, Myriam Chalabi, M. D. , of the Netherlands Cancer Institute, showed a slide with a waterfall plot—so. “That will be the bar they will be held to, ” she said. And based on the findings thus far, she added, “I think they’ll meet that bar. ”.

### Risk of disease progression after discontinuing immunotherapy in 105 patients with merkel cell carcinoma who responded to PD-1 pathway blockade [^8b6c669d]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Among patients on ICI for at least 1 year, 84% of the cohort who had achieved a CR remained progression-free for≥1 year after elective discontinuation. Similar results have been observed in patients with MCC who discontinued ICI after≥1 year of therapy if they had a PET-confirmed CR.Consequently, we do not recommend early discontinuation prior to 1 year unless discontinuation is necessitated by treatment toxicity or due to strong patient preference following a careful discussion of goals of care.

As an alternative to complete cessation, de-escalation strategies, such as reduced-frequency dosing of ICI, may offer another option to maintain the clinical benefit of ICI therapy, while decreasing logistical and financial burdens of standard ICI regimens. We have previously reported on reduced-frequency dosing—administering anti-PD-1 therapy every 2–3 months—in patients who have experienced maximal response to standard ICI therapy.The pharmacodynamic profile of anti-PD-1 agents supports this approach, with PD-1 receptor occupancy sustained for up to 100 days after a single dose.By extending the interval between doses, this strategy allows patients to continue therapy while reducing treatment-related costs and the time commitment associated with frequent clinic visits.

Compared with those who achieved CR, patients in this study who only achieved a PR had a numerically higher risk of progression, even after adjusting for ICI discontinuation status and reason for discontinuation. This is also consistent with prior MCC and melanoma studies.Therefore, in patients who never achieved a CR, elective discontinuation, even after more than a year of ICI therapy, may warrant careful consideration.

ICI rechallenge after elective discontinuation yielded a modest response rate in our cohort (2/7, 28.5%), lower than the reported rechallenge response rates in other MCC series: 50% in the European cohort and 75% in the Australian cohort.An important distinction with our cohort is that the seven patients who were retreated had all electively discontinued their first course of ICI. The European and Australian MCC cohorts did not specify reasons for ICI discontinuation before retreatment, and it is possible that rechallenge after toxicity confers a different immune response.Given the low response rate in our cohort, it is important to counsel patients that there is a significant risk of non-response following re-treatment after elective discontinuation.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: merkel cell carcinoma, version 1.2024 [^17668fd6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Merkel cell carcinoma—principles of radiation therapy general principles include: Expeditious initiation of adjuvant RT after surgery is preferred as soon as wound healing permits, as delay >7 to 8 weeks has been associated with worse outcomes. There is limited evidence supporting dosing recommendations for MCC. Dose ranges provided are based on clinical practice at NCCN Member Institutions and clinical evidence from studies of other types of skin cancer. Recommendations for external beam RT (EBRT) apply to both photons and electrons. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is considered best practice when treating with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), proton beam radiotherapy, or 3D conformal radiation. The use of IGRT for other types of radiotherapy to treat skin cancer is considered unnecessary. Application of bolus over the primary tumor should be considered to ensure full dose to the surface. Use of surface dosimeters should be considered to verify delivered dose. Radiation treatments should be given by a practicing radiation oncologist with radiation physics support to meet established quality assurance and dosimetric constraints. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Immune checkpoint inhibition in MCC

Pembrolizumab was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to demonstrate objective tumor regressions in patients with MCC. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1 and is now FDA-approved for use in patients with a variety of cancers. In a phase 2, single-arm, multicenter study (number NCT02267603), patients with advanced MCC who had not previously received systemic therapy were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every three weeks for a maximum of two years or until disease progression, dose-limiting toxicity, or complete response. Out of 26 patients, 4 experienced a complete response (CR) and 10 had a partial response (PR), for an ORR of 56%. At 6 months, the progression-free survival rate was 67% and the duration of response ranged from 2.2 months to at least 9.7 months. 86% of responses were ongoing at last follow-up. (Table 1) These results prompted the addition of pembrolizumab for the treatment of disseminated MCC to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Interestingly, objective regression was observed in both virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. PD-L1 expression did not seem to correlate with a higher likelihood of response to treatment as it has in other tumors.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Patients

KEYNOTE-913 was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase III study conducted at 22 sites in Australia, Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Eligible patients were aged 12 years or older and had histologically confirmed MCC that was locoregional and recurred following standard locoregional therapy with surgery or radiation therapy, or both, and was not amenable to local therapy or was metastatic (stage IV per American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th edition, guidelines). Patients were required to have at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and have adequate organ function. Patients could not have received previous treatment for advanced or metastatic disease, with the following exceptions: previous intra-tumoral therapy or previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy if concluded at least 3 months before study treatment initiation. Previous therapy with an anti–PD-1/L1 or anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 agent was not permitted. Patients with known active central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis, an active autoimmune disease, or an active infection requiring systemic therapy were excluded.

The study was conducted in accordance with principles of Good Clinical Practice and was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards and regulatory agencies. All patients provided written informed consent.

Treatment

All patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg (or 2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 200 mg for pediatric patients) every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years), or until documented progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or investigator decision to discontinue. Patients who achieved an investigator-determined complete response (CR) could stop treatment if they had received at least eight administrations of pembrolizumab and had received at least two administrations beyond the date that CR was declared. Patients could continue to receive pembrolizumab beyond PD per RECIST v1.1 at the investigator’s discretion if they were continuing to derive benefit and tolerating treatment.

### Merkel cell carcinoma: evolving therapeutics, continued challenges [^851dbe7d]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Conclusion

MCC is an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with rising global incidence, driven by MCPyV integration and UV‐induced mutagenesis. While surgery with SLNB and adjuvant RT remains critical for localized disease, immune ICIs have redefined the management of advanced MCC, particularly in virus‐positive cases. However, high recurrence rates and limited efficacy in virus‐negative and immunotherapy‐resistant disease highlight the need for novel strategies.

Molecular profiling, ctDNA monitoring, and immune‐based interventions are shaping precision medicine approaches that may improve therapeutic selection, predict resistance, and enhance long‐term outcomes. Future efforts must focus on refining combination therapies, identifying predictive biomarkers, and overcoming treatment resistance to further optimize MCC management and survival.

Immunotherapy for Merkel cell carcinoma: present and future

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive skin cancer associated with poor survival. In a phase I trial, first-line therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced MCC was associated with an ORR of 56%, with responses in patients with and without virus-positive tumors. Subsequent data with a median follow-up of 8.6 months showed durable tumor control, a favorable OS rate of 68% at 18 months and a manageable safety profile. Similar results have been observed with nivolumab, which induced rapid and durable tumor regressions in treatment-naive and previously-treated patients with advanced MCC (ORR 68%) in both virus-positive and virus-negative tumors.

In a phase II trial in patients with stage IV chemotherapy-refractory MCC, avelumab was associated with durable responses and an ORR of 31.8%. Avelumab was also well tolerated with five grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurring in four (5%) patients. In subsequent follow-up, 1-year PFS rate was 30% and 1-year OS rate was 52%. Median OS was 12.9 months. Subgroup analyses suggested a higher probability of response in patients receiving fewer prior lines of systemic therapy, with a lower baseline disease burden, and with PD-L1+ tumors; however, durable responses occurred irrespective of baseline factors, including tumor Merkel cell polyomavirus status.

Avelumab has also achieved high rates of response and was well tolerated as first-line therapy in patients with distant metastatic MCC, with a confirmed ORR of 62.1%. These data are supported by results of a European expanded access programme, which has reported physician-assessed objective responses in 54.3% (n = 57) of patients and a disease control rate (DCR) of 75%. Taken together, these data suggest that checkpoint inhibitors may represent a new standard of care for advanced MCC.

PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors may also have a role as neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy. In the first trial of anti-PD-1 treatment in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable MCC, nivolumab administered for 4 weeks before surgery was safe and induced substantial radiologic and pathologic tumor regressions in 45 and 65% of patients, respectively. Among 21 patients followed after surgery, all were progression-free at 6 months and two had relapsed at 12 months. Nivolumab and avelumab are also being assessed in adjuvant trials.

Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) surveillance—self-exams, clinician exams, imaging, and serology: Patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), or advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) should perform monthly self-skin and lymph node exams, and should have clinical skin exams by a dermatologist and lymph node exams every 3–6 months for the first 24–36 months after diagnosis, and every 6–12 months thereafter. Post-treatment surveillance imaging for advanced MCC, CSCC, and BCC should be conducted using diagnostic CT with or without FDG-PET/CT scans, and if indicated by symptoms, MRI may be helpful to image the head and extremities. For MCC, surveillance imaging should be based on recurrence risk, with high-risk MCC typically imaged every 3–6 months during the first 2 years after diagnosis, and every 6–12 months thereafter until 5 years. Monitoring MCPyV oncoprotein serology (eg, AMERK) every 3–6 months may be used for surveillance of recurrent MCC in seropositive patients as an adjunct to physical exams and scans. For advanced CSCC, imaging frequency should be based on recurrence risk, with high-risk CSCC typically imaged every 3–6 months for 3 years after diagnosis.

### Real-world outcomes of patients receiving salvage therapies for immune checkpoint inhibitor-resistant merkel cell carcinoma: a rationale for future clinical trials [^7b0978cb]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, while the introduction of ICI has made significant strides in improving survival outcomes for advanced MCC, the 60% of patients who ultimately experience disease progression on an ICI typically have disappointing outcomes, regardless of salvage approach. Still, approximately 20% of patients experience long-term survival with a supportive clinical team that facilitates multidisciplinary salvage approaches. While the addition of radiation to ICI was the only salvage approach clearly associated with improved survival outcomes, its applicability may be limited by disease extent. The strikingly better survival of patients with acquired rather than primary resistance to first-line ICI suggests important differences in their underlying biological mechanisms. As clinical trials are designed to address this population, outcomes should be stratified by ICI resistance type and compared with current salvage approaches. These findings clearly highlight the need to develop additional approaches for this population and to establish benchmark survival metrics for new therapies to surpass.

### Efficacy and safety of first-line avelumab treatment in patients with stage IV metastatic merkel cell carcinoma: a preplanned interim analysis of a clinical trial [^aca81574]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer that is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with distant metastatic disease. Results of part A of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial (avelumab in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma) showed that avelumab, an anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, demonstrated efficacy in second-line or later treatment of patients with metastatic MCC (mMCC).

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab as first-line treatment for patients with distant mMCC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

JAVELIN Merkel 200 part B is an international, multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial of first-line avelumab monotherapy. Eligible patients were adults with mMCC who had not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease. Patients were not selected for PD-L1 expression or Merkel cell polyomavirus status. Data were collected from April 15, 2016, to March 24, 2017, and enrollment is ongoing.

Interventions

Patients received avelumab, 10 mg/kg, by 1-hour intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal occurred.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Tumor status was assessed every 6 weeks and evaluated by independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The primary end point was durable response, defined as an objective response with a duration of at least 6 months. Secondary end points include best overall response, duration of response, progression-free survival, safety, and tolerability.

Results

As of March 24, 2017, 39 patients were enrolled (30 men and 9 women; median age, 75 years [range, 47-88 years]), with a median follow-up of 5.1 months (range, 0.3-11.3 months). In a preplanned analysis, efficacy was assessed in 29 patients with at least 3 months of follow-up; the confirmed objective response rate was 62.1% (95% CI, 42.3%-79.3%), with 14 of 18 responses (77.8%) ongoing at the time of analysis. In responding patients, the estimated proportion with duration of response of at least 3 months was 93% (95% CI, 61%-99%); duration of response of at least 6 months, 83% (95% CI, 46%-96%). First-line avelumab treatment was generally well tolerated, and no treatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events occurred.

Conclusions and Relevance

High rates of response to first-line avelumab therapy in patients with distant mMCC build on previously reported antitumor activity after second-line or later treatment, and maturing progression-free survival data suggest that responses are durable. These data further support avelumab's approval in the United States and European Union and use as a standard-of-care treatment for mMCC.

All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. When available and clinically appropriate, enrollment in a clinical trial is recommended. Data from non-randomized trials in patients with MCC demonstrate that rates of durable response are improved with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade compared with cytotoxic therapy. Ipilimumab + Nivolumab is particularly indicated for disease that is refractory to PD-1 therapy. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is not approved for concurrent use with IV Ipilimumab; however, for Nivolumab monotherapy, Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV Nivolumab, and Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV Nivolumab. In the Stage IV setting, next generation sequencing (NGS) of the tumor sometimes reveals relevant and actionable therapeutic targets.

### Immunotherapy response in immunosuppressed patients with merkel cell carcinoma: analysis of 183 patients [^9ea03ef5]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

The prognosis of immunosuppressed patients receiving ICI therapy for MCC was previously unclear. Our findings show that ICIs can elicit objective responses and provide benefits in immunosuppressed patients with advanced MCC, though their response rate may be somewhat lower than those of immunocompetent patients. While immunosuppressed patients face a significantly higher risk of disease progression over time, their time to progression remains substantially longer than typically seen with chemotherapy, as previously noted.

As such, ICIs currently offer the best chance of disease control for immunosuppressed patients with advanced MCC. These results underscore the importance of close monitoring and individualised management strategies during ICI therapy.

### Nationwide multidisciplinary consensus on the clinical management of merkel cell carcinoma: a Delphi panel [^5177c77c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor such as avelumab are recommended systemic therapy options for the treatment of the advanced disease based on three phase II international clinical trials, while CT should be discouraged in this setting unless the patient has contraindications to ICI or experienced disease progression on previous treatment with ICI.Among the three ICI (avelumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab) only avelumab has been approved to date by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the MCC metastatic setting regardless of the line of therapy. Regulatory approval of avelumab for mMCC was based on the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02155647). Part A investigated 88 patients who progressed on prior CT for mMCC: after 1 year follow-up, the objective response rate was 33.0%, with 74% of responses lasting over a year, and the median OS of 12.9 months.After 5 years of follow-up, the median OS was 12.6 months, with a 5-year OS rate of 26%.Part B of JAVELIN Merkel 200 investigated patients who received no prior systemic therapy for mMCC. The analysis of data included ≥15 months of follow-up for 116 patients, who showed an objective response rate of 39.7%, with the median duration of response 18.2 months; while the median OS was 20.3 months and the 12-month OS rate was 60%, associated with a low rate of grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events and no treatment-related deaths.Since 2018, the NCCN guidelines have recommended avelumab as first line treatment for mMCC.The global MCC EAP for avelumab fulfilled an overriding, unmet medical need for patients with mMCC. Before 2017, no treatment was approved for mMCC by the US FDA, European Commission, or any other regulatory authority. Within the large EAP population, avelumab provided a clinical benefit in a real-world population of both immune-competent and immunocompromised patients with mMCC who had various factors that excluded participation in clinical trials. Efficacy and safety data were consistent with pivotal trial data.Results from Italian patients enrolled in the avelumab EAP were consistent with the findings of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial and confirmed the efficacy and safety of avelumab treatment in this population.Infusion-related reaction, fatigue, and rashes were among the most frequently occurring and importantly no new safety signals were identified in the EAP population.

Methods

Patients

Patients with aMCC (distant metastatic or locoregional disease) not amenable to definitive surgery or radiation therapy, and measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST v1.1, were enrolled. Patients who had prior systemic therapy for MCC were excluded, with the exception of adjuvant chemotherapy if completed >6 months prior to initiating study treatment. More detailed patient eligibility criteria have been reported previously.An initial cohort of 26 patients was enrolled between January and December 2015, with results reported in 2016.The protocol was then amended to include 24 additional patients enrolled between March 2016 and May 2017, and preliminary results were reported with a median follow-up of 14.9 months.Potential financial conflicts of the investigators were reported and managed according to institutional policies at each center.

Study design

The CITN-09/KEYNOTE-017 trial is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized Simon two-stage multicenter study. Per the Simon two-stage design for efficacy estimation, at least one response among the first group of nine treated patients was required in order to enroll additional patients. Patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment continued for up to 2 years, or until the development of unacceptable adverse event(s) (AEs), progressive disease (PD), a complete response (CR) with at least 24 weeks of therapy and at least two treatments beyond the date of confirmed CR, consent withdrawal or physician discretion. Patients were followed for AEs, PFS, OS and treatments received after discontinuing the study drug.

Study objectives

The primary objective of the CITN-09/KEYNOTE-017 trial was to determine the clinical efficacy of systemic first-line therapy for aMCC with pembrolizumab (Keytruda/MK-3475). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) measured by RECIST V.1.1, defined as CR+partial response (PR). Secondary end points included PFS, duration of response (DOR) and OS. The study also collected data on subsequent treatments received by patients who had primary or acquired resistance to pembrolizumab. Exploratory objectives were to determine associations between clinical outcomes and baseline and on-treatment patient and tumor characteristics, including tumor viral status and PD-L1 expression.

### Rescue therapy for patients with anti-PD-1-refractory merkel cell carcinoma: a multicenter, retrospective case series [^bf36093d]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint blocking therapy has transformed the treatment landscape for patients with numerous tumor types, including those with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Over the last few years, agents blocking the immunoregulatory pathway comprised of PD-1 and its ligands have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in ~ 30–60% of patients, as well as improvements in progression-free and overall survival compared to historical data from patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Reflecting this, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s 2019 guidelines include avelumab (anti-PD-L1), pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) as preferred therapies for patients with advanced MCC. However, despite these advancements, a substantial portion of patients require “rescue” therapy in the setting of MCC refractory to PD-(L)1 monotherapy. Here, we report the largest case series to date of patients with advanced MCC who received additional immune checkpoint blocking therapies following disease progression on or shortly after treatment with anti-PD-1. We provide evidence that anti-CTLA-4, with or without radiation therapy, can activate synergistic anti-tumor immunity in this patient population. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, our report is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of second-line treatment with a PD-L1 antibody in a patient with anti-PD-1-refractory disease.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)—staging and treatment of the primary tumor: Surgery is the primary treatment modality for most MCC and is needed for accurate pathological staging of both the primary lesion and regional disease; the current AJCC staging system (8th edition) is based on an updated analysis of 9387 patients with MCC from the NCDB with a median follow-up of 28.2 months, and NCCN staging largely parallels AJCC by dividing presentation into surgically resectable local, locally advanced (curative surgery and RT not feasible), regional/in-transit, and disseminated disease. Clinical exam, imaging, laboratory studies, a multidisciplinary consultation, immunosuppression assessment, and potentially a genetics consultation are used to make an initial determination of the clinical N-stage and M-stage, and clinical staging determines the recommended approach for evaluating pathologic nodal status. Among patients with clinically apparent nodal disease at presentation, those with unknown primary have a better outcome than those with synchronous known primary, yet the NCCN recommendations for pathologic evaluation of nodal status and management of the nodal basin are the same for both groups of patients.

Conclusion

Our study showed that use of NIO for MCC patients with CDRLNM has been steadily increasing on a national level in the past few years, with promising clinical responses. Furthermore, our analysis showed that NIO provides OS benefit for stage IIIB MCC patients and should be considered as a new treatment paradigm for eligible patients supported by ongoing clinical trials.

Merkel cell carcinoma—principles of radiation therapy footnotes provide dosing and indication cautions. In subsets of patients at high risk, such as with chronic or profound immune suppression, an RT dose up to 66 Gy may be considered. In patients at higher risk for recurrence (eg, immunosuppression), avoid hypofractionated RT where there is limited data. Consider dose-painting higher dose/fraction to a subvolume incorporating areas of concerning margins, and caution using multiple fractions >5 Gy/fraction when targets involve cartilage or bone. Durable palliation is likely to be higher with 8 Gy x 3 fractions. Adjuvant RT following lymph node (LN) dissection is more likely indicated for multiple involved nodes, the presence of extranodal extension (ENE), or larger nodal size (eg, >1 cm). Use caution for patients with existing lymphedema or at high risk for lymphedema (ie, high body mass index, groin nodal basin, current smoker). LN dissection is the recommended initial therapy for clinically evident adenopathy, followed by postoperative RT if indicated. A footnote states, “Generally reserved for patients who are older or unable to come for protracted course.” All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Merkel cell carcinoma: current treatment landscape and emerging therapeutic targets [^10b1b240]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma that is primarily driven by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and ultraviolet radiation. Due to its rarity and innocuous appearance on clinical exam, MCC diagnosis is often delayed and therefore diagnosed at advanced stages. Overall survival outcomes are poor and notably worse than melanoma, with an estimated five-year survival ranging from 35 to 60% for stage I or II disease to <15% for metastatic disease. Our review examines the diagnostic workup, prognostic markers, and current and emerging treatments of MCC.

Recent Findings

For local disease in which surgical resection is feasible, tumor removal with potential adjuvant radiation therapy is the primary treatment modality. Immunotherapy with PD-1 / PD-L1 inhibitors is now standard for advanced disease where complete resection is not feasible. Additionally, there are many ongoing clinical trials examining novel immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulators, targeted therapies, cellular therapies, vaccines, and oncolytic virus therapies with the goal of improving outcomes for patients with advanced disease or those who experience recurrence after first-line immunotherapy. MCC is an aggressive disease with a rapidly evolving treatment landscape, and emerging therapies hold the potential to improve prognosis in advanced disease.

### Real-world outcomes of patients receiving salvage therapies for immune checkpoint inhibitor-resistant merkel cell carcinoma: a rationale for future clinical trials [^6f8b0903]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

With the introduction of hypofractionated radiation in MCC, this accessible and lower-risk approach could be used in the salvage setting to provide local tumor control, reduce disease burden, and potentially stimulate the immune system.Some data suggest that irradiating all clinically evident disease may lead to better outcomes.Unfortunately, the limited availability of detailed radiation records in the present cohort precluded reliably characterizing the extent of radiation that each patient received. Nevertheless, these data suggest that radiation in combination with ICI should be considered for salvage when feasible.

Surgery was not included in our salvage analyses given the limited number of cases in which this approach was used (7 of 75) and restriction to cases with very low disease burden.

The fact that 14 of the 75 patients with sufficient follow-up (~20%) in the present cohort lived ≥3 years following salvage demonstrates that long-term survival is possible after developing ICI-refractory disease. These patients all received a flexible, multimodal approach (summarized in online supplemental appendix I) for the management of their ICI-resistant aMCC. As illustrated by the two patients whose courses are summarized in the results section, durable responses did not arise via a single salvage therapy, but rather through thoughtful sequencing and combination of multiple systemic and local modalities. These cases demonstrate that the ongoing use of immunotherapy — even after experiencing progression — combined with appropriate approaches to debulk tumor can provide meaningful clinical benefit. Radiation can serve as a bridge to further systemic therapy, including a re-challenge with immunotherapy or clinical trial enrollment.

14.14 Merkel Cell Carcinoma

The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-017 (NCT02267603) and KEYNOTE-913 (NCT03783078), two multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trials that enrolled 105 patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MCC who had not received prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.

Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (KEYNOTE-017) or 200 mg (KEYNOTE-913) every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months.

The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1.

Among the 105 patients enrolled, the median age was 73 years (range: 38 to 91), 79% were age 65 or older; 62% were male; 80% were White, race in 19% was unknown or missing, and 1% were Asian; 53% had ECOG PS of 0, and 47% had ECOG PS of 1. Thirteen percent had stage IIIB disease and 84% had stage IV. Seventy-six percent of patients had prior surgery and 51% had prior radiation therapy.

Efficacy results are summarized in Table 85.
