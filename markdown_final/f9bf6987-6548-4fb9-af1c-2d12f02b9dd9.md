## Question

Treatment for long covid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for long COVID. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining long COVID and establishing diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the current state of evidence and guideline positions. Next, I will examine non-pharmacological interventions with the best support, followed by pharmacologic options, including metformin and other agents. After that, I need to check symptom-specific management and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, multidisciplinary care framework and highlight knowledge gaps and research directions, making sure I continuously cross-check claims against high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't anchor on outdated criteria. Long COVID, or post-COVID-19 condition, is generally defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting at least 3 months after probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms lasting at least 2 months and not explained by an alternative diagnosis, which aligns with the National Academies framing and is the working definition used in contemporary trials and reviews [^114h9MhB]. I should double-check that this is the same definition used in the living systematic review, and yes, the BMJ living review explicitly adopted the WHO definition for eligibility and synthesis, which supports consistency across studies and guidelines [^114h9MhB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatments before I verify the overall evidentiary landscape. The highest-quality synthesis to date is the BMJ living systematic review of randomized trials, which concludes that most interventions have low or very low certainty, with only a few non-pharmacologic strategies showing moderate certainty benefit, and no pharmacologic agent proven effective for established long COVID yet [^117LBAsh]. I need to ensure this aligns with professional society guidance; ESCMID repeatedly states insufficient evidence to recommend for or against most long COVID interventions, including fatigue, persistent cough, neurocognitive sequelae, and psychiatric sequelae, reinforcing the evidence gap and the need for caution [^114eVH9f] [^113vVjzw] [^113YFxXV] [^117Fk7V1].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic interventions with the strongest signals. Moderate-certainty evidence supports cognitive behavioral therapy for fatigue and concentration problems, and a supervised, online combined physical and mental health rehabilitation program improves overall health, reduces depression, and enhances quality of life compared with usual care, which is clinically meaningful and actionable in primary and specialty settings [^117LBAsh] [^1177ixGV]. Wait, let me verify the exercise component; intermittent aerobic exercise 3–5 times weekly for 4–6 weeks probably improves physical function versus continuous exercise, but I need to emphasize pacing and screening for post-exertional symptom exacerbation before prescribing exercise, as recommended by WHO, to avoid harm [^117LBAsh] [^116F8zvq] [^111EQNTr].

> I will now examine pharmacologic options, starting with metformin, because I recall a signal for prevention rather than treatment. Initially, I thought metformin might treat established long COVID, but wait, I should verify the endpoint; the signal comes from a single randomized trial suggesting metformin during acute infection may reduce incident long COVID, with low certainty and no evidence for treating established post-COVID symptoms, so I should correct that misattribution and frame metformin as a preventive, not curative, strategy pending replication [^1176iEkQ] [^114rz56i]. I need to ensure I'm precise about certainty; the WHO-commissioned meta-analysis rated the long COVID outcome as low certainty from one trial, underscoring the need for larger, diverse RCTs before routine preventive use is advised [^1176iEkQ].

> Let me consider other drugs often discussed. I should confirm that vortioxetine, leronlimab, probiotics-prebiotics, coenzyme Q10, L-arginine plus vitamin C, and several device or technology interventions have not shown compelling benefit in randomized trials for long COVID to date, which the living review reiterates alongside the absence of proven pharmacotherapies for established long COVID [^117LBAsh]. But wait, what about antivirals given acutely; an observational cohort did not find nirmatrelvir/ritonavir associated with reduced subsequent long COVID, so I should avoid implying benefit where evidence is null and observational [^115hzYNc].

> Next, I should review symptom-specific management while keeping expectations realistic. For fatigue and post-exertional symptom exacerbation, WHO recommends education, pacing, and cautious, symptom-titrated physical training after screening for exertional desaturation and cardiac impairment, with assistive strategies for severe functional limitation, which I should integrate with CBT where appropriate given the moderate-certainty benefit signal [^116F8zvq] [^111EQNTr] [^111jGh3k]. For breathlessness, WHO suggests breathing control techniques, nasal breathing, and psychological support, with individualized rehabilitation plans guiding intensity and modality, which I should tailor to cardiopulmonary findings and patient tolerance [^115NRn9G] [^111VCAPe] [^1149uJ4j]. For neurocognitive symptoms, WHO proposes education, self-management, and cognitive exercises, but I should caution that a recent multicenter RCT of cognitive training, structured rehabilitation, and tDCS showed no differential benefit versus comparators, so expectations should be conservative and individualized [^112EW2TG] [^114bWV7r]. For arthralgia, WHO supports pain education, short-term anti-inflammatories, and exercise in the absence of post-exertional exacerbation, which fits a multimodal pain approach [^116krYto]. For olfactory dysfunction, I should confirm that olfactory training is reasonable to offer, with discussion of spontaneous recovery and consideration of other interventions in trials, per ESCMID and WHO guidance [^114rqPaz] [^117RzWEo].

> I need to ensure safety and screening steps are explicit. Before prescribing exercise or pulmonary rehabilitation, I should screen for exertional desaturation, cardiac impairment, and orthostatic intolerance, and modify programs accordingly, because post-exertional symptom exacerbation is common and can be worsened by overly aggressive rehabilitation, which WHO emphasizes in its rehabilitation guidance [^111EQNTr] [^116F8zvq]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with occupational guidance. ACOEM similarly recommends structured, titrated return-to-activity with energy conservation and treatment of comorbid contributors, reinforcing a careful, individualized approach [^116wu1aT].

> Let me synthesize a practical care framework, but I should double-check that it reflects both evidence and guidance. A multidisciplinary model anchored in primary care with access to rehabilitation, mental health, and specialty input is recommended, with tiered services in some systems and a focus on functional assessment, symptom clusters, and shared decision-making, which is echoed by UK policy analyses and rehabilitation literature [^116dK5TC] [^111BzP9G]. I should confirm that WHO endorses individualized rehabilitation programs guided by persistent symptoms and functional limitations, which supports tailoring exercise, pacing, and assistive strategies to patient needs and trajectories [^1149uJ4j].

> I will now examine knowledge gaps and research directions so I don't overstate certainties. The field lacks standardized diagnostic biomarkers and consistent case definitions, which hampers comparability and generalizability across trials, and most RCTs are small, short-term, and heterogeneous in populations and outcomes, limiting certainty and external validity [^116xTMPQ]. Let me reconsider metformin; yes, replication in larger, diverse RCTs is needed, and future work should also clarify mechanisms linking viral dynamics, metabolic effects, and inflammatory pathways to long COVID phenotypes, while expanding trials to hospitalized and vaccinated populations underrepresented to date [^1176iEkQ] [^114rz56i]. I should also note that ongoing and registered trials span psychological, pharmacologic, and rehabilitation domains, but many are feasibility studies, underscoring the need for adequately powered, phase 3 trials with patient-centered outcomes [^1135V2uA].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise and balanced. No pharmacologic therapy has proven efficacy for treating established long COVID at this time, whereas moderate-certainty evidence supports CBT for fatigue and concentration and supervised combined physical and mental health rehabilitation for global health, depression, and quality of life, with individualized, paced exercise as an adjunct after appropriate screening and safety checks [^117LBAsh] [^1177ixGV]. Metformin during acute infection may reduce incident long COVID, but evidence is low certainty and single-trial, so it should not be used for treating established long COVID, and clinicians should prioritize symptom-targeted rehabilitation, comorbidity management, and shared decision-making while monitoring emerging evidence from living guidelines and trials [^1176iEkQ] [^116F8zvq].

---

Current evidence supports a **multidisciplinary, symptom-targeted approach** for long COVID, with no single therapy proven effective across all patients [^116xTMPQ] [^1157Ur5N]. The most consistent benefits come from **rehabilitation and behavioral interventions**, including CBT, pacing, and supervised exercise when tolerated [^117LBAsh] [^116F8zvq]. Pharmacologic options remain limited; metformin during acute infection may reduce long COVID risk, but evidence is low certainty and not for established cases [^1176iEkQ]. Management should be individualized, with careful screening for contraindications to exercise and close monitoring for adverse effects [^111EQNTr].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Rehabilitation and exercise

- **Supervised rehabilitation**: Moderate certainty evidence shows supervised rehabilitation improves fatigue, concentration, depression, and quality of life [^117LBAsh] [^116ssPBa].

- **Exercise**: Intermittent aerobic exercise 3–5 times weekly for 4–6 weeks improves physical function, but must be individualized and avoided in post-exertional malaise [^117LBAsh] [^111EQNTr].

- **Breathing control**: Techniques like nasal breathing and pacing help breathlessness and anxiety [^115NRn9G].

---

### Psychological interventions

Cognitive behavioral therapy (**CBT**) probably reduces fatigue and improves concentration, with moderate certainty evidence [^117LBAsh] [^1177ixGV]. Mindfulness and peer support are reasonable for distress reduction, though evidence is limited [^114UCwpk] [^117Fk7V1].

---

### Self-management and education

Energy conservation with **pacing** and assistive strategies is recommended for fatigue and post-exertional symptom exacerbation [^111jGh3k] [^116F8zvq]. Education on symptom management, pacing, and return-to-activity is essential [^116F8zvq].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Medications with limited or uncertain evidence

- **Metformin**: Low certainty evidence suggests reduced long COVID incidence when given during acute infection; not for established long COVID [^1176iEkQ].

- **Other agents**: Vortioxetine, leronlimab, probiotics, coenzyme Q10, and supplements lack compelling evidence [^117LBAsh] [^116ssPBa].

---

## Symptom-specific management

| **Symptom** | **Recommended interventions** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Fatigue | - CBT <br/> - Supervised rehabilitation <br/> - Pacing | Moderate |
| Breathlessness | - Breathing control <br/> - Supervised exercise | Moderate |
| Cognitive impairment | - CBT <br/> - Cognitive exercises | Moderate |
| Anxiety/depression | - Mindfulness <br/> - Peer support <br/> - Psychological support | Low |
| Sleep disturbances | - Sleep hygiene <br/> - CBT-I | Low |

---

## Safety considerations

Before exercise, **screen for cardiac impairment, exertional desaturation, and orthostatic intolerance** [^111EQNTr]. Monitor for adverse effects during rehabilitation and pharmacologic trials, and adjust as needed [^111EQNTr].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

WHO recommends individualized rehabilitation, education, and self-management, with psychological support as indicated [^1149uJ4j] [^116F8zvq]. ESCMID finds insufficient evidence for most pharmacologic interventions and emphasizes rehabilitation and symptom-specific care [^114eVH9f] [^111CYPnx].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Large trials such as **RECOVER** and **STIMULATE-ICP** aim to clarify effective interventions [^1167jXYU]. Research is refining **diagnostic criteria** and outcome measures to enable better trial design and care [^111VhhBF]. Digital and app-based platforms are being explored to deliver scalable rehabilitation and support [^11242Q2F].

---

## Conclusion

Long COVID management should be **individualized and multidisciplinary**, prioritizing rehabilitation, CBT, and self-management, with pharmacologic options limited and metformin reserved for acute-phase prevention rather than treatment of established long COVID.

### Interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID: a systematic review of registered trials [^1135V2uA]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a substantial proportion are experiencing ongoing symptoms for months after infection, known as 'long COVID'. Long COVID is associated with a wide range of physical and neuropsychological symptoms, including impacts on mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing. However, intervention research is only beginning to emerge. This systematic review synthesizes currently registered trials examining interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in patients with long COVID.

Methods

Standard systematic review guidelines were followed. Trials registered in two large trial registries in 2020 to May 2022 were reviewed. Included studies were narratively synthesized by type of intervention and a risk-of-bias assessment was conducted.

Results

Forty-two registered trials were included, with a total target sample size of 5814 participants. These include 11 psychological interventions, five pharmacological and other medical interventions, and five evaluating herbal, nutritional, or natural supplement interventions. An additional nine trials are examining cognitive and neurorehabilitation interventions and 12 are examining physiotherapy or physical rehabilitation. Most trials are randomized, but many are feasibility trials; trials are evaluating a wide spectrum of outcomes.

Conclusions

While there is a newly emerging body of research testing interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID, the breadth and scope of the research remains limited. It is urgently incumbent on researchers to expand upon the intervention research currently under way, in order to generate high-quality evidence on a wide range of candidate interventions for diverse long COVID patient populations.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^117LBAsh]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of interventions for the management of long covid (post-covid condition).

Design

Living systematic review.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 2023.

Eligibility Criteria

Trials that randomised adults (≥ 18 years) with long covid to drug or non-drug interventions, placebo or sham, or usual care.

Results

24 trials with 3695 patients were eligible. Four trials (n = 708 patients) investigated drug interventions, eight (n = 985) physical activity or rehabilitation, three (n = 314) behavioural, four (n = 794) dietary, four (n = 309) medical devices and technologies, and one (n = 585) a combination of physical exercise and mental health rehabilitation. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online programme of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) probably reduces fatigue (mean difference -8.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.11 to -3.69; Checklist for Individual Strength fatigue subscale; range 8–56, higher scores indicate greater impairment) and probably improves concentration (mean difference -5.2, -7.97 to -2.43; Checklist for Individual Strength concentration problems subscale; range 4–28; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online, supervised, combined physical and mental health rehabilitation programme probably leads to improvement in overall health, with an estimated 161 more patients per 1000 (95% CI 61 more to 292 more) experiencing meaningful improvement or recovery, probably reduces symptoms of depression (mean difference -1.50, -2.41 to -0.59; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale; range 0–21; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and probably improves quality of life (0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29+2 Profile; range -0.022–1; higher scores indicate less impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that intermittent aerobic exercise 3–5 times weekly for 4–6 weeks probably improves physical function compared with continuous exercise (mean difference 3.8, 1.12 to 6.48; SF-36 physical component summary score; range 0–100; higher scores indicate less impairment). No compelling evidence was found to support the effectiveness of other interventions, including, among others, vortioxetine, leronlimab, combined probiotics-prebiotics, coenzyme Q10, amygdala and insula retraining, combined L-arginine and vitamin C, inspiratory muscle training, transcranial direct current stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen, a mobile application providing education on long covid.

Conclusion

Moderate certainty evidence suggests that CBT and physical and mental health rehabilitation probably improve symptoms of long covid.

### Treatment experiences, preferences, and expectations for cognitive impairments in long COVID among Chinese young and older adults: a constructivist grounded theory study [^113MiJd9]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive impairments associated with long COVID disrupt daily functioning and psychological well-being. While increasing research has examined prevalence and mechanisms, little is known about patients' treatment experiences, preferences, and expectations. In the absence of validated effective treatments, integrating these perspectives is essential for guiding research priorities and clinical trial design. In China, where long COVID is an emerging public health concern, awareness of cognitive impairments remains limited and access to specialised care is inadequate. Considering potentially substantial differences in baseline health and treatment expectations between young and older adults, this study aimed to explore and compare their perspectives using a qualitative approach.

Methods

We adopted constructivist grounded theory to capture participants' lived experiences and develop a theory grounded in their narratives. Semi-structured online interviews were conducted with 23 individuals recruited via Chinese social media long COVID mutual aid groups, including 10 young adults (18–39 years) and 13 older adults (≥ 60 years). Theoretical sampling guided recruitment and iterative analysis through initial, focused, and theoretical coding, leading to the development of a framework explaining treatment preferences and expectations.

Results

All participants reported cognitive impairments based on self-perception, with no formal medical diagnoses. We constructed a theoretical framework of "Individualised and Dynamic Adaptation to Cognitive Challenges". Preferences and expectations could be shaped by age, symptom severity, prior management experiences, lifestyle, doctor-patient interactions, and health literacy. Young adults showed a strong preference for non-pharmacological strategies, including self-directed approaches and emotional support to address stigma. Older adults emphasised a balanced use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, supported by family and structured routines, while expressing holistic expectations that encompassed cognitive, physical, and emotional well-being. Across both groups, improved sleep and psychological health were consistently emphasised.

Conclusions

Age-specific differences highlighted the heterogeneity of long COVID experiences and underscored the need for dynamic, patient-centred approaches. Tailored interventions that integrate patient perspectives may enhance care quality and outcomes. Holistic care, particularly for older adults who may face additional comorbidities and functional challenges, is essential. In China, increasing awareness among the public and healthcare providers, reducing stigma, and addressing inequalities in care access should be prioritised.

### JAK inhibitors and COVID-19 [^114FVoJw]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

As more molecules keep being approved in emergency for treatment of COVID-19, RCTs are important to compare their definitive effect and determine the best indication(s) for each molecule. Also, RCTs with combination therapies would be all the more important for patient who might be already on treatment with JAKi — which it might be dangerous to stop abruptly in an emergency situation.

More data will emerge on secondary effects of JAKi in the setting of COVID-19. For example, both JAKi and COVID-19 were linked to potential thrombotic risk of their own but no evidence to date exist for an increased thrombotic risk while using JAKi for treating COVID-19. Moreover, adverse effects known from long-term treatment with JAKi, as immunosuppression, are less likely to be relevant in COVID-19, where treatment is of short duration, but should be kept in mind.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^111VhhBF]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Search strategy

We worked with an experienced research librarian to search Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and CINAHL from inception to December 2023 (see supplement 1). Our search combined terms related to long covid with a filter for randomised trials. In February 2024, we supplemented our search using the Epistemonikos covid-19 Repository — a living catalogue of covid-19 research — and by reviewing the references of relevant systematic reviews and soliciting experts for eligible trials.

Study selection

Following training and calibration exercises to ensure sufficient agreement, pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen the titles and abstracts of search records and subsequently the full texts of articles considered potentially eligible. We used the online systematic review software Covidence to assist with screening. Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion, or, if necessary, adjudication by a third reviewer.

Data extraction

Following training and calibration exercises to ensure sufficient agreement, pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to collect data from eligible trials using a pilot tested Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2019). Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer. A third experienced reviewer checked all consensus data to confirm accuracy.

Reviewers collected data on trial characteristics (eg, trial design, country of origin, funding sources, diagnostic criteria for long covid), patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, employment and education status, receipt of covid-19 vaccination, method of acute covid-19 diagnosis, severity of acute covid-19 infection, duration of long covid symptoms, number of covid-19 infections, long covid symptoms), characteristics of interventions and comparators (eg, type of intervention, treatment duration), and patient important outcomes. Our outcomes of interest were informed by a published core outcome set for long covidand discussions with patient partners and clinicians. We included fatigue, pain, post-exertional malaise, changes in education or employment status, cognitive function, mental health, dyspnoea, quality of life, patient reported physical function, recovery or improvement, and serious adverse events (as defined by each trial). We extracted data for all instruments used in trials that measured any of our outcomes of interest.

### Treatment experiences, preferences, and expectations for cognitive impairments in long COVID among Chinese young and older adults: a constructivist grounded theory study [^111eh8XU]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

At present, no widely validated treatments exist for managing cognitive impairments associated with long COVID. To allocate limited research resources efficiently towards exploring potentially effective interventions, it is essential to ground these efforts in patient perspectives to avoid inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. The complexity and heterogeneity of long COVID-associated cognitive impairments necessitate an approach that allows for an in-depth exploration of individual experiences, while accounting for the interplay of diverse personal, social, and systemic influences. Moreover, pandemic-related factors such as extended lockdowns and prolonged social isolation may also have contributed to perceived cognitive decline and reduced well-being in both younger and older adults. These contextual influences should be taken into account when interpreting long COVID-related cognitive impairments. Furthermore, research has shown that patient expectations could influence treatment outcomes in various conditions, including cognitive issues. When patients perceive a treatment as being aligned with their beliefs and expectations, and when their perspectives are heard and respected during the rehabilitation process, they are more likely to engage with it and experience better outcomes, particularly when there are low predictive errors between their expectations and actual experiences following treatment. Understanding and integrating patient expectations is therefore critical for optimizing long COVID cognitive rehabilitation.

Long COVID poses a significant health crisis in China. A large-scale survey of 74,075 Chinese participants found that approximately 10%−30% reported experiencing long COVID symptoms such as fatigue (30.53%), memory decline (27.93%), decreased exercise ability (18.29%), and brain fog (16.87%). However, publicly available, well-evidenced platforms providing information on long COVID symptoms remain scarce, leaving the public with limited access to reliable information and low awareness of the conditions. Additionally, the lack of specialised long COVID clinics in China further restricts access to appropriate care. Hence, prioritizing research tailored to the needs of those with long COVID-associated cognitive impairments in China is essential to raise public awareness and lay the groundwork for identifying potentially effective interventions.

### Addressing post-COVID symptoms: a guide for primary care physicians [^116s7NkE]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-COVID symptoms, defined as symptoms lasting > 4 weeks postinfection, have been identified not only among those patients who were hospitalized with severe symptoms but also among those who were asymptomatic or with only mild symptoms. Primary care providers (PCPs) will often be the first point of contact for patients experiencing potential complications of post-COVID symptoms. The aim of this article is to present a post-COVID management tool for PCPs to use as a quick reference and guide to the initial workup and management of the most common post-COVID symptoms.

Methods

Published guidance, recent literature, and expert specialist opinion were used to create the structure outlining the outpatient evaluation and treatment for post-COVID symptoms.

Results

A quick-reference guide for management of post-COVID symptoms was created for PCPs. Educational materials were created for clinicians to share with patients. Our article reviews several common complaints including respiratory, cognitive, and neurological symptoms, chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and anosmia and presents recommendations for management.

Conclusions

Data on long-term effects of COVID-19 are still emerging, and rapid dissemination of this data to front-line PCPs is crucial. This table was our effort to make the currently available evidence accessible for our PCPs in a simple, easy-to-use format.

Long COVID — risk for persistent symptoms and clinical course — Persistent symptoms are more likely after severe illness, and patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) have higher risks of persistent symptoms including fatigue, chest tightness, anxiety, dyspnea, and myalgia. Patients with mild illness have a lower rate of ongoing symptoms most of which resolve within a year from diagnosis. Reinfection also carries an added risk for persistent symptoms.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^114h9MhB]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We submitted our review protocol to MedRxiv in March 2024.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible studies enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with long covid — defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as symptoms at ≥ 3 months after laboratory confirmed, probable, or suspected covid-19 infection that persisted for at least two months — and randomised them either to any drug or non-drug intervention, placebo or sham, usual care, or to alternative drug or non-drug interventions, without any restrictions on date or language of publication. This definition, although broad, is consistent with the most recent definition published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and reflects the limitations in current scientific knowledge about long covid. Based on empirical evidence showing that preprints and published reports of randomised trials generally provide consistent results, we included both preprint and published trial reports.

We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses excluding trials that did not report the time since acute covid-19 infection or the duration of long covid symptoms according to WHO criteria. It was not possible to perform these analyses, however, owing to the limited number of trials addressing each class of intervention and outcome.

We excluded trials if ≥ 20% of patients had recovered from covid-19 less than three months before randomisation; pseudorandomised trials; trials of animals; and trials investigating treatments for acute covid-19 or interventions to prevent long covid. Trials were also excluded that targeted patients experiencing only anosmia and hyposmia after covid-19 infection, as these patients likely form a group that is distinct from those with other typical symptoms of long covid (eg, fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, cognitive impairment). Additionally, we excluded randomised trials with fewer than 25 participants in each arm. Smaller trials are unlikely to meaningfully contribute to meta-analyses, more likely to include unrepresentative samples and arms that are prognostically imbalanced, and at higher risk of publication bias.

### What is quality in long COVID care? Lessons from a national quality improvement collaborative and multi-site ethnography [^116dK5TC]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies of the patient experience revealed wide geographical variation in whether any long covid services were provided and (if they were) which patients were eligible for these and what tests and treatments were available. An interim UK clinical guideline for long covid had been produced at speed and published in December 2020, but it was uncertain about diagnostic criteria, investigations, treatments and prognosis. Early policy recommendations for long covid services in England, based on wide consultation across UK, had proposed a tiered service with "tier 1" being supported self-management, "tier 2" generalist assessment and management in primary care, "tier 3" specialist rehabilitation or respiratory follow-up with oversight from a consultant physician and "tier 4" tertiary care for patients with complications or complex needs. In 2021, ring-fenced funding was allocated to establish 90 multidisciplinary long covid clinics in England; some clinics were also set up with local funding in Scotland and Wales. These clinics varied widely in eligibility criteria, referral pathways, staffing mix (some had no doctors at all) and investigations and treatments offered. A further policy document on improving long covid services was published in 2022; it recommended that specialist long covid clinics should continue, though the long-term funding of these services remains uncertain. To build the evidence base for delivering long covid services, major programs of publicly funded research were commenced in both UK and USA.

In short, at the time this study began (late 2021), there appeared to be much scope for a program of quality improvement which would capture fast-emerging research findings, establish evidence-based standards and ensure these were rapidly disseminated and consistently adopted across both specialist long covid services and in primary care.

### Effects of an app-based physical training for long-and post-COVID treatment (A PILOT) study: protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^11242Q2F]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Physical activity and rehabilitation in PCS

Physical inactivity has been linked to a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas greater cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a reduced likelihood of hospitalisation. For PCS patients, exercise represents a promising strategy to counteract deconditioning, improve physical performance and alleviate fatigue. Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes focusing on respiratory and muscular recovery have shown significant benefits, improving exercise capacity and reducing dyspnoea in PCS patients. However, the complex pathophysiology of PCS, characterised by symptoms like exercise intolerance and post-exertional malaise, necessitates a gradual, individualised approach to physical activity. Despite its potential benefits, standardised rehabilitation protocols for PCS are limited. The WHO highlights the importance of personalised exercise programmes tailored to patients' symptoms to restore muscle strength and endurance. In Germany, S1 guidelines recommend individualised rehabilitation, delivered in-person or via teletherapy, with continued outpatient care to sustain recovery.

Mobile health technologies, such as app-based programmes, offer scalable solutions for delivering structured rehabilitation interventions. These platforms have demonstrated efficacy in enhancing adherence to exercise programmes, improving physical activity and reducing healthcare costs in various populations, including patients with cardiovascular diseases. A study in Chile further highlighted the feasibility and benefits of telerehabilitation in COVID-19 survivors, reporting improvements in physical capacity and QoL. Nevertheless, significant variability in rehabilitation guidelines persists, as evidenced by a study mapping long-COVID strategies across the European Union, which revealed inconsistencies in addressing specific symptoms and organ systems. This underscores the pressing need for robust research to develop evidence-based exercise and rehabilitation strategies for PCS.

The app-based physical intervention for long- and post-COVID treatment (A PILOT)study aims to address this gap by evaluating the efficacy of an app-based multimodal training intervention in improving physical performance, neurocognitive function, health-related QoL (HRQoL) and mental health outcomes in PCS patients. By generating high-quality clinical evidence, this study seeks to inform the development of targeted exercise guidelines and validate app-based rehabilitation as a scalable and patient-centred solution for PCS.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113FjQVZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Challenges to delivering evidence-based management for long COVID [^1167jXYU]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

What is the current evidence for the management of long COVID?

Government, non-government organisations and academe have taken steps to support, fund and conduct research on repurposed drugs, newly developed medications and non-pharmacological interventions that may alleviate symptoms and optimise function and quality of life for patients with post COVID-19 condition; as well as disseminate research findings to raise awareness and understanding among the public and health professionals of post COVID-19 symptoms. Patient networks are also influencing the research agenda and accelerating progress in research.

Most trials recruited patients with persistent symptoms after a specific time range (usually 3 or more months since acute infection) and focused on fatigue, asthenia and respiratory symptoms. Most frequently reported outcomes included symptom improvement (usually assessed with specific scales) and health-related quality of life.

This has led to the implementation of large-scale trials, such as the US National Institutes of Health $1.5 billion RECOVER studyand the UK STIMULATE-ICP study. Due to the multiple pathogenesis and varied clinical presentations of post COVID-19 condition, medical management is vast and tailored at an individual level. This has led to the production of small-scale and large-scale clinical trials as reflected in the International Clinical Trial Registry (ICTRP). As of February 2023, 444 interventional studies and 342 observation studies on post COVID/ long COVID were registered in the ICTRP (table 1). There were 314 randomised trials from 36 countries, 81 studies testing drug interventions, 26 studies on homeopathic or supplementals, and 175 trials on non-pharmacological interventions.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### Transparency and reporting characteristics of COVID-19 randomized controlled trials [^1148TmCh]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

This study is part of the COVID-NMA initiative (PROSPERO CRD42020182600). The two first pillars of this initiative are a living mapping and living evidence synthesis of all randomized controlled trials assessing treatments and preventive interventions for COVID-19. All results are updated weekly and made available on an open access platform.

The third pillar of this initiative, which is described in this manuscript, is the monitoring of trial reports in terms of transparency and reporting (protocol on Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.5810076). Because of the context and resource constraints, the scope was reduced to trials of pharmacological treatments and to the assessment of transparency, completeness, and consistency of reporting. Because of the role of preprint in scholarly communication, we added the comparison between preprint and related peer-reviewed publication.

Study design

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials published for the treatments of COVID-19 up to May 31, 2021.

Eligibility criteria

We included RCTs assessing pharmacological treatments such as antivirals, interferons, other antimicrobials, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamins, kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, antithrombotic but also convalescent plasma, and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP).

Trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. prone positioning, physiotherapy), pharmacological treatment of long-COVID, and preventive interventions, including vaccines, were excluded. Studies that did not randomly allocate patients to a treatment arm (e.g. quasi-randomized studies, phase one trials, single-arm trials) and modeling studies of interventions for COVID-19 were also excluded. We included trials published as research articles (i.e. full report), while other publication formats (e.g. conference abstracts or comments) were excluded. We only included trials written in English.

### COVID-19 pandemic-a focused review for clinicians [^1134TLwo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant issue for global health, economics and society. A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice.

Objectives

Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.

Sources

We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects.

Content

We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.

Implications

The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density. However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians. For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.

Clinical implications

Persisting symptoms following COVID-19 pose a significant challenge to global public health, burdening healthcare systems and affected individuals. Without effective medical therapies, structured app-based multimodal training interventions represent a promising approach to managing PCS. Given the limited research on integrating exercise within multimodal training programmes for these patients, the clinical findings from this study could provide valuable insights. These insights may guide the development of evidence-based, targeted exercise prescription guidelines to alleviate persistent physical and neurocognitive impairments in PCS patients, ultimately contributing to enhanced patient outcomes and recovery trajectories.

### National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel: perspectives and lessons learned [^112YJtzt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In March 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force determined that clinicians in the United States needed expert treatment guidelines to optimally manage patients with COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a new pathogen for which no specific treatments were known to be effective.

Methods

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requested that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) take the lead in expeditiously convening a panel of experts to create "living" guidelines that would be widely accessible and capable of frequent updating as important new information became available.

Recommendations

The purpose of this article is to expand on the experiences of the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) over the past 4 years, summarize the Panel's final recommendations for COVID-19, highlight some challenges and unanswered questions about COVID-19 management, and inform future responses to public health emergencies. The Panel was formed in March 2020, and the first iteration of the guidelines was released in April 2020. Now that the public health emergency has ended, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines have sunsetted. This role will now fall to professional societies and organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the World Health Organization, all of which have been active in this area.

### Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: a narrative review [^113MDbQs]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

"Long COVID", a term coined by COVID-19 survivors, describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life.

Methods/Results

In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago.

Conclusions

Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.

More data are needed on the potential adverse effects of this medication. The evidence supporting this recommendation will be reassessed with the release of updated published information from newer trials. Outcomes had a high risk of bias so were not considered for making the recommendation.

### A multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach to chronic pain patients in the post-COVID-19 era [^112MJpdC]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The global health care system has been shaken by the unprecedented pandemic. Chronic pain management has suffered through the pandemic due to lack of access and challenges in care delivery only to be faced by a new set of chronic pain conditions resulting from prolonged and persistent COVID-19 symptoms referred to as "long COVID syndrome".

Objectives

Long COVID is emerging as a complex and debilitating condition that occurs in a subpopulation of patients following acute COVID-19 infection. Our goals were to explore how to best treat and manage long COVID syndrome based on current experience.

Methods

This is a perspective rather than a systematic review. It is based on the limited available literature and current clinical experience.

Results

Although a few pharmacological agents have been proposed to mitigate symptoms, none have emerged to provide meaningful, long-term pain relief. Long COVID is associated with numerous and diverse symptoms. Risk factors for developing long COVID subsequent to acute COVID-19 remain unknown. Due to the multidimensional impact of long COVID chronic pain, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model has been proposed to relieve pain, restore function, and maximize quality of life.

Limitations

This is a perspective with an editorial point of view rather than a systematic literature study. Long COVID syndrome is a new condition, with which no clinicians have extensive experience. This is not a systematic review so there is no Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram. This is not a clinical study so there was no need for institutional review board approvals.

Conclusions

Treatment goals for the postviral syndrome of long COVID are multifaceted. In addition to pain control, patients may have functional deficits, cognitive issues, mental health issues, and reduced quality of life. Thus, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model seems most appropriate to manage long COVID.

Key Words

Chronic pain, long COVID, pandemic, COVID-19, brain fog, fatigue, pain program, functional restoration, back pain, joint pain.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111Uxt77]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives:

Long COVID presents with symptoms that persist for weeks or months postinfection, with sleep disturbances that significantly affect quality of life. The diverse approaches to managing sleep disturbances highlight the need for comparing treatment effectiveness to improve patient outcomes. This study systematically reviews and conducts a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of current interventions for sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID and explores the underlying mechanisms and promising treatments.

Methods:

Relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search across Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data databases. The included studies focused on interventions aimed at managing patients with long COVID with sleep disturbances. Data extraction and analysis were performed, followed by a meta-analysis of comparable studies. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2.0) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.

Results:

Out of 3,352 retrieved studies, 14 were included in the systematic review and 2 in the meta-analysis. Interventions were categorized as pharmacological and nonpharmacological. Whereas most studies indicated improved sleep quality measured by standardized scales, some did not demonstrate significant benefits. The quality of evidence varied from low to moderate.

Conclusions:

The results suggest that sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID result from a complex interplay of physiological, psychological, and neurological factors. Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions show potential in managing these disturbances, with nonpharmacological approaches showing particular promise. To establish more robust evidence, more high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary in future research.

### Cost-effectiveness of the ReDIRECT / counterweight-plus weight management programme to alleviate symptoms of long COVID [^115JAJZV]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Long COVID (LC), described as persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection, places a large burden on health systems globally, with those affected suffering a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, breathlessness, cognitive dysfunction and widespread pain. Although research into treatment of LC is ongoing, there are no established interventions, other than self-management, support and information, and treatment of individual symptoms. A Bayesian meta-regression of 54 studies and two databases estimated that, of individuals surviving symptomatic episodes of COVID-19 infection, 6.2% experienced at least one LC symptom 3 months after initial infection, with 15.1% of these individuals experiencing persistent symptoms at 12 months. Studies with matched controls conducted in the UK and the Netherlands suggest its prevalence is between 6 and 12% three to six months after initial COVID-19 infection, with UK estimates suggesting 10% prevalence of symptoms up to 18 months after infection.

### Drug treatments for COVID-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113dpQ9y]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As of 23 March 2022, more than 475 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19); of these, more than six million have died. Despite global efforts to identify effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of covid-19, which have resulted in approximately 3000 trials completed or underway, evidence for effective treatment remains limited.

Summarising the rapidly growing evidence base has been a challenge. Living systematic reviews deal with the main limitation of traditional reviews — that of providing an overview of the relevant evidence only at a specific time. This is crucial in the context of covid-19, in which the best evidence is constantly changing. The ability of a living network meta-analysis to present a complete, broad, and updated view of the evidence makes it the best type of evidence synthesis to inform the development of practice recommendations. Network meta-analysis, rather than pairwise meta-analysis, provides useful information about the comparative effectiveness of treatments that have not been tested head to head. The lack of such direct comparisons is certain to limit inferences in the covid-19 setting. Moreover, the incorporation of indirect evidence can strengthen evidence in comparisons that were tested head to head.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, "80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation", and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, "50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option". Recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; "we recommend" indicates strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention", and the recommendations acknowledge the current "knowledge gap" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Clinical course: progression, management, and treatment… [^111m9dL5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Management Patients with no risk factors for severe COVID-19 may benefit from supportive care and symptomatic treatment including antipyretics, analgesics, and antitussives. Clinicians can also instruct patients on preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 symptoms that indicate additional medical attention. For patients at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, clinicians should offer antivirals to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death. Antivirals should be started within the first 5–7 days of symptom onset. If declined, patients should be closely monitored. Treatment The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir and Remdesivir for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in people at risk for severe illness.
- Remdesivir – This intravenous antiviral medication is approved by FDA for COVID-19 treatment in adults and pediatric patients.
- Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir – This oral antiviral has been approved by FDA for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for progression to severe illness.

### Drug treatments for COVID-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111P9jqd]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This living systematic review and network meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence for drug treatments of covid-19 up to 1 December 2021 and a comprehensive list of drug trials to 3 December 2021. There are now more than 400 randomised trials examining many different interventions for treating covid-19, and as a result, the certainty in evidence for multiple interventions is improved.

For patients with severe covid-19, three anti-inflammatory drugs probably reduce mortality: systemic corticosteroids, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists (when given with systemic corticosteroids), and Janus kinase inhibitors. Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists, when co-administered with systemic corticosteroids, also probably reduce mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay. When they are provided without systemic corticosteroids, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists might not reduce mortality or length of hospital stay. The subgroup effect is consistent with evidence from other meta-analyses. A single dose of either sarilumab and tocilizumab appears to be similarly efficacious.

### Evaluation of interventions for cognitive symptoms in long COVID: a randomized clinical trial [^114bWV7r]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment for cognitive dysfunction due to postacute sequelae of long COVID (ie, symptoms of fatigue, malaise, weakness, confusion that persist beyond 12 weeks after an initial COVID infection) remains a significant unmet need.

Objective

To test evidence-based rehabilitation strategies for improving cognitive symptoms in persons with long COVID.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a 5-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of 3 remotely delivered interventions conducted between August 17, 2023, and June 10, 2024. The study took place at 22 trial sites and included the screening of individuals with cognitive long COVID.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 arms: adaptive computerized cognitive training (BrainHQ [Posit Science]), cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation involving both group and individual counseling sessions (PASC-Cognitive Recovery [PASC-CoRE]) paired with BrainHQ, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with BrainHQ. Two comparator arms were included as follows: unstructured computer puzzles and games (active comparator) and sham tDCS paired with BrainHQ. The interventions occurred 5 times per week over 10 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cognitive and behavioral in-person assessments were performed at baseline, midintervention, at the end of intervention, and 3 months after the end of the intervention. The primary outcome measure was the modified Everyday Cognition Scale 2 (ECog2) completed at the end of the intervention compared to the baseline visit based on participant self-report looking back over the prior 7 days.

Results

A total of 378 individuals were screened, from which there were 328 participants (median [IQR] age, 48.0 [37.0–58.0] years; 241 female [73.5%]; race: 15 Asian [4.6%], 47 Black [14.3%], and 235 White [71.6%]; ethnicity: 52 Hispanic [15.9%]). None of the 3 active interventions demonstrated benefits on the modified ECog2 in the intention-to-treat population by the end of the intervention period. The adjusted differences in mean change were 0.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to 0.2) for BrainHQ vs active comparator, 0.1 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3) for PASC-CoRE + BrainHQ vs active comparator, 0.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to 0.2) for tDCS-active + BrainHQ vs tDCS-sham + BrainHQ, and 0.1 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3) for PASC-CoRE + BrainHQ vs BrainHQ alone. Secondary participant-reported outcomes and neuropsychological tests showed no differential benefits for any treatment arm. All 5 arms demonstrated some improvements over time on the modified ECog2 and on secondary outcomes. There were no serious adverse events attributable to the interventions.

Conclusions and Relevance

This phase 2 randomized clinical trial failed to demonstrate differential benefits for online cognitive training, a structured cognitive rehabilitation program, and tDCS for cognitive long COVID.

### Long covid-mechanisms, risk factors, and management [^114vUgnS]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, covid-19 has spread and had a profound effect on the lives and health of people around the globe. As of 4 July 2021, more than 183 million confirmed cases of covid-19 had been recorded worldwide, and 3.97 million deaths. Recent evidence has shown that a range of persistent symptoms can remain long after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is now coined long covid by recognized research institutes. Studies have shown that long covid can affect the whole spectrum of people with covid-19, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. Like acute covid-19, long covid can involve multiple organs and can affect many systems including, but not limited to, the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms of long covid include fatigue, dyspnea, cardiac abnormalities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, muscle pain, concentration problems, and headache. This review summarizes studies of the long term effects of covid-19 in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and describes the persistent symptoms they endure. Risk factors for acute covid-19 and long covid and possible therapeutic options are also discussed.

### Challenges to delivering evidence-based management for long COVID [^116xTMPQ]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Challenges and limitations

We found an overall high risk of bias due to suboptimal randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding (as well as other methodological and reporting concerns). Most RCTs were also very small in size and had small event numbers. The methods were very poor overall, and the reporting was suboptimal, making the quality of evidence weak. In general, follow-up periods were too short to provide solid evidence. Definitions for post COVID-19, long COVID remain obscure, resulting in studies having methodological and analytical limitations, especially when defining patient cohorts. It is also challenging to draw definitive broad conclusions and generalisability on therapeutic based on the data across different studies.

Designing clinical trials for long COVID remains a challenge with many symptoms that differ between patients and within the same patient (waxing and waning or new symptoms), no specific diagnostic and overlap with similar chronic diseases. There is evidence that chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and renal failure may occur with COVID-19 and the elderly population is likely to experience a varied and complicated post-acute sequalae. Further research is needed to examine long COVID and the incidence of chronic diseases.

Although the PAHO living rapid review is focused on pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, this is only one aspect of the holistic management for long COVID. Future research should be directed towards establishing standardised diagnostic biomarkers for long COVID among others. A multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach will be crucial in improving outcomes of these patients.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^112J6Lfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114rz56i]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Given the biological rationale for metformin use in covid-19, investigators have conducted several observational studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with results summarised in systematic reviews; however, these reviews have limitations. Several reviews included low quality observational studies and did not incorporate data from recent randomised controlled trials. One review of randomised controlled trials omitted a formal quantitative meta-analysis and did not adhere to current GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluations) guidance. Initial randomised controlled trials assessing intervention effects on non-severe covid-19 did not address long covid, and the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline development group (GDG) responsible for WHO covid-19 guidelines did not identify long covid as a key outcome. Additionally, previous reviews did not consider the role of metformin in preventing and treating long covid. When the metformin trial addressing long covid was published, the GDG added long covid as a key outcome for studies of treatment for non-severe covid-19. The GDG also commissioned this review to support their clinical guidelines on metformin in patients with non-severe covid-19, including long covid, a previously unaddressed outcome.

Table 1
Studies registered in ICTRP for post COVID-19 condition (as of February 2023)

Due to this rapid production of many trials and the urgency to critically appraise, synthesise and disseminate the evidence, the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) developed the 'Living rapid review for post COVID-19 interventions'. This initiative, well received by the Member States and the scientific community of the region, has become a practical and timely tool for technical cooperation. The detailed methodology including analysis and result interpretation is available from.

At the time of drafting this article, the PAHO living rapid review summarised 47 potential therapeutic options for post-acute and post COVID-19 condition from 65 RCTs. Twenty-six per cent (n = 17) of trials assessed repurposed drugs, 46% (n = 30) tested non-pharmacological interventions and 18% (n = 12) trials were on natural supplements. At present, there are no ongoing trials on newly developed drugs to address this condition.

The certainty of the evidence for most of the interventions was low or very low, which means that currently there is no drug that is proved to be effective for the management of patients with long COVID. A trial assessing 'respiratory training' which is a non-pharmaceutical intervention for patients with respiratory symptoms has a moderate certainty of evidence. We grouped the interventions according to main organ/systems affected and assessed the certainty of evidence as summarised in table 2.

Table 2
Summary of findings by affected organ/system

Although there are currently no broadly effective treatments for long COVID, treatments for certain components have been effective for subsets of populations (table 2) including symptom-specific pharmacological options. Respiratory training is the only intervention that showed important benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms due to long COVID, with moderate to high certainty. Other interventions showed promising results but with low certainty evidence, for example, Actovegin potentially addresses asthenia/fatigue and respiratory symptoms, anticoagulant regimens are a promising way to address abnormal clotting, and palmitoylethanolamide with luteolin supplements have shown promise in treating olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction. These interventions deserve further study.

### Clinical features, therapeutic outcomes, and recovery period of long COVID [^113tePYw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the outbreak of COVID‐19 in 2019, several epidemiological studies have found that COVID‐19 subsequently causes sequelae, termed long COVID, in a substantial portion of patients. In a previous study from Italy, some symptoms persisted 60 days after COVID‐19 onset in 87% of patients. Similarly, another large cohort study from China also showed that some complaints remain in 76% of patients with COVID‐19 6 months after onset. Although a majority of patients with long COVID experience highly variable persistent signs and symptoms, such as chronic cough, breathlessness, fatigue, fever, and headache, with uncertain prospects for unknown periods, reliable evidence regarding the clinical features and valid management strategies for long COVID are still lacking.

First, the diagnostic criteria for long COVID differ, depending on the country. According to a summary of UK guidelines, long COVID is separately defined as acute COVID‐19, ongoing symptomatic COVID‐19, and post‐COVID‐19 syndrome based on the duration of symptoms for up to 4 weeks, from 4 weeks to up to 12 weeks and more than 12 weeks from the onset of COVID‐19, respectively. However, the post‐COVID condition is considered in the US guidelines as persistent symptoms lasting over 4 weeks after the first infection. Moreover, a certain standard for long COVID is currently unavailable in Japan.

Compared with the investigations of COVID‐19 itself, the whole picture of long COVID, which is a multisystem disorder after an initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, is not less well understood. Therefore, the clinical course of long COVID has been unpredictable, and the ability to obtain relevant information regarding suitable approaches and a more certain future has not been feasible. In addition, the other problems of long COVID would be its low awareness and its difficulty in quantitative evaluation because the chief complaints of long COVID are mainly not objective but subjective symptoms. As a result, long COVID has already caused an untoward impact on communities, such as unfair discrimination from neighbors or retirement from a company, in addition to medical issues. In summary, an unmet medical need for a better understanding and characterization of long COVID outcomes and its multidisciplinary approach certainly exists.

### Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges [^112y4RNp]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.

Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.

### Comparison of WHO versus national COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines across the world: not exactly a perfect match [^1171ZNcX]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Publicly available COVID-19 National Guidelines vary substantially in their therapeutic recommendations. Ineffective, unaffordable and unavailable therapies are widely recommended, particularly in low-resource settings. The formalisation of processes in the development of NGs for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is essential for ensuring that these guidelines are grounded in the best available evidence. A systematic and structured approach would not only enhance the credibility of the guidelines but could also contribute to their effectiveness in guiding public health interventions, especially in a pandemic setting.

### Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guideline, 10 November 2023 [^115NRn9G]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of breathlessness, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering a combination of education and skills training on self-management strategies (such as nasal breathing and pacing approaches), and physical exercise training (in the absence of post-exertional symptom exacerbation) for the clinical rehabilitation management of breathing impairment in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition.

### Randomized trials on non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19: a scoping review [^114HZKpN]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The list of available treatments for COVID-19 remains limited, with vaccination rates plateauing in many countriesand increasing numbers of confirmed cases during the summer and autumn 2021, NPIs and their effectiveness will remain a central debate. Our analysis clearly indicates that randomised trials are generally feasible to assess the benefits and harms of NPIs during a pandemic situation, in a very short time using the most reliable method to provide reliable evidence for optimal health policy decision making. WHO is committed to improve the evidence base on effectiveness of public health and social measures, and this overview may inform further developments in this important area of evidence generation.

This study is limited as our sample relies on accurate trial registration and reporting. We cannot exclude that some NPI randomised trials might have been missed because they were not registered, and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2-infections were incorrectly or not reported in the registries. Searching the grey literature (eg, via web search engine or institutional searches) or contacting key informants outside academia could have retrieved eligible trials that were not registered nor published in an academic format. In particular, NPI trials with inconclusive results or not supporting their use may be at risk of not being published potentially causing a publication bias. Non-published results can be expected since some trials should have been completed according to their completion date given in the registry. Furthermore, we could have missed eligible trials because of our single-reviewer screening approach. However, it is unlikely that we have been unaware of pertinent major results of further NPI trials, given their substantial impact on current debates and scarcity of the evidence.

To provide continuous guidance for policy and practice, we will continuously track randomised trials assessing NPIs and provide all information on their key design characteristics and their status, freely accessible via.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of fatigue, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering a combination of education, skills training on energy conservation techniques (such as pacing approaches), and a cautious return to symptom-titrated physical exercise training (in the absence of post-exertional symptom exacerbation) for the clinical rehabilitation management of fatigue in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition. Consider providing training in the use of assistive products and environmental modifications in patients experiencing levels of fatigue limiting instrumental activities of daily living. Consider offering psychological support to support coping with the symptom.

### Outpatient management of COVID-19: rapid evidence review [^112pdBpk]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

New COVID-19 variants of concern continue to develop. Incubation period, transmissibility, immune escape, and treatment effectiveness differ by variants of concern. Physicians should be aware that the characteristics of the predominant variants of concern determine aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Multiple testing modalities exist; the most appropriate testing strategy varies depending on the clinical scenario, with factors of test sensitivity, turnaround time, and the expertise required for specimen collection. Three types of vaccines are available in the United States, and all people six months and older should be encouraged to receive one because vaccination is effective in reducing the incidence of and hospitalizations and deaths associated with COVID-19. Vaccination may also reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., long COVID). Consider medications, such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, as first-line treatment for eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 unless logistical or supply constraints occur. National Institutes of Health guidelines and local health care partner resources can be used to determine eligibility. Long-term health effects of having COVID-19 are under investigation.

### Rehabilitation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with long COVID: position statement [^115qgzmV]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Long COVID, a term used to describe ongoing symptoms after COVID-19 infection, parallels the course of other postviral syndromes. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of long COVID can be persistent and interfere with quality of life and functioning. Within the biopsychosocial framework of chronic illness, rehabilitation professionals can address the neuropsychiatric sequelae of long COVID. However, current practice models are not designed to address concurrent psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in adults living with long COVID. Thus, we present a biopsychosocial framework for long COVID and provide treatment strategies based on evidence from current literature of postviral chronic illness. These recommendations will guide rehabilitation professionals in identifying common neuropsychiatric symptoms in long COVID that can be targeted for intervention and addressing these symptoms via integrative interventions taking into account the biopsychosocial presentation of long COVID symptoms.

### Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guideline, 10 November 2023 [^111EQNTr]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of fatigue, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to assess for and manage exertional desaturation and cardiac impairment following COVID-19 before offering physical exercise training in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition. Recognize that the presence of orthostatic intolerance and post-exertional symptom exacerbation, although amenable to rehabilitation, will require interventions to be modified in view of these diagnoses for rehabilitation to be safe.

### A living WHO guideline on drugs for COVID-19 [^115KY1he]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Updates

This is the fourteenth version (thirteenth update) of the living guideline, replacing earlier versions (available as data supplements). New recommendations will be published as updates to this guideline.

Clinical Question

What is the role of drugs in the treatment of patients with covid-19?

Context

The evidence base for therapeutics for covid-19 is evolving with numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recently completed and underway. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants are changing the role of therapeutics.

What Is New?

The guideline development group (GDG) defined 1.5% as a new threshold for an important reduction in risk of hospitalisation in patients with non-severe covid-19. Combined with updated baseline risk estimates, this resulted in stratification into patients at low, moderate, and high risk for hospitalisation. New recommendations were added for moderate risk of hospitalisation for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and for moderate and low risk of hospitalisation for molnupiravir and remdesivir. New pharmacokinetic evidence was included for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir, supporting existing recommendations for patients at high risk of hospitalisation. The recommendation for ivermectin in patients with non-severe illness was updated in light of additional trial evidence which reduced the high degree of uncertainty informing previous guidance. A new recommendation was made against the antiviral agent VV116 for patients with non-severe and with severe or critical illness outside of randomised clinical trials based on one RCT comparing the drug with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The structure of the guideline publication has also been changed; recommendations are now ordered by severity of covid-19.

About This Guideline

This living guideline from the World Health Organization (WHO) incorporates new evidence to dynamically update recommendations for covid-19 therapeutics. The GDG typically evaluates a therapy when the WHO judges sufficient evidence is available to make a recommendation. While the GDG takes an individual patient perspective in making recommendations, it also considers resource implications, acceptability, feasibility, equity, and human rights. This guideline was developed according to standards and methods for trustworthy guidelines, making use of an innovative process to achieve efficiency in dynamic updating of recommendations. The methods are aligned with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development and according to a pre-approved protocol (planning proposal) by the Guideline Review Committee (GRC). A box at the end of the article outlines key methodological aspects of the guideline process. MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation provides methodological support, including the coordination of living systematic reviews with network meta-analyses to inform the recommendations. The full version of the guideline is available online in MAGICapp and in PDF on the WHO website, with a summary version here in The BMJ. These formats should facilitate adaptation, which is strongly encouraged by WHO to contextualise recommendations in a healthcare system to maximise impact.

Future Recommendations

Recommendations on anticoagulation are planned for the next update to this guideline. Updated data regarding systemic corticosteroids, azithromycin, favipiravir and umefenovir for non-severe illness, and convalescent plasma and statin therapy for severe or critical illness, are planned for review in upcoming guideline iterations.

### Comparison of WHO versus national COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines across the world: not exactly a perfect match [^111eHqYb]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

As a consequence, there has been substantial variation between countries in their COVID-19 treatment recommendations. Different conclusions derived from the same evidence, different timing of treatment guideline development, lack of evidence in early infections, lack of pharmacometric evaluation, lack of comparative information, the high cost of new therapeutics and political pressures have all contributed to the heterogeneity in guidance observed between countries.

WHO has regularly updated its 'living' COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines, making this recommendation on the basis of a standardised review of the latest evidence. With some exceptions, its recommendations have been delineated by disease severity.

Many countries, particularly in low-resource settings, rely on guidance from WHO to develop and update their infectious diseases national treatment guidelines. We reviewed WHO member state national guidelines (NGs) for COVID-19 treatment and compared them to the WHO therapeutic guidelines.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1176iEkQ]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Implications for practice and research

The findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis will inform the WHO clinical practice guideline on metformin in patients with non-severe covid-19. Because the only finding suggesting a beneficial effect of metformin is the reduction in long covid, and that finding is informed by low certainty evidence from a single trial, more randomised trials are needed to provide definitive evidence. Future randomised controlled trials should aim to include larger and more diverse populations to ensure broader applicability of findings. Studies should prioritise enrolling patients admitted to hospital and those who have been vaccinated because these groups are underrepresented in existing randomised controlled trials. Establishing a consistent diagnostic approach and a standardised definition for long covid would strengthen outcome assessment and comparability across studies. Additional research into the mechanisms through which metformin might affect viral dynamics and inflammatory responses could further clarify its role in long covid and as an adjunct treatment in covid-19. Future research addressing these gaps might provide more substantial evidence to guide clinical practice and optimise the use of metformin in managing patients with covid-19.

Conclusions

Low certainty evidence suggests that metformin might have little or no impact on mortality when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection. The effects of metformin on admission to hospital remain uncertain, and it shows little or no difference in adverse effects leading to discontinuation. Metformin might reduce incidence of long covid when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection, but this was suggested by low certainty evidence from a single trial. Further research is required to establish the impact of metformin on long covid.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115iuAbe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the available interventions for managing sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID. Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions demonstrate varying effectiveness, with an emphasis on nonpharmacological approaches. Although definitive evidence was limited due to sample size constraints, potential treatments identified set the direction for future research. As treatment strategies for long COVID evolve, these findings enhance the understanding of the condition and improve patient outcomes.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1158hfNx]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Certainty of evidence assessment

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We made judgments of imprecision using the minimally important difference as a threshold and therefore rated certainty for each outcome in an important or unimportant effect. The corresponding WHO GDG decided and agreed on the following minimally important differences to inform therapeutic recommendations for patients with non-severe covid-19: mortality — 3 per 1000; mechanical ventilation — 15 per 1000; admission to hospital — 15 per 1000; adverse effects leading to discontinuation — 15 per 1000; patients with long covid — 20 per 1000; duration of hospital stay — 1 day; time to symptom resolution — 1 day.

Reviewers rated the certainty of outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. As fewer than 10 studies are included in the pooled estimate, we could not assess publication bias statistically. However, our search strategy included several databases, trial registries, and preprint repositories to capture published and unpublished studies, reducing the likelihood of missing relevant trials. Therefore, our approach reduces the risk of publication bias, but does not rule it out. We used standardised lay language to interpret and communicate the results, reflecting the level of certainty in the evidence.

Patient and public involvement

Patients were part of the WHO guideline development group and were involved in the outcome selection and generation of WHO recommendations, and therefore, in the outcome selection for this systematic review. On publication, the findings of the review will be disseminated to relevant patients and the public.

Introduction

Long- and post-COVID syndrome (PCS)

Long-COVID and PCS pose significant challenges to global public health. With an estimated incidence of 10% among the over 651 million documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least 65 million individuals are affected worldwide. This prevalence is likely underestimated due to diagnostic limitations and underreporting.PCS encompasses many persistent symptoms affecting the cardiovascular, nervous, immune, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems. These symptoms are not limited by age, sex or baseline health status, underscoring the universal vulnerability to this condition. Commonly reported symptoms include persistent fatigue (37.2%) and neurocognitive impairments (31.2%), as shown in the Epidemiology of Long COVID (EPILOC) study. Approximately 30% of patients experience symptoms lasting 6 months or more, including respiratory complaints, reduced lung function and a general decline in physical performance and quality of life (QoL). Cardiovascular symptoms, such as increased resting heart rate, episodic flushing and newly diagnosed hypertension, are also frequent. These chronic symptoms may result from exacerbating pre-existing conditions or inflammatory responses driven by immune dysregulation. The significant health and functional impairments associated with PCS highlight the urgent need for effective diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies to mitigate its long-term impact on individuals and society.

### COVID-19 drug discovery and treatment options [^115zAruS]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, and serious social and economic disruptions worldwide. Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated older individuals with underlying diseases are especially prone to severe disease. In patients with non-fatal disease, long COVID affecting multiple body systems may persist for months. Unlike SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which have either been mitigated or remained geographically restricted, SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated globally and is likely to continue circulating in humans with possible emergence of new variants that may render vaccines less effective. Thus, safe, effective and readily available COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. In this Review, we summarize the major drug discovery approaches, preclinical antiviral evaluation models, representative virus-targeting and host-targeting therapeutic options, and key therapeutics currently in clinical use for COVID-19. Preparedness against future coronavirus pandemics relies not only on effective vaccines but also on broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved viral components or universal host targets, and new therapeutics that can precisely modulate the immune response during infection.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1162akLL]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Long COVID presents with symptoms that persist for weeks or months post-infection, with sleep disturbances significantly affecting quality of life. The diverse approaches to managing sleep disturbances highlight the need for comparing treatment effectiveness to improve patient outcomes. This study systematically reviews and conducts a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of current interventions for sleep disturbances in long COVID patients, and explores the underlying mechanisms and promising treatments.

Methods

Relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search across Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data databases. The included studies focused on interventions aimed at managing long COVID patients with sleep disturbances. Data extraction and analysis were performed, followed by a meta-analysis of comparable studies. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2.0) and the GRADE system.

Results

Out of 3,352 retrieved studies, 14 were included in the systematic review, and two in the meta-analysis. Interventions were categorized as pharmacological and non-pharmacological. While most studies indicated improved sleep quality measured by standardized scales, some did not demonstrate significant benefits. The quality of evidence varied from low to moderate.

Conclusions

The results suggest that sleep disturbances in long COVID result from a complex interplay of physiological, psychological, and neurological factors. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions show potential in managing these disturbances, with non-pharmacological approaches showing particular promise. To establish more robust evidence, more high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary in future research.

### Lessons learned from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies: critical perspectives from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 treatment guideline panel [^115J4Lwq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the challenges of the pandemic, there has been substantial progress with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies. Pivotal COVID-19 trials like SOLIDARITY, RECOVERY, and ACCT-1 were rapidly conducted and data disseminated to support effective therapies. However, critical shortcomings remain on trial conduct, dissemination and interpretation of study results, and regulatory guidance in pandemic settings. The lessons that we learned have implications for both the current pandemic and future emerging infectious diseases. There is a need for establishing and standardizing clinical meaningful outcomes in therapeutic trials and for targeting defined populations and phenotypes that will most benefit from specific therapies. Standardized processes should be established for rapid and critical data review and dissemination to ensure scientific integrity. Clarity around the evidence standards needed for issuance of both emergency use authorization (EUA) and biologic license application (BLA) should be established and an infrastructure for executing rapid trials in epidemic settings maintained.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

Executive summary — interpretation of recommendation strength and clinical-trial use policy states that, per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", and that "recommend" indicates strong recommendations while "suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. It also notes that when promising interventions were judged to have insufficient evidence of benefit with potential appreciable harms or costs, the expert panel recommended their use in the context of a clinical trial, acknowledging the current "knowledge gap" and aiming at avoiding premature favorable recommendations for potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Long COVID: rapid evidence review [^113JDxja]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — convalescent plasma use in patients with limited options: For those with disease who have no other treatment options, the IDSA guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset rather than no high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty of evidence). Other options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir; patient-specific factors and logistical considerations should drive agent choice, and data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting. Remarks note that in the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) only authorizes use in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment, and that patients, particularly those who are not immunocompromised, who place a low value on uncertain benefits and a high value on avoiding possible adverse events would reasonably decline convalescent plasma. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### Association of nirmatrelvir for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection with subsequent long COVID symptoms in an observational cohort study [^115hzYNc]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is approved as treatment for acute COVID-19, but the effect of treatment during acute infection on risk of Long COVID is unknown. We hypothesized that nirmatrelvir treatment during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces risk of developing Long COVID and rebound after treatment is associated with Long COVID. We conducted an observational cohort study within the Covid Citizen Science (CCS) study, an online cohort study with over 100000 participants. We included vaccinated, nonhospitalized, nonpregnant individuals who reported their first SARS-CoV-2 positive test March-August 2022. Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was ascertained during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient-reported Long COVID symptoms, symptom rebound and test-positivity rebound were asked on subsequent surveys at least 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 4684 individuals met the eligibility criteria, of whom 988 (21.1%) were treated and 3696 (78.9%) were untreated; 353/988 (35.7%) treated and 1258/3696 (34.0%) untreated responded to the Long COVID survey (n = 1611). Among 1611 participants, median age was 55 years and 66% were female. At 5.4 ± 1.3 months after infection, nirmatrelvir treatment was not associated with subsequent Long COVID symptoms (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80–1.64; p = 0.45). Among 666 treated who answered rebound questions, rebound symptoms or test positivity were not associated with Long COVID symptoms (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 0.74–2.41; p = 0.33). Within this cohort of vaccinated, nonhospitalized individuals, oral nirmatrelvir treatment during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and rebound after nirmatrelvir treatment were not associated with Long COVID symptoms more than 90 days after infection.

### Developing treatment guidelines during a pandemic health crisis: lessons learned from COVID-19 [^115tU3SM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The development of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines began in March 2020 in response to a request from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Within 4 days of the request, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel was established and the first meeting took place (virtually-as did subsequent meetings). The Panel comprises 57 individuals representing 6 governmental agencies, 11 professional societies, and 33 medical centers, plus 2 community members, who have worked together to create and frequently update the guidelines on the basis of evidence from the most recent clinical studies available. The initial version of the guidelines was completed within 2 weeks and posted online on 21 April 2020. Initially, sparse evidence was available to guide COVID-19 treatment recommendations. However, treatment data rapidly accrued based on results from clinical studies that used various study designs and evaluated different therapeutic agents and approaches. Data have continued to evolve at a rapid pace, leading to 24 revisions and updates of the guidelines in the first year. This process has provided important lessons for responding to an unprecedented public health emergency: Providers and stakeholders are eager to access credible, current treatment guidelines; governmental agencies, professional societies, and health care leaders can work together effectively and expeditiously; panelists from various disciplines, including biostatistics, are important for quickly developing well-informed recommendations; well-powered randomized clinical trials continue to provide the most compelling evidence to guide treatment recommendations; treatment recommendations need to be developed in a confidential setting free from external pressures; development of a user-friendly, web-based format for communicating with health care providers requires substantial administrative support; and frequent updates are necessary as clinical evidence rapidly emerges.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113P1VF3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.
