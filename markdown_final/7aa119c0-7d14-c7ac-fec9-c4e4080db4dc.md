## Question

Viral pneumonia symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of viral pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and how it overlaps with bacterial pneumonia. Then, I should verify the most common respiratory and systemic symptoms across age groups. Next, I will consider age-specific nuances, including pediatric and elderly presentations. After that, I need to check for red flags and complications that warrant urgent care. Finally, I will integrate the role of co-infections and the limits of clinical differentiation, and close with practical takeaways anchored to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Viral pneumonia is an infection of the lower respiratory tract with alveolar involvement, and its symptoms overlap substantially with bacterial pneumonia, making etiologic distinction at the bedside challenging without testing or integrated clinical-imaging-lab data, so I should not overstate any supposedly "pathognomonic" features without evidence [^59fb094b] [^cfbbdc38].

> I will now examine the universal respiratory symptoms. Cough is consistently present and often prominent, frequently accompanied by dyspnea or shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, with tachypnea and abnormal lung exam findings such as crackles supporting a lower tract process. These features are repeatedly emphasized in pediatric and adult guidance and are consistent with population-based pneumonia studies, so I can treat these as core manifestations across ages [^5ce9135f] [^a7110357] [^2896a2a8].

> Next, I should review systemic features. Fever or chills are common, though not universal, and may be lower grade in some viral etiologies. Fatigue and malaise are frequent, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea occur in a meaningful minority, particularly in children and with certain viruses like SARS-CoV-2. I need to ensure I note that absence of fever does not exclude viral pneumonia, especially in older adults or the immunocompromised [^39b74e8b] [^8099f205] [^f957f47a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity. I should confirm red flags and complications that mandate urgent evaluation: hypoxemia or SpO2 less than about 94–95%, altered mental status, persistent chest pain, severe dyspnea, hemodynamic instability, and signs of respiratory failure or ARDS. These are consistently flagged in emergency care guidance and reviews of severe viral pneumonia, including influenza and COVID-19, and should trigger escalation without delay [^8099f205] [^95de0279] [^cb382e03].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific features. In children, tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring, retractions, and hypoxia are key markers of pneumonia, and viral etiologies predominate, especially RSV in younger children. I should double-check that wheeze is common in viral disease and that chest radiography is recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain, hypoxemia is present, or there is failure to improve, which aligns with primary care and pediatric guidance [^a7110357] [^a8dd1272].

> Now, I need to check elderly and immunocompromised presentations. In older adults, atypical features are more common, including minimal fever, subtle mental status changes, and blunted inflammatory responses, so I should maintain a low threshold to image and test. Immunocompromised hosts may have rapidly progressive disease with subtle early symptoms and higher risks for pathogens like CMV or adenovirus, reinforcing the need for early molecular testing and imaging when suspicion is moderate to high [^9772ce99] [^55e13d91].

> But wait, what if this is a mixed viral-bacterial infection. I should confirm that co-infections are common and worsen outcomes; influenza in particular predisposes to secondary bacterial pneumonia, often Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, and clinical deterioration after initial improvement should prompt reassessment for bacterial superinfection. This is why guidelines often recommend initial antibacterial therapy for influenza-associated CAP even when a virus is confirmed, with de-escalation if bacterial infection is excluded and the patient stabilizes [^cb382e03] [^70ecc6b6] [^f4368e9d].

> I should double-check the limits of clinical differentiation. No single symptom or sign reliably distinguishes viral from bacterial pneumonia, and even experienced clinicians have only modest diagnostic accuracy without integrated data. Biomarkers like CRP and procalcitonin can assist but lack perfect discrimination, and emerging host-response signatures show promise but are not yet ready for routine care, so I need to emphasize that diagnosis remains probabilistic and context-driven rather than categorical [^c460d385] [^ac622245] [^b91aa2c5].

> Let me synthesize a practical symptom profile. Typical viral pneumonia presents with cough, dyspnea, and often fever, accompanied by fatigue and sometimes GI symptoms. On exam, tachypnea, crackles, and hypoxemia may be present. In children, add grunting, retractions, and wheeze. In severe disease, expect progressive dyspnea, chest pain, confusion, and signs of respiratory failure. I should confirm that this synthesis aligns with CDC summaries, CHEST/IDSA guidance, and high-quality reviews, which it does [^39b74e8b] [^5ce9135f] [^59fb094b].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are actionable. Suspect viral pneumonia in patients with compatible respiratory and systemic symptoms, especially during viral seasons or outbreaks. Do not rely on any single feature to exclude it. Use pulse oximetry to screen for hypoxemia. And tailor testing and treatment to severity, age, and host factors, recognizing that early recognition of hypoxemia and complications improves outcomes, while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics when bacterial disease is unlikely and the patient is stable [^95de0279] [^5ce9135f] [^e912a650].

Viral pneumonia presents with **cough, dyspnea, and fever** as the most common symptoms, often accompanied by fatigue, malaise, and chest discomfort [^39b74e8b] [^59fb094b]. Additional features may include sore throat, nasal congestion, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [^8099f205]. In severe cases, patients may develop **hypoxemia, respiratory distress, or altered mental status**, particularly in older adults or those with underlying conditions [^95de0279] [^9772ce99]. Clinical features alone cannot reliably distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia, so diagnosis should integrate symptoms with epidemiology, imaging, and laboratory testing [^cfbbdc38] [^5a1f6b3d].

## Common symptoms of viral pneumonia

Viral pneumonia typically presents with the following **respiratory and systemic symptoms**:

| **Symptom category** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory symptoms | - Cough (dry or productive) [^39b74e8b] <br/> - Dyspnea (shortness of breath) [^5ce9135f] <br/> - Chest pain or discomfort (especially with coughing or deep breathing) [^39b74e8b] <br/> - Tachypnea (rapid breathing) [^a7110357] <br/> - Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea [^8099f205] <br/> - Sore throat [^8099f205] |
| Systemic symptoms | - Fever or chills [^39b74e8b] <br/> - Fatigue and malaise [^39b74e8b] <br/> - Myalgia (muscle aches) [^8099f205] <br/> - Headache [^8099f205] <br/> - Loss of appetite [^8099f205] |
| Gastrointestinal symptoms | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea [^39b74e8b] |

---

## Severe symptoms and complications

In more severe cases, viral pneumonia can lead to **significant respiratory compromise and systemic complications**, including:

- **Hypoxemia**: Low oxygen saturation levels, often requiring supplemental oxygen [^95de0279].
- **Respiratory distress**: Severe dyspnea, use of accessory muscles, and signs of respiratory failure [^8099f205].
- **Altered mental status**: Confusion, lethargy, or delirium, particularly in older adults [^39b74e8b].
- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: A life-threatening condition characterized by severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure [^cb382e03].
- **Secondary bacterial infections**: Particularly with influenza, increasing severity and mortality [^cb382e03].

---

## Variability in symptoms based on patient factors

The presentation of viral pneumonia varies with **age, immune status, and comorbidities**:

- **Children**: More likely to present with wheezing, nasal congestion, and gastrointestinal symptoms; RSV is a common pathogen [^a7110357] [^600c1949].
- **Elderly**: May present with atypical symptoms such as confusion, minimal cough, or absence of fever [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of severe disease, atypical pathogens (e.g. CMV), and prolonged recovery [^55e13d91].

---

## Comparison with bacterial pneumonia

Viral pneumonia shares many symptoms with bacterial pneumonia, making clinical differentiation challenging. However, certain features may suggest a **viral etiology**:

- **Gradual onset**: Viral pneumonia often has a more gradual onset compared to the abrupt presentation typical of bacterial pneumonia [^notfound].
- **Upper respiratory symptoms**: Nasal congestion, sore throat, and wheezing are more common in viral pneumonia [^notfound].
- **Lower inflammatory markers**: Viral pneumonia typically shows lower C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin levels compared to bacterial pneumonia [^f54b08f4].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the overlap in clinical presentation, diagnosis of viral pneumonia relies on a **combination of clinical assessment, epidemiological context, imaging, and laboratory testing**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and physical examination to identify characteristic symptoms and risk factors [^5ce9135f].
- **Chest radiography**: Often shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates, though findings are nonspecific and overlap with bacterial pneumonia [^55e13d91].
- **Laboratory testing**: PCR-based respiratory viral panels are the gold standard for identifying viral pathogens [^98002877].
- **Biomarkers**: CRP and procalcitonin may help differentiate bacterial from viral pneumonia, though no single biomarker is definitive [^f54b08f4].

---

## Conclusion

Viral pneumonia commonly presents with **cough, dyspnea, and fever**, often accompanied by fatigue, malaise, and chest discomfort. Severe cases may involve hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and altered mental status. Because symptoms overlap with bacterial pneumonia, diagnosis should integrate clinical features with epidemiology, imaging, and laboratory testing to guide appropriate management [^cfbbdc38].

### Radiographic and CT features of viral pneumonia [^438e3494]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Viruses are the most common causes of respiratory infection. The imaging findings of viral pneumonia are diverse and overlap with those of other nonviral infectious and inflammatory conditions. However, identification of the underlying viral pathogens may not always be easy. There are a number of indicators for identifying viral pathogens on the basis of imaging patterns, which are associated with the pathogenesis of viral infections. Viruses in the same viral family share a similar pathogenesis of pneumonia, and the imaging patterns have distinguishable characteristics. Although not all cases manifest with typical patterns, most typical imaging patterns of viral pneumonia can be classified according to viral families. Although a definite diagnosis cannot be achieved on the basis of imaging features alone, recognition of viral pneumonia patterns may aid in differentiating viral pathogens, thus reducing the use of antibiotics. Recently, new viruses associated with recent outbreaks including human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus have been discovered. The imaging findings of these emerging pathogens have been described in a few recent studies. This review focuses on the radiographic and computed tomographic patterns of viral pneumonia caused by different pathogens, including new pathogens. Clinical characteristics that could affect imaging, such as patient age and immune status, seasonal variation and community outbreaks, and pathogenesis, are also discussed. The first goal of this review is to indicate that there are imaging features that should raise the possibility of viral infections. Second, to help radiologists differentiate viral infections, viruses in the same viridae that have similar pathogenesis and can have similar imaging characteristics are shown. By considering both the clinical and radiologic characteristics, radiologists can suggest the diagnosis of viral pneumonia. © RSNA, 2018.

### Radiological, epidemiological and clinical patterns of pulmonary viral infections [^ef4ab550]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Respiratory viruses are the most common causes of acute respiratory infections. However, identification of the underlying viral pathogen may not always be easy. Clinical presentations of respiratory viral infections usually overlap and may mimic those of diseases caused by bacteria. However, certain imaging morphologic patterns may suggest a particular viral pathogen as the cause of the infection. Although definitive diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of clinical or imaging features alone, the use of a combination of clinical and radiographic findings can substantially improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to present the clinical, epidemiological and radiological patterns of lower respiratory tract viral pathogens providing a comprehensive approach for their diagnosis and identification in hospitals and community outbreaks.

### The evolving burden of viruses in pneumonia [^5a1f6b3d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the evolving microbiology of various forms of pneumonia and the importance of viruses as etiologic causes of pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Multiple studies utilizing novel diagnostic modalities demonstrate that the prevalence of viruses as causes for pneumonia varies from approximately 10–30% depending on the specific pneumonia type evaluated. Viral pneumonias appear similar in presentation and severity of illness to bacterial causes of pulmonary infection. Clinical criteria do not reliably allow the differentiation of viral from bacterial causes in pneumonia.

Summary

Viruses represent a pool of important culprit organisms in pneumonia and identification of a viral pathogen may facilitate attempts at antibiotic stewardship.

### Atypical pneumonia – time to breathe new life into a useful term? [^a72ba65c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

The term atypical pneumonia was originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia. It is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens, or to a distinct clinical syndrome the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the use of atypical pneumonia is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, and of dubious scientific merit. We need to return to the original meaning of atypical pneumonia and restrict its use to describe pneumonia that is truly unusual in clinical presentation, epidemiology, or both.

### Viral pneumonia [^cfbbdc38]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.

In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in China and all over the world now. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.

### Viral and bacterial co-infection in pneumonia: do we know enough to improve clinical care? [^f4368e9d]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Both bacterial and viral pneumonia are well accepted entities; however, with evolving diagnostics there has been increasing interest in the pathogenesis, epidemiology, presentation, and prognosis of viral pneumonias. In addition, the concept of viral and bacterial co-infections in pneumonia is an area of growing research and may be best recognized among patients with influenza who develop secondary bacterial infections; there was particular interest in this after the 2009 pandemic. However, in the setting of increasing molecular diagnostics, particularly multiplex PCR platforms, there is an opportunity to better define the epidemiology of co-infections and their impact on clinical diagnosis and patient outcomes. There is some evidence that dual infection may worsen patient outcome, including severity of disease and mortality. With this in mind, the article by Voiriot et al. "Viral–bacterial coinfection affects the presentation and alters the prognosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia", adds to our expanding knowledge base in this arena.

### Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children [^eebc72b6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Empiric use of antibiotics remains as cornerstone of treating pneumonia in the absence of effective point-of-care diagnostics for differentiating bacterial from viral infection. Many children who have viral pneumonia will continue to receive antibiotics without benefit. Early reliable detection of viral pneumonia, or early exclusion of bacterial pneumonia, could reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy, thereby mitigating the risk of emerging antibiotic resistance. While we have been unable to identify a single biomarker or clinical feature that could be used to confidently distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia, our findings suggest there may be utility in more sophisticated algorithms that integrate a number of clinical, microbiological, inflammatory biomarker, or radiological factors to improve pneumonia diagnostics and better targeting therapies.

### Influenza and viral pneumonia [^cfe2b72d]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Influenza and other respiratory viruses are commonly identified in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia. Clinically, it is difficult to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. Similarly, the radiological findings of viral infection are in general nonspecific. The advent of polymerase chain reaction testing has enormously facilitated the identification of respiratory viruses, which has important implications for infection control measures and treatment. Currently, treatment options for patients with viral infection are limited but there is ongoing research on the development and clinical testing of new treatment regimens and strategies.

### Do specific virus-bacteria pairings drive clinical outcomes of pneumonia? [^2032b588]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia is a common contributor to severe outcomes of influenza. Epidemiological data suggest that the incidence, severity and associated bacterial pathogens differ between epidemics and by geographical location within epidemics. Data from animal models demonstrate that differences in both viral and bacterial strains alter the incidence and outcomes of pneumonia. For influenza viruses, evolutionary changes to specific virulence factors appear to alter the ability of viruses within particular lineages to prime the host for secondary bacterial infection. Although bacterial strains differ considerably in disease potential in the setting of viral co-infection, the bacterial virulence factors underlying this finding are currently unknown. The hypothesis that geographical variation exists in the prevalence of bacterial strains expressing factors that enable efficient disease potentiation during viral epidemics should be considered as one explanation for regional differences in severity. This would have implications for surveillance, vaccine development, and the conduct of clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of pneumonia.

### Atypical pneumonia: definition, causes, and imaging features [^08986826]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is among the most common causes of death worldwide. The epidemiologic and clinical heterogeneity of pneumonia results in challenges in diagnosis and treatment. There is inconsistency in the definition of the group of microorganisms that cause "atypical pneumonia". Nevertheless, the use of this term in the medical and radiologic literature is common. Among the causes of community-acquired pneumonia, atypical bacteria are responsible for approximately 15% of cases. Zoonotic and nonzoonotic bacteria, as well as viruses, have been considered among the causes of atypical pneumonia in a patient who is immunocompetent and have been associated with major community outbreaks of respiratory infection, with relevant implications in public health policies. Considering the difficulty of isolating atypical microorganisms and the significant overlap in clinical manifestations, a targeted empirical therapy is not possible. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of atypical pneumonia, as in many cases its findings may first suggest the possibility of an atypical infection. Clarifying and unifying the definition of atypical pneumonia among the medical community, including radiologists, are of extreme importance. The prompt diagnosis and prevention of community spread of some atypical microorganisms can have a relevant impact on local, regional, and global health policies. © RSNA, 2021.

6 DIAGNOSIS

Although a good contact history, systemic symptoms, and radiographic changes of pneumonia make the diagnosis likely, the laboratory diagnosis is more reliable. Real time‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions. During COVID‐19 transmission events, RT‐PCR has served as the primary clinical laboratory diagnostic test. Success of these tests are very important to understand the viral kinetics and tissue tropism found in COVID‐19 cases. Several specific and sensitive assays targeting RdRP, N, and E genes of the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome were designed to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens. Lower respiratory tract samples provide the higher viral loads. The sampling source or operation may affect RT‐PCR testing results.

The positive rate of RT‐PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be about 60% in early stage of COVID‐19. These findings suggested that the result of RT‐PCR should be interpret with caution. One study investigated the diagnostic value and consistency of chest computed tomography (CT) compared with RT‐PCR test in 1014 patients with suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The results suggest that the sensitivity of chest CT in suspected patients was 97% based on positive RT‐PCR result and 75% based on negative RT‐PCR results. These findings indicated that chest CT is a sensitive modality to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

During the COVID‐19 epidemic in China, 10 567 patients were diagnosed as clinical diagnosed cases. This designation is being used in Hubei province, where is the worst affected area in China. In these cases, no RT‐PCR test was performed but diagnosis was made based on typical symptoms, exposure history, and chest CT manifestations consistent with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Under this criteria, 10 567 cases were diagnosed and isolated. This strategy quarantined a large number of suspected people and protected the healthy people to the most extent. On the basis of experiences above, we strongly recommend that the criteria of clinical diagnosed cases based on the symptoms, exposure history, and typical manifestations on chest CT imaging should be used in COVID‐19 affected areas that are in shortage of RT‐PCR testing kits to control the COVID‐19 epidemic.

### Pneumonia [^59fb094b]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that affects the alveoli and distal airways; it is a major health problem and associated with high morbidity and short-term and long-term mortality in all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children of < 5 years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. Development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance will improve the management of pneumonia.

### Management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [^4f8c94e1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has rapidly spread throughout the world since December 2019 to become a global public health emergency for the elevated deaths and hospitalizations in Intensive Care Units. The severity spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to severe clinical conditions. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 disease is correlated with multiple factors including host characteristics (genetics, immune status, age, and general health), viral load and, above all, the host distribution of the airways and lungs of the viral receptor cells. In this review, we will briefly summarize the current knowledge of the characteristics and management of coronavirus disease 2019-pneumonia. However, other studies are needed to better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms induced by SARS-Cov-2 infection, and to evaluate the long-term consequences of the virus on the lungs.

Introduction

Despite advancements in critical care and antimicrobial development, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) continues to be a significant source of infectious illness worldwide. In the USA, pneumonia is the eighth-leading cause of death overall and the number one cause of death from infectious disease. The signs and symptoms associated with CAP are highly variable, often impacted by the causative organism and patient variables. Appropriate antibiotic treatment requires confirmation of an infectious aetiology, followed by the pathogen class (eg, bacterial, viral, atypical bacterial) and ideally, the pathogen itself. Traditionally, pathogen identification has required culturing the whole organism from a patient sample. Non-culture diagnostics, such as the pneumococcal urinary antigen test and syndromic respiratory panels, improve the ability to identify possible CAP aetiologies. However, these pathogen-detection approaches are limited in their clinical sensitivity or specificity, depending on the test. Even after exhaustive microbiological testing, as many as 62% of patients with CAP have no identified pathogen.

Fortunately, appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy can be selected based on the class of aetiological organism (typical bacteria, atypical bacteria or virus) rather than the specific pathogen. Given limitations in pathogen detection tests, the host response is an alternative diagnostic approach that allows the pneumonia aetiology to be categorised into broad, clinically relevant groups. Procalcitonin is the most well-described host response biomarker and has been extensively studied for the discrimination of bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections. However, it has poor sensitivity and specificity particularly when atypical bacterial aetiologies are considered.

Gene expression profiling is another approach to characterising the host response. This holistic view of gene expression offers insights into the cellular processes associated with specific biological states and can be used to generate signatures of that disease. This approach has been used extensively to understand the host response to various infectious diseases such as sepsis, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections (ARI), dengue and malaria among others. In this study, we leveraged large scale gene expression analyses to prospectively classify typical, atypical and viral pneumonia. We began with murine models of pneumonia to develop gene expression signatures of the host response to typical bacterial pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae), atypical bacterial pneumonia (Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and viral pneumonia (influenza H1N1). We then validated our findings in publicly available human gene expression data from patients with known bacterial and viral pneumonias.

### Viral pneumonia [^41f014f7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has traditionally focused little on viral causes, and few studies have done an extensive and appropriate evaluation for viral cause. The purpose of the present article is to review several issues of viral infection in CAP in light of recent studies that included exhaustive evaluation of viruses.

Recent Findings

The introduction of better quality diagnostic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, have markedly improved our ability to detect multiple viral pathogens. With these diagnostic tools, a viral cause can be established in more than half of patients with CAP. Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus are the most frequent causes of viral pneumonia followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and influenza. Although some clinical findings have been more frequent with viral infection, no clear-cut clinical signs have been shown to be predictive of specific cause. Of more interest is the association of mixed virus-bacteria infection with poorer severity scores found in some studies. The diagnostic approach with new techniques should be taken for a true estimation of viral infection in epidemiologic studies. Unfortunately, there are no other licensed antivirals or vaccines against the large variety of clinically important respiratory viruses with the notable exception of influenza.

Summary

Given the high rate of viral infection in CAP and its probable association with poorer prognosis in mixed virus-bacteria infection, an extensive evaluation for virus in some populations seems appropriate. These findings can be useful for a more appropriate management of these patients.

### Improving the early identification of COVID-19 pneumonia: a narrative review [^95de0279]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 causes a self-limiting viral infection in the majority of patients. Cough, sore throat, headache, myalgia, fever and other cold/influenza like symptoms are typical, and symptoms begin to resolve within a few days (although cough can persist longer). In some, the illness progresses to a Lower Respiratory Tract Infection, and this is typified as viral pneumonia.

Time to hospital care in viral pneumonia is known to dictate outcome. Patients who present late have a longer hospital stay, increased ICU requirement and a higher mortality. The same is true for other pneumonias.

There are many reasons for an improved outcome with earlier inpatient care. Basic supportive care will include bed rest, appropriate hydration, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, medication review, early identification of complications (pulmonary embolism, acute kidney injury and secondary bacterial pneumonia and sepsis) and the commencement of oxygen at or soon after the onset of hypoxia.

The early identification and correction of hypoxia is likely one of the key determinants of disease progression. A recent study (n = 35 000) demonstrated a substantive mortality benefit when patients spent the majority of time in the optimal oxygen saturations of 94%–98%. Indeed, there was a 50% mortality saving when patients were in the optimum range for 80% of the time versus only 40% of the time. One may potentially infer that patients with COVID-19 left hypoxic at home carry a diminishing chance of survival.

Hypoxia (SpO 2 < 95%) has numerous adverse health effects. In the acute setting, hypoxia increases the risk of fatal arrhythmia and end-organ damage. In a subacute setting, hypoxia has been shown to drive pulmonary inflammation and the systemic inflammatory responseand to promote coagulation leading to an increase in thromboembolic events. Long-term effects of hypoxia include ongoing cognitive impairment.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^b3972897]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The framework that we have discussed for the early recognition of patients with SARS is based upon the knowledge and experience gathered during the recent worldwide outbreak, which suggests that clinical features alone cannot be used to conclusively distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions in a practical manner. Clinical features must be interpreted in the context of key epidemiologic risk factors, including epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e. clusters of cases of pneumonia clinically compatible with SARS), exposure to settings in which SARS activity is suspected or documented, and pneumonia among healthcare workers with direct patient care. Surveillance and additional research will be critical to help refine the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory features used to identify future infections with SARS, which will in turn help with the early detection and prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV infections.

In late December 2019, a cluster of cases with 2019 Novel Coronavirus pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, aroused worldwide concern. Previous studies have reported epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this brief review is to summarize those published studies as of late February 2020 on the clinical features, symptoms, complications, and treatments of COVID-19 and help provide guidance for frontline medical staff in the clinical management of this outbreak.

### Deadly viral syndrome mimics [^c05b8601]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (ie, "the common cold") have several hundred causes, the most common of which include rhino-virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The clinical presentation varies with symptoms. Every emergency department, no matter what the demographics, cares for patients with this constellation of symptoms. Emergency physicians examine, diagnose, and treat these disorders frequently. With increasing burdens being placed on emergency physicians, it is possible to assume a diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection without generating a complete differential diagnosis. The challenge is to identify and recognize the distinctions between an innocuous upper respiratory tract infection and a life-threatening disease "mimic" or entities. This article discusses some of these life-threatening mimics.

### Viral respiratory infections: a cause of community-acquired pneumonia or a predisposing factor? [^cf145a74]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A cause for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is only identified in ∼50% of cases. Nasopharyngeal PCR panels contain more viruses than previously. The problem then becomes determining the relevance of the organisms identified rather than figuring out which virus is present. This review addresses how to distinguish between viral CAP and bacterial CAP, how viral CAP predisposes to bacterial CAP and some novel antiviral treatment being conducted.

Recent Findings

The pneumonia severity index has been studied in patients with viral CAP. There are new studies using biomarkers to help determine when antimicrobial treatment is needed in CAP patients, and there is still no consensus. Newer devices are being invented in an effort to separate upper from lower respiratory organisms to make test results more relevant. Several outcome studies in patients with viral CAP are reviewed.

Summary

In addition to clinical correlation, using biomarkers can be useful to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP. Outcomes in patients with a co-infection are generally worse as a viral infection may predispose someone to a bacterial pneumonia. Influenza CAP treatment may be initially accompanied with antimicrobials until a patient's diagnosis is clear (∼48-72h). Future research is being conducted for antiviral treatment more than for influenza.

COVID-19 has infected more than 2 million people in the world in less than 5 months outbreak. Chest imaging is recommended for triage of suspected cases of COVID-19 with moderate-severe clinical features and high pre-test probability of disease, and may help for patient follow-up and to identify patients at higher risk of disease worsening.

### COVID-19 pneumonia: the great radiological mimicker [^a730c989]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Chest CT is an important tool in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia with high sensitivity rates. However, CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are rather nonspecific and variable during the disease course that may resemble numerous infectious and non-infectious diseases. The awareness and knowledge of the radiological features of these entities are essential in early diagnosis and management of precautions during the pandemic. Duration of the symptoms, background and clinical findings of the patient, ancillary imaging findings, and follow-up CT imaging when needed is helpful in the differential diagnosis.

### Pneumonia in the developed world [^b2c8dc56]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

In this paper, we review the literature on the management of pneumonia in the developed world setting. Pneumonia is usually diagnosed on the basis of a cough, respiratory distress, a fever, and chest X-ray changes. Pneumonia affects all paediatric age groups, though the highest incidence is in the under 5s. There is a significant burden of primary and secondary care illness, although mortality is low. Inpatient admission rates for pneumonia may have increased in recent years in some regions. Pneumonia is unlikely if a child presents with solely wheeze. In routine clinical practice, a microbiological diagnosis is often not made, because current tests are insensitive. Aetiology varies with geographical location, but approximately half of cases are viral. The mainstay of management of moderate pneumonia (the commonest group presenting to secondary care) is careful assessment, and oral antibiotics, followed by early discharge when the patient shows signs of improvement. We summarise the available clinical trial data from the developed world; most of these trials are not adequately powered. Patients with moderately severe pneumonia do not require invasive investigation, but clinical judgement should be used to identify and investigate more complex cases. We discuss several pathogens that have gained importance as causal agents, including non-vaccinated strains of S. pneumoniae, Panton Valentine leucocidin S. aureus, H1N1 Influenza A and Human Bocavirus. The importance of antimicrobial resistance is considered, and we review recent data on long term effects of pneumonia in childhood. By reviewing the available literature, we demonstrate that there are clear evidence gaps, and we suggest future areas for clinical research.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^2acd2240]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Early recognition and rapid initiation of infection control precautions are currently the most important strategies for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). No rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out SARS among patients with febrile respiratory illnesses. Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to healthcare settings. When combined with clinical findings, these epidemiologic features provide a possible strategic framework for early recognition of SARS.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: pathophysiology and epidemiology [^03251dc7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The challenge of diagnosing pneumonia and ARDS in patients with positive laboratory results for influenza relates to the temporality of the clinical events. Influenza virus infection alone can cause severe pneumonia and ARDS, but it can also act in conjunction with a bacterial infection (discussed below). It can precede a pneumonia episode caused by a secondary bacterial infection, most commonly by S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, or can be followed by an episode of nosocomial pneumonia. Clinicians commonly fail to clinically diagnose influenza in up to two-thirds of patients whom have confirmed influenza virus infection. In the case of severe pneumonia or ARDS, the only reliable clue that influenza is a possible causal agent is the presentation during the peak season of the epidemic because the symptomatology alone cannot distinguish severe influenza from other viral or bacterial respiratory infections. Primary influenza pneumonia shows persistence and/or subsequent worsening of respiratory symptoms, while secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs 1–3 weeks as a "relapse" after the initial Influenza symptoms have ended or subsided; however, bacterial co-infection can also occur a few days after the Influenza illness onset. That said, only 5% of all severe pneumonias admitted to the ICU are from a viral etiology.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: pathophysiology and epidemiology [^cb382e03]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Influenza virus affects the respiratory tract by direct viral infection or by damage from the immune system response. In humans, the respiratory epithelium is the only site where the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule is effectively cleaved, generating infectious virus particles. Virus transmission occurs through a susceptible individual's contact with aerosols or respiratory fomites from an infected individual. The inability of the lung to perform its primary function of gas exchange can result from multiple mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity from direct epithelial cell killing, and degradation of the critical extracellular matrix. Approximately 30–40% of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza are diagnosed with acute pneumonia. These patients who develop pneumonia are more likely to be < 5years old, > 65years old, Caucasian, and nursing home residents; have chronic lung or heart disease and history of smoking, and are immunocompromised. Influenza can primarily cause severe pneumonia, but it can also present in conjunction with or be followed by a secondary bacterial infection, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Influenza is associated with a high predisposition to bacterial sepsis and ARDS. Viral infections presenting concurrently with bacterial pneumonia are now known to occur with a frequency of 30–50% in both adult and pediatric populations. The H3N2 subtype has been associated with unprecedented high levels of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Influenza A is the predominant viral etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults. Risk factors independently associated with ARDS are age between 36 and 55years old, pregnancy, and obesity, while protective factors are female sex, influenza vaccination, and infections with Influenza A (H3N2) or Influenza B viruses. In the ICU, particularly during the winter season, influenza should be suspected not only in patients with typical symptoms and epidemiology, but also in patients with severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis with or without bacterial co-infection, as well as in patients with encephalitis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^5ea90c58]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in early December 2019 in China, as an acute lower respiratory tract infection and spread rapidly worldwide being declared a pandemic in March 2020. Chest-computed tomography (CT) has been utilized in different clinical settings of COVID-19 patients; however, COVID-19 imaging appearance is highly variable and nonspecific. Indeed, many pulmonary infections and non-infectious diseases can show similar CT findings and mimic COVID-19 pneumonia. In this review, we discuss clinical conditions that share a similar imaging appearance with COVID-19 pneumonia, in order to identify imaging and clinical characteristics useful in the differential diagnosis.

Viral pneumonia

Viruses are the main cause of acute respiratory infections. Viral pneumonia can be caused by different viruses depending on patient's age and immune status. Clinical symptoms are non-specific and depend on immunological status (being more severe in immunocompromised patients), age, and virus's prevalence.

Imaging features are variable and non-specific since they overlap and are shared with other non-viral lung diseases. CT findings reflect the pathogenesis of viral infection: viruses of the same family, sharing similar pathogenesis, generally show similar CT appearance.

Adenovirus manifests as a mild upper respiratory tract infection in most immunocompetent patients. However, it can also cause acute bronchiolitis and evolve to bronchopneumonia. CT findings in acute adenovirus pneumonia are bilateral, multifocal GGO with patchy consolidations, often with a segmental-lobar distribution, suggestive of bronchopneumonia, associated with tree-in-bud-opacities. Sometimes, expiratory acquisitions may demonstrate areas of air trapping, visualized as areas of decreased attenuation of lung parenchyma during expiration, due to small airway obstruction and reduced lung compliance. They are usually related to chronic bronchiolitis.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is more frequent in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV patients, patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy or organ transplant receivers, especially in the early phase (30–100 days) after transplantation. Immunocompetent patients are usually asymptomatic.

CT in CMV pneumonia demonstrates bilateral and asymmetric GGO, associated with random distributed, poorly defined pulmonary nodules and air-space consolidation. Interlobular septal thickening can be observed.

Influenza viruses are a diffuse group of infective agents (influenza virus A, B, C, and D) causing seasonal epidemic, or pandemic, upper respiratory tract infections. Infections are usually mild and self-limited but, in immunocompromised patients, children or elderly people, pneumonia may occur, mostly caused by Influenza A virus.

CT can show focal or diffuse, bilateral GGO, associated with consolidations that tend to be confluent (Fig. 3). Bronchiectasis and small centrilobular nodules are frequently observed in Influenza pneumonia while are rare in COVID-19. During influenza pneumonia, pleural effusion and cavitation can develop.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^24814974]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Management Decisions after Provisional Diagnosis

If a provisional diagnosis of SARS is made on the basis of the clinical and epidemiologic factors discussed, the patient should be managed according to existing guidance for SARS isolation precautions while evaluation and treatment proceed. The clinical evaluation should include, in addition to testing for SARS-CoV, laboratory testing for alternative diagnoses that could explain the illness. The patients should be isolated for the duration of the period of communicability or until convincing evidence against SARS is documented. Although the duration of communicability is not known, in the recent outbreak the isolation of patients until 10 days after their fever was gone and their respiratory symptoms were improving seemed an effective method to prevent additional transmission.

Alternative Diagnoses

Documenting the presence of other diseases does not exclude the possibility of SARS because patients with SARS-CoV infection can be co-infected with other respiratory pathogens. If the presence of an alternative diagnosis is to be used as justification for discontinuing SARS-specific isolation precautions, the alternative diagnoses should be based only upon tests with high positive predictive value, and the clinical illness should be fully explainable by the diagnosis. The possibility of secondary infection should be considered if the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is confirmed, since bacterial pneumonia is a well-known complication of viral respiratory tract infection and may occur following SARS-CoV infection.

Particular care should be taken in completely attributing the illness to an alternative diagnosis if the epidemiologic link to others known to have SARS-CoV infection is strong, or if the patient is part of an epidemiologic cluster of similar illnesses. In the latter instance, confirming an alternative diagnosis among more than one person within the cluster may be used as evidence against SARS, particularly if the clinical findings are not typical of SARS (e.g. upper respiratory symptoms).

Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 1918–19 Pandemic

Disease Usually Mild and Self-limited

The 1918–19 pandemic spread worldwide with remarkable speed. Over several months, a novel strain of influenza virus attacked communities worldwide; most persons were immunologically susceptible. However, most cases followed a mild or self-limited course. Had the pandemic strain been inherently hypervirulent, in the absence of modern lifesaving measures one would expect exceptionally high case-fatality rates for all affected populations. Yet during that pandemic, most infected persons had self-limited clinical courses and complete recovery. For most affected populations, the case-fatality incidence was < 2% and the overall mortality rate was < 0.5%.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children: rapid evidence review [^a7110357]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, pneumonia is the most common cause of hospitalization in children. Even in hospitalized children, community-acquired pneumonia is most likely of viral etiology, with respiratory syncytial virus being the most common pathogen, especially in children younger than two years. Typical presenting signs and symptoms include tachypnea, cough, fever, and anorexia. Findings most strongly associated with an infiltrate on chest radiography in children with clinically suspected pneumonia are grunting, history of fever, retractions, crackles, tachypnea, and the overall clinical impression. Chest radiography should be ordered if the diagnosis is uncertain, if patients have hypoxemia or significant respiratory distress, or if patients fail to show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy. Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia is appropriate in patients without respiratory distress who can tolerate oral antibiotics. Amoxicillin is the first-line antibiotic with coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae for school-aged children, and treatment should not exceed seven days. Patients requiring hospitalization and empiric parenteral therapy should be transitioned to oral antibiotics once they are clinically improving and able to tolerate oral intake. Childhood and maternal immunizations against S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Bordetella pertussis, and influenza virus are the key to prevention.

Specific microbiological investigations are usually required, but an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses is necessary to make interpretation possible. This review examines clinical presentation, microbiology and current evidence surrounding diagnostic techniques for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella species. Applying an understanding of the investigations to the diagnosis of pneumonia in children may lead to more appropriate patient management by ensuring that they clarify rather than further obscure the diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^70ecc6b6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Predictive signature of murine and human host response to typical and atypical pneumonia [^b91aa2c5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

Pneumonia due to typical bacterial, atypical bacterial and viral pathogens can be difficult to clinically differentiate. Host response-based diagnostics are emerging as a complementary diagnostic strategy to pathogen detection.

Methods

We used murine models of typical bacterial, atypical bacterial and viral pneumonia to develop diagnostic signatures and understand the host's response to these types of infections. Mice were intranasally inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza or saline as a control. Peripheral blood gene expression analysis was performed at multiple time points. Differentially expressed genes were used to perform gene set enrichment analysis and generate diagnostic signatures. These murine-derived signatures were externally validated in silico using human gene expression data. The response to S. pneumoniae was the most rapid and robust.

Results

Mice infected with M. pneumoniae had a delayed response more similar to influenza-infected animals. Diagnostic signatures for the three types of infection had 0.94–1.00 area under the receiver operator curve (auROC). Validation in five human gene expression datasets revealed auROC of 0.82–0.96.

Discussion

This study identified discrete host responses to typical bacterial, atypical bacterial and viral aetiologies of pneumonia in mice. These signatures validated well in humans, highlighting the conserved nature of the host response to these pathogen classes.

### The sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^58c6eec4]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The identification of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 is highly important to control the disease; however, the clinical presentation is often unspecific and a large portion of the patients develop mild or no symptoms at all. For this reason, there is an emphasis on evaluating diagnostic tools for screening. Chest CT scans are emerging as a useful tool in the diagnostic process of viral pneumonia cases associated with COVID-19. This review examines the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Methods

Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 in its various phases was compared using RT-PCR as a gold standard. A "reverse calculation approach" was applied and treated chest CT as a hypothetical gold standard and compared RT-PCR to it point out the flaw of the standard approach.

Results

High sensitivity (67–100%) and relatively low specificity (25–80%) was reported for the CT scans. However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was reported to be modest (53–88%), hence cannot serve as an appropriate ground truth. The "reverse calculation approach" showed that CT could have a higher specificity (83–100%) if we consider the modest sensitivity of the RT-PCR.

Conclusions

The sensitivity and specificity of the chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 and the radiation exposure have to be judged together. Arguments are presented that chest CT scans have added value in diagnosing COVID-19 especially in patients, who exhibit typical clinical symptoms and have negative RT-PCR results in highly infected regions.

Key Points

- CT scans have higher specificity if we take into account the low sensitivity of the RT-PCR.
- Avoid chest CT as a sole diagnostic approach for COVID-19 infection.
- Patients who had negative RT-PCR result with typical clinical symptoms in highly infected regions or with close contact of COVID-19-infected patients; the use of chest CT is warranted.

### Predicting the microbial cause of community-acquired pneumonia: can physicians or a data-driven method differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia at patient presentation? [^c460d385]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician predictions

Experts had "high" confidence in their predicted etiology only 18.8% of the time. Confidence levels were typically "moderate" (38.9%) or "low" (42.6%), but never "very low". All three experts agreed in 61.1% of the cases. Correct predictions were made 66.7% of the time. The clinician predictions had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.54, PPV of 0.54 and NPV of 0.86 for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia (Table 3). The LR+ for diagnosing a viral pneumonia was 3.81, and the corresponding LR- was 0.53. The LR+ for diagnosing a bacterial pneumonia was 1.89, and the corresponding LR- was 0.26. Therefore, the discriminant abilities of experienced physicians to distinguish viral and bacterial etiologies for pneumonia were categorized as very low to low (according to defined cutoff values for the interpretation of likelihood ratios, see Table 1).

Data-driven approach predictions

Predictions by the data-driven algorithms generated from clinical data alone resulted in an ROC curve with a corresponding AUC of 0.72. Predictions by the data-driven algorithms generated from biological and radiological variables data alone resulted in an ROC curve with an AUC of 0.81. Finally, predictions generated from the dataset that included all data sources outperformed the other algorithms and resulted in an ROC curve with an AUC of 0.84 (Table 3, Fig. 3). This model based on the more inclusive dataset was considered the final model for comparison with the expert panel. The final algorithm made predictions with a sensitivity of 0.57, specificity of 0.91, PPV of 0.80 and NPV of 0.77 for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. The LR+ for diagnosing a viral pneumonia was 2.12, and the corresponding LR- was 0.16. The LR+ for diagnosing a bacterial pneumonia was 6.29, and the corresponding LR- was 0.47. Consequently, the discriminant abilities of the data-driven algorithm to distinguish viral and bacterial etiologies for pneumonia were categorized as low to moderate (according to defined cutoff values for the interpretation of likelihood ratios, see Table 1).

### Epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 [^7545fcdc]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

At the end of 2019, a sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China, brought a series of calamities to both Chinese society and global communities. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) names the new coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), and World Health Organization (WHO) designates the pandemic disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are all caused by coronavirus and can be manifested with severe respiratory distress, COVID-19 has its own epidemiological and clinical features. In adults, COVID-19 has the characteristics of a long incubation period, strong infectivity, atypical clinical symptoms, and high mortality in the elderly. In view that people at any age are susceptible to COVID-19 and it has spread widely around the world, COVID-19 may affect human health for a long period of time. Therefore, understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 will help to control the spread and improve the curative rate of this pandemic disease.

Compared to adults, there are relatively few studies on pediatric COVID-19. In particular, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children aged 0–14 years are yet to be fully defined. With the current rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of pediatric patients with COVID-19 is expected to increase significantly or has already been rising remarkably. Therefore, defining the epidemiological and clinical features of the disease in large cohorts of pediatric patients is an urgent need. In this report, we conducted a retrospective review of COVID-19 features in 341 pediatric patients with ages between 0 and 14 years with the overall goal of providing data that could help in the development of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of pediatric COVID-19.

### Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children [^76a2f924]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, pneumonia is the leading cause of hospitalizations and death among children with nearly 120 million new cases and one million deaths each year. In Australia, pneumonia is associated with 5–8 hospitalisations per 1000 child-years among children < 5 years old, with deaths being rare. Australian Aboriginal children are 14 times more at risk of infectious diseases than non-Aboriginal children.

Respiratory bacteria and viruses are frequently detected in specimens collected from children with pneumonia. Identifying the infectious agents associated with illness can guide management of the infection and facilitate judicious use of antibiotics. Differentiating bacterial from viral pneumonia based on clinical characteristics is challenging as the clinical signs and symptoms overlap.

Despite the growing availability of molecular techniques for pathogen detection, including quantitative and qualitative pathogen detection, laboratory results are usually only available after treatment decisions have been made. Several studies have assessed the utility of non-specific inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase reactant released in response to cytokine interleukin-6, white cell count (WCC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to discriminate probable bacterial infections from non-bacterial infections and also to assess the severity of illness. Bacterial pneumonia has been associated with higher CRP, WCC and ANC than viral pneumonia, while some studies have found no difference in biomarkers among bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia. Even studies that report differences in these biomarkers cannot determine any reliable thresholds for differentiating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia. Previous studies were also affected by small sample size, use of less sensitive methods for pathogen detection which could have resulted an inaccurate categorization of bacterial and viral cases. Furthermore, studies have been conducted in low-income settings where the contribution of bacterial infection may be higher and where children are at higher risk of other infectious diseases that could influence the biomarker levels and confound the analysis.

### Viral pneumoniae in children: incidence and aetiology [^600c1949]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia remains a common and serious illness, which affects children of all age groups. The spectrum of causative organisms is wide and it differs according to the age of the patients. With the advent of new and improved diagnostic techniques our understanding of the aetiology of the disease has been improved considerably. Viruses have been shown to cause up to 90% of pneumonias, especially in the first year of life, with the respiratory syncytial virus to be the most important pathogen and this percentage decreases to approximately 50% by school age. Viral pneumonias frequently are complicated by bacterial infections and mixed infections are identified in 30% of the cases. The precise role of viruses and bacteria in these cases, remains to be clarified.

### Influenza and bacterial pneumonia – constant companions [^1fdbe1f1]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Sequential or concomitant influenza and bacterial pneumonia are two common syndromes seen in community-acquired pneumonia. Inadequacies of diagnostic testing make separating simple pneumonia with either bacteria or influenza from concomitant or sequential influenza with both microorganisms difficult, although the novel 2009 H1N1 epidemic may improve the availability of molecular testing for viruses. Given the frequency of viral pneumonia and diagnostic limitations, empirical antivirals may be underutilized in community-acquired pneumonia. Thankfully, increasingly effective vaccines appear to disrupt this synergistic relationship.

### Eleven faces of coronavirus disease 2019 [^fcfa4f58]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic. We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases.

Methods

Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed.

Results

The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe.

Conclusion

All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.

### Bench-to-bedside review: bacterial pneumonia with influenza-pathogenesis and clinical implications [^58789127]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Seasonal and pandemic influenza are frequently complicated by bacterial infections, causing additional hospitalization and mortality. Secondary bacterial respiratory infection can be subdivided into combined viral/bacterial pneumonia and post-influenza pneumonia, which differ in their pathogenesis. During combined viral/bacterial infection, the virus, the bacterium and the host interact with each other. Post-influenza pneumonia may, at least in part, be due to resolution of inflammation caused by the primary viral infection. These mechanisms restore tissue homeostasis but greatly impair the host response against unrelated bacterial pathogens. In this review we summarize the underlying mechanisms leading to combined viral/bacterial infection or post-influenza pneumonia and highlight important considerations for effective treatment of bacterial pneumonia during and shortly after influenza.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^2bebfeb9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and can be prevented through vaccination with pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. Diagnosis requires suggestive history and physical findings in conjunction with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. Laboratory testing can help guide therapy. Important issues in treatment include choosing the proper venue, timely initiation of the appropriate antibiotic or antiviral, appropriate respiratory support, deescalation after negative culture results, switching to oral therapy, and short treatment duration.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^5ce9135f]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza — states that for outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest the following clinical symptoms and signs are suggestive of pneumonia: cough; dyspnea; pleural pain; sweating, fevers, or shivers; aches and pains; temperature ≥ 38°C; tachypnea; and new and localizing chest examination signs. Those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Although the measurement of C-reactive protein levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. We suggest that there is no need for routine microbiological testing. We suggest the use of empiric antibiotics according to local and national guidelines when pneumonia is suspected in settings in which imaging cannot be performed. Where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. For outpatient adults with acute cough and suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment (according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice) within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and improved outcomes.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children [^a8dd1272]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a potentially serious infection in children and often results in hospitalization. The diagnosis can be based on the history and physical examination results in children with fever plus respiratory signs and symptoms. Chest radiography and rapid viral testing may be helpful when the diagnosis is unclear. The most likely etiology depends on the age of the child. Viral and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are most common in preschool-aged children, whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae is common in older children. The decision to treat with antibiotics is challenging, especially with the increasing prevalence of viral and bacterial coinfections. Preschool-aged children with uncomplicated bacterial pneumonia should be treated with amoxicillin. Macrolides are first-line agents in older children. Immunization with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is important in reducing the severity of childhood pneumococcal infections.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia presentations in chest computed tomography: a pictorial review [^92ad2a11]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite imaging not being a tool for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis, there has been an increased number of chest computed tomography (CT) scans done worldwide. There are no pathognomonic CT features for COVID-19 pneumonia, as findings are also common in other infectious diseases and noninfectious aetiologies. Nonetheless, point-of-care physicians should be familiarized with the most common imaging presentations of the COVID-19. In this pictorial review, we have summarized the most reported imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia, including possible differential diagnosis according to the CT finding.

### Viral pneumonias in adults: radiologic and pathologic findings [^55e13d91]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Numerous viruses, including influenza virus, measles virus, Hantavirus, adenovirus, herpesviruses, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus, can cause lower respiratory tract infection in adults. Viral pneumonia in adults can be classified into two clinical groups: so-called atypical pneumonia in otherwise healthy hosts and viral pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Influenza virus types A and B cause most cases of viral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. Immunocompromised hosts are susceptible to pneumonias caused by cytomegalovirus, herpesviruses, measles virus, and adenovirus. The radiographic findings, which consist mainly of patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation and reticular areas of increased opacity, are variable and overlapping. Computed tomographic findings, which are also overlapping, consist of poorly defined centrilobular nodules, ground-glass attenuation with a lobular distribution, segmental consolidation, or diffuse ground-glass attenuation with thickened interlobular septa. The radiologic findings reflect the variable extents of the histopathologic features: diffuse alveolar damage (intraalveolar edema, fibrin, and variable cellular infiltrates with a hyaline membrane), intraalveolar hemorrhage, and interstitial (intrapulmonary or airway) inflammatory cell infiltration. Clinical information such as patient age, immune status, community outbreaks, symptom onset and duration, and presence of a rash remain important aids in diagnosis of viral causes.

### Inflammatory response in mixed viral-bacterial community-acquired pneumonia [^f54b08f4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Besides individual host responses, there is increasing evidence that several different causal microorganisms may trigger different inflammatory responses, and levels of several markers such as white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) are associated with different etiological patterns. Clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial and viral pneumonia are highly variable and overlap, and there is no clinical or radiologic algorithm that can discriminate between the two causes of CAP. Some attempts at differentiation based on biomarkers have been made, and it is now well established that CRP and, especially, PCT show higher levels in bacterial than in viral (or atypical) pneumonia. Lack of viral PCT response to viral infection is thought to be related to post-infection release of interferon, which inhibits PCT synthesis.

There are very few studies of mixed viral-bacterial CAP that involve biomarkers. The only available data concern H1N1 influenza, from retrospective studies with a limited number of patients, mostly in those admitted to the ICU, showing increased PCT and CRP levels in bacterial coinfection; this suggests that the biomarkers may be used as a tool for discriminating mixed CAP from H1N1 viral CAP. The CAPNETZ study included a large number of patients (1337) with CAP, of which 58 (4.3%) showed mixed etiologies; however, this group was heterogeneous, as it included two or more typical or atypical bacteria and combinations of typical with atypical and any bacteria with a virus.

We wanted to determine WBC, CRP and PCT levels in mixed viral-bacterial CAP, and wondered whether biomarkers in mixed disease showed a different pattern than in either bacterial or viral CAP alone.

### 1918 influenza, a puzzle with missing pieces [^d4adcaff]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Figure
Combined influenza plus pneumonia (P&I) age-specific incidence, mortality, and case-fatality rates, per 1,000 persons/age group, US Public Health Service house-to-house surveys, 8 states, 1918, and US Public Health Service surveys during 1928–1929. A) P&I incidence for 1918; B) mortality rate for 1918 (ill and well persons combined); C) P&I case-fatality rates for 1918 (solid line) compared with a more typical curve of age-specific influenza case-fatality rates (dotted line) from 1928–1929. Reprinted from.

A complicating fact about 1918–1919 mortality patterns and pathogenesis hypotheses is that for ≈98% of infected persons, influenza was clinically unremarkable in its traditional signs and symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia) and severity. Clinical and epidemiologic differences were confined to 2 aspects: higher frequency of its long-appreciated post-illness complication — bacterial pneumonia — and an unusual peak in fatal or nonfatal pneumonia cases in persons 20–40 years of age. In 1918, a higher percentage of persons of all ages, and especially those 20–40 years old, experienced influenza that led to cases of secondary bacterial pneumonia, which were caused by highly prevalent pneumopathogenic bacteria (especially pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci). These bacteria had been continuously causing primary pneumonia and pneumonia after influenza and other respiratory illnesses, and had long been exacting a substantial death toll.

These 1918 postinfluenza cases of pneumonia produced case-fatality rates similar to those of noninfluenza pneumonia caused by the same organisms. Moreover, antibacterial vaccines administered in 1918–1919 seem to have prevented postinfluenza deaths. Influenza mortality rates in 1918–1919 were most strongly associated with increased case incidence of, not increased severity of, common complicating bacterial pneumonia, and this finding was seen especially in persons 20–40 years of age. The epidemiology of 1918 influenza mortality is predominantly, almost entirely, the epidemiology of a single postonset complication: secondary bacterial pneumonia. Therefore, pathogenesis theories of severe or fatal 1918 influenza must account for why the 1918 virus predisposed more persons to secondary bacterial pneumonia, and also look beyond the virus to address bacterial cofactors. The hypotheses of Shanks and Brundage should be considered with these observations in mind.

### Differentiate clinical characteristics between viral pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae and nomograms for predicting Mycoplasma pneumoniae: a retrospective study in primary hospitals [^a4ca30ff]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is the world's leading cause of death in children under 5 years old. Viruses have historically been the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children, approximately 65%. However, according to a 10-year study on respiratory tract surveillance in China, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the atypical pathogen with the highest detection rate in 5 to 7 years-old children. According to previous research, the detection rate of mycoplasma infection in children was more than 20%. – Therefore, as an atypical pathogen infection, M. pneumoniae is a matter of concern to society and cannot be ignored. M. pneumoniae is often related to community-based outbreaks among school-age children and young adults. What's worse, it has been found in recent years that some cases having been treated with macrolide antibiotics for more than 7 days are still in aggravation of clinical signs, such as persistent fever and aggravation of lung imaging, which becomes the refractory mycoplasma pneumonia. The incidence of refractory mycoplasma pneumonia complications is relatively high, even including necrotizing pneumonia, bronchitis obliterans or thrombosis.

Clinically, children with M. pneumoniae had nonspecific symptoms, which were not sufficiently distinctive to differentiate CAP caused by M. pneumoniae from other causes. Some primary care centers, like community hospitals, easily miss or delay diagnoses due to the lack of adequate testing devices. Few epidemiological studies and comparative studies focus on the difference between viral pneumonia and M. pneumoniae, which may result in abuse of antibiotic use. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the differential characteristics between viral pneumonia and M. pneumoniae and to develop a prediction tool for early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae in primary hospitals that is often ill-equipped to perform pathogenetic testing.

Chest CT mimickers of typical COVID-19

Viral pneumonias

Viruses are considered the most common pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections usually, the clinical signs and symptoms of viral pneumonia are non-specific, and the clinical course vary according to patient age and immune status. CT features of viral pneumonia are variable and may be affected by immunity and pathophysiology of the virus. Differentiating between COVID-19 and non-COVID19 pneumonia is a crucial need in the current situation to reduce unnecessary quarantine for suspected patients. Bai et al. demonstrate that radiologists are capable of distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral etiologies of pneumonia on chest CT with high specificity (93–100%).

HPIV (human parainfluenza virus) presents on CT as multifocal patchy consolidation with GGO of non-specific distribution and in one-fourth of patients show centrilobular nodules with bronchial wall thickening.

Influenza A, B and C pneumonia (Fig. 4) manifested on CT as focal, multifocal, or diffuse GGO with areas of consolidation. Unlike COVID-19, centrilobular nodules, pseudocavitation, pneumatocele formation and lymphadenopathy are commonly seen. Pleural effusion and cavitation can develop later in the course of the disease. An H1N1 (a subtype of Influenza A) pandemic reported in more than 70 countries with 30,000 cases of infection occurred in 2009.

Corona virus cause pneumonia, bronchiolitis and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS Coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak originated from Guangdong Province, China, occurred during 2002–2003. In 2012, another coronavirus-related epidemic occurred in the Middle East, identified as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). CT features of both diseases are similar to COVID-19 pneumonia including multifocal GGOs with less common consolidations. Reticulation is noted after the second week. Cavitation, lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion are not common findings.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^e9cb10b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### Predicting the microbial cause of community-acquired pneumonia: can physicians or a data-driven method differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia at patient presentation? [^8555873c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We compared the concordance between the predictions and the final microbial etiologies for the experts and for the algorithm and calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and likelihood ratios (LRs) for the predictions. Given the importance of this diagnostic prediction in the patient's therapeutic management, we determined that the discriminant properties should be "high" (LR + > 10 and/or LR- < 0.1) for the prediction to be considered useful for clinical practice. Table 1 summarizes the LR cutoff values defining the discriminant properties of the predictions. Quantitative data are reported as the median value and interquartile range (IQR). Statistical analyses were done with JMP software (SAS, version 7.2).

Due to its pandemic diffusion, SARS- CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection represents a global threat. Despite a multiorgan involvement has been described, pneumonia is the most common manifestation of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) and it is associated with a high morbidity and a considerable mortality. Especially in the areas with high disease burden, chest imaging plays a crucial role to speed up the diagnostic process and to aid the patient management. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to understand the diagnostic capabilities and limitations of chest X-ray (CXR) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in defining the common imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia and correlating them with the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. The evolution of lung abnormalities over time, the uncommon findings, the possible complications, and the main differential diagnosis occurring in the pandemic phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection are also discussed.

### COVID-19 in 7780 pediatric patients: a systematic review [^2faf7140]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In December 2019, an unprecedented number of pneumonia cases presented in adult individuals from Wuhan, China. Despite rapid action by the Chinese government and health officials, the number of similar presenting cases continued to rise at an alarming rate. By January 2020 an emerging zoonotic agent, known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in respiratory samples in patients diagnosed with pneumonia who subsequently developed respiratory failure. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 from human to human, through respiratory droplets, has now resulted in a worldwide outbreak, now classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

As of June 3rd, 2020, there has been more than 6·4 million confirmed cases worldwide and > 380,000 fatalitiesMost symptomatic cases have occurred in the adult population, characterized by fever, cough, malaise, and frequent hospitalization. Accordingly, most of the published data is derived from adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in China. As the pandemic continues, we are now observing numerous reports describing the clinical presentation and hospital course of children with confirmed COVID-19.

What is currently known is that children have milder symptoms and are less likely to be hospitalized when compared to adults. However, on May 14th, 2020 the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a health advisory reporting a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. This statement stemmed from a subset of pediatric patients manifesting with severe inflammation, multi-organ failure, and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Our goal was to conduct a systematic review: (i) to understand the clinical picture and presentation of pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19, and (ii) to provide an initial observation of the signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of pediatric patients who developed MIS-C.

Introduction

The 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic reemphasised the important role of respiratory viruses as causes of severe pneumonia. According to World Health Organisation estimates, 450 million cases of pneumonia are recorded every year, and about 4 million people die of this illness. In the United States alone, the economic burden of community-acquired pneumonia has been estimated to be more than US$17 billion per annum. The ability to identify patients with viral pneumonia correctly has important patient-management implications, but remains a challenge. Several studies, including, have shown that the protein biomarkers procalcitonin and C-reactive protein are typically lower in respiratory infections caused by viral as opposed to bacterial infections. These studies, however, were preliminary and consisted of small sample sizes. Attempts also have been made to distinguish clinically between bacterial and influenza pneumonia, by using a combination of variables such as age, mental orientation, temperature, leukocyte count, and chest-radiograph findings. However, the clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial and viral pneumonia can overlap and are often confounded by underlying conditions such as immunosuppression and extrapulmonary complications. When these individuals present with community-acquired pneumonia, it is difficult to determine which organism is the causative pathogen (bacterial versus viral).

Assessing the immune response at a gene-expression level may assist in the diagnosis as well as the understanding of the response to pulmonary infections caused by viral compared with bacterial pathogens. We previously showed that in influenza infection, the presence of an abnormal immune response at the gene-expression level is associated with the development of clinical symptoms. Further, we showed that changes in this immune response correlate well with the progression to respiratory failure in infected patients. However, it is not known whether this immune-response signature is specific to influenza infection, or merely a part of a generic host response to infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether a gene-expression signature is present in individuals with severe influenza pneumonia, and whether this immune-response signature is distinct from other conditions that share a similar clinical presentation, such as bacterial pneumonia or systemic inflammation due to noninfectious causes.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^30bbc4e6]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — conclusions and practice suggestions emphasize that there should be an assessment of clinical symptoms and signs, and those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, whereas there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. Microbiological diagnostic testing should be considered when the results may indicate a change in therapy. For outpatient adults with acute cough, we suggest the use of empiric antibiotics when pneumonia is suspected based on epidemiologic and clinical features in settings in which imaging cannot be performed, but where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. For suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and hospitalization and improved outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antiviral therapy, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to do not delay antiviral therapy until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Do not exclude influenza disease conclusively in case of negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially rapid antigen tests. Consider initiating treatment after 48 hours of symptomatic infection in patients with more severe disease, as it may still provide clinical benefit.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has had catastrophic effects worldwide. Radiology, in particular computed tomography (CT) imaging, has proven to be valuable in the diagnosis, prognostication, and longitudinal assessment of those diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. This article will review acute and chronic pulmonary radiologic manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia with an emphasis on CT and also highlighting histopathology, relevant clinical details, and some notable challenges when interpreting the literature.

### Advances in the diagnosis of pneumonia in children [^ac622245]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Pneumonia remains a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity globally. Accurate diagnosis and attribution of the causes of pneumonia are important for measuring the burden of disease, implementing appropriate preventive or treatment strategies, and developing more effective interventions. This review summarizes recent diagnostic advances in radiological techniques, specimen collection, and laboratory methods. Although chest ultrasound and chest magnetic resonance imaging are promising modalities for radiological diagnosis, their role in clinical management and their impact on outcomes need further study. Rapid, highly sensitive, multiplex laboratory tests performed on upper respiratory tract samples or induced sputum can detect nucleic acid from potential pathogens in most children with pneumonia. However, it may be difficult to attribute causality because it is often impossible to distinguish between organisms colonizing or infecting the upper respiratory tract and those causing pneumonia. Currently available host biomarkers lack accuracy for distinguishing bacterial or mixed bacterial-viral infections from viral infections. New biomarkers derived from host transcriptional profile analysis may be more accurate but require validation. Prospective studies with appropriate control populations, including studies of clinical impact, are needed to improve our understanding of the role of tests. Although progress has been made in radiological techniques and laboratory testing, current methods for diagnosing and attributing the causes of pneumonia are suboptimal.

### Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a primer for emergency physicians [^2577b6a2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic.

Objective

This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19.

Discussion

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine.

Conclusion

This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.

### Respiratory tract virus infections in the elderly with pneumonia [^9772ce99]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Frailty, immunologic weakening and cardiopulmonary diseases are understood to predispose to pneumonia when a viral infection occurs. In our study, a respiratory virus was found in no less than 40% of the elderly patients who suffered from respiratory symptoms but were not diagnosed with pneumonia. At the same time, the risk of a hospital revisit in all the studied episodes of hospital care seemed to be lower when a virus was present than when no virus was fund. These findings support the idea that respiratory viruses are merely innocent bystanders in patients with pneumonia.

Our study strengthens the idea that high CRP and WBC values are associated with pneumonia in patients with respiratory symptoms but have limited value as independent predictors. In adult populations, only relatively high CRP values have been shown useful in predicting the presence of pneumonia, and a cut-off value of 100 mg/l is mentioned in some studies. Krueger et al. concluded in their CAPNETZ-study with 1337 patients aged 62 ± 18 years that WBC and CRP are higher in typical bacterial than in atypical or viral etiology community-acquired pneumonias. Gao et al. showed in their study that high levels of CRP were induced as well as correlated with the complement activation in patients infected with severe influenza A. In our study, we saw no difference in inflammatory markers according to virus etiology.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^c8bb2598]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In early December 2019, a series of pneumonia of unknown causes with clinical features that resemble viral pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) officially named the clinical condition COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) and the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed the virus "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovarales, a family that includes viruses that cause diseases ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). WHO has since characterised COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard reflects that 220 countries have been affected, with 58,425,681 confirmed cases and 1,385,218 deaths globally as of 23 November 2020.

### Clinical features and outcomes of severe pneumonia caused by endemic human coronavirus in adults [^83697eb8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to become the fifth endemic human coronavirus (eHCoV), which would lead to severe SARS-CoV-2–associated pneumonia occurring seasonally. A better understanding of eHCoV-associated pneumonia would help prepare for the postpandemic era. Using 10-year prospective cohort data, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe eHCoV-associated pneumonia compared with those of severe influenza virus (IFV)–associated pneumonia.

### Inflammatory response in mixed viral-bacterial community-acquired pneumonia [^b04c0c6f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest a specific inflammatory profile in mixed viral-bacterial CAP, which is different from that of both bacterial and viral CAP. These findings can be useful by clinicians to include antiviral treatment especially during the influenza season, and to suspect a bacterial role in the case of either symptoms suggesting virus involvement or viral isolation. Interestingly our results were similar when we excluded mixed influenza cases. This is the first study to assess biomarkers in a group of mixed viral-bacterial CAP other than influenza, and compared with bacterial and viral adult CAP. The biomarker profile in this group is different from that of viral CAP. This suggests that the inflammatory response to viruses, even excluding influenza, is different from that in mixed CAP and, therefore, that viruses do not always require a bacterial co-pathogen to produce pneumonia in adults. This may help us better understand the true role of viruses in CAP and, perhaps, encourage the development of effective antiviral drugs. Despite their usefulness in some particular cases, we appear to lack an accurate biomarker to separate bacterial-involved CAP from viral CAP in clinical practice.

Influenza testing in adults with CAP — when influenza is circulating, molecular testing is preferred, with selective testing during low activity. "When influenza viruses are circulating in the community, we recommend testing for influenza with a rapid influenza molecular assay (i.e., influenza nucleic acid amplification test), which is preferred over a rapid influenza diagnostic test (i.e., antigen test) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". The guideline adds, "During periods of low influenza activity, testing can be considered but may not be routinely performed". Supporting context notes, "Rapid influenza tests have become increasingly available, moving from earlier antigen-based detection tests to nucleic acid amplification tests".

### Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children [^4fdde668]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study describes the clinical characteristics of children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia, and assesses the utility of serum biomarkers and clinical signs and symptoms for differentiating definite bacterial from other pneumonias in a highly vaccinated population. There were few differences between children with definite bacterial pneumonia, and those with presumed viral pneumonia, and other pneumonias which were neither definite bacterial nor presumed viral. CRP, WCC and ANC were higher in definite bacterial pneumonia and the CRP had value for distinguishing these from presumed viral and other pneumonias. The combination of high CRP with either fever ≥ 38.0 °C or with absence of rhinorrhoea increased the specificity and PPV compared to elevated CRP alone with little loss in sensitivity, suggesting that combining biomarkers with clinical features is of diagnostic value.

Timely identification of pneumonia aetiology could improve clinical management including decisions about the use of antibiotics. In line with previous studies, the clinical signs and symptoms among cases of definite bacterial and presumed viral pneumonia overlapped and were insufficiently specific in themselves to reliably differentiate one from the other. Our findings are mostly consistent with previous studies which have associated viral pneumonia with low grade fever, tachypnoea, rhinorrhoea and wheezing. We did not attempt to distinguish cases based on specific radiographic features, but others have not found any radiographic feature that can reliably distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia.

### Viral infections in critical care: a narrative review [^45275267]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Other respiratory viruses

There are a range of other respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus, para‐influenza, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. These are well established childhood pathogens, especially in infants, as a frequent cause of respiratory failure secondary to bronchiolitis. Adenoviruses may provoke disease across a range of tissues, including the respiratory tract. Their highly contagious nature can lead to outbreaks and although usually mild, adenoviruses can produce severe disease even in immunocompetent adults. While these non‐influenza respiratory viruses may be detected in up to a quarter of adult patients hospitalised with community‐acquired pneumonia, the pathogenic attribution of pneumonia to these organisms alone is challenging. The syndromic presentation of severe disease in adults is often clinically indistinguishable from influenza or COVID‐19 and requires molecular testing for confirmation. Immunodeficient patients and the elderly are at risk of severe diseases from these viruses, and hospital‐acquired transmission can occur. The use of antivirals, most commonly the broad antiviral compound ribavirin, is not underpinned by strong evidence for these infections. Further, these drugs are not without side effects and use should be guided by expert virological advice.

### Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children [^ba6ef6e6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Other studies have also attempted to discriminate bacterial from viral pneumonia cases using either blood biomarkers, clinical characteristics or radiological differences with modest success. To our knowledge, however, combining inflammatory biomarkers with clinical symptoms has rarely been explored. We found that compared to high CRP (≥ 72 mg/L) alone, high CRP and either fever or absence of rhinorrhoea improved the specificity and PPV with little loss in sensitivity, thereby improving the diagnostic accuracy.

Respiratory bacteria are often detected in the nasopharynx of healthy asymptomatic children, but are rarely detected in normally sterile sites like blood and pleural fluid. Furthermore, purulent pleural effusions are generally considered to be of bacterial origin even if bacteria cannot be detected. Respiratory viruses are usually detectable in the nasopharynx of children with viral pneumonias, but may also be detectable in healthy children. In the absence of any gold standard microbiological assays for distinguishing bacterial from viral and mixed infections, we categorised cases based on whether they were highly likely to be bacterial (definite), most likely viral (presumed), or possibly either based on whether bacteria were detected in sterile sites, respiratory viruses were detected in the nasopharynx, or neither. This pragmatic approach to classification reflects the limitations of current methods, and some misclassification is likely to have occurred. Previous studies categorised cases as either bacterial or viral, are were more limited due to lower pathogen detection rates and by the use of less sensitive assays. The strength of this study is that the range of pathogens tested covered virtually all important bacteria and viruses associated with childhood pneumonia using sensitive molecular techniques.

Our study had some limitations. While there were clear differences between the definite bacterial and the presumed viral and other pneumonia cases, it is likely that a number of the latter groups also had bacterial pneumonia or mixed infections and we note that many had detectable respiratory bacteria in their nasopharyngeal swabs (but not in their blood or pleural fluid). Of note, there were differences between presumed viral pneumonia and other pneumonia cases; the latter were less likely to have rhinorrhoea and tachypnoea suggesting they may comprise a higher proportion of bacterial infections than the presumed viral group. Half of all cases had prior exposure to antibiotics at enrolment which might have impacted on the natural progression of signs and symptoms and biomarkers, and the sensitivity of bacterial culture. Sputum samples are often used for diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in adults but collection of sputum from children is challenging and studies found limited utility of sputum as diagnostic tool for pneumonia.

### Clinical features of human metapneumovirus-associated community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations [^2896a2a8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of respiratory tract infections. Few studies have compared the clinical characteristics and severity of HMPV-associated pneumonia with other pathogens.

Methods

Active, population-based surveillance was previously conducted for radiographically confirmed, community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations among children and adults in 8 United States hospitals. Clinical data and specimens for pathogen detection were systematically collected. We described clinical features of all HMPV-associated pneumonia and, after excluding codetections with other pathogen types, we compared features of HMPV-associated pneumonia with other viral, atypical, and bacterial pneumonia and modeled the severity (mild, moderate, and severe) and length of stay using multivariable proportional odds regression.

Results

HMPV was detected in 298/2358 (12.6%) children and 88/2320 (3.8%) adults hospitalized with pneumonia and was commonly codetected with other pathogens (125/298 [42%] children and 21/88 [24%] adults). Fever and cough were the most common presenting symptoms of HMPV-associated pneumonia and were also common symptoms of other pathogens. After excluding codetections in children (n = 1778), compared to HMPV (reference), bacterial pneumonia exhibited increased severity (odds ratio [OR], 3.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43–9.40), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; OR, 0.76; 95% CI, .59-.99) and atypical (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, .19-.81) infections exhibited decreased severity, and other viral pneumonia exhibited similar severity (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, .55–1.39). In adults (n = 2145), bacterial (OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.87–7.47) and RSV pneumonia (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.32–2.50) were more severe than HMPV (reference), but all other pathogens had similar severity.

Conclusions

Clinical features did not reliably distinguish HMPV-associated pneumonia from other pathogens. HMPV-associated pneumonia was less severe than bacterial and adult RSV pneumonia, but was otherwise as or more severe than other common pathogens.

Testing for viral pathogens — For critically ill patients with new fever and suspected pneumonia, or new upper respiratory infection symptoms (e.g., cough), we suggest testing for viral pathogens using viral NAAT panels (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to allow a recommendation on performing routine blood testing for viral pathogens in immunocompetent patients in the ICU (e.g., herpesviruses, adenovirus). For critically ill patients with a new fever, we recommend testing for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR based on levels of community transmission (best practice statement).

### Meta-analysis of chest CT features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^625c7847]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since 1st December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology, now known as coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19), has been reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The disease has developed a severe pandemic affecting over 200 countries, areas or territories. According to the data from the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 4 May 2020, more than 3 million cases worldwide have been confirmed with over 20 thousand deaths. Here, we work to synthesize the associated literature by meta‐analysis to describe the chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics of common patients and severe patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia.

### Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children [^9d621d52]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Differentiating bacterial from viral pneumonia is important for guiding targeted management and judicious use of antibiotics. We assessed if clinical characteristics and blood inflammatory biomarkers could be used to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia.

Methods

Western Australian children (≤ 17 years) hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia were recruited and clinical symptoms and management data were collected. C-reactive protein (CRP), white cell counts (WCC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were measured as part of routine care. Clinical characteristics and biomarker levels were compared between cases with definite bacterial pneumonia (clinical empyema and/or bacteria detected in blood or pleural fluid), presumed viral pneumonia (presence of ≥ 1 virus in nasopharyngeal swab without criteria for definite bacterial pneumonia), and other pneumonia cases (pneumonia in the absence of criteria for either definite bacterial or presumed viral pneumonia). The area-under-curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for varying biomarker levels were used to characterise their utility for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia. For biomarkers with AUC > 0.8 (fair discriminator), Youden index was measured to determine the optimal cut-off threshold, and sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive and negative) were calculated. We investigated whether better discrimination could be achieved by combining biomarker values with the presence/absence of symptoms.

Results

From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 pneumonia cases were enrolled: 30 with definite bacterial pneumonia, 118 with presumed viral pneumonia and 82 other pneumonia cases. Differences in clinical signs and symptoms across the groups were noted; more definite bacterial pneumonia cases required intravenous fluid and oxygen supplementation than presumed viral or other pneumonia cases. CRP, WCC and ANC were substantially higher in definite bacterial cases. For a CRP threshold of 72 mg/L, the AUC of ROC was 0.82 for discriminating definite bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral pneumonia. Combining the CRP with either the presence of fever (≥ 38 ο C) or the absence of rhinorrhea improved the discrimination.

Conclusions

Combining elevated CRP with the presence or absence of clinical signs/ symptoms differentiates definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia better than CRP alone. Further studies are required to explore combination of biomarkers and symptoms for use as definitive diagnostic tool.

### Deaths from bacterial pneumonia during 1918–19 influenza pandemic [^c66eb9d8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Many influenza experts, policy makers, and knowledgeable observers believe that a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain directly caused most deaths during the 1918–19 pandemic, often from a hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Not surprisingly, plans and resources to respond to the next influenza pandemic focus almost exclusively on the virus, i.e. preventive vaccines and antiviral treatment of infections with a novel influenza strain. However, healthcare providers, medical experts, and published data from the 1918 period suggest that most deaths were caused by secondary bacterial pneumonias; hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to death was considered an alarming but uncommon clinical manifestation (,–).

Undoubtedly, the 1918–19 pandemic strain of influenza had unique pathophysiologic effects. In the wake of its worldwide spread, the number of deaths was unprecedented. However, contemporaneous reports suggest that the pathophysiologic effects of the virus, in and of themselves, did not directly cause most (or even many) of the deaths during the pandemic. If the pandemic strain was not inherently hypervirulent (i.e. if direct pathophysiologic effects of the virus were necessary but not sufficient to cause death in a large proportion of immunologically susceptible hosts) and if bacterial infections were also necessary causes of most deaths during the pandemic, then preparations for the next pandemic should focus on more than preventing and treating infections with a novel influenza strain alone.

We have identified epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the 1918–19 pandemic that are not readily consistent with the view that most deaths were caused by the direct effects of an inherently hypervirulent virus and were clinically expressed as rapidly progressing, ultimately fatal pneumonitis. Our alternative hypothesis is consistent with known characteristics and firsthand accounts of the pandemic and contains implications for preparing for the next pandemic.

Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases have been reported in Wuhan, China. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over the world, especially in China. Based on the published evidence, we systematically discuss the characteristics of COVID-19 in the hope of providing a reference for future studies and help for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

### Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19: a systematic review [^f957f47a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an unprecedented global public health challenge, leading to thousands of deaths every day worldwide. Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19 remain unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19.

Methods

The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and April 6th 2020. No language restrictions were applied. Inclusion criteria were (a) studied patients younger than 18 years old; (b) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (c) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, or radiological examinations.

Results

A total of 38 studies (1124 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1117 had their severity classified: 14.2% were asymptomatic, 36.3% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.1% were severe, and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (47.5%), followed by cough (41.5%), nasal symptoms (11.2%), diarrhea (8.1%), and nausea/vomiting (7.1%). One hundred forty-five (36.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (10.9%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count was reported in 12.9% of cases. Abnormalities in computed tomography were reported in 63.0% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground-glass opacities, patchy shadows, and consolidations. Only one death was reported.

Conclusions

Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from adult cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should not be considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in children.
