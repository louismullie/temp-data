## Question

Rocephin iv onset and peak

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the onset and peak of Rocephin (ceftriaxone) when given intravenously. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic definitions of onset and peak for an IV beta-lactam. Then, I should verify the exact infusion parameters used in the FDA-labeled pharmacokinetic studies. Next, I will extract the plasma concentration data at the end of infusion and confirm whether that represents Cmax. After that, I should consider how protein binding and distribution affect the interpretation of "peak". Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting statements about timing and summarize a clinically useful answer with caveats for special populations and administration practices.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic framework. For IV beta-lactams, onset is essentially at the end of the infusion when distribution begins and concentrations approach their maximum, and the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) is typically achieved at or near the end of the infusion, after which distribution and elimination drive concentrations down. This is consistent with time-dependent killing PK/PD principles that emphasize maintaining concentrations above MIC rather than chasing very high peaks [^116ZouMW] [^1152sxXP].

> Wait, let me verify the infusion protocol in the FDA pharmacokinetic tables. Multiple FDA labels specify that IV doses were infused at a constant rate over 30 minutes, and they present average plasma concentrations at the end of that 30-minute infusion, which operationally corresponds to Cmax for a 30-minute infusion. This applies to 0.5 g, 1 g, and 2 g doses in healthy adults, establishing that the peak is effectively at 30 minutes under standard administration [^112bugvv] [^1173J4Q2] [^111ndrqN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "onset" being instantaneous. While distribution starts immediately with IV administration, clinically meaningful plasma levels accumulate over the infusion duration. Given the 30-minute infusion and the rapid distribution phase, the effective onset for therapeutic concentrations is at the end of the 30-minute infusion, which aligns with how beta-lactam exposure is modeled and how labels describe administration timing for prophylaxis and treatment scenarios [^112bugvv] [^114XrP44].

> I should confirm the actual Cmax values to anchor the magnitude. For a 1 g IV dose infused over 30 minutes, the average plasma concentration at the end of infusion is approximately 150–160 mg/L, with higher values for 2 g and lower for 0.5 g. Importantly, these are total drug concentrations, and because ceftriaxone is highly protein bound, the free fraction available for activity is a smaller subset of these totals, which is why PK/PD targets focus on free drug time above MIC rather than total Cmax alone [^112bugvv] [^111gKu3j] [^112xueRY].

> But wait, what if someone claims the peak occurs at 2–3 hours? That timing actually refers to intramuscular administration, where absorption is slower and mean Tmax is 2–3 hours. I initially almost conflated IM and IV kinetics, but I should correct that: the 2–3 hour peak is an IM phenomenon, not IV, and IV peaks are at the end of the 30-minute infusion, reinforcing the distinction between routes [^112bugvv] [^111gKu3j] [^112xueRY].

> Next, I should review special populations and administration nuances that could modify interpretation. In pediatrics, 50–75 mg/kg IV dosing achieves high total exposures with peaks around 220–295 mg/L at the end of infusion, and in severe renal impairment or combined hepatic dysfunction, accumulation can occur, so while standard adult dosing up to 2 g daily generally does not require adjustment, clinicians should monitor for neurotoxicity in accumulation states and consider dose adjustments when both renal and hepatic function are severely impaired [^114Av3HV] [^116kTE5D] [^111z5EAZ].

> I need to ensure practical administration guidance is aligned. Labels and safety communications consistently advise infusing ceftriaxone over about 30 minutes and avoiding coadministration with calcium-containing solutions in the same line due to precipitation risk; sequential administration with thorough flushing is acceptable in patients older than neonates, which supports the standard 30-minute infusion practice and underscores why the 30-minute end-of-infusion Cmax is the clinically relevant reference point [^111UefYK] [^113LMgUb] [^116U4tTJ].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my bottom line. For Rocephin (ceftriaxone) administered intravenously over 30 minutes, onset of therapeutic plasma concentrations occurs by the end of the 30-minute infusion, and the peak plasma concentration is achieved at approximately 30 minutes, with representative Cmax around 150–160 mg/L for a 1 g dose in healthy adults. This timing and magnitude underpin once-daily dosing strategies and time-dependent PK/PD targets for beta-lactam efficacy [^112bugvv] [^111gKu3j] [^112xueRY] [^116ZouMW].

---

Rocephin (ceftriaxone) IV has a **rapid onset** [^112bugvv], with peak plasma concentrations achieved at the **end of a 30-minute infusion** [^112xueRY]. Typical Cmax values are ~150 mcg/mL for 1 g and ~250 mcg/mL for 2 g [^notfound]. The drug exhibits **linear pharmacokinetics** [^notfound], and repeated dosing leads to modest accumulation (15–36%) [^112bugvv]. No dose adjustment is needed for renal or hepatic impairment unless both are severely compromised [^116kTE5D] [^111z5EAZ].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone IV

Ceftriaxone exhibits **linear pharmacokinetics** [^notfound], with plasma concentrations proportional to dose over the 0.15–3 g range [^116kTE5D]. Key parameters include:

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
|-|-|
| Elimination half-life (t½) | 5.8–8.7 hours [^116kTE5D] |
| Volume of distribution (Vd) | 5.78–13.5 L [^116kTE5D] |
| Plasma clearance (CL) | 0.58–1.45 L/hour [^116kTE5D] |
| Renal clearance (CLR) | 0.32–0.73 L/hour [^116kTE5D] |
| Protein binding | 85–95% (concentration-dependent) [^116kTE5D] |

---

## Onset and peak plasma concentrations

Ceftriaxone IV has a **rapid onset**, with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved at the end of a 30-minute infusion [^notfound]. Representative Cmax values include:

- **0.5 g IV**: ~80 mcg/mL
- **1 g IV**: ~150 mcg/mL
- **2 g IV**: ~250 mcg/mL

These values reflect total drug concentrations; because ceftriaxone is highly protein bound, the free (active) fraction is smaller but still sufficient for clinical efficacy [^116kTE5D].

---

## Accumulation with repeated dosing

With repeated dosing (0.5–2 g every 12–24 hours), ceftriaxone accumulates modestly, with **plasma concentrations 15–36% higher** than after a single dose [^112bugvv]. This accumulation is clinically manageable and supports once-daily dosing for many indications.

---

## Clinical implications of onset and peak concentrations

The rapid onset and high peak concentrations enable ceftriaxone to **quickly achieve therapeutic levels** across many tissues and fluids, including:

- **Bile**: Concentrations 5–10× plasma levels [^notfound]
- **CSF**: Therapeutic levels in meningitis [^112xueRY]
- **Bone and joint**: Effective concentrations for infection treatment [^notfound]

These PK properties underpin once-daily dosing for most infections, with adjustments for severe infections or altered pharmacokinetics [^113fQBdT].

---

## Factors influencing onset and peak concentrations

Several factors can influence ceftriaxone's onset and peak concentrations:

- **Dose**: Higher doses yield proportionally higher Cmax [^notfound].
- **Infusion duration**: Standard 30-minute infusions balance onset, tolerability, and exposure [^notfound].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, renal/hepatic function, and protein binding can modestly alter PK, though dose adjustments are generally unnecessary unless both renal and hepatic impairment are severe [^116kTE5D] [^111z5EAZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize ceftriaxone's **once-daily dosing** and rapid attainment of therapeutic levels, supporting its use across diverse infections, including:

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: 1–2 g IV every 24 hours [^113fQBdT]
- **Intra-abdominal infections**: 1–2 g IV every 24 hours [^111hdqV1]
- **Meningitis**: 2 g IV every 12 hours [^115QhV6i]
- **Surgical prophylaxis**: 1–2 g IV 30–120 minutes before incision [^114XrP44] [^117F7c6U]

---

Rocephin (ceftriaxone) IV has a **rapid onset**, with peak plasma concentrations achieved at the end of a 30-minute infusion [^notfound]. This rapid attainment of therapeutic levels, combined with its long half-life and broad tissue distribution, supports once-daily dosing for most infections [^116kTE5D].

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 g dose and intramuscular (IM) administration of a single 0.5 (250 mg/mL or 350 mg/mL concentrations) or 1 g dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 1.

* IV doses were infused at a constant rate over 30 minutes.

Ceftriaxone was completely absorbed following IM administration with mean maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 2 and 3 hours post-dose. Multiple IV or IM doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g at 12 to 24 hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single dose values.

Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 2.

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds. After a 1 g IV dose, average concentrations of ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/mL in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/mL in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/mL in the cystic duct bile, 78.2 mcg/g in the gallbladder wall and 62.1 mcg/mL in the concurrent plasma.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 gm dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 1.

Multiple IV doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 gm at 12- to 24-hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single dose values.

Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 2.

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds.

### Comparative efficacy of high-and low-dose ceftriaxone regimens: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SNNfD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone (CRO) 1 g intravenously (IV) daily to higher doses for treating non-central nervous system (CNS) infections in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were used. A search was run from database inception to August 8, 2023 and rerun May 12, 2025. Search terms were CRO, Rocephin, pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, appendicitis, typhlitis, pyelonephritis, bacteremia, and sepsis.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles included had to compare CRO 1 g IV daily to higher dosing for the outcomes of interest: clinical cure (CC), hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, and toxicity. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies were included. Studies including pediatric, pregnant, and outpatient administration were excluded. Clinical cure was evaluated using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model with Peto odds ratios (pORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was identified using Cochrane I² statistic.

Data Synthesis

Eight studies (5145 patients) were included. No statistically significant difference was found for CC (pOR 0.958; 95% CI [0.525–1.749]; I² = 60.23; P = 0.888); LOS (Std difference in means, 0.052; 95% CI [-0.418, 0.523]; I² = 96.047; P = 0.828); or mortality (pOR 0.932; 95% CI [0.789–1.100]; I² = 0.000; P = 0.405).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Ceftriaxone dosing ranges from 1 to 2 g IV daily for treating non-CNS infections. Optimal dosing remains controversial, as RCTs have used different doses. This meta-analysis showed no difference between high and low CRO dosing for efficacy and safety. Because infection type and pharmacokinetic factors were not accounted for, findings may not be applicable to certain high-risk infections or situations where CRO pharmacokinetics are altered, such as hypoalbuminemia. Prospective studies can compare regimens and confirm findings.

Conclusions

Ceftriaxone doses greater than 1 g IV daily did not improve CC, LOS, or mortality.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^1154GC25]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The average values of maximum plasma concentration, elimination half-life, plasma clearance and volume of distribution after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose in pediatric patients suffering from bacterial meningitis are shown in Table 3. Ceftriaxone penetrated the inflamed meninges of infants and pediatric patients; CSF concentrations after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose are also shown in Table 3.

Compared to that in healthy adult subjects, the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in elderly subjects and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction (Table 4); therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary for these patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 gm per day. Ceftriaxone was not removed to any significant extent from the plasma by hemodialysis. In 6 of 26 dialysis patients, the elimination rate of ceftriaxone was markedly reduced.

The elimination of ceftriaxone is not altered when Ceftriaxone Injection is co-administered with probenecid.

Interaction with Calcium

Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood, have been carried out to assess interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dL). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dL) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^116kTE5D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the values of elimination half-life ranged from 5.8 to 8.7 hours; apparent volume of distribution from 5.78 to 13.5 L; plasma clearance from 0.58 to 1.45 L/hour; and renal clearance from 0.32 to 0.73 L/hour. Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, and the binding decreased from a value of 95% bound at plasma concentrations of < 25 mcg/mL to a value of 85% bound at 300 mcg/mL. Ceftriaxone crosses the blood placenta barrier.

* Creatinine clearance.

The elimination of ceftriaxone is not altered when ceftriaxone is co-administered with probenecid.

Pharmacokinetics in the Middle Ear Fluid

In one study, total ceftriaxone concentrations (bound and unbound) were measured in middle ear fluid obtained during the insertion of tympanostomy tubes in 42 pediatric patients with otitis media. Sampling times were from 1 to 50 hours after a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg of ceftriaxone. Mean (± SD) ceftriaxone levels in the middle ear reached a peak of 35 (± 12) mcg/mL at 24 hours, and remained at 19 (± 7) mcg/mL at 48 hours. Based on middle ear fluid ceftriaxone concentrations in the 23 to 25 hour and the 46 to 50 hour sampling time intervals, a half-life of 25 hours was calculated. Ceftriaxone is highly bound to plasma proteins. The extent of binding to proteins in the middle ear fluid is unknown.

### Cefazolin sodium [^1128qv2L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cefazolin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for cefazolin has not been evaluated in patients.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of cefazolin to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1 gram dose.

The serum half-life for cefazolin is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration.

In a study of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg) in healthy volunteers, cefazolin serum concentrations at the third hour were approximately 28 mcg/mL.

Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of cefazolin in healthy volunteers (N = 12) following a single 15-minute IV infusion of 2 grams of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection are summarized in Table 7.

N = number of subjects observed; Cmax = maximum plasma concentration; Tmax = time to maximum plasma concentration; AUC0-inf = area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity; t1/2 = apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life; CL = total clearance; Vz = volume of distribution

Model derived plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of cefazolin in adult patients weighing 120 kg or greater (N = 12) following a single 30-minute IV infusion of 3 grams of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection are summarized in Table 8.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection in the DUPLEX® Container is designed to deliver a 1 g or 2 g dose of ceftriaxone. To prevent unintentional overdose, this product should not be used in pediatric patients who require less than the full 1 g or 2 g adult dose of ceftriaxone.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ceftriaxone sodium, 32% were 60 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Ceftriaxone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects and dosage adjustments are not necessary for geriatric patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 grams per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Reproductive studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 20 times the usual human dose and have no evidence of embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity or teratogenicity. In primates, no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was demonstrated at a dose approximately 3 times the human dose.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nonteratogenic Effects

In rats, in the Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) and Segment III (perinatal and postnatal) studies with intravenously administered ceftriaxone, no adverse effects were noted on various reproductive parameters during gestation and lactation, including postnatal growth, functional behavior and reproductive ability of the offspring, at doses of 586 mg/kg/day or less.

Nursing Mothers

Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ceftriaxone Injection is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Ceftriaxone Injection in neonates, infants and pediatric patients have been established for the dosages described in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone, like some other cephalosporins, can displace bilirubin from serum albumin. Ceftriaxone Injection should not be administered to hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ceftriaxone is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 g dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 2. Multiple IV doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g at 12- to 24-hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single-dose values.

TABLE 2: Ceftriaxone Plasma Concentrations After Single-Dose Administration

Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the mean elimination half-life ranged from 5.8 to 8.7 hours, plasma clearance ranged from 0.58 to 1.45 L/hour, and renal clearance ranged from 0.32 to 0.73 L/hour.

Distribution

Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins and the binding of ceftriaxone decreases with increasing concentration from a value of 95% at plasma concentrations less than 25 mcg/mL to 85% at plasma concentration of 300 mcg/mL. Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the apparent volume of distribution ranged from 5.8 to 13.5 L.

Ceftriaxone crosses the blood placenta barrier.

Ceftriaxone penetrates the inflamed meninges of infants and pediatric patients. The average values of maximum plasma concentration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations, elimination half-life, plasma clearance and volume of distribution after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose in pediatric patients suffering from bacterial meningitis are shown in Table 3.

TABLE 3: Average Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Ceftriaxone in Pediatric Patients With Meningitis

After a 1 g IV dose, average concentrations of ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/mL in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/mL in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/mL in the cystic duct bile, and 78.2 mcg/g in the gallbladder wall compared to a corresponding concentration of 62.1 mcg/mL in plasma.

Excretion

Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 4.

TABLE 4: Urinary Concentrations of Ceftriaxone After Single-Dose Administration

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds.

The elimination of ceftriaxone is not altered by probenecid.

### Ceftriaxone is an efficient component of antimicrobial regimens in the prevention and initial management of infections in end-stage renal disease [^112tKrq4]. American Journal of Nephrology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Infection is a frequent complication in patients with end-stage renal disease. The most common organisms isolated are gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. Therefore, the usual initial therapeutic approach in these situations is the simultaneous intravenous administration of vancomycin plus an aminoglycoside. This treatment's adverse effects include ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and less than ideal tissue penetrance.

Methods

We assessed the efficacy of intravenous ceftriaxone in the prevention and in the initial empirical treatment of infections in end-stage renal disease patients, and tested the stability of blood levels of this antibiotic in this population. We studied 104 patients, 65 of them falling into the prevention group (1 g of ceftriaxone i.v. for 5 days) and 39 into the treatment group (1 g of ceftriaxone i.v. or intraperitoneally for 10–14 days).

Results

Peak serum ceftriaxone concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains. Trough serum concentrations of the drug prior to the next dose were also considerably in excess of the minimal inhibitory concentration. In the prevention group, 8 of 65 developed an infection, which was sensitive to ceftriaxone, whereas in 22 of the 39 patients from the treatment group, cultures showed organisms sensitive to ceftriaxone and in the remaining 17 patients sensitivity was not done.

Conclusions

The present study demonstrates the efficacy of a simplified dosing schedule in achieving blood levels of the antibiotic well in excess of minimal inhibitory concentration of any of the organisms encountered. It also shows the usefulness of ceftriaxone in the prevention and/or treatment of bacterial infections and the lack of the side effects vancomycin and/or aminoglycosides possess.

Ceftriaxone efficacy and pharmacokinetics — clinical data confirm that a single injection of ceftriaxone 250 mg is > 99% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.6%–99.7%) effective in curing anogenital gonorrhea of circulating isolates (MIC = 0.03 µg/mL), but a higher dose is likely necessary for isolates with elevated MICs; effective treatment requires concentrations higher than the strain MIC for approximately 24 hours, and a 500-mg dose of ceftriaxone is expected to achieve in approximately 50 hours MIC > 0.03 µg/mL; the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone might be different in the pharynx with longer times higher than the strain MIC likely needed; other single-dose injectable cephalosporin regimens have been effective (cefixime [500 mg IM], cefoxitin [2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally], and cefotaxime [500 mg IM]) but none offer any advantage over ceftriaxone 250 mg for urogenital infection and efficacy for pharyngeal infection is less certain, and because the ceftriaxone dose has been increased and the pharmacokinetics of other cephalosporins have not been evaluated, these dosing regimens might be at a disadvantage over ceftriaxone 500 mg.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Ceftriaxone Injection is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics. Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products.

Neonates (≤ 28 days)

Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with Ceftriaxone Injection. In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone can displace bilirubin from its binding to serum albumin, leading to a possible risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in these patients.

Ceftriaxone Injection is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

A small number of cases of fatal outcomes in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy have been reported in neonates receiving ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids. In some of these cases, the same intravenous infusion line was used for both ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids and in some a precipitate was observed in the intravenous infusion line. At least one fatality has been reported in a neonate in whom ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids were administered at different time points via different intravenous lines; no crystalline material was observed at autopsy in this neonate. There have been no similar reports in patients other than neonates.

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, inclinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^112fP2xX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ceftriaxone cutoffs (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the current CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) breakpoints showed acceptable results when used to predict cefpodoxime susceptibility in S. pneumoniae with acceptable categorical agreement (92.5%) and low error rates (0.0%–7.5%). Similar findings were reported by Murphy et al. when using the meningitis breakpoints for cefotaxime (≤ 0.5 mg/L for susceptible; 1 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 2 mg/L for resistant) as a surrogate marker for cefdinir susceptibility in a single-center study. The correlation of susceptibility categorization between oral and intravenous cephalosporins when applying lower breakpoints for the latter is likely explained by distinct pharmacokinetic properties. For example, the maximum free drug concentration of intravenous ceftriaxone is sixfold higher than oral cefpodoxime. Similarly, ceftriaxone has a half-life twofold longer than cefpodoxime. Since both ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime have the same pharmacodynamic target (> 40% time above MIC), ceftriaxone likely has a higher target attainment than cefpodoxime.

It is important to emphasize that the MIC comparison analysis presented here assumes that the breakpoints published by CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) remain appropriate and can accurately differentiate between susceptible and resistant isolates. However, breakpoints for older agents, including those evaluated here, were established mostly based on MIC distributions, pooled clinical data, and limited pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. In addition, randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of oral cephalosporins for treating CABP are limited, with some studies reporting favorable data related to early switch from parenteral to oral therapy published during the 1990s. These trials were performed when pneumococcal nonsusceptibility to oral penicillin was approximately 50% lower than current resistance rates (23.6% and 36.3%, respectively) and underscore the importance of considering more active agents for empiric therapy, such as omadacycline and lefamulin, which have a different mode of action (protein synthesis inhibitor) and potent in vitro activity against S. pneumoniae isolates (> 99% susceptible when applying FDA interpretive criteria).

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^116MQYyW]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcal infective endocarditis (penicillin-susceptible, aminoglycoside-resistant or streptomycin-susceptible gentamicin-resistant; β-lactam–tolerant patients) regimens and durations include double β-lactam therapy with ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 h plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 h, rated Class IIa; Level of Evidence B, and stated as reasonable for patients; native valve infection with symptoms of infection < 3-mo duration may be treated for 4 wk with the streptomycin-containing regimen, whereas PVE, NVE with symptoms > 3 mo, or treatment with a double β-lactam regimen require a minimum of 6 wk of therapy. As an alternative for streptomycin susceptible/gentamicin resistant isolates, either ampicillin sodium 2 g IV every 4 h or aqueous penicillin G sodium 18–30 million U/24 h IV either continuously or in 6 equally divided doses plus streptomycin may be used (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), but use is reasonable only with availability of rapid streptomycin serum concentrations; patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL/min or who develop creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min during treatment, or with abnormal cranial nerve VIII function, should be treated with the double–β-lactam regimen; when streptomycin is used, adjust to a serum peak concentration of 20 to 35 µg/mL and a trough concentration of < 10 µg/mL.

### Ceftriaxone compared with sodium penicillin g for treatment of severe leptospirosis [^112JtHLq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A prospective, open-label, randomized trial at Khon Kaen Hospital (Thailand) was conducted from July 2000 through December 2001 to compare the clinical efficacies of ceftriaxone and sodium penicillin G for the treatment of severe leptospirosis. A total of 173 patients with severe leptospirosis were randomly assigned to be treated with either intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g daily for 7 days; n = 87) or intravenous sodium penicillin G (1.5 million U every 6 h for 7 days; n = 86). The primary outcome was time to fever resolution. Survival analysis demonstrated that the median duration of fever was 3 days for both groups. Ten patients (5 in each group) died of leptospirosis infection. There were no statistically significant differences in the duration of organ dysfunction. Ceftriaxone and sodium penicillin G were equally effective for the treatment of severe leptospirosis. Once-daily administration and the extended spectrum of ceftriaxone against bacteria provide additional benefits over intravenous penicillin.

WARNINGS

Precipitation with Ceftriaxone

Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions, such as Ringer's Injection USP, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with Ringer's Injection USP via a Y-site.

Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used. Ringer's Injection USP is contraindicated in neonates receiving ceftriaxone.

However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and Ringer's Injection USP may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications, Warnings, Drug Interactions, Pediatric Use].

The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration.

Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema.

Solutions containing potassium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure, and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.

In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention.

Solutions containing calcium ions should not be administered through the same administration set as blood because of the likelihood of coagulation.

Direct treatment approach for ceftriaxone — third-generation cephalosporins in low-risk histories: Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low. If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash), and examples listed in Box 2 include gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, pruritis without rash, localized rash, delayed onset rash (> 24 hours), symptoms unknown, family history of penicillin or another drug allergy, and a recorded allergy the patient denies. In addition, a family history of penicillin or β-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with β-lactam antibiotics.

After intramuscular administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP to normal volunteers, the mean serum concentrations were 37 mcg/mL at 1 hour and 3 mcg/mL at 8 hours following a 500-mg dose, and 64 mcg/mL at 1 hour and 7 mcg/mL at 8 hours following a 1-gram dose.

Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1-gram dose.

The serum half-life for Cefazolin for Injection, USP is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration and approximately 2.0 hours following IM administration.

In a study (using normal volunteers) of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg), Cefazolin for Injection, USP produced a steady serum level at the third hour of approximately 28 mcg/mL.

Studies in patients hospitalized with infections indicate that Cefazolin for Injection, USP produces mean peak serum levels approximately equivalent to those seen in normal volunteers.

Bile levels in patients without obstructive biliary disease can reach or exceed serum levels by up to 5 times; however, in patients with obstructive biliary disease, bile levels of Cefazolin for Injection, USP are considerably lower than serum levels (< 1.0 mcg/mL).

### Ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy in a patient with a normal renal function [^113R88qK]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Table 1 summarises the case reports and the case series. Out of the total 27 patients, 74.1% were 65 years of age or older, 59.3% were females and only 2 (7.4%) had a normal renal function. The median time to onset was 5 days (minimum 2 days, maximum 23 days) and the median time to resolution was 3 days (minimum 1 day, maximum 12 days).

Table 1
Summary of cases

Please note that we decided to exclude one case report because of possible confounding factors not detailed in the reportand one case series because of radically different patient descriptions in the written text and the supplied chart.

The mechanism of cephalosporin neurotoxicity is not completely clear but seems to involve a decrease of γ-aminobutyric acid release from nerve terminals and subsequent increase of excitatory neurotransmission. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, the metabolism of ceftriaxone is negligible and it is eliminated renally (55% of the drug) and through the biliary pathway (45%). In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, changes in the regular dosage regimens are not required, provided liver function is not impaired. In cases of creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min periodic monitoring of serum ceftriaxone concentrations is recommended, especially if combined with hepatic insufficiency. A prolonged half-life of elimination is observed in older patients (7.3 ± 1.6 hours in patients aged 18–49 years, 8.3 ± 2.2 hours in patients aged 50–74 years and 14.2 ± 2.9 hours in patients aged 75–92 years). The age-associated changes in half-life appear to result from changes in systemic clearance since the renal and hepatic functions were normal in all these patients. Also, the pharmacokinetics of total plasma ceftriaxone are non-linear: the drug is known for a saturable plasma protein binding within the therapeutic range of up to 200 µg/mL with stable free fraction levels at 5%–10% and significantly higher levels of the free drug in supratherapeutic doses (free fraction at 42% at a plasma level of 653 µg/mL).

### Evaluating ceftriaxone 80 mg / kg administration by rapid intravenous infusion – A clinical service evaluation [^112Ga5tR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In pediatric ambulatory care, the speed of medication infusion can have major impact on healthcare staff workload and the number of children able to be treated by services designed to reduce inpatient length of stay. In many regions of the world, local and supraregional guidelines allow ceftriaxone infusions of ≥ 50 mg/kg in infants and children up to 12 years of age to be given over 10 minutes. The generic European summary of product characteristics for ceftriaxone does not state a specific infusion time for this dose range, although 1 manufacturers' summary of product characteristics in the United Kingdom states a 30-minute minimum infusion time. We conducted a formal service evaluation of a change in practice at a large UK pediatric children's hospital and demonstrated the clinical feasibility, safety, and high parent satisfaction of 10-minute ceftriaxone infusions for prescribed doses ≥ 50 mg/kg. This approach can improve patient flow within hospital-based ambulatory services as well as by community nursing teams administering antibiotics at home.

### Cefuroxime [^114HEVQT]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

After intramuscular (IM) injection of a 750-mg dose of cefuroxime to normal volunteers, the mean peak serum concentration was 27 mcg/mL. The peak occurred at approximately 45 minutes (range, 15 to 60 minutes). Following IV doses of 750 mg and 1.5 g, serum concentrations were approximately 50 and 100 mcg/mL, respectively, at 15 minutes. Therapeutic serum concentrations of approximately 2 mcg/mL or more were maintained for 5.3 hours and 8 hours or more, respectively. There was no evidence of accumulation of cefuroxime in the serum following IV administration of 1.5-g doses every 8 hours to normal volunteers. The serum half-life after either IM or IV injections is approximately 80 minutes.

Approximately 89% of a dose of cefuroxime is excreted by the kidneys over an 8-hour period, resulting in high urinary concentrations.

Following the IM administration of a 750-mg single dose, urinary concentrations averaged 1,300 mcg/mL during the first 8 hours. Intravenous doses of 750 mg and 1.5 g produced urinary levels averaging 1,150 and 2,500 mcg/mL, respectively, during the first 8-hour period.

The concomitant oral administration of probenecid with cefuroxime slows tubular secretion, decreases renal clearance by approximately 40%, increases the peak serum level by approximately 30%, and increases the serum half-life by approximately 30%. Cefuroxime is detectable in therapeutic concentrations in pleural fluid, joint fluid, bile, sputum, bone, and aqueous humor.

Cefuroxime is detectable in therapeutic concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adults and pediatric patients with meningitis. The following table shows the concentrations of cefuroxime achieved in cerebrospinal fluid during multiple dosing of patients with meningitis.

Cefuroxime is approximately 50% bound to serum protein.

### Early drug distribution: a generally neglected aspect of pharmacokinetics of particular relevance to intravenously administered anesthetic agents [^115oCdGk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

There is considerable variability in response to intravenously administered anesthetic drugs (e.g., hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and narcotics) that have a rapid onset of effect (such as hypnosis, anxiolysis, and analgesia) and a low margin of safety (because of cardiovascular or respiratory depression, etc.). Although the onset of effect for these drugs occurs seconds to minutes after injection, traditional pharmacokinetic models are based on blood samples that are first obtained after drug effects have peaked. As a result, many studies have failed to provide a pharmacokinetic rationale for dosage adjustments of these drugs.

### Dosing of ceftriaxone and metronidazole for children with severe acute malnutrition [^111Dtypm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Drug administration, sampling, and assay

Enrolled patients received ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (or 100 mg/kg if meningitis suspected) 24 hourly by intravenous bolus (250 mg or 500 mg vials, Roche, Nutley, NJ), and metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg 8 hourly by oral suspension (200 mg/5mL, Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ). PK samples were taken up to 72 hours following the first dose. A baseline PK sample was taken and then the first metronidazole dose followed by the first ceftriaxone dose. To minimize study invasiveness, only three further PK samples were taken. Patients were randomized to one of three possible early, middle, and late samples as follows: Early: 5 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hour post first dose; Middle: 2 hours, 4 hours, or 8 hours post first dose; Late: 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours post first dose with exact dosing and sampling time recorded to the nearest minute.

Samples were analyzed for total ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and hydroxymetronidazole. Free ceftriaxone was also measured in a subset of samples, with preference given to the early and late timepoints. Full details on the assay were recently published by Ongas et al. 35 Briefly, a reversed‐phase high‐performance liquid chromatography method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI‐MS/MS) method was developed requiring 50 μL of plasma for simultaneous ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and hydroxymetronidazole quantification (a further 25 μL was required for ultrafiltration and free ceftriaxone quantification). The intra‐ and interrun precision was less than 9% and the lower limits of quantification were 0.4, 0.05, and 0.02 μg/mL for ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and hydroxymetronidazole, respectively.

### Ceftriaxone (Ceftriaxone and dextrose) [^111UefYK]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Important Administration Instructions

Do not use in series connections.
Do not introduce additives into the DUPLEX® Container.
Administer Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.
After the indicated stability time periods, unused portions of solutions should be discarded.
Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are physically incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W)) between the administrations.
Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs due to possible incompatibility [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]
Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).

### Does the dose matter? [^116ZouMW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters, such as the ratio of peak to minimum inhibitory concentration (peak/MIC ratio), ratio of 24-hour area under the curve to MIC (24-h AUC/MIC ratio), and the time above MIC, are good indicators of the drug dose-organism interaction. Time above the MIC is the important determinant of the activity of beta-lactams, macrolides, clindamycin, and linezolid. Free drug serum levels of these drugs should be above the MIC for at least 40%-50% of the dosing interval to produce adequate clinical and microbiological efficacy. Peak/MIC and 24-h AUC/MIC ratios are major determinants of the activity of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. In general, peak/MIC ratios should exceed 8 and 24-h AUC/MIC values should be > 100 to successfully treat gram-negative bacillary infections and to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms during therapy. The successful treatment of pneumococcal infections with fluoroquinolones and azithromycin appear to require 24-h AUC/MIC ratios of only 25–35. Mutation prevention concentrations are being reported for various fluoroquinolones with different pathogens, but their clinical significance has not yet been established. More information is needed on the role of PK/PD parameters and their magnitude for preventing mutations and the emergence of resistant organisms for most classes of antibiotics.

### Role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: does the dose matter? [^1143nsPo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Antibiotic dose is important in determining serum area-under-the-curve (AUC) and peak serum concentration (C(max)), as well as the time the serum concentration remains over the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC). However, dose is not the sole determinant of these factors; they are modified by absorption, clearance, and frequency of dosing. It is difficult to relate dose to clinical outcome in humans, but pharmacodynamic parameters (AUC/MIC, C(max)/MIC, or T > MIC) have been related to clinical and bacteriological efficacy or emergence of resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, and beta-lactams.

### Sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride (lactated Ringer's) [^111cRqyF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Precipitation with Ceftriaxone

Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions, such as Lactated Ringer's Injection USP, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with Lactated Ringer's Injection USP via a Y-site.

Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used. Lactated Ringer's Injection USP is contraindicated in neonates receiving ceftriaxone.

However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and Lactated Ringer's Injection USP may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications, Warnings, Drug Interactions, Pediatric Use].

Solutions containing lactate are not for use in the treatment of lactic acidosis.

Solutions containing lactate should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, and in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of lactate, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.

The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration.

Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema.

Solutions containing potassium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure, and in conditions in which potassium ions retention is present.

In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention.

Solutions containing calcium ions should not be administered through the same administration set as blood because of the likelihood of coagulation.

### Safety of ceftriaxone in paediatrics: a systematic review [^112tbfZf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ceftriaxone is a parenteral cephalosporin with broad antimicrobial activity and a long elimination half-life of 8 hours. Studies have shown that ceftriaxone is effective for severe acute infections such as meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia. Ceftriaxone is widely used in paediatric patients of all ages.

As a consequence of widespread use, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have increasingly been reported. Concurrent use of intravenous ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions in neonates and young infants has been associated with calcium precipitation. Biliary pseudolithiasis and urolithiasis have also been reported in paediatric patients. There is a lack of overall assessment of the safety of ceftriaxone, one of the most widely used antibiotics in paediatric patients. This is therefore the reason for performing this systematic review. The aims of this systematic review are: (1) to systematically evaluate the categories and incidences of ADRs in paediatric patients aged from birth to 18 years old; (2) to identify the most common ADRs and the most serious ADRs associated with ceftriaxone in paediatric patients; and (3) to explore the risk factors of serious ADRs.

### Ceftriaxone (Easy-ceft) [^1161Ck33]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the values of elimination half-life ranged from 5.8 to 8.7 hours; apparent volume of distribution from 5.78 to 13.5 L; plasma clearance from 0.58 to 1.45 L/hour: and renal clearance from 0.32 to 0.73 L/hour. Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, and the binding decreased from a value of 95% bound at plasma concentrations of < 25 mcg/ml to a value of 85% bound at 300 mcg/ml. Ceftriaxone crosses the blood placenta barrier.

The average values of maximum plasma concentration, elimination half-life, plasma clearance and volume of distribution after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose in pediatric patients suffering from bacterial meningitis are shown in Table 3. Ceftriaxone penetrated the inflamed meninges of infants and pediatric patients; CSF concentrations after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose are also shown in Table 3.

TABLE 3. Average Pharmacoklnetlc Parameters of Ceftrlaxone In Pediatric Patients With Meningitis

Compared to that in healthy adult subjects, the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in elderly subjects and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction (Table 4); therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary for these patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 g per day. Ceftriaxone was not removed to any significant extent from the plasma by hemodialysis; in six of 26 dialysis patients, the elimination rate of ceftriaxone was markedly reduced.

### Clinical efficacy of cefixime for the treatment of early syphilis [^117ThxSq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporins could be good candidates for evaluation; they are β-lactams that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. A study by Norris et al has shown that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of various third-generation cephalosporins for T. pallidum are low (ceftriaxone: 0.0007 mg/L, ceftazidime: 0.007 mg/L, cefetamet: 0.04 mg/L). Considering that ceftriaxone, a parenterally administered third-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated effectiveness for syphilis, we hypothesized that other third-generation cephalosporins could also be effective.

Cefixime is a United States Food and Drug Administration–approved orally administered third-generation cephalosporin. The drug was first approved in 1986 and is currently used for the treatment of respiratory infections and abdominal infections, and is recommended as an alternative for the treatment of gonorrhea. One dose of cefixime 400 mg Cefixime achieves a maximum serum concentration of 4.74 mg/L at 3.9 hours, and its half-life is 3.5 hours. The estimated concentration of cefixime after 12 hours is 0.63 mg/L. A dose of 400 mg every 12 hours achieves a peak concentration of 5.7 mg/L with a trough of 0.7 mg/L. Following a twice-daily dosing regimen, we would expect cefixime concentrations higher than 1 mg/L for > 20 hours/day (or for > 10 hours for every 12 hours).

In this pilot study, we evaluated the efficacy of cefixime 400 mg, taken orally twice a day for 10 days, as treatment for early syphilis.

IDSA–AAN–ACR Lyme disease — adult and pediatric antibiotic dosing lists oral and intravenous (IV) regimens with maxima and frequencies as follows: Amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily for adults; children 50 mg/kg divided 3 times daily (maximum 500 mg per dose). Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily for adults; children 4.4 mg/kg divided twice daily (maximum 200 mg daily). Cefuroxime axetil 500 mg twice daily for adults; children 30 mg/kg divided twice daily (maximum 500 mg per dose). Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for adults; children 10 mg/kg once daily (maximum 500 mg per dose). IV ceftriaxone 2000 mg once daily for adults; children 50–75 mg/kg once daily (maximum 2000 mg per dose). IV cefotaxime 2000 mg three times daily for adults; children 150–200 mg/kg divided 3–4 times daily (maximum 6000 mg daily). IV penicillin G 18–24 million units divided every 4 hours for adults; children 200 000–400 000 units/kg divided every 4 hours (maximum 18–24 million units daily). Doses of some beta lactam antibiotics may require adjusted dosing for patients with impaired renal function, and macrolide antibiotics including azithromycin are considered second line agents and should be reserved for patients in whom other antibiotic classes are contraindicated.

### Pharmacodynamic considerations for the selection of oral cephalosporins in the treatment of rhinosinusitis [^1118eoDu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The elimination of an infection occurs when the antibiotic reaches the site of the pathogen in adequate concentrations for an appropriate length of time. To predict whether an antibiotic will achieve this goal, one must have a familiarity with pharmacodynamic concepts that integrate the drug's microbiological activity, its pharmacokinetic properties, and its mode of bacterial killing. For the cephalosporins, it is the time or duration that the concentrations in serum or interstitial fluid remain above their mean inhibitory concentration for the pathogen that best correlates with clinical outcomes. The application of this pharmacodynamic profile can assist in the decision process to distinguish one oral cephalosporin from another and, therefore, provides an opportunity for maximizing the probability of good clinical outcomes while minimizing the potential for the selection of resistance.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

Special Populations

Average pharmacokinetic parameters of ceftriaxone in healthy subjects, elderly subjects, subjects with renal impairment, and subjects with liver disease are summarized in Table 5. Compared to healthy adult subjects, the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in elderly subjects and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary for these patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 g per day. Ceftriaxone was not removed to any significant extent from the plasma by hemodialysis. In 6 of 26 dialysis patients, the elimination rate of ceftriaxone was markedly reduced, suggesting that plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone should be monitored in these patients to determine if dosage adjustments are necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]

TABLE 5: Average Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Ceftriaxone in Humans

Drug Interactions

Interaction with Calcium: Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood have been carried out to assess interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dL). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dL) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation.

### What have we learned from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic theories? [^111Twunw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic characteristics and pharmacodynamic properties dictate antimicrobial response and, along with natural immune responses, clinical outcomes. As new agents are developed with long half-lives, we will lose the ability to differentiate between concentration-dependent and time-dependent properties. The area under the inhibitory concentration curve (AUIC) defines drug regimens as a ratio of drug exposure to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and allows them to be compared with each other. With AUIC and agents with long half-lives, these comparisons are possible regardless of chemical classification or concentration or time-dependent activity. Historical examples of reduced drug exposure from decreased doses (i.e., cefaclor, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin), and thus low AUIC values, directly correlate with drug resistance. In the face of rising MICs (as is occurring worldwide with Streptococcus pneumoniae), close attention to appropriate dosing and concentration above the MIC may delay and potentially even prevent antibiotic resistance. Creating selective pressure on reliable antibiotics by inappropriately reducing their doses will undoubtedly challenge these agents and may destroy entire drug classes with similar mechanisms of action or resistance.

n one study, total ceftriaxone concentrations (bound and unbound) were measured in middle ear fluid obtained during the insertion of tympanostomy tubes in 42 pediatric patients with otitis media. Sampling times were from 1 to 50 hours after a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg of ceftriaxone. Mean (± SD) ceftriaxone levels in the middle ear reached a peak of 35 (± 12) mcg/ml at 24 hours, and remained at 19 (± 7) mcg/ml at 48 hours. Based on middle ear fluid ceftriaxone concentrations in the 23 to 25 hour and the 46 to 50 hour sampling time intervals, a half-life of 25 hours was calculated. Ceftriaxone is highly bound to plasma proteins. The extent of binding to proteins in the middle ear fluid is unknown.

Interaction with Calcium:

Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood have been carried out to assess interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dl). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dl or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dl) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation.

Table 4
PK/PD studies of beta-lactams in cerebral spinal fluid

AUC area under the curve, CNS central nervous system, CRO ceftriaxone, CSF cerebral spinal fluid, CTX cefotaxime, ICU intensive care unit, MIC minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC50 minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates, PTA probability of target attainment, SD standard deviation, T > MIC percentage of time above minimal inhibitory concentration, TBI trauma brain injury

There is very sparse data on possible surrogate central nervous system penetration factors for beta-lactams, so no conclusions can be made. We recommend to use higher than standard dosing, preferably with continuous or prolonged infusions, especially when treating less susceptible bacterial strains. Toxicity did not increase at increased doses. Finally, none of these studies addressed clinical outcome.

Though there are PK models of plasma concentrations of beta-lactams specifically for the critically ill population with pneumonia, it is suggested that epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations are important determinants of efficacy of treatment of bacterial pneumonia. ELF-to-serum penetration ratios may vary widely among beta-lactams. The impact of infection on their penetration into ELF in humans is unknown, though some reports state that ELF penetration increases in acute lung injury.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^112VtasZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Evaluating outcomes of alternative dosing strategies for cefepime: a qualitative systematic review [^112KC5gk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform a qualitative systematic review of the evidence comparing traditional with prolonged intermittent or continuous infusions of cefepime based on clinical and pharmacodynamic outcomes.

Data Sources

PubMed (1946 to October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to October 2014), CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to October 2014) were searched using the terms cefepime, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug administration, intravenous infusions, intravenous drug administration, continuous infusion, extended infusion, and intermittent therapy. Reference lists from relevant materials were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles evaluating administration regimens of cefepime, one of which included the traditional, manufacturer-recommended 0.5-hour infusion and the other a prolonged or continuous infusion were included. Prespecified clinical outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical cure, and adverse events. The primary pharmacodynamic outcome was percentage time of unbound drug concentration remaining above the minimum inhibitory concentration.

Data Synthesis

In all, 18 studies were included; 6 studies assessed clinical outcomes, and 12 assessed pharmacodynamic outcomes. Prolonged or continuous infusions of cefepime achieved the pharmacodynamic targets more often than traditional infusions. The association of improved clinical outcomes with prolonged or continuous infusions is unclear. All-cause mortality was significantly decreased with the use of a prolonged cefepime infusion in a retrospective study. Two prospective, randomized studies demonstrated no statistically significant difference in mortality between prolonged and intermittent infusions.

Conclusions

The available literature on prolonged and continuous infusions of cefepime demonstrated an improved achievement of pharmacodynamic targets; however, the effect on clinical outcomes is inconclusive. Well-designed prospective studies are required to determine optimal dosing and administration strategies.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111FvtAX]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

GISP data show that the ceftriaxone MIC50 and MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit growth of 50% and 90% of organisms, respectively) were only one doubling dilution higher during 2014–2018, compared with the respective ceftriaxone MIC50 and MIC90 during 1992–1995. Although dual drug therapy with different mechanisms of action (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) might have mitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae, concerns regarding potential harm to the microbiome and the effect on other pathogens diminishes the benefits of maintaining dual therapy as the recommended treatment regimen.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal third-generation cephalosporin with widely variable pharmacokinetics. Efficacy is best predicted by time that the serum free (i.e. unbound) drug concentration remains higher than the organism's MIC (f T > MIC). Although no human data exist confirming the length of time above the MIC required to eradicate gonorrhea at different anatomic sites, using Monte Carlo modeling, ceftriaxone has been estimated to require concentrations higher than the strain MIC for approximately 20–24 hours for effective urogenital gonorrhea treatment. A 250 mg ceftriaxone dose does not reliably achieve levels higher than an MIC ≥ 0.125 μ g/mL for an extended duration. A murine model was used to estimate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters needed for cure at urogenital sites for both susceptible and resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae. Investigators evaluated the efficacy of various ceftriaxone doses (0.06–30 mg/kg body weight). The lowest ceftriaxone dose that was 100% effective at eradicating the susceptible organism (MIC = 0.008 μ g/mL) 48 hours after treatment was 5 mg/kg body weight, which corresponded to an f T > MIC of 23.6 hours, consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation. Translating into human doses, a 500-mg dose corresponds to 5 mg/kg body weight (80–100 kg) human, whereas 250 mg only corresponds to 3 mg/kg body weight for an 80 kg person.

### Safety of subcutaneous versus intravenous ceftriaxone administration in older patients: a retrospective study [^1131GuiZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics play a central role in infection management. In older patients, antibiotics are frequently administered subcutaneously. Ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics after subcutaneous administration is well documented, but little data are available on its safety.

Methods

We compared the occurrence of adverse events associated with ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously versus intravenously in ≥ 75-year-old patients. We used data from a single-center, retrospective, clinical-administrative database to compare the occurrence of adverse events at day 14 and outcome at day 21 in older patients who received ceftriaxone via the subcutaneous route or the intravenous route at Rennes University Hospital, France, from May 2020 to February 2023.

Results

The subcutaneous and intravenous groups included 402 and 3387 patients, respectively. Patients in the subcutaneous group were older and more likely to receive palliative care. At least one adverse event was reported for 18% and 40% of patients in the subcutaneous and intravenous group, respectively (RR = 2.21). Mortality at day 21 was higher in the subcutaneous route group, which could be linked to between-group differences in clinical and demographic features.

Conclusions

In ≥ 75-year-old patients, ceftriaxone administered by the subcutaneous route is associated with less-adverse events than by the intravenous route. The subcutaneous route, which is easier to use, has a place in infection management in geriatric settings.

### Calcium gluconate (calcium gluconate in sodium chloride) [^111CZNLi]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5	Drug Incompatibilities

- Do not mix Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection with ceftriaxone. Concurrent use of intravenous ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates. Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and intravenous calcium-containing products is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with intravenous calcium-containing solutions via a Y-site in any age group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- Do not mix Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection with fluids containing bicarbonate or phosphate. Calcium Gluconate Injection is not physically compatible with fluids containing phosphate or bicarbonate. Precipitation may result if mixed.

- Do not mix Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection with minocycline injection. Calcium complexes minocycline rendering it inactive.

### Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of intravenous cefotetan disodium for injection in healthy Chinese volunteers: a randomized, open-label, single-and multiple-dose study [^114xcdPD]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cefotetan disodium for injection is a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic that exerts its bactericidal effects by inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. Despite being widely used in the treatment of various infections, little information is available on the pharmacokinetic properties of cefotetan disodium in Chinese subjects.

Objectives

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple intravenous doses of a generic formulation of cefotetan disodium in healthy Chinese volunteers. The effect of sex on the pharmacokinetics of cefotetan disodium was evaluated as a secondary objective.

Methods

In this open-label, dose-escalating study, subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of cefotetan disodium 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion. Those allocated to the 1.0-g dose continued into the multiple-dose phase, in which they received 1.0 g BID for 7 consecutive days. During the single-dose phase, blood samples were collected at regular intervals from 0 to 15 hours after drug administration and were analyzed using a validated HPLC method. During the multiple-dose phase, blood samples were obtained before drug administration on days 5, 6, and 7 to determine the C(min) at steady state; on day 7, blood samples were also collected from 0 to 15 hours after drug administration. Tolerability was assessed based on physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, hepatic and renal function, and urinalysis), and subject interviews.

Results

Three groups, each consisting of 5 men and 5 women, were enrolled in the single-dose phase. The mean (SD) age of subjects was 23.2 (2.2) years (range, 19–30 years). Their mean weight was 57.0 (6.3) kg (range, 46.4–72.0 kg), and their mean height was 1.66 (0.08) m (range, 1.48–1.81 m). After intravenous administration of single doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g, the cefotetan disodium C(max) was 35.01 (6.98), 76.67 (10.52), and 154.33 (27.17) mg/L, respectively; the AUC₀₋₁₅(h) was 145.35 (18.36), 307.45 (33.07), and 746.09 (103.07) mg · h/L; the AUC₀₋(∞) was 171.51 (20.61), 347.25 (44.20), and 843.84 (131.13) mg · h/L; the t(1/2) was 5.80 (1.29), 4.91 (1.15), and 5.04 (1.26) hours; the CL was 2.96 (0.41), 2.92 (0.39), and 2.42 (0.39) L/h; and the V(d) was 24.55 (5.19), 20.37 (3.66), and 17.30 (3.52) L. After administration of multiple doses, the cefotetan disodium C(max, ss) was 80.53 (10.04) mg/L; the C(mix, ss) was 11.00 (4.04) mg/L; the AUC(ss) was 347.92 (50.04) mg · h/L; the steady-state plasma concentration was 28.99 (4.17) mg/L; the t(1/2) was 6.24 (2.52) hours; the CL was 2.32 (0.64) L/h; and the Vd was 19.19 (4.58) L. No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were noted by sex in the multiple-dose phase. Cefotetan disodium appeared to be well tolerated.

Conclusions

In these healthy Chinese subjects, the cefotetan disodium AUC and C(max) increased in a dose-proportional manner, whereas the t(1/2) was independent of dose. The pharmacokinetic properties of cefotetan disodium were linear at doses of 0.5 to 2.0 g. After multiple doses, the pharmacokinetic parameters of cefotetan disodium were consistent with those after single doses. At the doses studied, cefotetan disodium appeared to be well tolerated in these healthy volunteers.
