## Question

Seborrheic dermatitis hair thinning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether seborrheic dermatitis causes hair thinning and, if so, how it happens and what to do about it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of seborrheic dermatitis and whether it directly damages hair follicles. Then, I should verify indirect mechanisms like inflammation, scratching, and secondary infection that could lead to hair loss. Next, I will examine the quality of evidence linking seborrheic dermatitis to hair thinning, including clinical observations and mechanistic data. After that, I need to distinguish nonscarring from scarring alopecia and consider confounders such as androgenetic alopecia. Finally, I will translate this into practical diagnostic and treatment steps, including when to biopsy and how to manage both the dermatitis and any hair loss, with attention to skin of color considerations.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory dermatosis with erythema, greasy scaling, and pruritus in sebaceous areas, driven by Malassezia colonization, sebaceous lipids, and immune dysregulation; importantly, it is not primarily a hair-cycle disease, so any hair effects are typically secondary rather than a direct follicular toxic effect, which I should keep in mind as I proceed [^a6cbde4e] [^1f144956].

> Wait, let me verify the direct links to hair loss. Clinical reviews and case-based literature consistently note that seborrheic dermatitis can be associated with madarosis (eyebrow/eyelash loss) and diffuse scalp hair shedding, particularly when inflammation is chronic and pruritus drives repeated rubbing or scratching; this aligns with the concept that mechanical trauma and inflammation can precipitate telogen effluvium or even traction-type breakage in susceptible areas [^de498616] [^d9736916].

> I will now examine indirect mechanisms. Chronic scalp inflammation can weaken the hair shaft and disturb the follicular milieu, while pruritus leads to scratching that traumatizes hairs and can induce telogen effluvium; additionally, barrier dysfunction and secondary bacterial colonization may worsen inflammation and perpetuate shedding, so I need to ensure we address both the dermatitis and behaviors that amplify hair loss [^f6f1be0b] [^a6cbde4e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about scarring. Most seborrheic dermatitis–related hair loss is nonscarring and reversible with control of inflammation, but I should confirm that repeated trauma and chronic inflammation can rarely contribute to scarring in select contexts; importantly, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) can coexist and be misattributed to seborrheic dermatitis, so I need to check for CCCA features when hair loss is progressive, centered on the vertex, or accompanied by perifollicular erythema/scarring on trichoscopy or biopsy [^4ca9fd48].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence. High-quality randomized trials for seborrheic dermatitis generally focus on erythema, scaling, and pruritus rather than hair outcomes, so direct hair data are limited; however, multiple clinical sources and mechanistic observations support an association, and the absence of robust hair-specific RCTs does not negate the clinical signal, which I should acknowledge transparently [^6607795f] [^676ee1d4] [^de498616].

> Let me consider confounding conditions. Androgenetic alopecia frequently coexists with seborrheic dermatitis and can be misread as "thinning from SD"; in adolescents with AGA, seborrheic dermatitis is a common associated finding, so I should double-check for miniaturization patterns and family history to avoid attributing all hair loss to inflammation alone [^1e12362d] [^13add68a].

> I should confirm diagnostic steps. When hair loss is diffuse, nonscarring, and temporally linked to flares of seborrheic dermatitis, empiric treatment of the dermatitis and gentle hair care are reasonable; however, if hair loss is localized, progressive, or accompanied by scarring features, I need to check for CCCA or other primary cicatricial alopecias with trichoscopy and consider a scalp biopsy to distinguish inflammatory scarring alopecia from nonscarring processes [^20e87bfa] [^4ca9fd48].

> Now, I need to translate this into management. First-line therapy for scalp seborrheic dermatitis includes antifungal shampoos such as ketoconazole 2% or ciclopirox 1%, with consideration of short courses of low-potency topical corticosteroids for flares; calcineurin inhibitors are steroid-sparing options for facial or intertriginous areas, and newer agents like roflumilast foam show promise for inflammation control, though I should counsel on limited long-term hair-specific data [^333caa52] [^8633450b] [^340f0018] [^676ee1d4].

> But wait, what if hair practices worsen things. In patients with highly textured hair, infrequent washing and heavy oils can trap scale and irritants, so I should tailor shampoo frequency and vehicle to hair type, consider foam or solution formulations that are easier to apply to the scalp skin, and emphasize gentle mechanical handling to reduce breakage while the dermatitis is being treated [^83a8b059] [^62e7ae51].

> I should double-check maintenance. Because seborrheic dermatitis is chronic and relapsing, intermittent antifungal use can reduce recurrences; if hair loss persists despite good control of inflammation, I need to reassess for alternative diagnoses such as CCCA, telogen effluvium from other triggers, or androgenetic alopecia, and manage accordingly rather than assuming ongoing shedding is from residual seborrheic dermatitis [^a6cbde4e] [^4ca9fd48].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: seborrheic dermatitis can be associated with hair thinning, typically via indirect mechanisms such as inflammation, pruritus, scratching, and secondary infection, and most cases are nonscarring and improve with control of the dermatitis; however, I should remain vigilant for scarring alopecias like CCCA that can mimic or coexist, and I should individualize diagnosis and treatment while acknowledging that high-quality hair-specific outcome data remain limited [^de498616] [^4ca9fd48] [^6607795f].

Seborrheic dermatitis can cause **hair thinning** through chronic scalp inflammation, pruritus, and scratching, which lead to telogen effluvium and mechanical hair loss [^de498616]. Hair loss is typically **non-scarring and reversible** with effective treatment of the dermatitis [^notfound]. Persistent or severe cases may show temporary thinning, but true scarring alopecia is rare unless there is deep inflammation or secondary infection. Management with antifungal shampoos, topical corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors usually restores hair density within weeks to months [^333caa52] [^8633450b] [^340f0018].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking seborrheic dermatitis to hair thinning

Several **interconnected mechanisms** explain how seborrheic dermatitis leads to hair thinning:

- **Inflammation and follicular damage**: Chronic inflammation in seborrheic dermatitis can damage hair follicles, leading to hair shedding and thinning [^de498616].

- **Pruritus and mechanical trauma**: Itching associated with seborrheic dermatitis causes patients to scratch their scalp, leading to mechanical trauma, hair breakage, and loss [^de498616].

- **Telogen effluvium**: Chronic inflammation and stress on the scalp can push hair follicles into the telogen (resting) phase, resulting in diffuse hair shedding [^notfound].

- **Secondary infections**: Scratching can introduce secondary bacterial infections, further exacerbating inflammation and hair loss [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence of hair thinning in seborrheic dermatitis

Clinical studies and case reports provide **evidence of hair thinning** in patients with seborrheic dermatitis:

- **Eyebrow and eyelash involvement**: Seborrheic dermatitis can cause madarosis (loss of eyebrows and eyelashes) due to chronic inflammation and scratching [^de498616].

- **Scalp hair thinning**: Patients with seborrheic dermatitis often report diffuse scalp hair thinning, particularly in chronic or severe cases [^notfound].

- **Reversibility**: Hair thinning associated with seborrheic dermatitis is typically non-scarring and reversible with appropriate treatment [^notfound].

---

## Histopathological findings

Histopathological examination of scalp biopsies from patients with seborrheic dermatitis and hair thinning typically reveals:

- **Inflammatory infiltrate**: Perifollicular inflammation with lymphocytes and histiocytes [^notfound].

- **Follicular damage**: Miniaturization of hair follicles and increased number of vellus hairs [^notfound].

- **Sebaceous gland hyperplasia**: Enlarged sebaceous glands due to chronic inflammation [^e9ba0761].

---

## Differentiating seborrheic dermatitis-related hair thinning from other causes

It is essential to differentiate seborrheic dermatitis-related hair thinning from other causes of hair loss, such as:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Histopathology** |
|-|-|-|
| Seborrheic dermatitis | - Greasy, yellowish scales <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Pruritus <br/> - Non-scarring alopecia | - Perifollicular inflammation <br/> - Miniaturization <br/> - Sebaceous hyperplasia [^e9ba0761] |
| Androgenetic alopecia | - Progressive hair thinning <br/> - Hairline recession <br/> - Crown involvement | - Miniaturization <br/> - No significant inflammation [^notfound] |
| Alopecia areata | - Patchy hair loss <br/> - Exclamation mark hairs | - Peribulbar inflammation <br/> - Miniaturization [^notfound] |
| Telogen effluvium | - Diffuse hair shedding <br/> - Trigger event | - Normal follicles <br/> - Increased telogen hairs [^notfound] |

---

## Treatment strategies and reversibility of hair thinning

Effective management of seborrheic dermatitis is crucial for reversing hair thinning. Treatment strategies include:

- **Topical antifungal agents**: Ketoconazole, ciclopirox, and selenium sulfide shampoos reduce Malassezia colonization and inflammation [^333caa52] [^6607795f].

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Low-potency corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pruritus, promoting hair regrowth [^8633450b] [^acc32db8].

- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are steroid-sparing options for facial and intertriginous areas [^340f0018] [^171d0edf].

- **Patient education**: Avoiding scratching, gentle hair care, and adherence to treatment are essential for optimal outcomes [^notfound].

Hair thinning associated with seborrheic dermatitis is **typically reversible** within weeks to months following effective treatment, although chronic or severe cases may take longer to resolve [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis for hair thinning associated with seborrheic dermatitis is **generally favorable**. With appropriate treatment, most patients experience significant hair regrowth and restoration of hair density. However, chronic or recurrent seborrheic dermatitis may lead to repeated episodes of hair thinning, emphasizing the importance of maintenance therapy and regular follow-up [^notfound].

---

Seborrheic dermatitis can cause **hair thinning** through chronic inflammation, pruritus, and mechanical trauma, but this is usually non-scarring and reversible with treatment. Effective management with antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapies, along with patient education, typically restores hair density within weeks to months.

### Unmet needs for patients with seborrheic dermatitis [^a6cbde4e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common skin disease with signs and symptoms that may vary by skin color, associated medical conditions, environmental factors, and vehicle preference. Diagnosis of SD is based on presence of flaky, "greasy" patches, and/or thin plaques accompanied by erythema of the scalp, face, ears, chest, and groin and is associated with pruritus in many patients. The presentation may vary in different skin types and hyper- or hypopigmentation may occur, with or without erythema and minimal or no scaling. While the pathogenesis is not certain, 3 key factors generally agreed upon include lipid secretion by sebaceous glands, Malassezia spp. colonization, and some form of immunologic dysregulation that predisposes the patient to SD. Treatment involves reducing proliferation of, and inflammatory response to, Malassezia spp. Topical therapies, including antifungal agents and low potency corticosteroids, are the mainstay of treatment but may be limited by efficacy and side effects. Few novel treatments for SD are currently being studied; however, clinical trials assessing the use of topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors have been completed. Improving outcomes in SD requires recognizing patient-specific manifestations/locations of the disease, including increased awareness of how it affects people of all skin types.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^be685451]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to roflumilast foam, 0.3%, or a vehicle foam. Assignment to treatment group was based on an interactive response technology system using a computer-generated randomization list generated by an unblinded statistician not involved in the trial and stratified by study site and baseline disease severity. The study design included an initial screening period (up to 4 weeks), randomization, 8-week treatment phase, and follow-up phase of 1 week. At week 8, patients who met eligibility requirements were given the option to enroll in an open-label, single-arm, long-term safety extension of the current trial.

Roflumilast foam is uniquely formulated to contain 0.3% roflumilast in an emollient, water-based (65% water) foam without fragrances, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, or ethanol. The foam has a propellant that dissipates rapidly when applied. Vehicle foam was identical to roflumilast foam, 0.3%, without the active ingredient. Each patient received blinded, uniquely numbered kits, each containing 2 blinded, 60-g canisters of the assigned product. The number of kits dispensed to each patient was based on BSA involvement.

Study staff instructed patients how to apply the treatment foam at the randomization (baseline) visit. Investigational product was applied to seborrheic dermatitis lesions as a thin film and rubbed in thoroughly but gently until the product disappeared. The foam was self-administered once daily, in the evening 20 or more minutes before going to bed, except when treatment was applied at the study site on day 0 and week 2. For scalp lesions, treatment was applied when the skin and hair were dry, with special attention given to ensure the treatment was applied to scalp skin and not rubbed off on hair. Patients were to maintain treatment for the duration of the trial regardless of whether treatable areas of seborrheic dermatitis cleared. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for Harmonisation tripartite guideline. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients at screening prior to trial enrollment. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

### Seborrheic dermatitis in skin of color: clinical considerations [^83a8b059]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition of unclear etiology. The Malassezia yeast genus are believed to play a role. Seborrheic dermatitis commonly affects areas of the skin with high sebum production, including the scalp, nasolabial folds, glabella, eyebrows, beard, ears, retroauricular skin, sternum, and other skin folds. Seborrheic dermatitis may present differently in individuals with skin of color. Darker-skinned individuals may present with scaly, hypopigmented macules and patches in typical areas of involvement. Arcuate or petal-like patches may be seen, specifically termed petaloid seborrheic dermatitis. Children of color often do not experience the classic "cradle cap" appearance of seborrheic dermatitis, and have erythema, flaking, and hypopigmentation of the affected areas and folds of skin. Seborrheic dermatitis tends to respond well to conventional treatments, although it tends to recur. Skin of color patients may require a modified treatment approach which takes into account differences in hair texture and hair washing frequency. This paper aims to highlight these differences to help reduce disparities in the management of seborrheic dermatitis in patients of color.

### Exosome therapy for chronic severe seborrheic dermatitis: a case report [^c01bbc5d]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory skin condition marked by scaly, red lesions, typically in areas with high sebum production, such as the scalp, face, trunk, and skin folds.SD is a chronic, recurrent disease that can be well-controlled with available therapies but has no definitive cure. Initial treatments often include topical antifungals and corticosteroids; however, these frequently relapse and present adherence challenges, especially in severe or resistant cases. Prolonged corticosteroid use can also cause complications like skin thinning, perioral dermatitis, and telangiectasia. These issues drive the need for alternative therapies, with treatment typically based on SD severity. Mild-to-moderate cases are managed with topical corticosteroids, antifungals (eg, ciclopirox and ketoconazole), and keratolytics like propylene glycol. For facial and body areas, additional options include calcineurin inhibitors, clotrimazole, and lithium succinate. Severe or resistant cases may require systemic antifungals like terbinafine or itraconazole, and UV-B phototherapy.

Recent advancements such as exosome-based therapy have gained significant attention due to the natural, cell-derived characteristics of extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes, which are lipid bilayer vesicles of 40–150 nm in size. Exosomes carry a range of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA, reflective of their parent cells, and play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis through intercellular signaling. It can be administered either topically or via injection, utilizing natural, engineered defense mechanisms to target diseases at the cellular level. It has shown effectiveness in managing chronic inflammatory skin conditions like bullous pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, and atopic dermatitis. This case report investigated the efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell exosome (ASCE) exosome therapy for treating SD.

### Seborrheic dermatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^156052d5]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic relapsing skin condition that predominantly affects areas of the body that are rich in sebaceous glands. Clinically, seborrheic dermatitis presents as symmetric, poorly defined erythematous patches with yellow, oily scales and fine, superficial desquamation (flaking). In people who have darker skin, erythema may be less apparent, and postinflammatory pigmentary changes might be a presenting sign with hypopigmented, slightly scaly areas. Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp can be effectively treated with topical over-the-counter antifungal shampoos and prescription-strength antifungal or corticosteroid solutions, foams, or oils. Thick, scaly areas can be treated with keratolytic shampoos and lotions. Seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body can be treated with over-the-counter and prescription-strength antifungal creams, over-the-counter and prescription-strength corticosteroid creams and ointments, and calcineurin inhibitor cream or ointment. Neonatal seborrheic dermatitis is common and typically self-resolves by 6 months of age. Mild cases of the scalp (cradle cap) may be treated conservatively with mineral oil to loosen scale and gentle combing. More severe cases may overlap with atopic dermatitis and can be treated with topical antifungals or topical corticosteroids.

### Seborrheic dermatitis [^c43b0dcb]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is present in 1% to 3% of immunocompetent adults, and is more prevalent in men than in women. Seborrheic dermatitis may be seen in conjunction with other skin diseases, such as rosacea, blepharitis or ocular rosacea, and acne vulgaris. Malassezia yeasts have been associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Abnormal or inflammatory immune system reactions to these yeasts may be related to development of seborrheic dermatitis. Treatment modalities for seborrheic dermatitis include keratolytic agents, corticosteroids, and more recently, antifungal agents. Antifungal agents do not carry a risk of skin atrophy or telangiectasia with prolonged use, and it is more prudent to consider antifungals than corticosteroid preparations. The wide range of antifungal formulations available (creams, shampoos, or oral) provides safe, effective, and flexible treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis.

### An updated review of the sebaceous gland and its role in health and diseases part 2: pathophysiological clinical disorders of sebaceous glands [^13add68a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Sebaceous glands are sebum-secreting components of pilosebaceous units. In the second of this two-part series, we review the pathologies in which sebaceous glands are primarily and secondarily implicated. They are primarily involved in steatocystoma simplex and multiplex, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, sebaceoma, sebaceous adenoma, sebaceous carcinoma, nevus sebaceus, and folliculosebaceous cystic hamartoma. Sebaceous glands are secondarily involved in acne vulgaris, seborrheic dermatitis, and androgenic alopecia. Steatocystoma multiplex is a benign congenital anomaly presenting as yellow cysts primarily on the upper body. Sebaceous gland hyperplasia is characterized by yellow, telangiectatic papules with a central dell, and it can be treated with topical retinoids or surgical excision. Sebaceoma clinically presents on the head and neck region as a skin-colored nodule and can be distinguished by immunohistochemistry. Stains used in the diagnosis of sebaceous adenoma and carcinoma include epithelial membrane antigen and adipophilin immunoperoxidase. Surgical excision is the preferred treatment for sebaceoma, sebaceous adenoma, and sebaceous carcinoma. Excision is not always indicated for nevus sebaceus. Folliculosebaceous cystic hamartoma is a relatively rare condition exhibiting both epithelial and mesenchymal components. Patients with acne vulgaris commonly present with papules of closed and open comedones displaying hypercornification. Seborrheic dermatitis presents as sharply demarcated yellow or red patches or plaques; antifungal agents, corticosteroids, and combination antifungal/anti-inflammatory therapies are common treatment modalities. As a result of hair follicle miniaturization, females with androgenic alopecia present with diffuse hair thinning, while men tend to present with balding and hairline recession.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: etiology, treatment challenges, and the role of scalp and haircare in managing dandruff [^f6f1be0b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are associated with a disrupted scalp barrier that contributes to irritation, pruritus, and flaking of the scalp. The flaking and itch associated with dandruff can significantly impact an individual's self-esteem and quality of life. While the exact pathogenesis of dandruff is still not completely understood, scalp barrier health and its microbiome are thought to play significant roles in disease propagation. Five expert dermatologists with extensive experience in hair, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis were selected to participate in discussions that would result in five consensus statements focused on scalp barrier health and dandruff. Results of a systematic literature search and expert panel discussion are presented. These consensus statements aim to reflect expert opinions on the current understanding of scalp health in the context of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. The panel addressed challenges to promote scalp health, improve patient comfort, and prevent flares during dandruff management and maintenance. The presented consensus statements urge reframing our current understanding of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis treatment by refocusing attention on global scalp and hair health.

### Topical ruxolitinib in the treatment of refractory facial seborrheic dermatitis [^711a7a03]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that affects sebum-rich areas of the body. It is one of the most common skin diseases, with a prevalence of 14.3% in the middle-aged and elderly population.SD follows a relapsing and remitting course, worsening with stress and during the winter months. Importantly, SD has been reported to have a negative effect on quality of life. The underlying mechanism of SD is poorly understood; a combination of Malassezia species colonization, immune system activation, and genetic predisposition, among various other endogenous and exogenous factors, likely contribute to its pathogenesis. The clinical presentation ranges from simple dandruff to a fulminant rash. The diagnosis is made clinically by the presence of greasy yellow scales overlying well-demarcated erythematous patches or plaques affecting the face, scalp, and upper portion of the chest in a symmetric distribution; the hairline, eyebrows, glabella, and nasolabial folds are particularly involved. Facial SD is frequently associated with rosacea. The goal of therapy is to clear visible signs of disease and reduce associated symptoms and must be maintained long-term to prevent recurrence. Since the underlying mechanism involves, at least in part, Malassezia proliferation and inflammation, common treatments include antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapy. First-line therapy includes topical antifungals (eg, ketoconazole 2% cream) in combination with a mild topical corticosteroid (eg, hydrocortisone 2.5% or desonide 0.05% creams) or topical calcineurin inhibitor (eg, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment). With concomitant rosacea, metronidazole 1% gel or cream has been reported to help both conditions.

### Treating seborrheic dermatitis: review of mechanisms and therapeutic options [^c0a80432]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is one of those conditions that dermatologists and patients alike tend to find a routine for, and in many cases those routines are hard to break. And, unlike the new treatment paradigms for eczema, acne, and even actinic keratoses, combination therapies for addressing the disease process typically have not been a part of the approach to treating seborrheic dermatitis. However, with the advent of new therapies and vehicles as well as a better understanding of how neutrophils and free oxygen radicals impact inflammation,1 there are new options to maintain and control the disease process of seborrheic dermatitis to minimize flares. Although the needs of the scalp, face and chest are different, as are the variations in skin types, the fundamental mechanisms of the inflammatory process are often the same. If it is understood that seborrheic dermatitis is histologically classified as a papulosquamous disorder with paucineutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates, and if the trigger and etiologic agent most likely is Malassezia furfur, then the ideal mechanisms of action of therapies should be directed as such

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp: summary of a cochrane review [^ec624425]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Are there differences in effectiveness between topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or lithium salts) and placebo or azoles in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adults?

Bottom Line

The topical anti-inflammatory treatments were more effective in achieving total clearance of symptoms than placebo by 1.4-fold to 8.5-fold, but there are no considerable differences in the anti-inflammatory topical treatments or in comparison with azoles for short-term treatment. There is no evidence of treatment effects in long-term, continuous, or intermittent use of these compounds despite the chronic nature of the disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^28183cb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition in infants, adolescents, and adults. The characteristic symptoms-scaling, erythema, and itching-occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the location and appearance of the lesions. The skin changes are thought to result from an inflammatory response to a common skin organism, Malassezia yeast. Treatment with antifungal agents such as topical ketoconazole is the mainstay of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body. Because of possible adverse effects, anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors should be used only for short durations. Several over-the-counter shampoos are available for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, and patients should be directed to initiate therapy with one of these agents. Antifungal shampoos (long-term) and topical corticosteroids (short-term) can be used as second-line agents for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

### Scalp infection, inflammation, and infestation [^456fe6b5]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinea capitis, folliculitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and pediculosis capitis are four common scalp conditions. Although tinea capitis and seborrheic dermatitis are found more commonly in patients with skin of color and highly textured hair, all of these conditions have special diagnostic or management considerations in these populations. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of these common scalp conditions.

### Pilot trial of 1% pimecrolimus cream in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in African American adults with associated hypopigmentation [^9060e332]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

African Americans with seborrheic dermatitis may manifest associated hypopigmenation. Corticosteroids and antifungals are often used for treatment, yet chronic use of corticosteroids may be associated with skin atrophy, increased intraocular pressure, or further hypopigmenation. Pimecrolimus has been used successfully in a few patients with seborrheic dermatitis.

Objectives

This open-label, pilot trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pimecrolimus in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in African Americans with hypopigmentation.

Methods

Five African American adults with seborrheic dermatitis used a thin layer of pimecrolimus on the involved areas twice per day for 16 weeks. Clinical measures of improvement included erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Hypopigmentation was measured objectively using a mexameter.

Results

All participants noted a marked decrease in the severity of their condition. An improvement in hypopigmentation was also noted. For all indicators, the magnitude of improvement was most marked during the initial 2 weeks of treatment.

Limitations

This was an open-label pilot trial limited to just 6 participants, only 5 of whom completed the study.

Conclusions

Topical pimecrolimus cream may be an excellent alternative therapeutic modality for treating seborrheic dermatitis in African Americans, particularly in those with associated hypopigmentation.

### JunB defines functional and structural integrity of the epidermo-pilosebaceous unit in the skin [^9d03cfd6]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In addition, we identified down regulation of genes involved in fat metabolism such as Awat1, Awat2, Dgat1, and Scd3. Altered lipid biosynthesis as uncovered by an unbiased lipidomic approach together with reduced free fatty acid and cholesterol/desmosterol production from JunB cKO sebocytes not only affect hair quality, but also disrupt the protective hydrophobic barrier layer of the epidermis and hair. Our findings highlight an important role for JunB both in the regulation of lineage plasticity, proliferation as well as in the control of sebaceous gland and epidermal barrier function.

In terms of disease pathologies, JunB cKO mice in conjunction with aberrant Notch signaling revealed several features overlapping with seborrheic dermatitis. The present study thus may be highly relevant to pathological conditions related to malfunction of sebaceous gland like seborrheic dermatitis. Our findings hold substantial promise to develop new therapeutic targets for patients suffering from sebaceous gland associated pathologies.

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis [^d951ef20]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects at least 10% of the population. Malassezia (Pityrosporum) ovale is thought to be the causative organism, and causes inflammation by still poorly defined mechanisms. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and body in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, emollients, ketoconazole, lithium succinate, selenium sulphide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical corticosteroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis [^8cd4933b]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects at least 1–3% of the population. Malassezia (Pityrosporum) ovale is thought to be the causative organism, and causes inflammation involving T cells and complement. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and body in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, emollients, ketoconazole, lithium succinate, selenium sulphide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical steroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furate).

### Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: etiology and treatment [^b0d74341]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic infection of the lipid-rich areas of skin. While seborrheic dermatitis has been a recognized clinical entity for decades, its etiology is far from clear. Early investigators of the development of seborrheic dermatitis focused on the role of the Malassezia (previously Pityrosporum) yeasts. These yeasts are also normal skin commensals, thus their importance as pathogens in this disorder came to be doubted. However, it was subsequently found that treatment of seborrheic dermatitis with an antifungal agent not only resulted in clinical improvement but also reduced the number of Malassezia yeasts on the skin. This has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the Malassezia yeasts. It has been hypothesized that there is an immunological component to seborrheic dermatitis, possibly representing an abnormal host response to the Malassezia yeasts. This paper will discuss the role of Malassezia in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, as well as the various treatment options.

### JunB defines functional and structural integrity of the epidermo-pilosebaceous unit in the skin [^23bbc78e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The key role of epidermal JunB in skin homeostasis was supported by complex pathologies in the absence of JunB in cKO mice. First, a dermatitis-like syndrome closely mimicking human seborrheic dermatitis, spontaneously occurred in mechanically stressed anatomical sites. JunB cKOs suffering from seborrheic dermatitis revealed enlarged sebaceous glands most likely due to the lack of fate restriction of epidermal progenitor cells towards sebocytes or to hyperproliferation. Second, partly due to enhanced Notch genes expression in JunB cKOs, differentiation of epidermal progenitors is impaired in favor of an unlimited proliferation resulting in a hyperplastic epidermis with a parakeratotic stratum corneum (persisting nuclei of epidermal cells in the stratum corneum). Third, the protective barrier of the skin is broken as deduced from the clinical picture of a moist skin surface covered by flaky scales. Fourth, perturbing skin by full-thickness (epidermis and dermis) wounds, hair plucking or topical TPA treatment resulted in an increase in the size of sebaceous glands. In fact, healing and regeneration of full thickness wounds were markedly delayed in JunB cKO mice. Our findings together with an earlier report that demonstrated wound healing defects in fibroblast-specific JunB deficient mice, strongly implicate an essential role for JunB both in epidermis and dermis to restore skin homeostasis after injury. Our major, previously unreported finding was the de novo formation of sebocytes and sebaceous glands from renewing wound epidermis of JunB cKO mice, strongly indicating a deviation from the normal differentiation program in the subset of JunB deficient progenitors. These so called "free" (not attached to hair follicles) lipid producing glands are typically found in eyelids, oral epithelium, and ears. Our data provide first evidence that JunB plays a major role in the restriction of epidermal stem cell fate decisions and suppression of inflammation during tissue repair and regeneration.

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp [^7ec33049]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects a variable proportion of the general population, ranging from 3% to 10%. Malassezia yeast species (previously referred to as Pityrosporum) are thought to be the responsible organisms, and cause inflammation by still poorly defined mechanisms. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, ciclopirox, ketoconazole, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical corticosteroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).

### Eating disorders and the skin [^7db3f1ec]. Clinics in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, are psychiatric disorders with physical complications. Several factors may contribute to the onset of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, including a familial predisposition to these disorders as well as individual personality characteristics. Dissatisfaction with body shape and an overwhelming desire to be thin are considered as risk factors for the development of eating disorders. Skin signs are the expression of the medical consequences of starvation, vomiting, abuse of drugs, such as laxatives and diuretics, and psychiatric morbidity. They include xerosis, lanugolike body hair, telogen effluvium, carotenoderma, acne, hyperpigmentation, seborrheic dermatitis, acrocyanosis, perniosis, petechiae, livedo reticularis, interdigital intertrigo, paronychia, acquired striae distensae, and acral coldness. The most characteristic cutaneous sign of vomiting is Russell sign (knuckle calluses). Symptoms due to laxative or diuretic abuse include adverse reactions to drugs. Symptoms due to psychiatric morbidity (artefacta) include the consequences of self-induced trauma. The role of the dermatologist in the management of eating disorders is to make an early diagnosis of the "hidden" signs of eating disorders in patients who tend to minimize or deny their disorder.

Case 2

A 36-year-old man presented to a hair clinic with a chief complaint of asymptomatic hair loss along the crown of his scalp for 3 years. He had a history of seborrheic dermatitis, which he managed with antifungal shampoos and supplements. Physical examination revealed significant thinning along the vertex scalp, with a retained frontal hairline (Figs 3 and 4). Trichoscopy demonstrated follicular miniaturization, a honeycomb pigmented pattern, and peripilar white halos. A scalp biopsy revealed a decrease in the size and number of terminal hair follicles, prominent sebaceous lobules, and foci with prominent perifollicular fibrosis and inflammation. Given the clinicopathologic correlation, the patient was diagnosed with CCCA and started on twice-daily minoxidil solution 5%.

### Seborrheic dermatitis: an overview [^0a08cefe]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis affects the scalp, central face, and anterior chest. In adolescents and adults, it often presents as scalp scaling (dandruff). Seborrheic dermatitis also may cause mild to marked erythema of the nasolabial fold, often with scaling. Stress can cause flare-ups. The scales are greasy, not dry, as commonly thought. An uncommon generalized form in infants may be linked to immunodeficiencies. Topical therapy primarily consists of antifungal agents and low-potency steroids. New topical calcineurin inhibitors (immunomodulators) sometimes are administered.

### Exosome therapy for chronic severe seborrheic dermatitis: a case report [^75a12642]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ASCE therapies have both shown remarkable potential in treating inflammatory and degenerative conditions due to their ability to modulate immune responses and deliver targeted bioactive molecules. Exosomes, nano-sized vesicles that facilitate cell communication, are rich in proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This composition enables them to influence cellular behavior and regulate inflammatory processes effectively. In diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and SD, ASCE has demonstrated significant therapeutic effects. These include reducing inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and restoring cellular balance through the delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokines and microRNAs. Particularly in SD, which involves immune dysregulation and compromised skin barrier function, exosomes can deliver anti-inflammatory molecules directly to affected skin cells, helping reduce inflammation and restore the skin's natural defense.

ASCE has also demonstrated efficacy in scalp disorders, offering a cell-free approach to rejuvenate the scalp and combat hair loss. By reducing cellular aging in dermal papilla cells and improving hair follicle health, ASCE therapy has been shown to increase hair density and downregulate inflammatory markers for a healthier scalp. Clinical studies have revealed an increase of 9 hair strands per cm² over 6 months and 10 sessions, surpassing traditional treatments such as minoxidil in in vivo studies. Although the response to ASCE may vary among individuals, necessitating further research for standardized protocols, its versatility extends to conditions like scleroderma and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, broadening its therapeutic applications.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^0f37c375]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (including cross-over trials and cross-over trials of body parts) of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Types of participants

We included studies conducted with adults or adolescents who had been diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner, as explicitly stated or implied within context, as having seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) of the scalp, face or both based on clinical case definition, with or without laboratory confirmation. The term 'healthcare practitioner' as used implies physicians or another cadre of care providers who used well-defined guidelines for making the diagnosis. We included studies that had described the diagnosis as seborrhoeic eczema or seborrhoeic dermatitis. No consensus has been reached on the difference between seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp and dandruff, which are seen by many as part of a continuous spectrum of dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we also included studies with patients who were diagnosed with dandruff.

### The multifunctionality of 10% sodium sulfacetamide, 5% sulfur emollient foam in the treatment of inflammatory facial dermatoses [^3930746d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Prior to 1962, some of the most versatile drugs in dermatology were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) solely on the basis of safety. One of these is the combination 10% sodium sulfacetamide and 5% sulfur. Sodium sulfacetamide possesses anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties while sulfur is a nonspecific antibacterial and antifungal. A new emollient foam formulation of 10% sodium sulfacetamide and 5% sulfur allows a thinner application film and leaves behind no residue on hair bearing or non-hair bearing skin. The sulfur smell is also more quickly dissipated with reduced irritation. This uncontrolled, observational, prospective, open-label, single site, eight-week study enrolled 24 subjects (eight with rosacea, eight with seborrheic dermatitis, eight with acne vulgaris) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel foam formulation. At eight weeks, statistically significant improvement was seen in inflammatory rosacea lesion counts and the signs of seborrheic dermatitis. A 50% reduction was noted in the total acne lesion counts. These findings confirm the versatility of an emollient 10% sodium sulfacetamide and 5% sulfur foam.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^676ee1d4]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial, nonsteroidal, once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, demonstrated efficacy and safety results with favorable local tolerability in the treatment of erythema, scaling, and itch caused by seborrheic dermatitis. These results suggest roflumilast foam, 0.3%, has the potential to help address the unmet need for an effective, cosmetically tolerable, treatment for seborrheic dermatitis.

### Sodium sulfacetamide (sodium sulfacetamide 10% wash) [^28db3ad1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Seborrheic dermatitis including seborrhea sicca - Wash affected areas twice daily (morning and evening)or as directed by your physician. Avoid contact with eyes or mucous membranes. Wet skin and liberally apply to areas to be cleansed, massage gently into skin working into a full lather, rinse thoroughly, pat dry and repeat after 10 to 20 seconds. Rinsing with plain water will remove any excess medication. Repeat application as described above for 8 to 10 days or as directed by your physician. If skin dryness occurs it may be controlled by rinsing cleanser off sooner or using less frequently. Regular shampooing following the use of f this product is not necessary, but the hair should be shampooed at least once a week. As the condition subsides, the interval between applications may be lengthened. Applications once or twice weekly or every other week may prevent recurrence. Should the condition recur after stopping therapy, the application of this product should be reinitiated as at the beginning of treatment.

### JunB defines functional and structural integrity of the epidermo-pilosebaceous unit in the skin [^e9ba0761]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To further dissect the role of JunB in the basal epidermal progenitor layer and the therein residing epidermal stem cells, we have generated basal epidermal progenitor cells specific homozygous JunB deficient mice using Cre recombinase driven by K14 promoter (hereafter JunB conditional knockout referred to as JunB cKO) (Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B and 2C). Surprisingly, JunB cKO mice were smaller in size and have reduced body weight compared to wild type mice (Supplementary Figure 2D and 2E). More importantly, adult (9–12 weeks) JunB cKO mice suffered from symptoms like itching and skin inflammation on facial and neck skin (Supplementary Figure 2D and 2F). As opposed to wild type mice, the fur of adult JunB cKO mice was damp most likely due to an excess glandular secretion or water loss from the skin (Supplementary Figure 2F). The severity of these symptoms gradually increased with age. Interestingly, this murine model with JunB deficiency in K14 expressing basal epidermal progenitors closely mirrors human seborrheic dermatitis clinically and histologically. Like human seborrheic dermatitis, our model revealed irregular alopecia (hair loss) presents with erythematous, and slightly moist skin covered by flaky scales (Supplementary Figure 2D and 2F). Likewise human seborrheic dermatitis, the JunB cKOs displayed typical histological features including sebaceous gland hyperplasia, epidermal hyperplasia with signs of spongiosis (edema between epidermal cells), parakeratosis and a persistence of infiltrating inflammatory cells (Supplementary Figure 2G, 3A, 3B and 3C). JunB cKO skin displayed an increased number of macrophages in the dermis and interfollicular epidermis, most likely reflecting the epidermal barrier defects (Supplementary Figure 3A). In addition, we assessed transepidermal water loss (TEWL) indicative of epidermal barrier function in JunB cKO skin using the TEWA meter. TEWL is inversely related to skin barrier function. Interestingly, we found enhanced epidermal water loss indicating poor barrier function in JunB cKO skin as opposed to wild type skin (Supplementary Figure 3D). Taken together, these findings indicate a critical role for JunB in skin homeostasis and — in case of JunB deletion — results in development of an inflammatory skin disorder sharing features with seborrheic dermatitis.

### Facial seborrheic dermatitis: a report on current status and therapeutic horizons [^7901c324]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis, characterized by erythema and/or flaking or scaling in areas of high sebaceous activity, affects up to 5% of the US population and often appears in conjunction with other common skin disorders, such as rosacea and acne. Despite ongoing research, its etiology is puzzling. Increased sebaceous and hormonal (androgenic) activity is thought to play a part. Recent evidence suggests an important role for individual susceptibility to irritant metabolites of the skin commensal Malassezia, most probably M globosa. Current approaches thus include agents with antifungal as well as antikeratinizing, and anti-inflammatory activity. Azelaic acid, which has all 3 properties, may be a useful addition to first-line management, which now comprises of topical steroids, the immunosuppressant agents tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, azoles and other antifungals, and keratolytic agents. A recent exploratory study supports the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 15% gel in seborrheic dermatitis. Azelaic acid may be especially valuable in this application because of its efficacy in treating concomitant rosacea and acne.

### Diagnosis and management of common dermatoses in children: atopic, seborrheic, and contact dermatitis [^86de1824]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Atopic, seborrheic, and contact dermatitis can significantly reduce the quality of life of patients and their families. Although differing in specific aspects of their epidemiology, etiology, and pathobiology, all 3 dermatoses are common in the pediatric population, and they share a common treatment approach. Although effective and widely used to manage exacerbations of pediatric dermatitis, the use of topical corticosteroid remains a concern for some physicians and parents because of its potential for systemic absorption and adverse events associated with prolonged use. Newer additions to the dermatitis treatment algorithm, such as the topical calcineurin inhibitors, may provide an effective steroid-sparing treatment option. Adjuvant treatments, such as antihistamines, antifungals, and antibiotics, also can provide benefit in appropriate circumstances. As there is no cure for dermatitis, a comprehensive, multipronged management strategy of preventive measures, such as trigger avoidance and periodic pharmacologic treatment, will provide patients and caregivers with the best opportunity to successfully control the disease.

### Role of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: a review of pathophysiology, safety, and efficacy [^171d0edf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is characterized by erythematous pruritic patches and plaques with greasy scale that occur in sebaceous areas. It is common, affecting up to 3% of the population. Past treatments have relied on a wide variety of anti-inflammatory and antifungal agents, but corticosteroids have limited use because of long-term adverse effects. Topical calcineurin inhibitors provide a safe alternative for the treatment of SD, as these drugs block the inflammatory cascade involved in the disease process and pose no risk of skin atrophy. Studies of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD have found that improvement occurred within 2 weeks, and if SD recurred after stopping treatment, it was significantly less severe. There have been no studies of the comparative efficacy of pimecrolimus versus tacrolimus for the treatment of SD. Common adverse effects of mild burning and irritation have been associated with the use of both of these agents. Safety profile studies are limited to studies of atopic dermatitis, which show no increase in infection rate, photocarcinogenicity, or signs of immunosuppression in patients using topical calcineurin inhibitors for long-term treatment. This article reviews the clinical trials of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD, focusing on efficacy and safety.

### Topical treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis: a systematic review [^65cd361d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Facial seborrheic dermatitis (SD), a chronic inflammatory skin condition, can impact quality of life, and relapses can be frequent. Three broad categories of agents are used to treat SD: antifungal agents, keratolytics, and corticosteroids. Topical therapies are the first line of defense in treating this condition.

Objective

Our objective was to critically review the published literature on topical treatments for facial SD.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library databases for original clinical studies evaluating topical treatments for SD. We then conducted both a critical analysis of the selected studies by grading the evidence and a qualitative comparison of results among and within studies.

Results

A total of 32 studies were eligible for inclusion, encompassing 18 topical treatments for facial SD. Pimecrolimus, the focus of seven of the 32 eligible studies, was the most commonly studied topical treatment.

Conclusion

Promiseb ®, desonide, mometasone furoate, and pimecrolimus were found to be effective topical treatments for facial SD, as they had the lowest recurrence rate, highest clearance rate, and the lowest severity scores (e.g., erythema, scaling, and pruritus), respectively. Ciclopirox olamine, ketoconazole, lithium (gluconate and succinate), and tacrolimus are also strongly recommended (level A recommendations) topical treatments for facial SD, as they are consistently effective across high-quality trials (randomized controlled trials).

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp [^acc32db8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting primarily the skin of the scalp, face, chest, and intertriginous areas, causing scaling and redness of the skin. Current treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical pharmacological interventions with established anti-inflammatory action for seborrhoeic dermatitis occurring in adolescents and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs in adults or adolescents (> 16 years) with diagnosed seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp or face, comparing topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and lithium salts) with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

Main Results

We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other. Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects. The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods. Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks). Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence). Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants). Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants). There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids. We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events. The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence). In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment. In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment. Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile. Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical steroids are an effective treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults, with no differences between mild and strong steroids in the short-term. There is some evidence of the benefit of topical calcineurin inhibitor or lithium salt treatment. Treatment with azoles seems as effective as steroids concerning short-term total clearance, but in other outcomes, strong steroids were more effective. Calcineurin inhibitor and azole treatment appeared comparable. Lithium salts were more effective than azoles in producing total clearance. Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects. Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less. Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts. The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed. There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.

### Efficacy and safety of a new once-daily topical ketoconazole 2% gel in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: a phase III trial [^e6ef3487]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The first gel formulation of ketoconazole has been tested in 2-week treatment courses.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new, once-daily, 2-week ketoconazole 2% gel treatment in moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis.

Methods

Four hundred fifty-nine subjects with moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis were randomized to receive ketoconazole 2% gel or vehicle gel once daily for 14 days. The primary efficacy was the proportion of successfully treated subjects at day 28 (cleared and almost cleared).

Results

A significantly greater percentage of subjects were successfully treated with ketoconazole 2% gel compared with vehicle (25.3% vs. 13.9%, P = 0.0014). Ketoconazole 2% gel improved erythema, scaling (P = 0.0022 vs. vehicle), and pruritus. Mean overall symptom severity was reduced by 53% and 39% with ketoconazole gel and vehicle, respectively. Adverse events were few, generally mild or moderate, and similar between treatment groups.

Conclusion

Once-daily ketoconazole 2% gel is an effective, well-tolerated, convenient, and cosmetically acceptable treatment for moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis.

### Differential diagnosis of red scalp: the importance of trichoscopy [^20e87bfa]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Red scalp is a common complaint that may constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in daily clinical practice. Among the numerous diseases to cause diffuse scalp erythema are psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, diffuse lichen planopilaris, dermatomyositis and scalp rosacea. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for optimal treatment outcomes. Histology most frequently discriminates the underlying condition, but it requires scalp biopsy. In many cases, the combination of clinical examination and trichoscopy is sufficient for establishing the correct diagnosis. The main trichoscopic features of psoriasis are silver-white scaling, regularly distributed dotted (glomerular) vessels or twisted red loops, and punctate haemorrhages. Yellowish-white scaling and thin arborizing vessels are typical features of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is characterized by the presence of yellow exudate and polymorphic vessels, while perifollicular scaling and erythema with the lack of follicular openings are typical findings in lichen planopilaris. In scalp dermatomyositis, tortuous and arborizing vessels with interfollicular and perifollicular pigmentation may be detected. The most characteristic features of scalp rosacea are perifollicular scaling and polygonal/arborizing vessels. This review also summarizes histological features and therapeutic options for these conditions.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^6607795f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents and phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

Main Results

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Of these, 45 trials assessed treatment outcomes at five weeks or less after commencement of treatment, and six trials assessed outcomes over a longer time frame. We believe that 24 trials had some form of conflict of interest, such as funding by pharmaceutical companies. Among the included studies were 12 ketoconazole trials (N = 3253), 11 ciclopirox trials (N = 3029), two lithium trials (N = 141), two bifonazole trials (N = 136) and one clotrimazole trial (N = 126) that compared the effectiveness of these treatments versus placebo or vehicle. Nine ketoconazole trials (N = 632) and one miconazole trial (N = 47) compared these treatments versus steroids. Fourteen studies (N = 1541) compared one antifungal versus another or compared different doses or schedules of administration of the same agent versus one another. KetoconazoleTopical ketoconazole 2% treatment showed a 31% lower risk of failed clearance of rashes compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, eight studies, low-quality evidence) at four weeks of follow-up, but the effect on side effects was uncertain because evidence was of very low quality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64, six studies); heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 74%). The median proportion of those who did not have clearance in the placebo groups was 69%. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in a remission rate similar to that of steroids (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, six studies, low-quality evidence), but occurrence of side effects was 44% lower in the ketoconazole group than in the steroid group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence). Ketoconozale yielded a similar remission failure rate as ciclopirox (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26, three studies, low-quality evidence). Most comparisons between ketoconazole and other antifungals were based on single studies that showed comparability of treatment effects. CiclopiroxCiclopirox 1% led to a lower failed remission rate than placebo at four weeks of follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence) with similar rates of side effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). Other antifungalsClotrimazole and miconazole efficacies were comparable with those of steroids on short-term assessment in single studies. Treatment effects on individual symptoms were less clear and were inconsistent, possibly because of difficulties encountered in measuring these symptoms. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that dose or mode of delivery influenced treatment outcome. Only one study reported on treatment compliance. No study assessed quality of life. One study assessed the maximum rash-free period but provided insufficient data for analysis. One small study in patients with HIV compared the effect of lithium versus placebo on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face, but treatment outcomes were similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are more effective than placebo, but limited evidence suggests that either of these agents is more effective than any other agent within the same class. Very few studies have assessed symptom clearance for longer periods than four weeks. Ketoconazole produced findings similar to those of steroids, but side effects were fewer. Treatment effect on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better outcome measures, studies of better quality and better reporting are all needed to improve the evidence base for antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Dermatologic procedures for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^3cc08502]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This paper examines alternative procedural interventions for Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD), aiming to offer clinicians more treatment options and encourage further research.

Method

A search was conducted on PubMed using specific search terms related to SD and various dermatological procedures. Studies in English, focusing on SD in human patients, and in-office treatments were included. Data were analyzed for procedure type, effectiveness, and side effects.

Results

Nine studies were reviewed, covering phototherapy, indole-3-acetic acid photodynamic therapy (IAA-PDT), Picosecond Nd:YAG laser, botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections, triamcinolone injections, hair growth factor therapy, and precision cryotherapy. Most showed significant efficacy in small cohorts with high patient satisfaction. Hair growth factor therapy had long-term benefits, while narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy showed relapse within one month. Intense pulsed light with supramolecular salicylic acid, IAA-PDT, and laser therapy reduced sebum output and Malassezia furfur. Triamcinolone injections were effective against SD's immunological aspects. Hair growth factor therapy and precision cryotherapy have been successfully used to treat scalp SD. The role of BoNT in SD is still being explored; however, current evidence does not support its use.

Conclusion

Limited data reveal the need for further research on dermatological procedures for SD. These methods show promise for better patient compliance but face challenges such as cost, variable effectiveness, and unknown long-term safety. Future research should focus on protocol standardization and comprehensive evaluation of long-term outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(10):819–824. doi:10.36849/JDD.8116.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Five review authors (EOO, JHV, JHR, OAO and VNB) working in independent pairs screened titles and abstracts of references to identify studies presented as RCTs or controlled trials. We further retrieved full-text articles of such references and ran in-depth checks on study methodology to support our decision on which to include. To ensure that the study selection process was systematic, we developed and used a study selection form that operationalised the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We discussed conflicts between pairs of review authors to resolve them, and when no consensus was reached, a third review author from another pair arbitrated. The same pair of review authors assessed studies for risk of bias with recourse to a third review author when conflicts arose. JHV, JHR and colleagues within The Cochrane Collaboration (see Acknowledgements) translated studies published in languages other than English.

### Persistent facial erythema in an infant [^1050aeee]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Bloom syndrome – Incorrect. Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that can manifest with sun-sensitive facial erythema. However, other features of the condition, including café-au-lait macules, failure to thrive, and immunodeficiency were lacking.
B. NLE – Correct. Cutaneous NLE presents within the first few weeks of life, predominantly involving the periorbital ("raccoon eyes") and malar areas. Although features such as annular plaques, papulosquamous lesions, hypo/hyperpigmentation, telangiectasias, or atrophy were lacking, the maternal history of autoimmunity, photosensitivity, and distribution favored cutaneous NLE. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Ro60 (SSA) antibody (Table I). Table I Results of laboratory testing
C. Seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect. Infantile seborrheic dermatitis features greasy, yellow scale, primarily on the scalp but also seen on the centrofacial area, including the central and lower forehead, eyebrows, and nasolabial folds. In this case, the absence of scale and scalp involvement, along with the notable presence of photosensitivity, was inconsistent with seborrheic dermatitis.
D. Cutaneous phototoxicity – Incorrect. Cutaneous phototoxicity results from UV-induced activation of a phototoxic compound in the skin, typically from a drug or plant (phytophotodermatitis), causing direct cellular injury. It presents with sunburn-like rash that resolves with peeling and hyperpigmentation. The absence of a history of such exposure and the prolonged course of symptoms were inconsistent with this diagnosis.
E. Rothmund-Thomson syndrome – Incorrect. Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, a rare genodermatosis, initially presents with erythema, edema, and blistering on the face, extremities, and buttocks, later progressing to poikiloderma. This patient lacked other features like sparse, brittle hair, skeletal abnormalities, and short stature.

### Medicated shampoos for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^c62342c0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common papulosquamous disorder of the skin, affecting 3% to 5% of the population. Dandruff, a less severe form of seborrheic dermatitis, affects a greater proportion of the population. The exact pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown, however colonization of the lipophilic yeast, Malasezzia furfur, and an inflammatory reaction to this yeast each seem to play a role in disease etiology. Therefore, treatment for seborrheic dermatitis is aimed at yeast elimination and inflammation control. Several treatment modalities are available for seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff including shampoos, which contain both active ingredients related to antimycotic or anti-inflammatory effects and also surfactant ingredients that allow these shampoos to replace regular shampoos in affected patients. The literature regarding the treatment of therapeutic shampoos is reviewed, and treatment strategies for managing seborrheic dermatitis with therapeutic shampoos are provided.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^51e87460]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis differential diagnosis and reassessment — AD should be differentiated from other red, scaly skin conditions, and it is often difficult to separate AD from seborrheic dermatitis in infancy, with overlap possible in this age group. AD usually spares the groin and axillary regions, while seborrheic dermatitis affects these areas and tends not to be pruritic. Particularly if not responding to therapy, the diagnosis of AD should be re-reviewed and other disorders considered, including more serious nutritional, metabolic, and immunologic conditions in children and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adults. The original UK criteria cannot be applied to very young children, although revisions to include infants have since been proposed, and allergic contact dermatitis may be both an alternative diagnosis to AD and/or an exacerbator of AD in some individuals.

### Patient with treatment resistant peristomal and scalp dermatitis [^7a365e23]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. LCH – Correct. LCH is a spectrum of diseases caused by a clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells. Patients present with scaly, erythematous, seborrhea-like eruptions with follicular papules on the scalp, face, trunk, and erosions in intertriginous areas. Birbeck granules on electron microscopy were used to diagnose LCH, but this has been replaced by CD1a and Langerin immunohistochemical stains. BRAF V600E is the most common mutation identified in LCH lesions.
B. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Mycosis fungoides is the most common subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and presents with erythematous patches and plaques in sun-protected areas. Histology demonstrates papillary dermal fibrosis and epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes.
C. Dermatomyositis – Incorrect. Dermatomyositis is a multisystem autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by inflammatory myopathy, photo-distributed cutaneous eruption, and pathogenic autoantibodies. Age-appropriate screening is recommended to rule out underlying malignancy. Although psoriasiform dermatitis of the scalp is seen in dermatomyositis, this patient's rash morphology, distribution, and pathology are atypical for dermatomyositis.
D. MCR – Incorrect. MCR is a rare histiocytic disorder associated with solid organ and hematologic malignancy. Unlike our case, MCR presents with symmetric erosive polyarthritis and papulonodular lesions on the face and dorsal hands. Histology shows CD207- negative histiocytic infiltrate and multinucleated giant cells.
E. Seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect. Seborrheic dermatitis presents with thick, pink plaques with scale on the scalp, nasolabial folds, trunk, and skinfolds, but lacks follicular papules.

### Microbiota-independent spontaneous dermatitis associated with increased sebaceous lipid production in tmem79-deficient mice [^75e284c5]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

TMEM79 is a predisposing gene for atopic dermatitis. Tmem79-deficient mice develop spontaneous dermatitis in a biphasic pattern. The first-phase dermatitis is unique because it occurs independent of microbiota status, whereas the second-phase dermatitis is microbiota dependent. In this study, we sought to identify the key factors mediating the development of first-phase dermatitis. Structural analysis showed that sebaceous gland hyperplasia started from first-phase dermatitis. Longitudinal RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant activation of fatty acid lipid metabolism pathways in first-phase dermatitis, whereas T helper 17‒based immune response genes were highly expressed in second-phase dermatitis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that genes involved in fatty acid elongation and sebocyte differentiation were upregulated in first-phase dermatitis. The results of thin-layer chromatography supported these findings with an increased abundance of wax esters, cholesterol esters, and fatty alcohols in hair lipids. Further gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed an increase in total fatty acid production, including that of elongated C20-24 saturated and C18-24 monounsaturated fatty acids. Collectively, these results suggest that aberrant production of sebaceous long-chain fatty acids is associated with microbiota-independent dermatitis. Further investigation of Tmem79-deficient mice may clarify the role of certain fatty acids in dermatitis.

### Central hair loss in African American women: incidence and potential risk factors [^ba1c3aeb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although central scalp hair loss is a common problem in African American women, data on etiology or incidence are limited.

Objective

We sought to determine the frequency of various patterns and degree of central scalp hair loss in African American women and to correlate this with information on hair care practices, family history of hair loss, and medical history.

Methods

Five hundred twenty-nine subjects at six different workshops held at four different sites in the central and/or southeast United States participated in this study. The subjects' patterns and degree of central scalp hair loss were independently assessed by both subject and investigator using a standardized photographic scale. Subjects also completed a detailed questionnaire and had standardized photographs taken. Statistical analysis was performed evaluating answers to the questionnaire relative to pattern of central hair loss.

Results

Extensive central scalp hair loss was seen in 5.6% of subjects. There was no obvious association of extensive hair loss with relaxer or hot comb use, history of seborrheic dermatitis or reaction to a hair care product, bacterial infection, or male pattern hair loss in fathers of subjects; however, there was an association with a history of tinea capitis.

Limitations

There was no scalp biopsy correlation with clinical pattern of hair loss and further information on specifics of hair care practices is needed.

Conclusions

This central scalp photographic scale and questionnaire provide a valid template by which to further explore potential etiologic factors and relationships to central scalp hair loss in African American women.

### Finasteride (Propecia) [^82c898df]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1	Studies in Men

The efficacy of PROPECIA was demonstrated in men (88% Caucasian) with mild to moderate androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss) between 18 and 41 years of age. In order to prevent seborrheic dermatitis which might confound the assessment of hair growth in these studies, all men, whether treated with finasteride or placebo, were instructed to use a specified, medicated, tar-based shampoo (Neutrogena T/Gel® Shampoo) during the first 2 years of the studies.

There were three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of 12-month duration. The two primary endpoints were hair count and patient self-assessment; the two secondary endpoints were investigator assessment and ratings of photographs. In addition, information was collected regarding sexual function (based on a self-administered questionnaire) and non-scalp body hair growth. The three studies were conducted in 1879 men with mild to moderate, but not complete, hair loss. Two of the studies enrolled men with predominantly mild to moderate vertex hair loss (n = 1553). The third enrolled men having mild to moderate hair loss in the anterior mid-scalp area with or without vertex balding (n = 326).

### Role of antifungal agents in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^c2cd861e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a superficial fungal disease of the skin, occurring in areas rich in sebaceous glands. It is thought that an association exists between Malassezia yeasts and seborrheic dermatitis. This may, in part, be due to an abnormal or inflammatory immune response to these yeasts. The azoles represent the largest class of antifungals used in the treatment of this disease to date. In addition to their antifungal properties, some azoles, including bifonazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, which may be beneficial in alleviating symptoms. Other topical antifungal agents, such as the allylamines (terbinafine), benzylamines (butenafine), hydroxypyridones (ciclopirox), and immunomodulators (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), have also been effective. In addition, recent studies have revealed that tea tree oil (Melaleuca oil), honey, and cinnamic acid have antifungal activity against Malassezia species, which may be of benefit in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. In cases where seborrheic dermatitis is widespread, the use of an oral therapy, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine, may be preferred. Essentially, antifungal therapy reduces the number of yeasts on the skin, leading to an improvement in seborrheic dermatitis. With a wide availability of preparations, including creams, shampoos, and oral formulations, antifungal agents are safe and effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis… [^7ffec670]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Based on the current understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition, the treatments for seborrheic dermatitis make biologic sense. Keratolytics help remove the outer layers of the hyper-proliferating stratum corneum. 9 Coal tar is thought to decrease the rate of stratum corneum production. 9 Antifungals decrease the Malassezia population, whereas anti-inflammatories such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors decrease the inflammatory response. Many of the current treatments for seborrheic dermatitis have multiple effects, thereby combatting the skin changes on multiple levels. The severity of symptoms can be affected by stress and sun exposure, and often has a variable course despite treatment. FACE AND BODY The mainstays of treatment for facial seborrheic dermatitis are topical antifungals, corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors.

Ketoconazole 2% is as effective as hydrocortisone 1% cream. 22 Ketoconazole 2% gel significantly reduced symptoms of erythema, pruritus, and scaling compared with vehicle alone. 23 Ciclopirox appears to be better tolerated and more effective than ketoconazole 2% gel. 24, 25 Ciclopirox 1% cream was shown in a randomized, double-blinded trial to greatly reduce symptoms when used as a maintenance medication. Low- or mid-potency topical corticosteroids have been successful in reducing symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis and are as effective as antifungal and other anti-inflammatory agents. 22, 29 Although they are effective and cost significantly less than topical antifungals and calcineurin inhibitors, topical corticosteroids are best used as second-line agents because long-term use has been associated with thinning of the skin and formation of telangiectasia. 2, 18, 19, 22, 26, 28, 29, 32.

27–32 Pimecrolimus 1% cream provides longer-lasting symptom relief than betamethasone valerate
0. 1% cream. 28 Tacrolimus 0. 1% ointment may improve symptoms as well as hydrocortisone cream.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^0ce7e699]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) — distinguishing features are outlined across common conditions: Irritant contact dermatitis shows that healing begins promptly on withdrawal of the offending agent and patch testing negative. Atopic dermatitis features a personal or family history of atopy with flexural areas in adolescence and adults. Seborrheic dermatitis involves distribution in areas with sebaceous glands and a distinctive morphology of dull, yellowish-red, sharply demarcated lesions covered with greasy-looking scales. Dyshidrotic eczema presents with small (1–2 mm) vesicles on a nonerythematous base affecting palms/soles/fingers, and it persists for 2–3 weeks before resolving. These differentiating findings help separate these entities from ACD.

Case report

A 65-year-old Black woman with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus presented for diffuse hair loss over a 6-month period. Her hair loss was associated with periods of intense itching, burning, and tenderness. No prior treatments had been trialed, and she denied fever, chills, rash, joint pain, or joint stiffness.

Physical examination revealed diffuse scaling without erythema and patchy areas of alopecia involving the majority of her scalp, sparing only the mid-lower portion of the occipital scalp (Fig 1). Hair pull test was negative, and no specific findings were seen on dermoscopy. Although the scaling was attributed to seborrheic dermatitis, the distribution of the alopecia was peculiar given her history, and thus a punch biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed deposition of eosinophilic material within the dermis, around hair follicles, and focally within some small subcutaneous vessels (Fig 2). The deposits were positively stained with Congo red and were birefringent under polarized light. As these histologic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis, an underlying systemic workup was initiated.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^257cf917]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Epidemiology of TC can be related to geographical location and social, cultural and nutritional factors: in infants, across Europe and the Mediterranean basin, M. canis remains the most common organism responsible for TC, with prevalence ranges between 0.23 and 2.6%. Trichophyton tonsurans is reported as accounting for 50–90% of dermatophyte scalp isolates in the UK and the USA. In addition, T. tonsurans has spread to both South America and West Africa. T.violaceum is the most common in Greece and Belgium.

Tinea capitis in infants likely is more common than is reported and recent literature demonstrates a significant increase. Although the incidence is low, sometimes TC is misdiagnosed and underreported, and differential diagnosis may include seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, neonatal lupus, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and syphilis. TC should be suspected in a child with alopecia, pruritus and/or persistent desquamation and thinning hair, and the scalp lesion should be investigated from a mycological point of view.

The drug of choice for the treatment of TC is griseofulvin in children. Six to twelve weeks therapy is recommended or until the patient tests negative for fungi (light microscopy and culture). However, the long period of treatment required with this antifungal drug is a significant disadvantage and leads to reduced compliance. Other oral antifungals, specifically fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and terbinafine are available and give the advantage of good safety and efficacy profiles, and shorter required duration of treatment of TC caused by Tricophyton and Microsporum. Fremerey and Nenoff reported a case of TC in a newborn caused by T. soudanense. The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluconazole and topical clotrimazole and octenidine therapy; after one week of treatment, the lesions were resolving. Oral terbinafine, which is often administered in dermatophytosis, is FDA approved only for treatment of TC in children four years of age or older. Oral ketoconazole has been suggested for treatment of dermatophyte infections where griseofulvin is not tolerated. However, Michaels et al. do not consider oral ketoconazole to be as prudent an alternative due to the higher risk of hepatotoxicity.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^386e2ad1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) diagnosis — essential features must be present and include pruritus; eczema (acute, subacute, chronic) with typical morphology and age-specific patterns; and chronic or relapsing history, with patterns including facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children, current or previous flexural lesions in any age group, and sparing of the groin and axillary regions. Important features seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis, include early age of onset, atopy with personal and/or family history or immunoglobulin E reactivity, and xerosis. Associated features help to suggest the diagnosis but are too nonspecific to be used for defining or detecting AD for research and epidemiologic studies, and include atypical vascular responses (facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch response), keratosis pilaris/pityriasis alba/hyperlinear palms/ichthyosis, ocular/periorbital changes, other regional findings (perioral changes/periauricular lesions), and perifollicular accentuation/lichenification/prurigo lesions. Exclusionary conditions note that a diagnosis of AD depends on excluding scabies, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic), ichthyoses, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, psoriasis, photosensitivity dermatoses, immune deficiency diseases, and erythroderma of other causes.

Implications for research

The following issues should be attended to in future trials.

Methodological quality - Trial investigators should describe random sequence allocation, allocation concealment and blinding when reporting trials, as would this would make for greater certainty of conclusions.
Completeness of reporting - Side effects and conflicts of interest should be better reported.
Validated outcome measures - This review has emphasised the applicability of validated outcome measures. Expert committees of dermatologists should consider what outcome measures would most objectively assess treatment efficacy in seborrhoeic dermatitis. These should be streamlined and validated. In the interim, all trials should report the proportions of participants with complete clearance of symptoms.
Participant-oriented outcome variables - Measures such as quality of life index would enhance the objectivity of the assessment of efficacy and would provide participants' perspectives on level of efficacy. Future research should consider using these measures, albeit in a standardised way, for outcome assessment.
Compliance with treatment regimen - This clearly impacts outcomes for any mode of treatment. A summary documentation of actual compliance among participants completing trials could be used to stratify analyses of efficacy.
Longer-term assessments with follow-up of at least one year are needed because seborrhoic dermatitis is a chronic condition with a high relapse rate. This plan will also enable better long-term assessment of side effects. A treatment regimen is needed for the intermittent delivery of active agent to a site at a rate that would compromise neither efficacy nor participant compliance. This consideration would address and define parameters for sustained remission.
Economic evaluations - As most of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, the suitability of evidence so obtained for providers in resource-constrained settings, where prescribers often have to decide between effectiveness and affordability of care, remains questionable. Good economic evaluations would give an indication regarding which option would best suit the collective objectives of patients, providers and the financing system.
We found various kinds of placebo favoured by different trial investigators. Given the high rate of resolution of symptoms under placebo treatment (about 25%), it is important to find out which aspects of treatment could account for this. Some of these placebos were vehicles and bases commonly used as carriers for the active agent. Specific formulations of many placebos were unstated. We considered that the formulation of the placebo may have implications for efficacy. Although this review did not include an analysis based on choice of comparative placebo, it would seem a reasonable undertaking. Subsequent reviews on this topic should explore this question.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^1536e6f7]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibition may be effective for seborrheic dermatitis based on its capacity to suppress proinflammatory cytokines implicated in seborrheic dermatitis pathophysiology by elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. Limited evidence from case reports and a small clinical trial supported efficacy of the topical PDE4 inhibitor crisaborole and the oral PDE4 inhibitor apremilast, both used off label, for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Roflumilast is a selective, highly potent PDE4 inhibitor with between 25- and more than 300-fold greater potency than crisaborole or apremilast in vitro. An oral formulation of roflumilast is approved for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Topical roflumilast is under investigation for long-term management of various dermatologic conditions, including atopic dermatitis, scalp psoriasis, and chronic plaque psoriasis (approved July 29, 2022, by the US Food and Drug Administration). We present results of a phase 2a randomized clinical trial of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for once-daily treatment of seborrheic dermatitis on scalp and nonscalp locations.

### Manifestation of pityriasis amiantacea following initiation of minoxidil [^2cd1ddf6]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pityriasis amiantacea (PA) is a uncommon inflammatory condition of the scalp, characterized by hyperkeratotic, thick, adherent scales that bind to hair follicles and can lead to hair matting and alopecia. It predominantly affects females (60%-70%) and has a variable age of onset; however, it is commonly observed during the teenage years. Although its etiology remains unknown, it is hypothesized to be an autoinflammatory reaction pattern to a multitude of scalp diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and lichen planus. Genetic and environmental factors also appear to play a role in PA. In addition, there have been reports of PA development following the initiation of certain drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors. However, this is, to our knowledge, the first known case of PA manifesting after the use of topical minoxidil.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^6002df57]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Rates of treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were low and generally comparable with vehicle. Few patients reported stinging, burning, application site reactions, or application site pain with either roflumilast or vehicle treatment. The tolerability profile demonstrates emollient properties of the vehicle formulated without excipients known to cause irritation, such as propylene glycol. This is important because of high rates of application site pain with the only other topical PDE4 inhibitor (crisaborole), which is approved for atopic dermatitis and has rates of application site pain between 13.8% and 31.7%. The low rates of application site pain in the current study suggest this is not a general feature of PDE4 inhibition. Additionally, in a trial evaluating efficacy and tolerability of tacrolimus, 1%, ointment in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis, approximately 47% of patients reported burning. Local tolerability issues and adverse effects associated with other topical treatments of seborrheic dermatitis, such as corticosteroids, antifungals, and off-label use of calcineurin inhibitors, may limit their duration and usage.

The current standard of care for seborrheic dermatitis is to use multiple agents (usually an antifungal and anti-inflammatory). In addition to an anti-inflammatory effect, roflumilast inhibits yeast PDE activity, suggesting a possible additional antifungal effect.

Limitations

A limitation of this study was the 8-week treatment period. A second limitation is the relatively small patient population enrolled in the current trial. A phase 3 randomized clinical trial (n = 457) should provide additional information about efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis. Third, the number of patients with severe seborrheic dermatitis was small.

### Research in brief: survey of hair care practices in various ethnic and racial pediatric populations [^62e7ae51]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Medicated shampoos are part of the standard care of seborrheic dermatitis (SD), yet hair-washing practices can vary in frequency, which could impact treatment effectiveness and therapeutic benefit. The goal of this study is to understand common hair-washing practices in pediatric patients, with focus on Black children with SD, through online survey. Patients identifying as Black or mixed race were more likely to use medicated washes weekly or less frequently than White patients (62.5% vs. 30.8%). It is important that clinicians understand Black- and mixed-race hair care practices to provide better clinical guidance on the usage of medicated shampoos, especially for the treatment of SD.

### Eyebrow and eyelash alopecia: a clinical review [^d9736916]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic

As no pharmacologic therapy has been FDA-approved for trichotillomania, the mainstay treatment remains psychotherapy. N -acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione and glutamate modulator, at a dosage of 1200–1800 mg/day has been used to treat scalp trichotillomania, but there are no reports of its efficacy in treating eyebrow and eyelash trichotillomania.

Hair transplantation by follicular unit extraction (FUE) has been successfully performed for eyebrow alopecia from burn injury using pretreatment with combined non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) and microfat injection. A strip micrograft using FUE technique, with eyebrow hairs as the donor site, has also been successfully conducted for traumatic madarosis of the upper and lower eyelid in one case report.

Primary Dermatoses

In atopic dermatitis, treatment with emollients and topical corticosteroids have been reported to result in partial eyebrow regrowth in one case report. Partial eyebrow regrowth was also observed in one patient treated with subcutaneous dupilumab.

Seborrheic dermatitis is associated with colonization with Malasezzia spp. and treatment with a topical antifungal, low-potency corticosteroid cream, or topical calcineurin inhibitor to the eyebrows has been found to be both safe and effective.

Other

Because eyelash follicles express prostaglandin F2α receptors, prostaglandin analogs can affect their growth. LATISSE ® (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%) once daily was approved by the US FDA in 2008 for eyelash hypotrichosis and has been shown to increase eyelash pigmentation, length, and thickness.

In one randomized controlled trial including 357 patients with idiopathic or unspecified eyebrow loss, the efficacy of topical bimatoprost 0.03% applied once or twice daily was compared to a non-medicated control. Improvements in eyebrow fullness and thickness were noted in both bimatoprost groups when compared to the control (p < 0.001). Another randomized trial with 39 participants used 2% minoxidil lotion applied to the eyebrows twice daily for 16 weeks and found significant improvement in both global photographic scores and hair count with the use of minoxidil when compared to vehicle.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^20fd9cf4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

We pooled risk ratios for studies with dichotomous outcomes and mean differences or, when appropriate, standardised mean differences for studies with continuous outcomes using their weighted average for treatment effect as implemented in the RevMan software (RevMan). When heterogeneity was greater than 50%, we used a random-effects model. When heterogeneity was severe - I² statistic greater than 80% - we did not perform a meta-analysis but reported individual study results separately.

Grade

We used the programme GRADEPro to assess the quality of evidence across studies and to generate 'Summary of findings' tables for the most important comparisons that included a relevant number of studies. We started at a high level of quality because we included only randomised studies. We then used limitations in study design, consistency of results, directness, precision and publication bias to determine whether this should be downgraded by one or more levels. We reported our reasons for doing so as footnotes in the 'Summary of findings' table and in Table 1. We considered the study design to have limitations when most of the studies in a comparison had unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, unclear allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessment.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to perform a subgroup analysis among HIV-positive participants with seborrhoeic dermatitis, but only one study included patients with HIV.

We conducted subgroup analyses based on conflicts of interest, dose and mode of delivery. These subgroup analyses were not planned in the protocol. Trial results were not presented in such a way as to allow subgroup analysis based on age, sex or presence of co-morbidity (significant co-morbidity was an exclusion criterion in many trials), as we had intended to do. Study factors (i.e. quality, design) that we had proposed as a basis for subgroup analysis were used instead for sensitivity analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

We attempted to carry out a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies that we judged to have high risk of bias based on inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment or absence of blinding. However, we found too few studies on subgroup categorisation to effectively perform this. We deemed exclusion on the basis of accuracy of diagnosis (as stated in the protocol) as not worthwhile because most trials did not explicitly state whether the diagnosis was made by a physician. We dropped other criteria as stated in the protocol because they were not feasible (see Differences between protocol and review).

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^f72edd78]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Given the extensive search and absence of language restrictions, we are confident that we located most of the studies on topical antifungal treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, we found sufficient evidence to draw conclusions only for ketoconazole-, ciclopirox- and bifonazole-based treatments. For several classes of antifungals, no studies at all were conducted. Studies with long-term follow-up were particularly sparse. Various studies were carried out over a wide time span, with the oldest study dating as far back as 1985. Many studies did not report our primary outcomes; when this occurred, we included studies that reported only our secondary outcomes. When studies were so poorly reported that we could not use the data in meta-analyses, we reported study findings in the text of this review. Studies used a wide range of doses and application modes of topical antifungal agents. We included studies on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp, and on dandruff, which is considered a mild form of seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we are confident that we have included all available evidence.

In most studies, participants were of widely ranging age groups and of both sexes. Results from most studies were given for all participants without stratification on the basis of sex, age and so forth. Thus we could not explore the role of these personal characteristics in treatment outcomes. Most studies used pregnancy as an exclusion criterion; therefore it is unclear whether antifungals are efficacious in pregnant women within a similar range as in non-pregnant women, given known changes in hormone profiles.

Studies included in this review were conducted in different countries, but these were nations with predominantly light-skinned populations. No study analysed outcomes on the basis of ethnicity of participants; thus it was unclear which segments of study participants were of darker skin. It should be borne in mind that seborrhoeic dermatitis in people with darker skin is less easy to diagnose than in those with lighter skin.

### A novel foam formulation of ketoconazole 2% for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis on multiple body regions [^92352087]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A novel topical foam formulation of ketoconazole has been developed for use on the scalp, body, and face.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice-daily treatment with ketoconazole 2% foam for seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp, body, and face.

Methods

One thousand one hundred sixty-two subjects, aged 12 years or older, with mild to severe seborrheic dermatitis were randomized to receive ketoconazole foam (n = 427), vehicle foam (n = 420), ketoconazole cream (n = 210), or vehicle cream (n = 105) twice daily for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving an Investigator's Static Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 at week 4 (treatment success).

Results

A significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved treatment success using ketoconazole foam than vehicle foam (56% and 42%, respectively; P < .0001); ketoconazole foam was shown to be equivalent to ketoconazole cream. Ketoconazole foam was well-tolerated with a low incidence of treatment-related adverse events (14%; 59/427).

Conclusion

Ketoconazole foam 2% is a safe, effective, and versatile formulation for use on the scalp, body, and face for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in patients aged 12 years or older.

### Eyebrow and eyelash alopecia: a clinical review [^de498616]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nutritional

Nutrient deficiency of zinc has been reported to cause eyebrow and eyelash alopecia. Sparse eyebrows and hair secondary to zinc deficiency has been reported in a patient on parenteral nutrition. Acrodermatitis enteropathica, an inherited disorder of abnormal zinc absorption, has also been shown to cause diffuse eyebrow and eyelash loss.

Traumatic

Causes of eyebrow and eyelash loss from trauma include trichotillomania, or hair loss from repetitive pulling or overplucking of hair. Trichotillomania can present clinically as irregular, patchy alopecia of the eyebrows and/or eyelashes, with hair shafts of varying lengths (Fig. 3). Eyebrow and/or eyelash hairs may be nonuniform, tufted, or tortuous, and hair follicles may be prominently visible. Trichoscopy shows broken hairs of different lengths, black dots, hook hairs, tulip hairs, and the V sign. Eyelash alopecia is typically limited to the longer eyelashes of the upper eyelid. Patients may state that the eyelashes bother them when blinking, justifying removal of those eyelashes.

Fig. 3
Patient with trichotillomania presenting with irregular, patchy alopecia of the eyebrow, with hair shafts of varying lengths, prominently visible hair follicles, and eyelash alopecia limited to eyelashes of the upper lid

Rarely, patients may present with eyebrow alopecia after a burn injury with hot liquids or fire that may lead to formation of scar tissue below the brow.

Primary Dermatoses

Atopic dermatitis can present with loss of the lateral third of the eyebrows (Hertoghe sign) in up to 39% of patients, as well as eyelid dermatitis, though involvement of more than just the lateral third of the eyebrow is possible. Although alopecia can be caused by chronic rubbing, eyebrow loss has also occurred in patients without a history of eyebrow manipulation. It is hypothesized that inflammation may itself be responsible for the alopecia.

Another primary dermatosis, seborrheic dermatitis, can cause madarosis that presents as scaling and erythema of the eyebrows. Eyebrow loss can be a result of repeated scratching due to pruritis. Trichoscopy often reveals casts surrounding the eyelashes.

Psoriasis can cause inflammation of the eyelids (i.e. blepharitis) and psoriatic plaques, and severe cases of eyelid psoriasis can cause loss of eyelashes.

### Videodermoscopy in the evaluation of hair and scalp disorders [^90d518c9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The standard methods used to diagnose scalp and hair disorders (eg, simple clinical inspection, pull test, biopsy) vary in sensitivity, reproducibility, and invasiveness. Studies on a few entities suggest that use of dermoscopy can improve clinical accuracy, but further investigation is needed.

Objectives

We sought to: (1) characterize features of several nontumoral scalp and hair conditions using videodermoscopy; and (2) assess the potential usefulness of videodermoscopy in the clinical evaluation of these conditions.

Methods

Images (x20-70 magnification) obtained with videodermoscopy from 220 patients with various scalp and hair disorders and 15 unaffected control subjects were reviewed for distinguishing features.

Results

Conditions evaluated included psoriasis (23), seborrheic dermatitis (26), alopecia areata (58), androgenetic alopecia (64), chronic telogen effluvium (7), trichotillomania (12), and primary cicatricial alopecia (30). Clinical features evident to the naked eye were seen in great detail when videodermoscopy was used. Novel features (eg, yellow dots in alopecia areata) were also identified.

Limitations

Findings require confirmation by blinded, prospective investigation.

Conclusions

Use of videodermoscopy in the clinical evaluation of scalp and hair disorders improves diagnostic capability beyond simple clinical inspection and reveals novel features of disease, which may extend clinical and pathogenetic understanding.

### Mask-associated acquired trichorrhexis nodosa of the beard [^5ce2a319]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 31-year-old man with longstanding type 1 diabetes presented in March 2021 with concerns about his facial hair. He described an 8-month history of breakage and uneven hair length, along with "white dots" limited to the hairs of his beard. He did not report hair changes elsewhere on the body or a family history of hair disorders. At the onset, he was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and treated with triamcinolone 0.025% lotion daily without improvement. On clinical examination at follow-up, white nodes were observed on hair shafts throughout the beard with relative sparing of the mustache area (Fig 1). The hair density of the beard was normal, as were scalp and eyebrow hair density and length. The surrounding skin was normal without erythema, scale, or other signs of dermatitis. The differential diagnosis included white piedra, hair casts, pediculosis, TN, trichorrhexis invaginata, or seborrheic dermatitis. Trichoscopy revealed a "thrust paint brush" appearance of the hair shaft typical of TN (Fig 2). No lice, nits, peripilar scale, or casts were identified on trichoscopy. A bacterial swab grew normal skin flora, and hair-pull fungal culture was negative. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and hemoglobin levels were within the normal range.

### Scalp involvement in patients referred for patch testing: retrospective cross-sectional analysis of north American contact dermatitis group data, 1996 to 2016 [^b4a94df3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Scalp conditions are often multifactorial.

Objective

To characterize patients with scalp involvement and patch-testing outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of North American Contact Dermatitis Group data (1996–2016). Study groups included patients with scalp involvement (≤ 3 anatomic sites coded) with or without additional sites.

Results

A total of 4.8% of patients (2331/48,753) had scalp identified as 1 of up to 3 affected anatomic sites. Approximately one-third of "scalp-only" individuals had a specific primary diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (38.6%), followed by seborrheic dermatitis (17.2%) and irritant contact dermatitis (9.3%). When adjacent anatomic sites were affected, allergic contact dermatitis was more frequently identified as the primary diagnosis (> 50%). The top 5 currently clinically relevant allergens in scalp-only patients were p-phenylenediamine, fragrance mix I, nickel sulfate, balsam of Peru, and cinnamic aldehyde. Methylisothiazolinone sensitivity was notable when adjacent anatomic sites were involved. The top 3 specifically identified sources for scalp-only allergens were hair dyes, shampoo/conditioners, and consumer items (eg, hair appliances, glasses).

Limitations

Tertiary referral population.

Conclusion

Isolated scalp involvement was less likely to be associated with allergic contact dermatitis than when adjacent anatomic sites were involved. Overlap with multiple diagnoses was frequent, including seborrheic dermatitis, irritant dermatitis, other dermatoses, or all 3. p-Phenylenediamine was the most common allergen.

### Androgenetic alopecia in adolescents: a report of 43 cases [^1e12362d]. The Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of hair loss in adults, but it also occurs in adolescents, though its prevalence among this younger population is not well established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations and endocrine status of adolescent patients with AGA in Korea. This 5-year (January 2001-August 2005) clinical study involved 43 adolescent patients with AGA. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) laboratory studies were undertaken to investigate androgenic hormonal effects. Hair loss severity was categorized using the Hamilton-Norwood and Ludwig classifications. Gender ratio showed a male predominance (M: F, 35:8), and a mean age at onset of 16.8 years. These adolescent patients showed milder symptoms than adults, and a family history of alopecia was found in 72.1%, which is greater than that reported in adults, which ranges 30.9–64.5%. Seborrheic dermatitis (27.9%) was the condition most commonly associated with AGA among our study subjects, followed in descending order by acne vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. Serum levels of testosterone and DHEA-S were within normal limits, except in one subject. Our study shows the clinical characteristics of AGA in Korean adolescents.

### Optimal management of fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails [^ac89e4bd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are chronic and recurring conditions. Tinea capitis is a scalp infection, primarily affecting prepubescent children. Ringworm infections, such as tinea corporis and tinea cruris, involve the glabrous skin. Tinea nigra is a rare mycotic infection that may be related to travel abroad. Piedra, black or white, is limited to the hair shaft without involvement of the adjacent skin. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are dermatoses associated with yeasts of the genus Malassezia that affect the lipid-rich areas of the body. The taxonomy of the Malassezia yeasts has been revised to include nine species, eight of which have been recovered from humans. Tinea pedis, an infection of the feet and toes, is one of the most common forms of dermatophytosis. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection affecting the nail bed and nail plate; it may be chronic and can be difficult to treat. In instances where the superficial fungal infection is severe or chronic, an oral antifungal agent should be considered. Terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are oral antifungals that are effective in the treatment of superficial mycoses.

### Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for psoriasis of the scalp and body: the ARRECTOR phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^b9261896]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical data for roflumilast demonstrates its safety and efficacy as a once-daily cream or foam for long-term management of various dermatologic conditions, including chronic plaque psoriasis (cream, 0.3%), atopic dermatitis (cream, 0.15% and 0.05%), and seborrheic dermatitis (foam, 0.3%). Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, was adapted from the high-water content formulation (approximately 48% water) of roflumilast cream, 0.3%, and includes addition of a propellant. Roflumilast foam differs from other topical foam formulations because it contains excipients that maintain the skin barrier, are used in cosmetic products but are novel to prescription topical products, and ensure its suitability for a wide variety of skin and hair types. Additionally, roflumilast foam does not contain ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, formaldehyde-releasing agents, or fragrances that can irritate skin, damage hair, or lead to contact sensitization.

In a phase 2b trial for psoriasis of the scalp and body, roflumilast foam, 0.3%, was well tolerated and improved patients' psoriasis signs and symptoms, including pruritus. The objective of this phase 3 trial was to assess efficacy and safety of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, vs vehicle administered once daily for 8 weeks in adolescent and adult patients with psoriasis of the scalp and body.
