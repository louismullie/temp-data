## Question

What is the role of radioactive iodine therapy in the treatment of thyroid cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in thyroid cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological rationale and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the current indications and how they vary by risk category. Next, I will examine dosing strategies and preparation protocols. After that, I need to review outcomes data and controversies, including low-risk disease and second malignancy risks. I will then consider special populations and RAI-refractory disease. Finally, I should integrate a practical decision framework and conclude with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the biological rationale and mechanism. RAI leverages the sodium-iodide symporter expressed by thyroid follicular cells, including most differentiated thyroid cancers, to deliver beta-emitting 131I that ablates thyroid tissue and iodine-avid tumor foci. This is the foundation of its specificity and therapeutic effect, and explains why it is generally not effective in medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancers that lack this transport mechanism [^114py5AN] [^11216FPP] [^111SKXxU].

> I need to check the current indications and how they have evolved. Historically, RAI was used broadly after total thyroidectomy, but contemporary practice is risk-adapted: RAI is not routinely recommended for ATA low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), may be considered for intermediate-risk disease, and is generally recommended for high-risk disease. This shift reflects recognition that many low-risk patients derive no survival benefit and may incur harm, whereas higher-risk patients accrue meaningful recurrence and mortality benefits [^1142T9xE] [^112qZ4by] [^116h3dYi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the specific roles of RAI in practice. RAI is used for three distinct purposes: remnant ablation to destroy residual normal thyroid tissue and facilitate surveillance, adjuvant therapy to eradicate suspected microscopic disease, and treatment of known persistent or metastatic disease; distinguishing these intents guides dose selection and expectations for response [^116FnCLd] [^116h3dYi].

> Next, I should review dosing strategies. For remnant ablation, low-activity 131I (about 30 mCi, 1.11 GBq) is standard and achieves comparable ablation success with fewer side effects than higher activities. For adjuvant therapy, typical activities range from 30–100 mCi (1.11–3.7 GBq), with up to 150 mCi considered in select cases. For known metastatic disease, 100–200 mCi (3.7–7.4 GBq) is usual, with dosimetry-based approaches favored in advanced disease to maximize tumor dose while respecting marrow and lung safety thresholds [^113hu1co] [^112Sxmrw] [^114CLdj6].

> Wait, let me verify preparation protocols because uptake optimization matters. TSH elevation is required to enhance NIS-mediated iodine uptake; this can be achieved by thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant human TSH (rhTSH), with rhTSH commonly preferred for patient comfort and to avoid hypothyroidism; a low-iodine diet for 1–2 weeks and objective confirmation of iodine restriction (e.g., urinary iodine < 100 mcg/L) improve ablation rates, and pregnancy must be excluded and avoided for 6–12 months after RAI [^111AE5HS] [^116njviw] [^112JFsgH].

> I will now examine outcomes and controversies, especially in low-risk disease. Multiple systematic reviews and observational data show no clear survival or recurrence benefit for routine RAI in low-risk DTC, supporting selective or omission strategies; conversely, in intermediate- and high-risk cohorts, RAI is associated with improved disease-free and overall survival, with large database analyses suggesting a 29% reduction in mortality in intermediate-risk patients treated with RAI [^113UfZhf] [^117TGxhj] [^11647Fqx].

> But wait, what about harms? I should double-check the long-term risks. RAI is associated with salivary dysfunction, transient bone marrow suppression, and a dose-related increase in second primary malignancies, particularly leukemia and solid tumors such as breast, salivary gland, uterine, and lung; large epidemiologic cohorts show a linear dose–response for solid cancer mortality after RAI for hyperthyroidism, and pediatric/young adult DTC cohorts demonstrate a 23% increase in solid cancers and 92% increase in leukemia after RAI, reinforcing the need to avoid unnecessary exposure in low-risk patients [^114CLdj6] [^114hXMoM] [^111qiu33].

> Let me consider special populations and practical constraints. In children and adolescents, RAI can be effective but carries higher long-term second-cancer risks, so indications should be stringent and dosing minimized. In pregnancy and lactation, RAI is contraindicated. In renal impairment or dialysis, excretion and dosing require modification and coordination with nuclear medicine and nephrology. In elderly patients, lower empirical doses or dosimetry-based approaches help mitigate toxicity [^1121psDX] [^112JFsgH] [^111Yp7u1] [^111xSxVk].

> I should confirm the approach to RAI-refractory disease. Loss of iodine avidity due to dedifferentiation defines RAI-refractory DTC. In these patients, continued RAI is ineffective and systemic therapy is indicated, with multikinase inhibitors such as lenvatinib or sorafenib as first-line options. Redifferentiation strategies (e.g. MEK inhibition) and selective use of RAI after functional restoration are investigational but promising in subsets [^111BWSdv] [^112nGrE9] [^111Bpxpr].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of post-therapy imaging and biomarkers because they shape follow-up. Post-therapy whole-body scans can reveal unsuspected disease and alter management in a meaningful minority, and serum thyroglobulin in the setting of complete remnant ablation serves as a sensitive biomarker for recurrence; structured response assessment using anatomic and functional criteria is recommended to standardize outcomes reporting [^111nVife] [^112hPUAG] [^113WM3ae].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework. RAI decisions should integrate ATA risk stratification, postoperative pathology, molecular features, patient comorbidities, logistics, and preferences. For low-risk patients, omission is reasonable. For intermediate-risk patients, consider adjuvant RAI with 30–100 mCi, balancing potential survival benefit against toxicity. For high-risk patients, recommend adjuvant RAI with 100–150 mCi or higher if metastatic. Always individualize dosing, consider dosimetry in advanced disease, and avoid RAI in medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer [^1142T9xE] [^112Sxmrw] [^111SKXxU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that all intermediate-risk patients benefit equally; I should correct that. While some cohort data suggest mortality reduction with RAI in intermediate-risk DTC, the magnitude varies and evidence quality is lower than for high-risk disease, so shared decision-making and case-by-case judgment are essential, especially when adverse features are borderline or when surveillance infrastructure is robust [^117TGxhj] [^112qZ4by].

> In summary, RAI remains a cornerstone therapy for appropriately selected DTC patients, with the greatest benefit in intermediate- and high-risk disease. Modern practice emphasizes selective, lower-dose strategies, meticulous preparation, and vigilant attention to long-term risks, while RAI-refractory disease transitions to systemic therapy and precision oncology approaches continue to refine selection and dosing paradigms [^111VWvU6] [^114CLdj6] [^111BWSdv].

Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is a **targeted treatment** for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), leveraging iodine-131 to ablate residual thyroid tissue and destroy microscopic or macroscopic disease [^113tPKDi]. It is indicated for **intermediate- and high-risk patients** after total thyroidectomy, with selective use in low-risk cases based on clinicopathologic features and patient preference [^1142T9xE] [^112qZ4by]. RAI is not effective for medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer due to lack of iodine uptake [^111SKXxU]. Benefits include reduced recurrence and improved survival in high-risk disease, but risks include salivary dysfunction, hematologic effects, and second primary malignancies; dosing is individualized, and RAI-refractory disease requires alternative systemic therapies [^114CLdj6] [^111BWSdv].

---

## Mechanism of action

RAI exploits the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) in thyroid tissue, which concentrates iodine — including 131I — enabling **selective delivery of beta radiation** that destroys thyroid cells and cancerous tissue [^114py5AN]. This targeted approach minimizes damage to non-thyroid tissues while effectively ablating residual thyroid tissue and treating metastatic disease [^116h3dYi].

---

## Indications for RAI therapy

RAI therapy is indicated based on **risk stratification**, clinicopathologic features, and patient-specific factors:

| **Risk category** | **Indications for rai therapy** |
|-|-|
| Low-risk | - Not routinely recommended <br/> - Selective use for remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy based on individual patient factors and preferences [^112qZ4by] [^1142T9xE] |
| Intermediate-risk | - Adjuvant therapy considered after total thyroidectomy <br/> - Typically administered activity: 1.1–3.7 GBq (30–100 mCi) [^117TGxhj] [^112qZ4by] |
| High-risk | - Routinely recommended after total thyroidectomy <br/> - Higher administered activities (up to 7.4 GBq or 200 mCi) may be used for metastatic disease [^112qZ4by] [^112Sxmrw] |

---

RAI is **not indicated** for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) due to the absence of iodine uptake [^notfound].

---

## Clinical benefits

RAI therapy provides several **clinical benefits** in appropriately selected patients:

- **Reduction in recurrence**: RAI significantly reduces the risk of locoregional and distant recurrence, particularly in intermediate- and high-risk patients [^115Sa5Uy] [^114PDnkE].

- **Improved survival**: RAI therapy is associated with improved disease-specific survival, especially in high-risk patients [^11647Fqx] [^1156TrZ4].

- **Facilitates surveillance**: Remnant ablation allows for accurate surveillance using serum thyroglobulin and imaging, improving detection of recurrent disease [^112hPUAG].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

While generally well tolerated, RAI therapy carries **potential risks and side effects**:

- **Salivary gland dysfunction**: Xerostomia, sialadenitis, and taste disturbances are common due to salivary gland exposure to radiation [^117VCume].

- **Hematologic effects**: Transient leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and rare bone marrow suppression may occur [^1113cx1v].

- **Second primary malignancies**: Increased risk of leukemia and solid tumors, particularly with cumulative doses exceeding 5.6–7.4 GBq (150–200 mCi) [^114CLdj6] [^111qiu33].

- **Reproductive effects**: Temporary or permanent infertility, particularly in women of reproductive age [^117VCume].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Patient selection for RAI therapy is guided by **risk stratification**, clinicopathologic features, and patient preferences. Key factors include age, tumor size, histology, lymph node involvement, extrathyroidal extension, and postoperative thyroglobulin levels [^111jRvzp] [^112qZ4by] [^112Sxmrw] [^115bzqWx] [^116h3dYi].

---

## Dosing strategies

RAI dosing is individualized based on disease extent, risk category, and patient-specific factors. Common dosing strategies include **empiric fixed dosing** — standard activities based on risk category and disease extent — and **dosimetry-guided dosing** — personalized dosing based on absorbed radiation dose calculations, particularly in metastatic disease [^112Sxmrw] [^111JNeXS].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Post-RAI follow-up includes regular measurement of serum thyroglobulin (with or without anti-thyroglobulin antibodies), neck ultrasound, and periodic imaging (whole-body scans, CT, MRI, or PET/CT) to detect recurrence or metastasis [^112hPUAG] [^111AE5HS]. Response to therapy is assessed using standardized criteria, incorporating biochemical and imaging findings [^112hPUAG].

---

## Alternative treatments for RAI-refractory disease

A subset of patients develop RAI-refractory disease, characterized by loss of iodine avidity. Alternative treatments include **multikinase inhibitors** such as lenvatinib or sorafenib, which improve progression-free survival in advanced RAI-refractory DTC [^notfound], and **redifferentiation strategies** using agents such as selumetinib or retinoic acid analogs to restore iodine uptake, enabling renewed RAI therapy [^111Bpxpr] [^112nGrE9].

---

Radioactive iodine therapy is a **cornerstone of differentiated thyroid cancer management**, providing significant benefits in recurrence reduction and survival for appropriately selected patients. Careful patient selection, individualized dosing, and vigilant follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize risks.

In the past decade, the management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) underwent a paradigm shift toward the use of risk stratification with the goal of maximizing the benefit and minimizing the morbidity of radioiodine (131 I) therapy. 131 I therapy is guided by information derived from surgical histopathology, molecular markers, postoperative diagnostic radioiodine scintigraphy, and thyroglobulin levels. 131 I is used for diagnostic imaging and therapy of DTC based on physiologic sodium-iodine symporter expression in normal and neoplastic thyroid tissue. We summarize the essential information at the core of multidisciplinary DTC management, which emphasizes individualization of 131 I therapy according to the patient's risk for tumor recurrence.

### The role of external beam radiation and targeted therapy in thyroid cancer [^114dRqyx]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The initial management of thyroid cancer is usually surgery, followed by radioactive iodine in differentiated thyroid cancer. The role of external beam radiotherapy for gross residual or unresected disease is discussed. For both differentiated thyroid cancer and medullary thyroid cancer, the role of external beam radiotherapy after resection of gross disease when there is a high risk of local regional failure is reviewed. In anaplastic thyroid cancers, although most patients present with unresectable disease and radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, the benefits of the addition of chemotherapy to radiation therapy will be discussed. Patient selection, radiation volumes, and radiation doses will be discussed. As in other tumor sites, external beam radiation has an import role in the palliative management of patient with metastatic thyroid cancer of all histologies, especially of metastases to bone but also brain and lung, but this role is not described in the review.

### Chinese management guidelines for radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (2025 edition) [^112nGrE9]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAIR-DTC) has become a challenge in clinical practice, particularly in China with a high incidence and undesirable survival outcome. Since the publication of first China consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC in 2019, significant and rapid advances have occurred in the field both in China and internationally. This guideline aims to inform Chinese clinicians, researchers, patients, and health policy makers on the latest evidence and recommendations, to further standardize the clinical diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC.

Methods

The structured clinical questions addressed in this guideline were derived from clinical diagnostic and treatment processes, with references to study, prior guidelines, expert consensus, and systematic reviews, etc. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the evidence. The editorial process was completely independent of the guideline development group.

Results

The guideline addressed 26 clinical questions and formed 35 recommendations. In this guideline, the definition criteria for RAIR-DTC was optimized, prediction and identification was based on evidence including molecular testing, dynamic biochemical changes, and multimodal imaging. Comprehensive pre-treatment clinical evaluation was emphasized and tailored for individualized decision-making. The combination of systematic therapy and surgery, and the redifferentiation followed by RAI therapy were also reviewed and updated. Molecular imaging plays a unique role in the pre-assessing and therapeutic response evaluation for RAIR-DTC.

Conclusions

We have updated and developed evidence-based recommendations with the aim of providing scientific, rigorous, and comprehensive guidance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC patients in China. We hope to share our guideline with colleagues out of China, with the expectation of further comments and suggestions.

### Radioactive iodine: recognizing the need for risk-benefit balance… [^117VCume]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Accompanying ArticleOpen accessORIGINAL REPORTSAssociation Between Radioactive Iodine Treatment for Pediatric and Young Adulthood Differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Risk of Second Primary Malignancies Radioactive iodine has revolutionized the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer since its development in the 1940s. 1Quantifying the impact that RAI has had on the treatment of advanced DTC is actually difficult because it has been a mainstay of treatment for so long. In many ways, modern RAI using iodine-131 epitomizes an ideal cancer therapy — it has high specificity for tumor tissue, and the decay spectrum results in energy deposition limited predominantly to nearby tissues. RAI is very well tolerated in terms of its acute toxicity profile, especially when compared with external beam radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or even modern biologic agents. As a result, approximately half of patients diagnosed with DTC will receive RAI as a component of their treatment.

2, 3 Although RAI is well tolerated in the short term, a majority of patients experience late effects that include salivary gland dysfunction, conjunctivitis, hematologic abnormalities, and infertility. 12Furthermore, the anatomic sites of SMNs observed reflect the biodistribution and dosimetry of RAI, with highest relative risk of cancer occurring in those tissue receiving the greatest radiation exposure including the salivary glands, stomach, and kidneys. The relative risk of solid SMN was also increased for organs receiving more moderate doses such as the uterus, breast, and lungs. Despite these limitations and highlighted areas for further study, this well-written and thoughtful analysis provides yet another weight on the scale identifying that RAI therapy has higher associated risks than was once believed.

Indeed, the work led by this group's senior author has identified that even low-dose RAI therapy, such as that widely used in treatment of hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, is associated with organ absorption beyond the commonly recognized sites of the thyroid and salivary gland. 14Not only does this include less aggressive strategies for biopsy and surgical removal of thyroid nodules, but also this extends to RAI therapy, recommending against it for the smallest cancers and advocating decreased doses for larger tumors. However, there still exists a gray area in patients with intermediate risk of recurrence where the need for RAI therapy is controversial and to a great extent, determined by physician preference, limitation of expertise in the management of DTC, and institutional protocols.

### The role of external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer [^1165NZty]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

The role of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in treating thyroid cancer has brought forth controversy. Due to various histologic presentations and different natural histories, there is no uniform approach/recommendation among centers and/or authorities regarding the role of EBRT for thyroid cancer. This is particularly true for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) where the clinical course can range from a disease that is cured with simple surgery to an aggressive form of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer with high rates of recurrence/death from disease. In addition, because the majority of the patients with PTC undergo postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, the question remains as to what is the exact role of EBRT for PTC in the setting of RAI treatment? In this issue of Endocrine-Related Cancer, Chow and colleagues identified indications for EBRT and RAI therapy for PTC based on a retrospective review of 1300 patients. The authors concluded that postoperative RAI treatment is indicated in patients with pT2-pT4, pN0-pN1b while postoperative EBRT is recommended for patients with gross residual, positive margin, pT4, pN1b, and lymph nodes > 2 cm disease. Other centers have also published their experience on the value of EBRT for PTC but with different indications. The reasons for the variations from different centers are complex. However, when all published results are taken together, the findings confirm the added value of EBRT to the present management of PTC in a select group of patients, particularly those with high risk features. In this commentary, these issues will be discussed and recommendations regarding the role of EBRT will be given.

### Postoperative management of thyroid carcinoma [^112LtAA4]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Survival from differentiated thyroid carcinoma is generally good, but postoperative management plays an important role in minimizing the likelihood of disease recurrence. Postoperative management is generally performed by endocrinologists and nuclear medicine physicians, who exploit thyroid cells' inherent iodineavidity and sensitivity to hormonal manipulation in a unique cancer management paradigm. Endocrinologists manage thyroid hormone replacement/thyroid stimulating hormone suppression and coordinate surveillance. Nuclear physicians administer targeted therapy with radioactive iodine and perform imaging studies to assess disease status. This article provides an overview of the postoperative assessment, treatment, and follow-up of patients who have thyroid carcinoma.

### Controversies, consensus, and collaboration in the use ofI therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer: a joint statement from the American Thyroid Association, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine, the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, and the European Thyroid Association [^115yBjvK]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Publication of the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer was met with disagreement by the extended nuclear medicine community with regard to some of the recommendations related to the diagnostic and therapeutic use of radioiodine (131 I). Because of these concerns, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging declined to endorse the ATA guidelines. As a result of these differences in opinion, patients and clinicians risk receiving conflicting advice with regard to several key thyroid cancer management issues.

Summary

To address some of the differences in opinion and controversies associated with the therapeutic uses of 131 I in differentiated thyroid cancer constructively, the ATA, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine, the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, and the European Thyroid Association each sent senior leadership and subject-matter experts to a two-day interactive meeting. The goals of this first meeting were to (i) formalize the dialogue and activities between the four societies; (ii) discuss indications for 131 I adjuvant treatment; (iii) define the optimal prescribed activity of 131 I for adjuvant treatment; and (iv) clarify the definition and classification of 131 I-refractory thyroid cancer.

Conclusion

By fostering an open, productive, and evidence-based discussion, the Martinique meeting restored trust, confidence, and a sense of collegiality between individuals and organizations that are committed to optimal thyroid disease management. The result of this first meeting is a set of nine principles (The Martinique Principles) that (i) describe a commitment to proactive, purposeful, and inclusive interdisciplinary cooperation; (ii) define the goals of 131 I therapy as remnant ablation, adjuvant treatment, or treatment of known disease; (iii) describe the importance of evaluating postoperative disease status and multiple other factors beyond clinicopathologic staging in 131 I therapy decision making; (iv) recognize that the optimal administered activity of 131 I adjuvant treatment cannot be definitely determined from the published literature; and (v) acknowledge that current definitions of 131 I-refractory disease are suboptimal and do not represent definitive criteria to mandate whether 131 I therapy should be recommended.

### The effect of radioactive iodine (RAI) on disease-specific survival in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC): a study of 96, 557 patients… [^1156TrZ4]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract e18095 Background: The use of RAI in the treatment of DTC of various stages and risk levels is widespread. However, its efficacy continues to be a subject of debate, particularly with regard to low-risk patients. Some studies have found significant differences in RAI's ability to decrease recurrence and distant metastasis, while others have not. Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate the effect of RAI on disease-specific survival in patients with DTC without distant metastasis. These patients were classified into three groups based on their histology: classical papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular type variant carcinoma, and follicular thyroid cancer. T-tests and chi-square tests were employed to compare variables, while the Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to assess the effect of RAI on DSS, presenting adjusted hazard ratios and confidence intervals. RAI was administered to 61. 2% of FTC cases,
53.

2% of C-PTC cases, and 52. 1% of FV-PTC cases. In both FV-PTC and C-PTC, patients who received RAI had significantly better long-term survival than those who underwent surgery alone. The multivariable analysis confirmed that RAI had a more favorable prognosis in FV-PTC and C-PTC, but did not result in improved DSS in FTC. Conclusions: Our results showed that RAI administration was statistically associated with improved long-term DSS outcomes in FV-PTC and C-PTC histological subtypes, but not in FTC. However, a careful interpretation of these results is needed as the survival benefit was less than 3% in all cohorts, it might be clinically insignificant. This study was the first to examine all histological types of DTC using a large sample size. There is a need for a randomized trial to confirm the efficacy of RAI in FTC treatment.

### How can we meet the information needs of patients with early stage papillary thyroid cancer considering radioactive iodine remnant ablation? [^1129XVQU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid carcinoma is increasingly being diagnosed–, and the most common subtype is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). New cases of PTC are most commonly diagnosed at an early stage, with a low risk of disease-related mortality. After the standard surgical removal of the thyroid (total or near-total thyroidectomy), radioactive iodine remnant ablation (RRA) treatment or no RRA (with close medical follow-up) is considered acceptable options for management of early stage PTC, with some flexibility in the approach depending on the individual case characteristics and treatment preferences.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^111BWSdv]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer — first-line systemic therapy without an actionable driver (Recommendation 62) specifies that for patients with progressive RAIR DTC without an actionable biomarker-linked FDA-approved first-line therapy, multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapy with either lenvatinib or sorafenib is recommended, and in most cases, lenvatinib is the preferred first-line MKI (Strong recommendation, High certainty evidence). Long-term survival outcomes following RAI treatment in patients with RAI-responsive metastatic DTC are excellent, so it is critical to confirm whether patients with DTC considered for systemic therapy have RAI responsive DTC; supporting trial evidence includes the DECISION trial, the first large multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of sorafenib in progressive RAIR DTC, in which participants were randomized to sorafenib or placebo and treated until progression per RECIST, with crossover to open-label sorafenib and progression-free survival as the primary endpoint.

### Radioiodine remnant ablation for differentiated thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hu1co]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) remnant ablation for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) facilitates the early detection of recurrence and represents an adjuvant therapy that targets persistent microscopic disease. The optimal activity of RAI in low- and intermediate-risk DTC remains controversial.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term cure rate of different RAI activities in low- and intermediate-risk DTC. Secondary outcomes included successful remnant ablation, adverse effects, and hospital length of stay.

Data Source

A systematic search of the databases PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared long-term outcomes (> 12 months) for American Thyroid Association-classified low- and intermediate-risk DTC based on receipt of either low-activity or high-activity RAI postoperatively.

Study Selection

All RCTs or observational studies evaluating patients with low- and intermediate-risk DTC who were treated initially with total/near-total thyroidectomy, followed by remnant RAI ablation with either low or high activities. Eligible studies had to present odds ratio, relative risk (RR), or hazard ratio estimates (with 95% CIs), standard errors, or the number of events necessary to calculate these for the outcome of interest rate.

Data Extraction

Two investigators reviewed the literature in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Dichotomous variables were pooled as risk ratios and continuous data as weighted-mean differences. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa and Jadad scales.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Disease recurrence was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included successful ablation, adverse effects, and length of stay.

Results

Ten studies that included 3821 patients met inclusion criteria, including 6 RCTs and 4 observational studies. There was no difference in long-term cure recurrence rates (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.62–1.27, P = 0.50) or successful remnant ablation (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.87–1.03; p = 0.20) between low-activity and high-activity RAI.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, low-activity RAI was comparable with high-activity RAI regarding successful ablation and recurrence rates. This suggests that low-activity RAI is preferable to high-activity in low- and intermediate-risk DTC because of its similar efficacy but reduced morbidity.

The last 10 years have seen a major paradigm shift in the management of thyroid cancer, with greater reliance on serum thyroglobulin and neck ultrasonography, and less emphasis on routine diagnostic whole-body radioactive iodine scanning for detection of recurrent disease. As our follow-up tests become more sensitive for detection of recurrent disease, we are finding many asymptomatic patients who have low-level persistent disease many years after initial therapy that may or may not benefit from additional testing and therapy. These difficult issues have been addressed by at least five different sets of guidelines published recently by various thyroid specialty organizations around the world. In this article, the authors compare and contrast the recommendations from the various guidelines in an attempt to define areas of consensus and explore possible reasons for differing recommendations.

### Thyroid cancer patients' involvement in adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment decision-making and decision regret: an exploratory study [^112QDJM6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid carcinoma is increasingly being diagnosed, especially small primary tumors of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) discovered at an early stage. PTC is usually treated with total thyroidectomy, followed in some cases by adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment. Decision-making about adjuvant RAI treatment in early stage PTC is complex and subject to considerable medical evidence uncertainty. This uncertainty is due to contradictory findings in long-term observational studies and a lack of high quality evidence from randomized controlled trials. The impact of the uncertainty of the medical evidence on patients' regret of treatment choice is not known.

According to a model of decision-justification theory, Connolly and Zeelenberg have proposed that regret is associated with the comparative evaluation of the outcome of a decision and the feeling of self-blame for having made a poor choice. From this perspective, regret is regarded as an aversive emotion, in which people realize or imagine that their present situation would have been better had they decided differently in the past. This regret can be experienced about the decision-making process ("process regret") and/or about the outcome of the decision ("outcomes regret"). Our primary objective in this secondary study was to measure outcome regret in thyroid cancer survivors, relating to the decision to take adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment or not. Furthermore, we explored process regret by examining the relationship between patients' perceived role in radioactive iodine treatment decision-making and current regret. We also examined outcome regret, by exploring the relationship between radioactive iodine treatment status (i.e. whether this treatment was received or not) and current decision regret.

### New therapeutic advances in the management of progressive thyroid cancer [^117Qw7CY]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The spectrum of thyroid cancers ranges from one of the most indolent to one of the most aggressive solid tumors identified. Conventional therapies for thyroid cancers are based on the histologic type of thyroid cancers such as papillary or follicular thyroid cancer (differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), or anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). While surgery is one of the key treatments for all such types of thyroid cancers, additional therapies vary. Effective targeted therapy for DTC is a decades-old practice with systemic therapies of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression and radioactive iodine therapy. However, for the iodine-refractory DTC, MTC, and ATC there is no effective systemic standard of care treatment. Recent advances in understanding pathogenesis of DTC and development of molecular targeted therapy have dramatically transformed the field of clinical research in thyroid cancer. Over the last five years, incredible progress has been made and phases I-III clinical trials have been conducted in various types of thyroid cancers with some remarkable results that has made an impact on lives of patients with thyroid cancer. Such history-making events have boosted enthusiasm and interest among researchers, clinicians, patients, and sponsors and we anticipate ongoing efforts to develop more effective and safe therapies for thyroid cancer.

### Current practice in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^111VWvU6]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Considerable changes have occurred in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) during the past four decades, based on improved knowledge of the biology of DTC and on advances in therapy, including surgery, the use of radioactive iodine (radioiodine), thyroid hormone treatment and availability of recombinant human TSH. Improved diagnostic tools are available, including determining serum levels of thyroglobulin, neck ultrasonography, imaging (CT, MRI, SPECT-CT and PET-CT), and prognostic classifications have been improved. Patients with low-risk DTC, in whom the risk of thyroid cancer death is < 1% and most recurrences can be cured, currently represent the majority of patients. By contrast, patients with high-risk DTC represent 5–10% of all patients. Most thyroid cancer-related deaths occur in this group of patients and recurrences are frequent. Patients with high-risk DTC require more aggressive treatment and follow-up than patients with low-risk DTC. Finally, the strategy for treating patients with intermediate-risk DTC is frequently defined on a case-by-case basis. Prospective trials are needed in well-selected patients with DTC to demonstrate the extent to which treatment and follow-up can be limited without increasing the risk of recurrence and thyroid cancer-related death.

### Radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer… [^113fH7Rt]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Based on current guidelines, adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy is not recommended for localized papillary thyroid tumors measuring 1 cm or less, medullary thyroid cancer, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. 1–3 Nevertheless, previous studies have reported the use of RAI in the treatment of these cancers. The aim of the current study was to analyze patterns of inappropriate RAI use in the United States to identify potential misuses leading to increased costs for the health care system and unnecessary patient exposure to the risk and potential complications of RAI therapy.
4. All adult patients with ATC and MTC were included in the analyses. Inclusion criteria for patients with papillary thyroid cancer were the following: papillary thyroid microcarcinoma measuring 1 cm or less, no aggressive histologic variants, no extrathyroidal extension, no regional or distant metastases, and negative margin status.

In univariate analyses, patients with ATCs who received RAI were younger than those who did not, had lower income, were from a rural or urban rather than a metropolitan county, and had smaller tumors. Patients with MTCs whose management included RAI were less likely to be treated in academic facilities and had smaller tumors. Patients with PTMCs treated with RAI were younger, more often white, managed in nonacademic centers, and were more likely to have multifocal and larger tumors. While the overall incidence of PTMC significantly increased over time, the proportion of PTMCs treated with RAI has decreased. When stratified by facility type, the rate of RAI administration showed no change in community hospital programs but decreased at comprehensive and academic hospital programs.

In our cohort, the rate of unnecessary RAI treatment decreased overall; however, no change was observed during the past decade at community hospitals. This emphasizes the need to educate health care professionals regarding evidence-based practice guidelines and disseminate those guidelines in areas that may serve vulnerable populations. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that nearly one-fourth of patients with thyroid cancer may receive unnecesary RAI treatment. Ongoing efforts should be undertaken to educate health care professionals in the appropriate use of RAI therapy to optimize patient care.

ATA thyroid nodule/differentiated thyroid cancer — Recommendation 56 for initial adjuvant therapy states: When RAI is intended for initial adjuvant therapy to treat suspected microscopic residual disease, administered activities above those used for remnant ablation up to 150 mCi are generally recommended (in absence of known distant metastases). It adds that it is uncertain whether routine use of higher administered activities (> 150 mCi) in this setting will reduce structural disease recurrence for T3 and N1 disease (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Dosimetry in advanced thyroid cancer: a piece of a puzzle? [^111JNeXS]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Thyroid cancer demonstrates variable prognosis depending on disease severity with low-risk tumors showing excellent survival rates and high-risk cases facing poorer outcomes. Radioactive iodine therapy is the standard treatment. However, individualized dosing is still debated. Despite the international guidelines recommend high activities for metastatic disease, there is still a potential risk of overtreatment or undertreatment. Dosimetry calculates absorbed radiation to optimize treatment minimizing toxicity. Challenges influencing treatment response include patient variability, genetic mutations, tumor microenvironment, and pharmacokinetics. On the other hand, emerging technologies promise to standardize and improve dosimetry, refining theragnostic approaches and enabling personalized therapies.

### The evolving role of (131) I for the treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^11216FPP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The use of radioactive iodine ((131)I) for the treatment of thyroid carcinoma has changed over the past 50 y. These changes are based on increasing awareness of the biophysical properties of (131)I and new discoveries concerning the biology of iodine handling by thyroid cells. The therapeutic administration of (131)I for thyroid remnant ablation and for metastases requires an appreciation of iodine clearance kinetics, of factors that can alter the occupancy time of (131)I within lesions, and of the role of thyroid-stimulating hormone in stimulating the sodium-iodide symporter. The potential complications and adverse events associated with (131)I are discussed. (131)I will continue to be a major weapon in the fight against metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Its future role will be modified by expanding knowledge of its relative risks and benefits.

### An updated systematic review and commentary examining the effectiveness of radioactive iodine remnant ablation in well-differentiated thyroid cancer [^116oqrTh]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Radioactive iodine remnant ablation (RRA) is used to destroy residual normal thyroid tissue after complete gross surgical resection of papillary or follicular thyroid cancer. The article updates a prior systematic review of the literature to determine whether RRA decreases the risk of thyroid cancer-related death or recurrence at 10 years after initial surgery, including data from 28 studies. No long-term randomized trials were identified, so the review is limited to observational studies. The incremental benefit of RRA in low risk patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer after total or near-total thyroidectomy who are receiving thyroid hormone suppressive therapy remains unclear.

Radioactive iodine therapy — postoperative use by risk group: Postoperative RAI administration is recommended when clinical factors predict a significant risk of recurrence, distant metastases, or disease-specific mortality. Algorithms specify that postoperative RAI is typically not indicated for low-risk patients; adjuvant therapy with RAI may be considered for intermediate- or high-risk disease without gross residual disease, and RAI treatment is often used for postoperative residual disease or inoperable distant metastasis based on whether the persistent tumor is shown to be iodine-131–avid. Even in the absence of thyroid bed uptake, postoperative RAI treatment may be considered.

### Radioactive iodine and increased risk of second cancers-NCI… [^111qiu33]. dceg.cancer.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of post-operative radioactive iodine in the treatment of thyroid cancer has been linked to an increased risk of leukemia within 2–3 years after exposure, but the risks of solid cancers have been unclear, especially in the long-term. In one of the largest studies of its kind with more than 40 years of follow-up, DCEG investigators found that RAI therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer among people younger than 45 years old was associated with 23% increased risk of solid cancer and 92% increased risk of leukemia relative to those who did not receive RAI therapy. These findings were published in May 2022 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. To quantify second cancer risks associated with RAI treatment, Elisa Pasqual, M. D. Ph. D., postdoctoral fellow in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch, and colleagues analyzed U. S. population cancer registry data from over 36, 000 children and young adults diagnosed between 1975 and 2017.

While increased risk of leukemia after RAI treatment has been previously reported, the added value of this study is its longer follow-up time which made it possible to observe increased risk of solid cancer. Taking a closer look at the solid cancer risks, the researchers found that treatment with RAI was associated with increased risk of salivary gland cancer, uterine cancer, lung cancer, and female breast cancer. Notably, breast cancer was the most common cancer in this cohort. The elevated risk of breast cancer associated with RAI treatment was stronger after more than 20 years since diagnosis and for those diagnosed before age 25 ages. Considering that thyroid cancer is 3 times more common in women, these findings regarding breast cancer warrant special attention from a public health perspective.

The results of this study highlight the need for greater caution and consideration of the risks versus benefits of RAI therapy in the management of DTC, especially with younger patients who are more vulnerable to the carcinogenic effects of radiation exposure and are more likely to experience long-term effects than older adults.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment intent definitions and thyrotropin suppression — Remnant ablation is RAI administration to destroy benign remnant thyroid tissue following total or near-total thyroidectomy. Adjuvant therapy is RAI administration to destroy suspected (but not identified) remaining thyroid cancer following total or near-total thyroidectomy. Therapeutic treatment is RAI administration to treat known residual or recurrent thyroid cancer, either initially or with subsequent re-presentation after total or near-total thyroidectomy. Thyrotropin suppression therapy uses thyroid hormone to suppress serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations below the normal range based on the risk of recurrence and/or response to therapy.

Thyroid carcinoma — postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) use is risk-adapted: use of postoperative RAI administration is dependent on risk for recurrence. Patients with low risk for recurrence do not benefit from adjuvant RAI therapy, though low-dose RAI (remnant ablation dose) may be used to destroy a thyroid remnant to facilitate an undetectable Tg. For intermediate and high risk for recurrence, adjuvant RAI therapy is given with the goal of reducing the risk for recurrence, and it is not necessary for there to be suspected disease at time of adjuvant RAI treatment. RAI therapy may also be used to treat known or suspected structural disease.

### Controversies in the radioiodine treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^116cidug]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of radioiodine (I-131) in the management of patients suffering differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has changed little in the past 40 years. The use of a standardized approach has served the majority of patients well over that time. However, there have been recent doubts concerning this approach in some low risk patients and if so, how can these patients recognized and which patients who may need more intensive treatment. A number of clinical trials have questioned the paradigms used in the treatment of DTC including what activity of I-131 should be used for ablation and which low risk patients should be treated with I-131 especially as there remains some doubts as to the long-term safety of I-131. Should a dosimetric approach be used to optimize the use of I-131 even though at present this approach has not been shown to improve outcomes in a formal clinical trial. The era of precision oncology represents a challenge and opportunity to nuclear medicine with a move away from a regime of standard care to one of highly individualized care based on the genetic profiling of the patient and their cancer. The treatment of DTC with I-131 is about to become very interesting.

### Clinical review 170: a systematic review and metaanalysis of the effectiveness of radioactive iodine remnant ablation for well-differentiated thyroid cancer [^115Sa5Uy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Radioactive iodine remnant ablation destroys residual thyroid tissue after surgical resection of papillary or follicular thyroid cancer. We systematically reviewed 1543 English references to determine whether remnant ablation decreases the risk of thyroid cancer-related death or recurrence after bilateral thyroidectomy for papillary or follicular thyroid cancer. In 13 cohort studies in which the analysis of thyroid cancer-related outcomes was statistically adjusted to a variable degree for prognostic factors or cointerventions, rates of recurrences of thyroid cancer-related outcomes were significantly decreased in the following: one of seven studies examining thyroid cancer-related mortality, three of six studies examining any tumor recurrence, three of three studies examining locoregional recurrence, and two of three studies examining distant metastases. Thyroid hormone suppressive therapy was not adjusted for in the majority of these analyses. In 18 cohort studies not adjusted for prognostic factors or interventions, the benefit of radioactive iodine ablation in decreasing the thyroid cancer-related mortality and any recurrence at 10 yr was inconsistent among centers. However, pooled analyses were suggestive of a statistically significant treatment effect of ablation for the following 10-yr outcomes: locoregional recurrence (relative risk of 0.31, 95% confidence interval, 0.2, 0.49) and distant metastases (absolute decrease in risk 3%, 95% confidence interval, risk decreases 1–4%). In conclusion, radioactive iodine ablation may be beneficial in decreasing recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer; however, results are inconsistent among centers for some outcomes, and the incremental benefit of remnant ablation in low-risk patients treated with bilateral thyroidectomy and thyroid hormone suppressive therapy is unclear.

### Tailoring the approach to radioactive iodine treatment in thyroid cancer [^114DdGY1]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer continues to move away from a 'one size fits all' approach to a process of tailored therapeutic decision-making that incorporates disease-specific factors and individual patient preferences. Management options range from active surveillance to thyroid lobectomy to total thyroidectomy with or without the use of postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI). RAI may be administered for one or more reasons: Thyroid remnant ablation, adjuvant therapy, or therapy for persistent structural disease. It is important to be cognizant of the therapeutic intent of RAI and weigh the risks and benefits of treatment for each individual patient. Risk stratification should be used to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from RAI and guide therapeutic choices. Available data suggest that RAI can be safely deferred for most patients considered at low risk for structural recurrence, while adjuvant RAI is associated with improved disease-free survival in patients with higher-risk disease. Although progress has been made, many areas of uncertainty related to the use of RAI remain. These include: (1) The appropriate selection of intermediate-risk patients to receive adjuvant RAI, (2) the superiority or inferiority of different RAI dosing activities, (3) the optimal approach to the use of RAI in special populations, including patients with end-stage renal disease and children, and (4) the management of patients with RAI-refractory disease.

The use of DAs in medical decision-making

Decision aids are tools or instruments used to inform patients about available treatment options, including evidence about potential benefits and risks of interventions.DAs facilitate evidence-based patient choice–and are useful in the clinical setting when there is more than one treatment option. In a recent systematic review, DAs were reported to improve patient knowledge, result in more accurate risk perceptions, increase the proportion of people active in decision-making and reduce decisional conflict, when compared to usual care. Also, in another systematic review, cancer-related DAs increased patients' knowledge compared to usual practice, without increasing anxiety. However, DAs relating to thyroid cancer care have been lacking.

### Variations in radioiodine ablation: decision-making after total thyroidectomy [^111YzQVL]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of radioiodine treatment following total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer is changing. The last major revision of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Management Guidelines for Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer in 2015 changed treatment recommendations dramatically in comparison with the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) 2008 guidelines. We hypothesised that there is marked variability between the different treatment regimens used today.

Methods

We analysed decision-making in all Swiss hospitals offering radioiodine treatment to map current practice within the community and identify consensus and discrepancies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that for low-risk DTC patients after thyroidectomy, some institutions offered only follow-up, while RIT with significant activities is recommended in others. For intermediate- and high-risk patients, radioiodine treatment is generally recommended. Dosing and treatment preparation (recombinant human thyroid stimulation hormone (rhTSH) vs. thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW)) vary significantly among centres.

### Disease severity and radioactive iodine use for thyroid cancer [^112j38q9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Although variation in radioactive iodine (RAI) use for thyroid cancer has been demonstrated, the role of region and nonclinical correlates of use within risk groups has not been investigated.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the correlates of RAI use within risk groups.

Design/Setting/Patients

Use of RAI was evaluated across 9 US regions in 85 948 patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2008 at 986 hospitals associated with the US National Cancer Database. Cancers were then categorized as low risk (tumor size ≤ 1 cm and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I disease), medium risk (neither low nor high-risk), and high risk (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or IV). Within each risk stratum, the role of region and nonclinical correlates of RAI use were evaluated using hierarchical logistic regression.

Main Outcome Measure

Use of RAI was measured.

Results

Rates of RAI use varied across geographic regions from 49% to 66%. Regional differences persisted after controlling for patient and hospital characteristics and evaluating less vs more intensive regions within low-risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25–0.53)], medium-risk [OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.16–0.34)], and high-risk cancers [OR 0.30 (95% CI 0.19–0.49)]. Patterns of RAI use were similar in medium- and high-risk patients. The most nonclinical correlates of use were in low-risk patients.

Conclusion

Similar treatment patterns for the heterogeneous medium-risk thyroid cancer patients compared with the high-risk patients suggest more intensive management in patients with medium-risk disease. The large number of nonclinical correlates of RAI use, including region, imply controversy over indications for RAI.

### Low iodine diet in differentiated thyroid cancer: a review [^116njviw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation is a beneficial, adjuvant therapy for the management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) after thyroidectomy. The goal of RAI is to destroy remnant thyroid and microscopic cancerous tissue. Radioactive iodine uptake is enhanced by elevating TSH levels and initiating a low iodine diet (LID) prior to ablation. An ideal LID should preferably not exceed 50 mcg/day of dietary iodine for 1–2 weeks, although the duration may be shortened to a week with a structured patient education programme. A pre-ablation spot urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of < 100 mcg/l and/or a urinary iodine to creatinine ratio (UICR) of < 100 mcg/gCr would support an adequate LID preparation. Hyponatraemia, most likely due to iatrogenic hypothyroidism, is a potential side effect associated with LID and occurs during and a few days after the LID. Although the overall incidence of hyponatraemia is low, patients at high risk (older age, female sex, use of thiazide diuretics) may benefit from serum sodium monitoring. The existing evidence on the impact of LID on RAI ablation has been largely inconsistent due to retrospective study designs and the lack of an objective measurement of urinary iodine levels. Future large prospective randomized control trials are needed to elucidate and confirm the crucial role of LID in achieving successful RAI ablation and greater disease-free survival in DTC.

Diagnostic radioactive iodine (RAI) imaging in initial staging — ATA intermediate-risk patients: Neck ultrasonography (US) and serum Tg determinations have well-established roles in preoperative evaluation, while diagnostic RAI imaging in a pre-RAI treatment setting may yield information relevant to clinical decision making only in selected patients in the intermediate-risk category; the limitations of low-activity imaging should be recognized, institutional management algorithms play a significant role in pretreatment imaging as a "value-added" step, and the utility of the diagnostic RAI scan is firmly dependent on institutional treatment algorithms and strategies; accordingly, the authors state, "We support a selective use approach to diagnostic RAI scanning in ATA intermediate-risk patients rather than routine use or denial for all patients in this category".

### Second primary malignancies induced by radioactive iodine treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma-a critical review and evaluation of the existing evidence [^1113cx1v]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer, estimated to be the sixth most common carcinoma in the USA in 2021 in women, is a malignancy with increasing incidence in the last decades. This trend has been driven by an increased incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), most notably small papillary thyroid carcinoma. As these histological types of thyroid cancer have a generally favorable prognosis with 10-year survival above 90%, concern is growing about late adverse effects of DTC treatment that might impair survivors' quality-of-life, or even themselves prove life-threatening.

After surgery, radioactive iodine (RAI) for remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy is recommended for high-risk DTC and, notwithstanding debate among experts, is also recommended for substantial proportions of intermediate-risk and low-risk DTC cases, depending on national guidelines. Side effects of RAI treatment may include nausea and vomiting, radiation thyroiditis, and in rare cases, sialadenitis and xerostomia, bone marrow suppression, gonadal dysfunction, second primary malignancies (SPMs), and in the presence of widespread lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis. As long-term adverse effects are a substantial component of patient-relevant outcomes, any risk–benefit ratio has to incorporate the potential for SPM occurrence. The relationship of RAI and SPM, if any, is the subject of ongoing discussion, and existing evidence is conflicting. While some authors found an increased risk of SPM related to RAI therapy, others could not reproduce these findings, or even observed a lower risk of SPM in the exposed group compared with patients not undergoing adjuvant [131 I]NaI therapy. Prior reviews and meta-analyses showed enormous heterogeneity between studies. We sought to perform an updated critical review of available data concerning the risk of SPM in patients with DTC undergoing post-operative RAI therapy, compared to the risk in their counterparts undergoing surgery alone. As part of this review, we sought to elucidate the quality of the published evidence. Outcomes of interest were: (1) occurrence of any SPM or (2) any secondary hematologic malignancy (SHM), and (3) evidence of a dose–response relationship between the cumulative administered activity of RAI and the risk of SPM. Throughout this paper, we use the term "dose–response relationship" recognizing that it may be more accurate to refer to an "association" between administered 131 I activity and occurrence of SPM, than to a "relationship", since the latter term may imply a deterministic rather than a stochastic effect.

### Cancer risk after radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hAYeq]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hyperthyroidism, a form of thyrotoxicosis, is a clinical state characterized by inappropriately high tissue thyroid hormone levels. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism ranges from 0.1% to 2.9% worldwideand is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical) in the United States. The most common causes include Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used to treat hyperthyroidism for more than 7 decades. According to the American Thyroid Association guidelines, RAI therapy has been strongly recommended with moderate-quality evidence as 1 of the 3 major treatments (ie, RAI, antithyroid drugs, and thyroidectomy) for patients with overt Graves hyperthyroidism. RAI treatment is preferred in situations in which greater value is placed on the definitive control of hyperthyroidism, the avoidance of surgery, and the potential adverse effects of antithyroid drugs, and a lower value is placed on the need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement and the rapid resolution of hyperthyroidism. The European Thyroid Association guidelines also recommend RAI therapy to be considered for patients who prefer this approach.

However, the extensive use of RAI therapy has raised concerns regarding its potential carcinogenic and leukemogenic effects. RAI therapy for thyroid cancer, and for hyperthyroidism, has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms, whereas other studies, have reported no associations. However, a recent study by Kitahara et al, showing a dose-response association between RAI treatment and the risk of cancer death, has challenged the notion that RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism does not have long-term adverse effects.

Previously, a systematic review and meta-analysis reported the cancer risks after RAI exposure for hyperthyroidism. Several studies for RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism and subsequent cancer risk were published thereafter. Most, but not all, of these studies were summarized in a 2020 narrative reviewdescribing the association between RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism and cancer risk. However, to our knowledge, there have been no systematic reviews or meta-analyses summarizing the dose-response association of RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism with subsequent cancer risk. In addition, a new quality assessment tool for radiation epidemiology studies was recommended by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), but it has yet to be applied in a systemic review of RAI treatment studies. Therefore, an updated systematic review of the evidence on cancer risks following RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Controversies in the management of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer [^112u4Ptz]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Controversy exists over optimal management of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer. This controversy occurs in all aspects of management, including surgery, use of radioactive iodine for remnant ablation, thyroid hormone supplementation, and long-term surveillance. Limited and conflicting data, treatment paradigm shifts, and differences in physician perceptions contribute to the controversy. This lack of physician consensus results in wide variation in patient care, with some patients at risk for over- or undertreatment. To reduce patient harm and unnecessary worry, there is a need to design and implement studies to address current knowledge gaps.

### Variation in the management of thyroid cancer [^112dR3MS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Little is known about practice patterns in thyroid cancer, a cancer that is increasing in incidence.

Objective

We sought to identify aspects of thyroid cancer management that have the greatest variation.

Design/Setting/Participants

We surveyed 944 physicians involved in thyroid cancer care from 251 hospitals affiliated with the US National Cancer Database. Physicians were asked questions in the following four domains: thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine use, thyroid hormone replacement postsurgery, and long-term thyroid cancer management. We calculated the ratio of observed variation to hypothetical maximum variation under the assumed distribution of the response. Ratios closer to 1 indicate greater variation.

Results

We had a 66% response rate. We found variation in multiple aspects of thyroid cancer management, including the role of central lymph node dissections (variation, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–1.00), the role of pretreatment scans before radioactive iodine treatment (variation, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.00), and all aspects of long-term thyroid cancer management, including applications of ultrasound (variation, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99) and radioactive iodine scans (variation, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00). For the management of small thyroid cancers, variation exists in all domains, including optimal extent of surgery (variation, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.94) and the role of both radioactive iodine treatment (variation, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89–0.93) and suppressive doses of thyroid hormone replacement (variation, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99–1.00).

Conclusion

We identified areas of variation in thyroid cancer management. To reduce the variation and improve the management of thyroid cancer, there is a need for more research and more research dissemination.

### The role of radioactive iodine in the treatment of well-differentiated thyroid cancer [^1114PEFR]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The prognosis in differentiated thyroid cancer is excellent. The completeness of thyroidectomy and removal of involved regional metastases are the most important elements of management. Iodine 131 has a role in ablating residual thyroid and treating regional and distant metastases. The effectiveness of the treatment is confirmed by negative follow-up scans and low or undetectable Tg. This therapy is relatively specific, but other tissues can receive meaningful doses of radiation and acute and long-term complications can occur. Therefore, whether the patient will have a better prognosis after treatment with 131I and whether the benefits of treatment are greater than the side effects must be determined for every patient.

Harms and treatment — The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence to assess the harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons and found adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and treatment as at least moderate, based on adequate evidence of serious harms of treatment of thyroid cancer and evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely consequences of screening. Surgery (ie, total or partial thyroidectomy, with or without lymphadenectomy) is the main treatment for thyroid cancer; additional treatment, including radioactive iodine therapy, may be indicated depending on postoperative disease status, tumor stage, and type of thyroid cancer, and external-beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy are not generally used to treat early-stage, differentiated thyroid cancer.

Radiation therapy in one form or the other has an important role in the treatment of thyroid cancer. In the definitive setting, external beam radiation therapy is used in situations where microscopic or gross residual disease after thyroidectomy cannot be effectively treated with radioactive iodine or with targeted therapy. In patients with metastatic disease to the lungs, bone, brain, or other organs, different types of radiation can be administered depending on the clinical situation of the patient.

Well-differentiated thyroid cancer is increasing in incidence but the disease-specific mortality remains very low. The only effective adjuvant treatment is radioactive iodine ablation. Guidelines regarding the use and dosage of radioactive iodine depend on pathologic features of the primary and metastatic tumor that define risk. Long-term treatment includes thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression and surveillance with serum thyroglobulin and radiologic assessment for nodal recurrence.

### Radioactive iodine in differentiated thyroid cancer: a national database perspective [^11647Fqx]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) is a key component in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer. RAI has been recommended more selectively in recent years as guidelines evolve to reflect risks and utility in certain patient subsets. In this study we sought to evaluate the survival impact of radioactive iodine in specific thyroid cancer subgroups. Nationwide retrospective cohort study of patients using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004 to 2012 and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1992 to 2009 examining patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated with or without RAI. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality (NCDB and SEER), and cancer-specific mortality (SEER). Cox multivariate survival analyses were applied to each dataset, and in 135 patient subgroups based on clinical and non-clinical parameters. A total of 199,371 NCDB and 77,187 SEER patients were identified. RAI was associated with improved all-cause mortality (NCDB: RAI hazard ratio (HR) 0.55, P < 0.001; SEER: HR 0.64, P < 0.001); and cancer-specific mortality (SEER: HR 0.82, P = 0.029). Iodine therapy showed varied efficacy within each subgroup. Patients with high-risk disease experienced the greatest benefit in all-cause mortality, followed by intermediate-risk, then low-risk subgroups. Regarding cancer-specific mortality, radioactive iodine therapy was protective in high-risk patients, but did not achieve statistical significance in most intermediate-risk subgroups. Low-risk T1a subgroups demonstrated an increased likelihood of cancer-specific mortality with iodine therapy. The efficacy of RAI in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer varies by disease severity. A negative cancer-specific survival association was identified in patients with T1a disease. These findings warrant further evaluation with prospective studies.

Introduction

The purpose of the present guidelines on the radioiodine therapy (RAIT) of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) formulated by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Therapy Committee is to provide advice to nuclear medicine clinicians and other members of the DTC-treating community on how to ablate thyroid remnant or treat inoperable advanced DTC or both employing large 131-iodine ((131)I) activities.

Discussion

For this purpose, recommendations have been formulated based on recent literature and expert opinion regarding the rationale, indications and contraindications for these procedures, as well as the radioiodine activities and the administration and patient preparation techniques to be used. Recommendations also are provided on pre-RAIT history and examinations, patient counselling and precautions that should be associated with (131)I iodine ablation and treatment. Furthermore, potential side effects of radioiodine therapy and alternate or additional treatments to this modality are reviewed. Appendices furnish information on dosimetry and post-therapy scintigraphy.

### Radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer in the era of risk stratification and alternative targeted therapies [^115tRKx6]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancers are typically iodine-avid and can be effectively treated with radioiodine. In most patients, radioiodine treatment is done for ablation of residual tissue, and in these cases the focus should be on using the minimum effective dose. Adjuvant therapy can be done to reduce the risk of recurrence, but optimal patient selection and dose are unclear. Patients with advanced disease benefit most from treatment with the maximum-tolerated dose. Recent research has focused on better patient selection and reduced radioiodine doses for remnant ablation. There are emerging targeted therapeutic approaches in patients who are appropriately shown to have iodine-refractory disease, with 1 drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Numerous trials are ongoing to assess targeted therapeutics alone or in combination with radioiodine.

Radioactive iodine — pregnancy and breastfeeding counseling: Women of childbearing age receiving RAI therapy should have a negative screening evaluation for pregnancy prior to RAI administration and avoid pregnancy for 6–12 months after receiving RAI (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Radioactive iodine should not be given to nursing women; depending on the clinical situation, therapy could be deferred until lactating women have stopped breastfeeding or pumping for at least 3 months, and a diagnostic 123I or low-dose 131I scan should be considered in recently lactating women to detect breast uptake that may warrant deferral of therapy.

### The role of pretherapy quantitative imaging and dosimetry in radioiodine therapy for advanced thyroid cancer [^111Bpxpr]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Radioactive iodine is well established as a successful treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), although around 15% of patients have local recurrence or develop distant metastases and may become refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI). A personalized approach to treatment, based on the absorbed radiation doses delivered and using treatments to enhance RAI uptake, has not yet been developed. Methods: We performed a multicenter clinical trial to investigate the role of selumetinib, which modulates the expression of the sodium iodide symporter, and hence iodine uptake, in the treatment of RAI-refractory DTC. The iodine uptake before and after selumetinib was quantified to assess the effect of selumetinib. The range of absorbed doses delivered to metastatic disease was calculated from pre- and posttherapy imaging, and the predictive accuracy of a theranostic approach to enable personalized treatment planning was investigated. Results: Significant inter- and intrapatient variability was observed with respect to the uptake of RAI and the effect of selumetinib. The absorbed doses delivered to metastatic lesions ranged from less than 1 Gy to 1,170 Gy. A strong positive correlation was found between the absorbed doses predicted from pretherapy imaging and those measured after therapy (r = 0.93, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The variation in outcomes from RAI therapy of DTC may be explained, among other factors, by the range of absorbed doses delivered. The ability to assess the effect of treatments that modulate RAI uptake, and to estimate the absorbed doses at therapy, introduces the potential for patient stratification using a theranostic approach. Patient-specific absorbed dose planning might be the key to more successful treatment of advanced DTC.

Background: The American Thyroid Association (ATA), the European Association of Nuclear Medicine, the European Thyroid Association, and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging have established an intersocietal working group to address the current controversies and evolving concepts in thyroid cancer management and therapy. The working group annually identifies topics that may significantly impact clinical practice and publishes expert opinion articles reflecting intersocietal collaboration, consensus, and suggestions for further research to address these important management issues. Summary: In 2019, the intersocietal working group identified the following topics for review and interdisciplinary discussion: (i) perioperative risk stratification, (ii) the role of diagnostic radioactive iodine (RAI) imaging in initial staging, and (iii) indicators of response to RAI therapy. Conclusions: The intersocietal working group agreed that (i) initial patient management decisions should be guided by perioperative risk stratification that should include the eighth edition American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system to predict disease specific mortality, the modified 2009 ATA risk stratification system to estimate structural disease recurrence, with judicious incorporation of molecular theranostics to further refine management recommendations; (ii) diagnostic RAI scanning in ATA intermediate risk patients should be utilized selectively rather than being considered mandatory or not necessary for all patients in this category; and (iii) a consistent semiquantitative reporting system should be used for response evaluations after RAI therapy until a reproducible and clinically practical quantitative system is validated.

### The effectiveness of radioactive iodine for treatment of low-risk thyroid cancer: a systematic analysis of the peer-reviewed literature from 1966 to April 2008 [^113UfZhf]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Radioactive iodine (RAI) remnant ablation has been used to eliminate normal thyroid tissue and may also facilitate monitoring for persistent or recurrent thyroid carcinoma. The use of RAI for low-risk patients who we define as those under age 45 with stage I disease or over age 45 with stage I or II disease based on American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th edition, or low risk under the metastases, age, completeness of resection, invasion, size (MACIS) staging system (value < 6) is controversial. In this extensive literature review, we sought to analyze the evidence for use of RAI treatment to improve mortality and survival and to reduce recurrence in patients of various stages and disease risk, particularly for those patients who are at low risk for recurrence and death from thyroid cancer.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was conducted for studies published between January 1966 and April 2008 that compared the effectiveness of administering versus not administering RAI for treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Studies were grouped A through D based on their methodological rigor (best to worst). An analysis, focused on group A studies, was performed to determine whether treatment with RAI for DTC results in decreased recurrences and improved survival rates.

Results

The majority of studies did not find a statistically significant improvement in mortality or disease-specific survival in those low-risk patients treated with RAI, whereas improved survival was confirmed for high-risk (AJCC stages III and IV) patients. Evidence for RAI decreasing recurrence was mixed with half of the studies showing a significant relationship and half showing no relationship.

Conclusions

We propose a management guideline based on a patient's risk-very low, low, moderate, and high-for clinicians to use when delineating those patients who should undergo RAI treatment for initial postoperative management of DTC. A majority of very low-risk and low-risk patients, as well as select cases of patients with moderate risk do not demonstrate survival or disease-free survival benefit from postoperative RAI treatment, and therefore we recommend against postoperative RAI in these cases.

### Use of radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer… [^114QC2c4]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

More than 40 000 individuals in the United States receive a thyroid cancer diagnosis each year, and the overwhelming majority of cases are well-differentiated thyroid cancer. 1 Standard treatment for well-differentiated thyroid cancer is thyroidectomy. To ensure full eradication of remnant thyroid tissue and to treat residual disease, in patients with visible, inoperable, iodine-avid metastases, radioactive iodine is often administered after total thyroidectomy. Previous cohort studies have shown improved survival and reduced tumor recurrence when iodine-avid, advanced-stage, well-differentiated thyroid cancer is treated with radioactive iodine. 2–4 There is little controversy concerning the value of radioactive iodine for these patients. In contrast, for very low-risk disease, in which prognosis is typically excellent, treatment with radioactive iodine is of uncertain benefit. 5–8.

Indications for use of radioactive iodine following surgery for the majority of well-differentiated thyroid cancers are hotly debated. 9–11 In the absence of randomized controlled trials evaluating the utility of radioactive iodine relative to disease severity, clinical guidelines have left radioactive iodine use to physician discretion in most scenarios. 12–17 Proponents argue that universal use of radioactive iodine increases the ease of following the tumor marker, thyroglobulin, and may destroy microscopic metastases. The results of this study provide insight into the use of radioactive iodine for management of well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Between 1990 and 2008, there was an increase in radioactive iodine use across all tumor sizes. In addition to tumor characteristics, other patient and hospital characteristics were also associated with radioactive iodine use.

There was wide between-hospital variation in radioactive iodine use, and much of the variance was attributable to unexplained hospital characteristics. Even with the limitations inherent in a large database, the results of this study have implications for patients, physicians, and payers. Although it is appropriate therapy for certain well-differentiated thyroid cancers, the benefit of radioactive iodine may not always exceed the risks. There is a clear role for adjuvant therapy with radioactive iodine in iodine-avid, advanced-stage, well-differentiated thyroid cancer2–4, 59; however, there is unclear benefit to radioactive iodine use in low-risk disease5–7, 60–65 because patients with low-risk disease have an excellent prognosis regardless of intervention. 6, 66, 67.

### Association of radioactive iodine treatment with cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism [^114hXMoM]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is radioactive iodine absorbed dose associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism?

Finding

In this cohort study of 18 805 patients with hyperthyroidism treated with radioactive iodine, a statistically significant positive dose-response relationship for risk of death was observed for all solid cancers (6% increase in risk per 100-mGy dose to the stomach), breast cancer (12% increase in risk per 100-mGy dose to the breast), and all solid cancers excluding breast (5% increase in risk per 100-mGy dose to the stomach).

Meaning

This study's findings suggest a modest positive association between greater organ-absorbed doses of radioactive iodine and risk of solid cancer death; additional studies are needed to fully weigh the risks and advantages of radioactive iodine and other treatment options for patients with hyperthyroidism.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — empiric radioactive iodine (RAI) for thyroglobulin (Tg)-positive, diagnostic scan-negative disease (Recommendation 58) may be pursued selectively when localization imaging fails. Empiric "(3.7–7.4 GBq, 100–200 mCi) or dosimetrically determined RAI therapy may be considered" when imaging such as "cross sectional imaging and/or 18FDG-PET/CT" does not reveal tumor amenable to directed therapy, and this is a "Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence". If nonresectable disease is localized after empiric RAI and there is objective tumor reduction, "repeat RAI therapy can be considered until the tumor has been eradicated or the tumor no longer responds to treatment" (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). The guideline notes "There is no recognized cutoff value for a serum Tg level above which a patient empirically should be treated with RAI", and that in Tg-positive/scan-negative settings where directed therapy is not feasible, empirical RAI "may disclose the location of persistent disease in up to 50% of patients", though "improved survival has not been shown with empirical therapy in this setting", with "the most compelling evidence for benefit from empirical RAI therapy" being "for multiple pulmonary metastases".

Definition of response to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in structural disease — response to therapy is expressed in clinical outcomes or objectives, with objective response criteria/parameters including anatomic volume, functional volume, and thyroglobulin (Tg); in initial RAI treatment, target lesions may include malignant tissue and the non-neoplastic remnant tissue, whereas in the secondary setting the target is the malignant tissue; after secondary treatments, evaluation ideally should include quantitative/semiquantitative measures and Tg level, and Tg, as a sensitive and specific biomarker in a setting of complete remnant ablation, has a strong role.

Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

Diagnostic radioactive iodine (RAI) imaging in initial staging — diagnostic RAI whole body scans (WBS) are performed to identify and localize regional and distant metastatic disease, and findings may guide how to proceed with RAI treatment or what 131 I activity to administer. For clinical RAI imaging and dosimetry the most common isotope is 131 I; its physical properties are not optimal for highest quality imaging, and relatively low administered activities in the range of 1–5 mCi (37–185 MBq) are used before therapy to avoid stunning. 123 I is predominantly a gamma emitter with better physical qualities for standard gamma camera imaging, but the 13-hour half-life of 123 I limits its utility for dosimetry protocols and it is more expensive and not as readily available as 131 I. In the pre-RAI treatment setting, diagnostic 131 I scans may have limited diagnostic and theranostic yield.

### Role of radioactive iodine for adjuvant therapy and treatment of metastases [^114py5AN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Normal thyrocytes and thyroid cancer cells are characterized by possession of a sodium iodide symporter. Radioiodine administration is a unique and powerful means of treating differentiated thyroid cancer because of the ability of thyroid cancer cells to concentrate beta-emitting radiolabeled iodine. Several manipulations, such as iodine depletion and thyroid hormone-stimulating hormone elevation, are used to enhance uptake of radiolabeled iodine by tumor cells. Adjuvant radioiodine therapy, given to patients without evidence of residual disease, enhances the sensitivity of subsequent surveillance and may decrease recurrence rates and mortality. However, its exact role in the management of low-risk patients merits further investigation. In contrast, radioactive iodine therapy used in patients with residual or metastatic disease clearly improves outcomes. Several studies show decreased recurrence and mortality rates in patients treated with radioiodine compared with those not receiving radioactive iodine. Adverse events from radioiodine therapy include salivary gland dysfunction, bone marrow suppression, and reproductive disturbances. Side effects of radioiodine therapy are generally greater when higher activities of radioiodine are used and may be transient or permanent. Secondary malignancies also may occur after radioiodine therapy. These side effects must be weighed against potential benefits, especially when radioactive iodine is used as adjuvant therapy. Stimulation of the expression of the sodium iodide symporter, or its introduction de novo into nonthyroid cells, is promising in treating poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and nonthyroid malignancies, respectively.

### Radioactive iodine therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer: an update on dose recommendations and risk of secondary primary malignancies [^114CLdj6]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy with iodine-131 is performed in select cases of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), typically for remnant ablation, adjuvant therapy, or treatment of known persistent disease. Herein, we review updated RAI dose recommendations and associated risks of secondary primary malignancy (SPM). RAI dose is usually chosen empirically based on the risk assessment of tumor recurrence and other factors. Dose recommendations differ slightly among relevant medical societies. As of April 2024, most medical societies, including the American Thyroid Association (ATA), European Thyroid Association (ETA), Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging/European Association of Nuclear Medicine (SNMMI/ EANM), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), recommend a dose of 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) I-131 for remnant ablation. For adjuvant therapy, the recommended RAI dose ranges from 1.11 to 3.7 GBq (30–100) mCi I-131, although doses up to 5.6 GBq (150 mCi) may also be considered. In patients with known or suspected metastatic disease, at least 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) I-131 should be administered, and RAI doses as high as 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) may be justified depending on the suspected tumor burden and extent. Dosimetry has the advantage of tailoring the RAI dose to each patient's pharmacokinetics, resulting in ≥ 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) of I-131 in most cases. There is an ongoing debate about the risk of developing SPM due to RAI therapy, with several multicenter studies and meta-analyses concerning SPM being published in the last 2 years. The incidence of RAI-associated SPM varies according to the study design and detection method. Several studies showed no increased incidence, and there was no specific secondary cancer or cancer group linked to RAI exposures. Some reports indicated that cumulative RAI doses exceeding 5.6–7.4 GBq (150–200 mCi) were found to represent an increased risk for developing SPM. However, a clearly defined dose threshold cannot be provided based on the current literature. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when considering repeated RAI therapies for persistent metastatic PTC, with a cumulative dose exceeding 37.0 GBq (1,000 mCi), due to the potential risk of developing SPM and other long-term toxicity. Further research is warranted to understand better the relationship between RAI dose and the risk of SPM.

### Management of challenging radioiodine treatment protocols: a case series and review of the literature [^111Yp7u1]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy with 131 I is the standard of care for treatment in many patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Because 131 I is typically administered as a pill, and much of its radioactivity is excreted via the urine, there can be challenges in patients who cannot swallow pills, absorb iodine via the gastrointestinal tract, or eliminate RAI via the urine (i.e., dialysis patients and patients with renal failure). In this article, we present 3 cases in which the standard 131 I treatment protocol for thyroid cancer could not be used because of these challenges, and we discuss the strategies used to overcome them. Provider collaboration and treatment customization are critical in overcoming patient-specific challenges.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) sensitivity — supplemental criteria in metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) indicate that no uptake on a diagnostic 123I or 131I whole-body scan (WBS) with otherwise detectable disease and uptake present in some (but not all) tumor foci on post-therapy WBS suggest less RAI sensitivity; additionally, when there is no uptake on post-therapy scans with structurally apparent disease and/or progression over fewer than 6 months after treatment, additional RAI is unlikely to provide benefit.

### Advancements in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer [^116AYDNB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although surgery and radioiodine ablation remain the mainstay of DTC therapy, we have become less aggressive in our management of low-risk patients. As our understanding of the natural history and molecular underpinnings of DTC evolves, so might our approach to managing this patient subset, obviating the need for invasive intervention. At the same time, advances in interventional and systemic therapies have greatly expanded treatment options for high-risk surgical candidates and patients with widespread disease, and continue to be areas of active investigation. Continued research efforts are essential to improve our ability to offer effective individualized therapy to patients at all disease stages and to reduce the incidence of recurrent and progressive disease.

Radioactive iodine therapy strategy and selection factors — Near total or total thyroidectomy is necessary if the overall strategy is to include RAI therapy post-operatively, and prior ATA guidelines suggested that patient age > 45 years, contralateral thyroid nodules, a personal history of radiation therapy to the head and neck, or RFMTC might prompt recommendations for total thyroidectomy because of plans for RAI therapy, to facilitate follow-up strategies, or to address greater suspicion of bilateral disease; ultrasound-guided FNA of significant/suspicious contralateral nodularity helped inform a recommendation for total thyroidectomy.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — using risk stratification to guide disease surveillance and therapeutic management decisions, risk stratification is the cornerstone of individualized thyroid cancer management, and initial risk estimates are useful to guide the wide variety of clinical management decisions that need to be made around the time of initial diagnosis and treatment. Initial risk estimates can also be used to guide recommendations with regard to the extent of thyroid surgery, the need for and extent of cervical lymph node dissection, the need for and dose of administered activities of radioactive iodine (RAI), the need for and degree of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, the need for and details of external beam radiation therapy, the need for and types of systemic therapy, the need for and types of studies required for initial staging, and the intensity and type of follow-up studies required for evaluating response to therapy in the early years following initial therapy. This approach tailors the aggressiveness of intervention and follow-up to the specific risks associated with the tumor in an individual patient, and these initial management plans are then modified over time as additional data accumulate and allow for restratification based on individual response to therapy.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) after thyroidectomy — definitions and overall use are as follows: remnant ablation eliminates residual benign thyroid tissue in the thyroid bed to facilitate treatment monitoring; adjuvant therapy is additional RAI administered to reduce the risk of recurrence; and treatment of known disease targets known areas of residual/metastatic disease. Postoperative RAI administration can be used to accomplish remnant ablation, adjuvant therapy, or treatment for known residual disease, and when deciding if RAI is appropriate, patient- and tumor-specific features should be considered, including histopathology, comorbidities, serological biomarkers and metabolic function panel, logistic feasibility for posttreatment isolation and follow-up evaluation, and patient concerns and preferences.

### Approach and challenges for patients with advanced radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer [^113HjqeS]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC), including papillary, follicular, and oncocytic subtypes, are generally associated with an excellent prognosis due to their responsiveness to conventional therapies, including surgery, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. However, a subset of patients develops radioiodine-refractory (RAI-R) disease, characterized by tumor dedifferentiation and loss of iodine avidity, resulting in disease progression despite standard interventions. This group poses a considerable therapeutic challenge and is associated with markedly poorer outcomes. Recent advancements have transformed the treatment landscape with the emergence of systemic therapies such as anti-angiogenic multikinase inhibitors (aaMKIs) and genotype-directed therapies that offer improved disease control in advanced settings. This review consolidates the current evidence for diagnosing, evaluating, and managing advanced RAI-R DTC. It explores the pathophysiological basis of refractoriness, prognostic implications, treatment selection strategies-including active surveillance, locoregional therapies, redifferentiation approaches, and systemic therapies-and outlines practical considerations for clinicians. Future directions including immunotherapy, novel agents, and personalized therapy strategies are also discussed. Emphasis is placed on precision oncology, toxicity management, and the role of multidisciplinary care in optimizing patient outcomes.

### Evolving approaches in managing radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer [^112veMUu]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the approach to care of patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), in particular those with radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory disease, and the transition to systemic treatment.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted using the search terms "radioactive iodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer and treatment" restricted to a 2000–2012 timeframe, English language, and humans. Relevant articles were identified from the bibliographies of selected references. Four patient cases are presented to illustrate the clinical course of RAI-refractory DTC.

Results

The current standard of care for early stage DTC could include surgery, RAI in some cases, and thyroid hormone suppression. For advanced RAI-refractory DTC, clinical practice guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Thyroid Association recommend, as one option, the use of systemic therapy, including kinase inhibitors. Numerous trials are underway to evaluate the clinical benefit of these targeted therapies.

Conclusion

Preliminary results are encouraging with respect to the clinical benefit of targeted systemic therapies. However, at present there is no consensus on the criteria that define RAI-refractory disease and the optimal timing for transition to systemic therapy. There remains a need to establish common criteria to enhance patient care and enable better comparison across clinical studies.

### Current controversies in the initial post-surgical radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer: a narrative review [^113T7b74]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy and the fifth most common cancer in women. DTC therapy requires a multimodal approach, including surgery, which is beyond the scope of this paper. However, for over 50 years, the post-operative management of the DTC post-thyroidectomy patient has included radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation and/or therapy. Before 2000, a typical RAI post-operative dose recommendation was 100mCi for remnant ablation, 150mCi for locoregional nodal disease, and 175–200mCi for distant metastases. Recent recommendations have been made to decrease the dose in order to limit the perceived adverse effects of RAI including salivary gland dysfunction and inducing secondary primary malignancies. A significant controversy has thus arisen regarding the use of RAI, particularly in the management of the low-risk DTC patient. This debate includes the definition of the low-risk patient, RAI dose selection, and whether or not RAI is needed in all patients. To allow the reader to form an opinion regarding post-operative RAI therapy in DTC, a literature review of the risks and benefits is presented.

### Cancer risk after radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145nP33]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for hyperthyroidism associated with an increased cancer risk?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis, including 12 observational studies and 479 452 participants, found that RAI therapy was not associated with a significant increase in overall cancer risk or site-specific cancer incidence or mortality, except for thyroid cancer. However, a linear radiation dose-response association between RAI therapy and solid cancer mortality was observed, based on 2 studies with information on RAI administered dose.

Meaning

Considering the global use of RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism, further studies are needed to provide quantitative estimates of site-specific cancer risks associated with RAI therapy, particularly at higher doses.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1121psDX]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association pediatric thyroid cancer guidelines — scope and methods emphasize that a task force commissioned by the American Thyroid Association developed clinically relevant questions for managing children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), used an extensive literature search focused on studies with subjects ≤ 18 years of age with articles identified through April 2014, and graded recommendations using a modified schema from the United States Preventive Services Task Force. These inaugural guidelines provide recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents, including the role and interpretation of ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and the management of benign nodules; for DTC they outline evaluation, treatment, and follow-up including preoperative staging, surgical management, postoperative staging, the role of radioactive iodine therapy, and goals for thyrotropin suppression, and they propose management algorithms with separate recommendations for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers. The need for pediatric-specific guidance is noted because previous guidelines were geared toward adults, pediatric thyroid neoplasms differ in pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and long-term outcomes, and children may be at low risk for death but at higher risk for long-term harm from overly aggressive treatment.
