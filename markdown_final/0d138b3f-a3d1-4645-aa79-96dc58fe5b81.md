## Question

When should testosterone be tested in a male with fatigue, erectile dysfunction, difficulty losing weight, and decreased exercise endurance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to test for testosterone in a man with fatigue, erectile dysfunction, difficulty losing weight, and decreased exercise endurance, and how to structure the testing and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these symptoms meaningfully raise the pretest probability of testosterone deficiency. Then, I should verify guideline-based indications for ordering testosterone testing. Next, I will review timing and assay conditions for sample collection. After that, I need to confirm the requirement for repeat testing to establish persistence. Then, I should consider when to add free testosterone and gonadotropins. Finally, I will outline immediate management of reversible contributors and the decision pathway if testosterone remains low despite addressing comorbidities.

> Let me first confirm the pretest probability. Fatigue and decreased endurance are nonspecific, but erectile dysfunction is among the most specific symptoms associated with low testosterone in men, and the combination of sexual dysfunction with reduced energy and impaired physical performance increases the likelihood of androgen deficiency, especially in the presence of excess adiposity and cardiometabolic comorbidity, which commonly suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis [^114XKuPY] [^114tZLyY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify guideline indications before ordering tests. Multiple societies advise measuring testosterone when men have compatible symptoms and signs, and erectile dysfunction is itself a recognized indication to check total testosterone, particularly when accompanied by other suggestive features or risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, or sleep apnea, so this patient profile warrants testing rather than screening the general population [^116QUpQv] [^112qUU3o] [^111K8ekU] [^1119mcdZ].

> I need to ensure proper timing and conditions for the blood draw. Wait, let me verify the morning requirement: total testosterone should be measured in a fasting morning sample, ideally before 11 AM, because diurnal variation and feeding can lower measured levels by up to 20–30%, which risks false positives if drawn later in the day or nonfasting [^116Fdiwb] [^114QxHTp].

> Next, I should review confirmation. I should double-check that a single low value is insufficient; the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency requires two separate morning total testosterone measurements on different days, using the same assay when possible, given biological variability and assay variability, and if the first is low and the second normal, a third may be needed to adjudicate persistence [^116Fdiwb] [^1161SNRm].

> Let me consider adjunctive testing. If total testosterone is borderline, or if SHBG is abnormal due to obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or medications, I should confirm with free testosterone using equilibrium dialysis or a reliable calculation, and I should measure LH and FSH to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism and guide etiologic workup, adding prolactin if LH/FSH are low or inappropriately normal to evaluate for pituitary disease [^115dQsiH] [^114ATRq4].

> But wait, what if symptoms are driven by reversible factors rather than organic hypogonadism. I need to ensure we address obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, depression, and medications that suppress the axis, because weight loss and comorbidity optimization can raise testosterone by roughly 10–30% and may normalize levels in functional hypogonadism, while PDE5 inhibitors and CPAP can directly improve erectile function and fatigue independent of testosterone status [^113BAEvt] [^112MhEgS] [^1178MmgM].

> I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds I will apply. The AUA uses less than 300 ng/dL as a reasonable cut point supporting testosterone deficiency when paired with symptoms, whereas the EAU suggests 12 nmol/L, approximately 346 ng/dL, as a reliable threshold for late-onset hypogonadism; given this range, values below about 300 ng/dL strengthen the case, and values above about 350–400 ng/dL make testosterone deficiency less likely as the sole driver of symptoms [^111bvkZt] [^113ykDc2].

> Let me synthesize the testing plan. I will order a fasting morning total testosterone now, repeat it on a separate morning if the first is low, and if still low, proceed with LH, FSH, SHBG, and calculated or directly measured free testosterone, while simultaneously initiating evaluation and treatment for obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and mood symptoms, and considering a PDE5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction, because these steps can improve symptoms and clarify whether persistent low testosterone remains after reversible causes are addressed [^116Fdiwb] [^112qUU3o] [^114W9Cp4].

> Hold on, I should verify the downstream decision points. If, after 6–12 months of lifestyle and comorbidity optimization, testosterone remains unequivocally low and symptoms persist, a shared decision-making discussion about a time-limited therapeutic trial of testosterone can be considered, with upfront counseling about uncertain long-term cardiovascular and prostate risks, baseline hematocrit and PSA, and a plan to discontinue therapy if goals are not met within 3–6 months [^114W9Cp4] [^114ATRq4] [^114UcDBz].

Testosterone testing is indicated in men with **fatigue, erectile dysfunction, difficulty losing weight, and decreased exercise endurance** when symptoms are persistent and suggestive of androgen deficiency [^112oc1u4]. Order **two separate fasting morning total testosterone measurements** [^117Q5eXY] to confirm low levels, and add free testosterone if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^114mNUJU]. Testosterone should be measured after addressing acute illness, sleep apnea, obesity, diabetes, and medications that suppress testosterone [^113icLgp]. If testosterone is low, evaluate for primary versus secondary causes with LH/FSH and prolactin [^114ATRq4], and consider testosterone therapy only if symptoms persist and benefits outweigh risks [^114W9Cp4].

---

## Clinical indications for testosterone testing

Testosterone testing is indicated in men with **persistent symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency**, including:

- **Fatigue**: Persistent, unexplained fatigue or decreased vitality [^113amujQ].
- **Erectile dysfunction**: Particularly with reduced libido or spontaneous erections [^112qUU3o].
- **Difficulty losing weight**: Especially with increased abdominal adiposity [^112Q4pSt].
- **Decreased exercise endurance**: Reduced physical performance or endurance [^113amujQ].

These symptoms are **nonspecific** and may arise from other conditions; therefore, testing should be guided by clinical judgment and the presence of consistent symptoms [^112oc1u4].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

During the initial evaluation, obtain a **detailed medical history** to characterize symptom onset, duration, and severity, and screen for comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, sleep apnea, depression, and medication use (e.g. opioids, glucocorticoids) [^113Y6q86]. Conduct a focused physical examination for signs of androgen deficiency, including decreased body hair, gynecomastia, small testes, or delayed puberty [^113amujQ].

---

### Laboratory testing

- **Total testosterone measurement**: Obtain two separate fasting morning (before 11 AM) total testosterone measurements using reliable assays [^117Q5eXY] [^116Fdiwb].
- **Free testosterone measurement**: If total testosterone is borderline (8–12 nmol/L) or SHBG is abnormal, measure or calculate free testosterone [^114mNUJU] [^116kpqgV].
- **LH and FSH measurement**: To differentiate primary (testicular) from secondary (pituitary-hypothalamic) hypogonadism [^112oc1u4].
- **Prolactin measurement**: If testosterone is low with low or normal LH/FSH, to evaluate for pituitary disorders [^114ATRq4].

---

## Interpretation of testosterone levels

Interpretation should be guided by **symptoms and clinical context** [^116QUpQv]. Total testosterone below 300 ng/dL (10.4 nmol/L) supports hypogonadism, whereas levels above this threshold make it less likely [^111bvkZt]. Free testosterone below 65 pg/mL (225 pmol/L) suggests bioavailable androgen deficiency [^112Cpy5a]. LH and FSH help distinguish primary (elevated) from secondary (low or normal) hypogonadism [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing testosterone levels

Several factors can **transiently lower testosterone**; testing should be deferred or interpreted cautiously:

- **Acute illness**: Avoid testing during or shortly after acute illness [^113icLgp].
- **Medications**: Opioids, glucocorticoids, and others can suppress testosterone [^113Y6q86].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Obesity, sleep apnea, excessive alcohol, and stress can lower testosterone [^notfound].

What Treatment Would You Recommend?

This patient has nonspecific symptoms and signs of androgen deficiency, and his serum total testosterone is modestly reduced. The diagnostic evaluation has excluded classic pathology of the HPT axis. His symptoms, signs, and low serum testosterone (with normal serum gonadotropin) concentrations suggest HPT suppression due to obesity, untreated sleep apnea, and T2D with suboptimal glycemic control. A high percentage of older, obese men with low serum testosterone with normal serum gonadotropin concentrations will remit to normal serum testosterone concentrations, particularly with weight loss. Initial treatment of our patient should include 1) implementation of lifestyle measures and pharmacotherapy to optimize weight and comorbidities (including cardiovascular risk) and 2) initiation of phosphodiesterase type 5-inhibitor (PDE5-inhibitor) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy to address his principal concerns of erectile dysfunction and fatigue. This holistic approach will provide general health benefits and has the potential to reverse his hypogonadism.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old analyst was referred for evaluation of low serum testosterone levels. He described several years of progressive fatigue, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, poor recovery after exercising, and difficulty losing weight. Additionally, he had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension, treated with continuous positive airway pressure and candesartan 8 mg daily, respectively. On the advice of a coworker and after conducting online "research", he requested serum testosterone testing by his primary care physician, which returned a result of 147 ng/dL (5.1 nmol/L), below the laboratory lower reference interval. He was then referred for review of "testosterone deficiency" and consideration of testosterone replacement therapy.

He described longstanding obesity with a current weight of 118 kg [body mass index (BMI) 36 kg/m²] and predominant central adiposity (waist circumference 112 cm; normal range, NR < 94 cm). Resting blood pressure was elevated (148/99 mmHg). Virilization and secondary sexual characteristics were normal with testicular volumes of 25 mL bilaterally (Prader orchidometer). Repeat early morning blood sampling confirmed low serum testosterone with concomitant low SHBG and normal LH and FSH concentrations (Table 1). Additional obesity-related metabolic abnormalities were also present (Table 1). Hemoglobin and hematocrit were within the normal range.

Back to the Case

The evidence was discussed with the patient. He agreed to implement lifestyle measures and was referred to a dietician and exercise physiologist with a target weight loss of 5% to 10% that might increase his serum testosterone into the normal range. However, despite his initial enthusiasm and hiring a personal coach, he was only able to maintain modest dietary and exercise changes. PDE5-inhibitor treatment was progressively titrated to maximum dose, with modest improvements in his erectile function. CPAP therapy was commenced and optimized with improvements in fatigue; repeat polysomnography demonstrated resolution of significant apneic episodes. He was prescribed a weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, but he was unable to tolerate a low dosage of GLP-1 receptor agonist due to significant gastrointestinal side effects. SGLT2 inhibitor treatment was initiated.

Twelve months later, he had lost 2 kg (now 97.3 kg, 214 lb), and his HbA1c had decreased to 7.3%. A fasting early morning blood sample demonstrated a total serum testosterone (216 ng/dL; 7.5 nmol/L;) and a low calculated free testosterone (51.6 pg/mL; 179 pmol/L). A second blood sample yielded similar results. Both total testosterone measurements were done by a validated, harmonized assay. Although his energy has improved, he still reports low motivation and intermittent low mood. He reports improved erectile function, but libido, tumescence, and overall sexual function remains less than satisfactory. The patient wishes to discuss the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy.

What Are the Benefits of Testosterone Treatment?

In men with classic organic hypogonadism, testosterone replacement ameliorates the clinical features of hypogonadism (except fertility) although the evidence is limited to uncontrolled studies. In the following section we will focus on double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs of testosterone treatment in older men with low serum testosterone and no classic cause of HPT axis pathology. Benefits and risks are summarized in Table 3.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^116PrpL2]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — clinical diagnosis criteria and symptom considerations — The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs.(Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) Total testosterone < 300 ng/dL alone does not define testosterone deficiency, and clinicians should refrain from measuring testosterone levels in patients who are not experiencing symptoms or do not have signs related to low testosterone, or do not have any comorbid conditions that are associated with low testosterone. A meta-analysis of 4 observational studies involving 4,426 men showed that men with low testosterone levels had a higher prevalence of fatigue than men with normal testosterone levels (OR = 1.46; CI 1.16, 1.98), and those that used < 350ng/dL as a cut-off to define low testosterone did not detect a significant association.

Thus, in addition to providing general health benefits, there is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30% that might normalize testosterone concentrations in our patient and might improve many of his symptoms that overlap with hypogonadism. However, the data stem mostly from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions, and these studies had small numbers of participants that were typically younger (30–50 years of age), relatively short follow-up (< 1–2 years), and variable methodologies in the assessment of serum testosterone concentrations. Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older, frailer men. The degree to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for the improvement seen with androgen deficiency-like features (eg, erectile function, physical performance) is not certain. Whether concomitant testosterone treatment improves the efficacy of lifestyle interventions requires further study, but preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the single most important intervention for our patient and many older men with a high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration might be lifestyle changes (increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet) to reduce weight.

What is the Evidence for Lifestyle Measures?

In middle-aged and older men not selected for a low serum testosterone, moderate exercise (eg, 90 minutes thrice weekly) improves sense of well-being, sarcopenia/physical function, bone mass, and cardiovascular risk factors, and might additively improve erectile function with PDE5-inhibitor treatment.

In a 2013 meta-analysis of studies of adult men with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 kg/m², a hypocaloric diet leading to a 9.8% loss of body weight was associated with an increase in mean serum total testosterone concentration of 83 ng/dL (95% CI, 48–117) (2.87 nmol/L; 95% CI, 1.68–4.07), representing increases ranging from 10% to 30% of the baseline serum testosterone. Younger age and magnitude of weight loss were associated with the increment in serum testosterone. The studies included in the meta-analysis were small (generally < 50 men), short term (< 12 months), and predominantly recruited men < 50 years of age. Furthermore, some men had normal baseline testosterone concentrations, and the overall effect was largely driven by a single study. In a 2016 RCT of a hypocaloric diet and testosterone vs placebo of obese men (baseline median age 53 years; BMI 37 kg/m²; serum total testosterone 202 ng/dL [7.0 nmol/L]), the mean weight loss of 9.1% achieved with the hypocaloric diet alone was associated with a 52 ng/dL (1.8 nmol/L) increase in total testosterone (a 20% increase from baseline). Neither weight loss nor serum total testosterone increase were maintained after supervised weight loss intervention ended. In a 12-month RCT of frail obese men ≥ 65 years with a baseline serum total testosterone concentration of 211 to 274 ng/dL [7.3–9.5 mmol/L], weight loss by diet (mean loss 10.1 kg) and diet plus exercise (mean loss 9.1 kg) increased serum testosterone concentrations by 21.0 ng/dL (0.73 nmol/L) and by 49.9 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L), respectively, without any changes in serum calculated free testosterone. The diet plus exercise group also had improved physical function. It is uncertain whether the increases in serum testosterone play a role in improved outcomes seen with weight loss. For example, some studies suggest that improved sexual function after bariatric surgery more closely correlates with the amount of weight loss than the rise of serum testosterone.

AUA guideline — guideline statements for erectile dysfunction (ED) state: Men presenting with symptoms of ED should undergo a thorough medical, sexual and psychosocial history, a physical examination, and selective laboratory testing (Clinical Principle). For the man with ED, validated questionnaires are recommended to assess the severity of ED, to measure treatment effectiveness, and to guide future management (Expert Opinion). Men should be counseled that ED is a risk marker for underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other health conditions that may warrant evaluation and treatment (Clinical Principle). In men with ED, morning serum total testosterone levels should be measured (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For some men with ED, specialized testing and evaluation may be necessary to guide treatment (Expert Opinion). For men being treated for ED, referral to a mental health professional should be considered to promote treatment adherence, reduce performance anxiety, and integrate treatments into a sexual relationship (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### How would you manage this male patient with hypogonadism? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111ibLAU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism is defined as an abnormally low serum testosterone concentration or sperm count. As men age, often in the context of obesity and other comorbid conditions, serum testosterone levels may decrease. Normalizing serum testosterone levels in male adults with hypogonadism may improve symptoms related to androgen deficiency, but controversies exist regarding the long-term benefits and risks of hormone supplementation in this setting. In 2020, the American College of Physicians published a clinical guideline for the use of testosterone supplementation in adult men based on a systematic review of available evidence. Among their recommendations were that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function and not initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition. Here, two clinicians with expertise in this area, one a generalist and the other an endocrinologist, debate the management of a patient with sexual symptoms and a low serum testosterone level. They discuss the diagnosis of male hypogonadism, the indications for testosterone therapy, its potential benefits and risks, how it should be monitored, and how long it should be continued.

### Medical treatment of hypogonadism in men [^111Mtdh5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urologists may commonly diagnose hypogonadism in adult men experiencing an age-related decline in serum testosterone. Low serum testosterone in conjunction with symptoms such as decreased libido, fatigue, memory deficit, or decreased vitality is described as testosterone deficiency syndrome. There are numerous therapeutic options, although each is unique in its formulation, administration, and side-effect profile. For this reason, treatment can prove to be challenging for each unique patient case. The clinician must carefully monitor key serum markers before and during treatment. With careful dosing and monitoring, therapeutic benefit can be achieved reliably and sustainably.

### The laboratory diagnosis of testosterone deficiency [^112mxnrd]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation and treatment of hypogonadal men has become an important part of urologic practice. Fatigue, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction are commonly reported, but nonspecific symptoms and laboratory verification of low testosterone (T) are an important part of evaluation in addition to a detailed history and physical examination. Significant intraindividual fluctuations in serum T levels, biologic variation of T action on end organs, the wide range of T levels in human serum samples, and technical limitations of currently available assays have led to poor reliability of T measurements in the clinical laboratory setting. There is no universally accepted threshold of T concentration that distinguishes eugonadal from hypogonadal men; thus, laboratory results have to be interpreted in the appropriate clinical setting. This review focuses on clinical, biological, and technological challenges that affect serum T measurements to educate clinicians regarding technological advances and limitations of the currently available laboratory methods to diagnose hypogonadism. A collaborative effort led by the American Urological Association between practicing clinicians, patient advocacy groups, government regulatory agencies, industry, and professional societies is underway to provide optimized assay platforms and evidence-based normal assay ranges to guide clinical decision making. Until such standardization is commonplace in clinical laboratories, the decision to treat should be based on the presence of signs and symptoms in addition to serum T measurements. Rigid interpretation of T ranges should not dictate clinical decision making or define coverage of treatment by third party payers.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

How Should This Man Be Evaluated?

Does This Man Have Clinically Evident Androgen Deficiency?

The first step is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap of the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool that screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key first step in the evaluation (Table 1). In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, 3 sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections) were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion; diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Because reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In the European Male Aging Study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with a normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease (see below). However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone justify further evaluation for androgen deficiency.

Table 1.
Clinical features of testosterone deficiency in men

The patient lacks more specific clinical signs of hypogonadism (Table 1), but these findings, such as new-onset or increased gynecomastia that is almost always characterized by breast pain and tenderness, deficient male pattern body hair (that is generally only seen in longstanding hypogonadism), hot flashes that might occur with acute onset of hypogonadism (eg, bilateral orchidectomy), and/or small (< 15 cc) testes are not common in hypogonadal middle-aged or older men. Although small testes are an uncommon finding in older men with newly diagnosed hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of classic organic hypogonadism, is typically characterized by very small testes (≤ 4 cc each), is underdiagnosed (by 50% or more), and might not be diagnosed until middle or older age.

Prostate cancer — adverse effects of hormonal therapy reflect the systemic impact of lowering or blocking androgens; hormonal therapy includes treatments designed to affect cells whose functioning depends on androgens, and prostate cancer cells are susceptible to such treatments. Among the most common side effects are increased risk for weight gain, obesity, and diabetes; cardiovascular disease; breast enlargement and/or tenderness; sexual problems including diminished sex drive and erectile dysfunction; emotional changes including anger, sadness, and fatigue; osteoporosis; loss of muscle strength and mass with increased risk of falls and fractures in older men; anemia contributing to fatigue; and cognitive changes such as impaired thought processes and memory loss.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1165kCnK]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA Guideline — lifestyle modification for testosterone deficiency — 21. All men with testosterone deficiency should be counseled regarding lifestyle modifications as a treatment strategy. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Men with testosterone deficiency should be counseled that lifestyle modifications, such as losing weight or maintaining recommended weight and increasing physical activity, has the potential to increase total testosterone levels and/or reduce signs and symptoms, and clinicians should counsel that improvements in total testosterone might not be clinically meaningful; the AACE suggests that significant improvements do not occur until an individual has lost 10% of his body weight. Evidence cited includes morbidly obese men undergoing gastric bypass in whom 29 were studied (mean age: 31 years; mean BMI: 56.8), with 22 patients having total testosterone < 300 ng/dL at baseline and, at 6 months post-surgery, total testosterone increased significantly (p ≤ 0.001) with 22 patients (75.9%) showing normalized total testosterone levels. Additional data in 118 overweight and obese men with normal total testosterone levels (> 350 ng/dL) on calorie restricted diets for 52 weeks showed total testosterone increased in both diet types with neither group deriving more benefit (p ≥ 0.244), with increases noted in the first 12 weeks (p = 0.037) and improvement not significant until weeks 12–52 (p = 0.002). Studies that randomized overweight or obese men to combined diet and exercise reported significantly greater increases in total testosterone than calorie reduction or exercise alone, and men with mild testosterone deficiency who are overweight or physically inactive should be encouraged to participate in lifestyle modification programs with reassessment of testosterone levels, signs, and symptoms before deciding to start long-term therapy.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113BZXYp]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Appendix A: Testosterone literature methodology review — study design, populations, and inclusion thresholds emphasize that meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies provide the highest levels of evidence, followed by individual RCTs, prospective cohorts, retrospective cohorts, and observational studies. For the evidence synthesis, the guideline only included studies that used morning testosterone < 350 ng/dL as an inclusion criterion, and the mean testosterone across all patients in the included studies was 249 ng/dL. RCTs are commonly of short duration (< 1 year), which leads to results that might have a bias towards lack of benefit in certain symptoms/signs while failing to identify therapeutic benefit that can require additional time to manifest. The document notes that individual study factors such as population heterogeneity, comorbidities and their control, and confidence intervals impact overall study quality, and that statements are generalized with recognition that some populations and clinical scenarios fall outside the initial study criteria.

### Testosterone therapy: review of clinical applications [^1116DPTT]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone therapy is increasingly common in the United States, and many of these prescriptions are written by primary care physicians. There is conflicting evidence on the benefit of male testosterone therapy for age-related declines in testosterone. Physicians should not measure testosterone levels unless a patient has signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, such as loss of body hair, sexual dysfunction, hot flashes, or gynecomastia. Depressed mood, fatigue, decreased strength, and a decreased sense of vitality are less specific to male hypogonadism. Testosterone therapy should be initiated only after two morning total serum testosterone measurements show decreased levels, and all patients should be counseled on the potential risks and benefits before starting therapy. Potential benefits of therapy include increased libido, improved sexual function, improved mood and well-being, and increased muscle mass and bone density; however, there is little or mixed evidence confirming clinically significant benefits. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that testosterone therapy may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. Other possible risks include rising prostate-specific antigen levels, worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, polycythemia, and increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Patients receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored to ensure testosterone levels rise appropriately, clinical improvement occurs, and no complications develop. Testosterone therapy may also be used to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women and to produce physical male sex characteristics in female-to-male transgender patients.

Patient values and preferences — Fifty-three percent of patients receiving testosterone treatment (n = 382) chose injectable testosterone over gel-based pellet regimens, mostly because of lower cost; in a second study (n = 54) after more than 1 month of testosterone replacement therapy, most (71%) preferred a topical gel over an injection or patch for reasons such as convenience and ease of use. Among 312 men with hypogonadism, the most bothersome symptoms were lack of energy (90% of patients who elected to receive TRT vs. 81% who refused TRT; P = 0.075), decreased strength and endurance (86% vs. 76%; P = 0.077), and deterioration in work performance (52% vs. 31%; P = 0.004). Willingness and reasons to seek care included that in a study of 101 patients attending an urologic consultation, 43% reported interest in testosterone treatment although half were unsure of the risks, and another study found erectile dysfunction was the most frequently reported reason (66%), followed by loss of energy or increased tiredness (59.0%) and decreased sex drive (57.9%); however, TRT discontinuation rates between 30% and 62% have been reported.

### A perspective on middle-aged and older men with functional hypogonadism: focus on holistic management [^113MtyWZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Middle-aged and older men (≥ 50 years), especially those who are obese and suffer from comorbidities, not uncommonly present with clinical features consistent with androgen deficiency and modestly reduced testosterone levels. Commonly, such men do not demonstrate anatomical hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis pathology but have functional hypogonadism that is potentially reversible.

Evidence Acquisition

Literature review from 1970 to October 2016.

Evidence Synthesis

Although definitive randomized controlled trials are lacking, evidence suggests that in such men, lifestyle measures to achieve weight loss and optimization of comorbidities, including discontinuation of offending medications, lead to clinical improvement and a modest increase in testosterone. Also, androgen deficiency-like symptoms and end-organ deficits respond to targeted treatments (such as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction) without evidence that hypogonadal men are refractory. Unfortunately, lifestyle interventions remain difficult and may be insufficient even if successful. Testosterone therapy should be considered primarily for men who have significant clinical features of androgen deficiency and unequivocally low testosterone levels. Testosterone should be initiated either concomitantly with a trial of lifestyle measures, or after such a trial fails, after a tailored diagnostic work-up, exclusion of contraindications, and appropriate counseling.

Conclusions

There is modest evidence that functional hypogonadism responds to lifestyle measures and optimization of comorbidities. If achievable, these interventions may have demonstrable health benefits beyond the potential for increasing testosterone levels. Therefore, treatment of underlying causes of functional hypogonadism and of symptoms should be used either as an initial or adjunctive approach to testosterone therapy.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns. Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by current evidence, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

### 'What should I do with a 60-year old man with a slightly low serum total testosterone concentration and normal levels of serum gonadotrophins'? [^112kDkJD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The fundamental question in assessing an older man with a slightly low total testosterone and normal gonadotrophin levels is to determine whether or not he has clinical hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome complex, which comprises both symptoms as well as biochemical testosterone deficiency. As symptoms are nonspecific and there are no clear cut-off values for testosterone levels this invariably leads to a clinical dilemma. International guidelines have been published which provide recommendations to aid the clinician in making a diagnosis. Late-onset hypogonadism, the preferred terminology for age-related hypogonadism, can only be made once other causes have been excluded. Evidence shows that low testosterone levels are associated with several common male conditions including erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis and diabetes. Short-term studies have shown benefits of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, bone metabolism, insulin resistance, sexual function and quality of life. Recommendations give clear advice on safety monitoring, specifically in relation to prostate health. If a diagnosis of hypogonadism is made with borderline testosterone levels then a 3-month trial of TRT can be considered. The diagnosis of hypogonadism associated with borderline testosterone levels and the decision to treat should only be made by an experienced clinician.

Final Comments About the Initiation of Testosterone Therapy in Men ≥ 50

The decision to treat medical conditions always involves an analysis of the benefits and risks; that analysis is particularly important in the decision to initiate testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years. Although testosterone replacement for men with organic hypogonadism is uncontroversial irrespective of age, men ≥ 50 years old with nonspecific symptoms, reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations, normal serum gonadotropins, and no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease often have improved health and well-being and normalization of serum testosterone concentrations with optimization of weight and comorbidities and stopping or reducing the dosage of medications that affect the HPT axis. In addition, therapies other than testosterone should be considered for symptoms and signs that might be attributed to hypogonadism: PDE5-inhibitors (for erectile dysfunction); treatment of sleep apnea, depression, obesity, and diabetes mellitus with proven effective therapies; and medications that reduce fracture (for osteoporosis). It is reasonable to add testosterone treatment to men ≥ 50 years with persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone (measured fasted in the morning when the man is at baseline health) and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations despite lifestyle measures for 6–12 months to lose weight (if BMI > 25 kg/m²) and optimization of management of comorbidities. This decision must be individualized and is not algorithmic, and there should be no contraindications to testosterone therapy. Men ≥ 50 years with symptoms of hypogonadism and primary hypogonadism (low serum testosterone and elevated serum gonadotropin concentrations) should generally be offered testosterone replacement therapy. If testosterone therapy is being considered, we highlight the importance of discussing the unknown effects of testosterone therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer with the patient and documenting that discussion. It is also vital to determine the patient's expectations and goals and to provide information to the patient about the most likely benefits of testosterone therapy and the typical course for these benefits. The clinician and patient should identify patient-specific treatment goals with a timeline for assessment of effectiveness and consideration of whether to continue therapy. The therapeutic plan should include monitoring to ensure serum testosterone concentrations are above the lower limit of normal and to minimize and manage adverse effects including erythrocytosis. If a trial of testosterone therapy of sufficient duration does not meet patient-specific treatment goals in men with low serum testosterone and without identifiable pathology of the HPT axis, testosterone treatment should be stopped.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113Y6q86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The patient does not have unexplained anemia that might suggest hypogonadism. His osteopenia is consistent with, but not specific for sex steroid deficiency. Observational and experimental studies consistently suggest that bone health is typically compromised at serum total testosterone concentrations of < 200 ng/dL (6.9 nmol/L).

His initial assessment identifies comorbidities that could be partially responsible for his clinical presentation. Reduced pedal pulses and erectile dysfunction indicates likely atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. The clinical history suggests uncontrolled sleep apnea that could be the primary cause of his fatigue and suppressed HPT axis and a factor in his erectile dysfunction. Of note, hypoxemia in older men with sleep apnea can be associated with increases in hematocrit and thus could mask testosterone deficiency–associated anemia in this man.

There are no clinical features suggesting classic organic causes of hypogonadism, including Klinefelter syndrome, hypopituitarism, pituitary mass effect, or endogenous Cushing syndrome, and he is not taking medications that can suppress the HPT axis, such as opioids or glucocorticoids. Moreover, there is no history of common risk factors for primary and secondary hypogonadism such as testicular trauma, radiation to the pelvis, chemotherapy, significant head trauma, or radiation to the head or neck. In summary, his clinical probability of classic pathologic hypogonadism is low to moderate. His symptoms might be due to depression (with a false negative result in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9), atherosclerotic disease of the penile vasculature, obesity, sleep apnea, or some combination of these causes. Because the man has had a very low serum testosterone measured, it is incumbent to exclude hypogonadism with an appropriate evaluation (Fig. 1).

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

This patient might have had a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after ∼ 6 months. Sense of well-being and sexual function are complex, and both depend upon multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the HPT axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men. The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism after attempts to treat reversible causes are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less. An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by restoration of normal HPT axis function by weight loss. With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit for an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their current regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit had increased 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. He had lost another 4.3 kg (and now weighs 93.0 kg) with diet and exercise. He had lost a total of 6.3 kg (∼6% of body weight since his initial evaluation). At 12 months of follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L), and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after discontinuation of testosterone therapy. He enquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

### Male hypogonadism. part II: etiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis [^112Q4pSt]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism has a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic conditions, anatomic abnormalities, infection, tumor, and injury. Defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis may also result from type II diabetes mellitus and treatment with a range of medications. Circulating testosterone levels have been associated with sexual function, cognitive function, and body composition. Apart from reduced levels of testosterone, clinical hallmarks of hypogonadism include absence or regression of secondary sex characteristics, reduced fertility (oligospermia, azoospermia), anemia, muscle wasting, reduced bone mass (and bone mineral density), and/or abdominal adiposity. Some patients, particularly those with partial androgen deficiency of the aging male, also experience sexual dysfunction, reduced sense of vitality, depressed mood, increased irritability, difficulty concentrating, and/or hot flushes in certain cases of acute onset. As many patients with male hypogonadism-like patients with erectile dysfunction-do not seek medical attention, it is important for clinicians to be acquainted with the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, and to conduct appropriate laboratory testing and other assessments to determine the causes and inform the treatment of this condition.

### Sex-differential testosterone response to long-term weight loss [^1155GvVp]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

In approximately 40% of men, obesity is associated with low testosterone together with low SHGB and increased oestradiol, and with low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins. In our study, despite an average age of male subjects of 55 years, only a single male was affected by hypogonadism. However, the median testosterone level of male subjects was below the reference range.

The weight loss interventions led to an increase in total testosterone over 12, 24 and 36 months with an increase in SHBG from baseline up to 24 months. The sustained increase in SHBG levels and in total and CFT in males was previously attributed to reduction in visceral adipose tissue and to alterations in testosterone metabolism with relative decreases in aromatization and lower 5α-reductase activity. The restoration of testosterone levels may help to relieve fatigue and improve reduced libido. As testosterone inhibits stem cell differentiation into adipocytes and promotes myogenesis, testosterone supplementation in males results in favourable change in body composition with reduction in total and abdominal fat mass and preservation of lean body mass. Notably recent recommendations by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) endorsed screening men with obesity for hypogonadism and evaluation of body weight in men with hypogonadism.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — diagnosis of testosterone deficiency directs that clinicians should use a total testosterone level below 300 ng/dL as a reasonable cut-off in support of the diagnosis of low testosterone (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B), and that the diagnosis of low testosterone should be made only after two total testosterone measurements are taken on separate occasions with both conducted in an early morning fashion (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should consider measuring total testosterone in patients with a history of unexplained anemia, bone density loss, diabetes, exposure to chemotherapy, exposure to testicular radiation, HIV/AIDS, chronic narcotic use, male infertility, pituitary dysfunction, and chronic corticosteroid use even in the absence of symptoms or signs associated with testosterone deficiency (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The use of validated questionnaires is not currently recommended to either define which patients are candidates for testosterone therapy or to monitor symptom response in patients on testosterone therapy (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Hypogonadism and androgen replacement therapy in elderly men [^113r6Dfe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The decrease in testosterone levels with age is both central (pituitary) and peripheral (testicular) origin. Because serum levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin increase with aging, the decrease in free testosterone is of even greater magnitude. Recent long-term studies of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal elderly men have shown beneficial effects on bone density, body composition, and muscle strength without any substantial adverse effects on lipids and the prostate. Total testosterone level is the test of choice for initial screening of elderly men who present with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. If the level is below 300 ng/dL, replacement therapy should be initiated. If the level is normal in a symptomatic patient, free or bioavailable testosterone should be determined. The pros and cons of testosterone therapy should be discussed in depth with every patient, and decisions should be made on an individual basis. This review summarizes the trials of testosterone replacement therapy in elderly men and outlines a diagnostic approach to these patients.

Back to the Case

The patient has continued to have symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations. He enquired about testosterone therapy to restore his serum testosterone concentration into the normal range. Before testosterone therapy was considered and the potential benefits and risks were discussed, prostate cancer screening was discussed; untreated prostate cancer is a contraindication to testosterone therapy (Table 4). After discussion of the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, he elected to undergo prostate cancer screening; digital rectal exam revealed no prostate abnormality and PSA was 1.5 ng/dL. The potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy were discussed because he had persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly, unequivocally low serum testosterone concentrations after a year of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT axis (including lifestyle changes to lose weight and optimization of treatment of sleep apnea).

Table 4.
Contraindications to testosterone therapy in men

He was counseled about the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy (including the lack of definitive data about the effects on cardiovascular outcomes and prostate cancer) and the absence of high-quality, long-term studies. The patient's main concerns were identified as low libido, reduced energy, and low mood. He was advised that, based on the T-Trials, effects of testosterone treatment on these symptoms should be evident within 3 to 6 months while other benefits (eg, muscle mass and function, bone health) typically take longer. Testosterone formulations (including topical and intramuscular treatment) were discussed. He preferred topical testosterone for a therapeutic trial of 6 months to determine if testosterone therapy would meaningfully improve his symptoms. He agreed that testosterone treatment would be stopped if there was no significant benefit despite normal serum testosterone concentrations during therapy. The discussion about the benefits and risks of testosterone, the goals of therapeutic trial and the plan to discontinue testosterone therapy if these goals were not met were documented in the medical record. Treatment was initiated with a standardized monitoring plan that included follow-up clinic visits to assess for effectiveness and safety at 3 and 6 months with reassessment of the dosage of testosterone based on symptoms and measurement of serum testosterone concentrations and assessment of hematocrit 3 and 6 months after initiation (and increases of dosage) of testosterone.

We recommend against routine screening of men in the general population for hypogonadism. In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114tZLyY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In the population-based European Male Ageing Study, the prevalence of the syndromic association of symptoms of hypogonadism plus low serum testosterone without an identifiable classic HPT axis pathology was determined in men aged 40 to 79 years. Symptoms of hypogonadism were defined as a constellation of low libido, decreased sexual function, and a low serum testosterone. The overall prevalence of this syndrome of androgen-deficiency-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone was 2.1%, and it increased from 0.6% in men 50 to 59 years of age to 5.1% in men 70 to 79 years. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) was associated with a 13-fold increased prevalence compared with normal weight. Likewise, the presence of ≥ 2 comorbidities was associated with a 9-fold increase in the prevalent syndrome of hypogonadism-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone. In the longitudinal follow-up, weight loss was associated with resolution of this syndrome in a significant percentage of the men.

The management of older men with low serum testosterone concentrations is hampered by the fact that many clinical features of androgen deficiency are nonspecific and similar to those associated with obesity or comorbid disease, conditions that are associated with low serum testosterone concentrations. In such men, the conundrum lies in determining the degree to which the (often nonspecific) clinical symptoms are predominantly due to hypogonadism or instead due to obesity and other chronic systemic disorders that suppress the HPT axis (ie, reverse causality). Of note, this assessment is probabilistic rather than deterministic. In many men, this assessment can only be validated during management, by monitoring the response to lifestyle measures, optimization of comorbidities, and in selected cases, a trial of testosterone treatment. However, a trial of testosterone therapy should only be considered when an older man has persistent symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations after a minimum of 6–12 months of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT, including vigorous lifestyle changes for overweight men. It is particularly important to use a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay (if at all possible) when considering a trial of testosterone therapy.

Testosterone and other anabolic steroids — mechanisms, age-related decline, and guidance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Testosterone and its analogs are potent anabolic agents acting to increase muscle protein synthesis and reduce muscle protein breakdown, yielding new muscle mass increases, and these drugs have lipolytic effects, so that FM is decreased. Testosterone levels decline with age (around 1–2% per year), and a significant number of older men have levels below the lower limit of normal for young men. Current endocrine society guidance suggests testosterone supplementation for older men with symptomatic hypogonadism, and reduced muscle mass and function is a common feature of hypogonadism alongside loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of energy and vitality, and reduced bone mineral density and muscle mass.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115dQsiH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — diagnosis, testing, and initial treatment for male hypogonadism states that we recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test, and we recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone–binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula, and in men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism.
