## Question

Exudative pleural fluid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about exudative pleural fluid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining exudative pleural fluid and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria, especially Light's criteria and their limitations. Next, I will review alternative and adjunctive tests, including cholesterol, NT-proBNP, and ultrasound. After that, I need to consider common etiologies and how to prioritize them. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm, special scenarios, and a concise synthesis that ties mechanism, diagnosis, and management together.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Exudative pleural effusions arise from increased pleural permeability and/or impaired lymphatic drainage, producing fluid rich in protein and often inflammatory cells, in contrast to transudates that reflect systemic hydrostatic or oncotic pressure changes. This distinction guides the intensity of diagnostic workup and therapy selection [^95283f7c] [^d6f78c29].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic cornerstone. Light's criteria remain the standard: pleural fluid protein to serum protein ratio greater than 0.5, pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH ratio greater than 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH. Meeting any one criterion classifies the effusion as exudative, with high sensitivity but limited specificity, particularly misclassifying transudates after diuretic therapy [^e1e40a6e] [^585a9d81] [^23ead298].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accuracy without context. I should double-check the misclassification risk. Approximately 25% of transudates, especially in heart failure treated with diuretics, are mislabeled as exudates by Light's criteria, so I need to consider serum–pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients and, when available, pleural NT-proBNP to rescue misclassified cardiac effusions [^23ead298] [^22fddcb2] [^c3088765].

> Next, I should review adjunctive biochemical markers. Pleural cholesterol greater than 55 mg/dL or a pleural-to-serum cholesterol ratio greater than 0.3 provides strong likelihood ratios for exudates and can help when Light's criteria are equivocal, though I need to ensure results are interpreted alongside clinical context and standard tests [^e1e40a6e] [^8a35b8eb] [^998e0d4d].

> I will now examine cardiac biomarkers. Pleural NT-proBNP is highly accurate for identifying heart failure–related effusions misclassified as exudates; a meta-analytic pooled sensitivity and specificity around 94% supports its use when heart failure is suspected, and BTS suggests considering pleural NT-proBNP selectively rather than routinely, given similar performance to serum NT-proBNP in many cases [^c3088765] [^559e223e].

> Let me consider imaging adjuncts. Thoracic ultrasound can suggest exudative features such as septations, echogenicity, or pleural thickening, but I should confirm that ultrasound cannot reliably distinguish all exudates from transudates; a complex-appearing effusion is more likely exudative, yet anechoic effusions can still be exudative, so ultrasound complements but does not replace fluid analysis [^d2f4d04c] [^a34271bc].

> But wait, what if I try to use CT attenuation values to classify effusions. I should double-check that CT Hounsfield units show only modest discrimination and substantial overlap between exudates and transudates, so CT attenuation should not be used as a standalone classifier; morphologic features like pleural thickening or nodularity raise suspicion for exudative or malignant effusions but are not definitive [^6de0e417] [^9ca12c25].

> Next, I should review the etiologic landscape. Common causes of exudative effusions include infection (parapneumonic and empyema), malignancy (lung, breast, lymphoma, mesothelioma), pulmonary embolism, tuberculosis, autoimmune disease, and less common entities such as IgG4-related disease. The relative frequencies vary by geography and population, with TB prominent in endemic regions and malignancy common in older adults [^68a42a58] [^839b57ba] [^f484d1dd].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to suspected malignant effusion. Pleural fluid cytology is the first-line test but has limited sensitivity, around 46–60% overall and lower in mesothelioma; BTS recommends submitting 25–50 mL for cytology and escalating to image-guided pleural biopsy or medical thoracoscopy if cytology is negative but suspicion remains, with thoracoscopy offering diagnostic yields up to 90–95% in experienced hands [^2a1acdea] [^bd8da9c8] [^5e6d0d27].

> I need to ensure I address parapneumonic effusions correctly. Complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyema are suggested by pleural fluid pH less than 7.2, glucose less than 60 mg/dL, LDH greater than 1000 IU/L, or positive Gram stain or culture; these findings should trigger prompt drainage and consideration of intrapleural fibrinolytics to reduce morbidity and mortality [^68a42a58].

> Let me reconsider the role of ADA. Pleural ADA is useful for tuberculous pleural effusion in the right epidemiologic context, with sensitivity around 85–90% and specificity around 85–90%, but levels can be elevated in empyema, lymphoma, and some malignancies; ADA-2 isoform activity improves specificity, and BTS supports ADA use in high-prevalence settings while cautioning against overcalling isolated ADA elevations [^003c67c3] [^70af8c3c].

> I should double-check the practical diagnostic algorithm. Start with clinical assessment and chest radiography, use ultrasound to guide safe thoracentesis and assess complexity, and send fluid for protein, LDH, cell count with differential, pH, glucose, Gram stain, culture, and cytology. Apply Light's criteria, and if heart failure is suspected with discordant results, check serum–pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients and consider pleural NT-proBNP. If cytology is negative but malignancy is suspected, proceed to image-guided pleural biopsy or medical thoracoscopy [^68a42a58] [^559e223e] [^2a1acdea].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked eosinophilic effusions. Eosinophil-rich effusions, defined as at least 10% eosinophils, are uncommon and nonspecific; they can follow air or blood in the pleural space, reflect infection, malignancy, pulmonary embolism, asbestos exposure, or drugs, and should prompt a careful search for underlying causes rather than reassurance [^9b673d9c] [^4996cc9a].

> Let me synthesize. Exudative pleural fluid reflects increased pleural permeability and impaired lymphatic clearance, producing protein-rich effusions that warrant a structured diagnostic workup. Light's criteria remain the first step but misclassify some transudates, so clinicians should integrate gradients, NT-proBNP when cardiac disease is suspected, and selective use of cholesterol or ADA in the right context, while leveraging ultrasound and, when needed, thoracoscopy to secure a definitive diagnosis and guide therapy [^95283f7c] [^e1e40a6e] [^c3088765] [^5e6d0d27].

---

Exudative pleural fluid is defined by **Light's criteria** as pleural fluid with at least one of the following: pleural protein/serum protein > 0.5, pleural LDH/serum LDH > 0.6, or pleural LDH > 2/3 the upper limit of normal serum LDH [^585a9d81]. This profile reflects increased pleural permeability from inflammation, infection, or malignancy, and mandates further diagnostic workup [^d6f78c29]. Common causes include pneumonia, malignancy, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism; initial evaluation should include cell count, differential, glucose, pH, cytology, and cultures, with ADA or IFN-γ in TB-suspected cases [^68a42a58] [^003c67c3]. Management is cause-specific: antibiotics for infection, drainage for empyema, oncologic therapy for malignancy, and anticoagulation for PE [^68a42a58] [^cc9cb905]. Light's criteria are highly sensitive but can misclassify transudates as exudates, especially with diuretics; in such cases, use serum–pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients or pleural NT-proBNP to correct classification [^22fddcb2] [^c3088765].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Light's criteria remain the **standard** for distinguishing exudates from transudates:

| **Criterion** | **Threshold** |
|-|-|
| Pleural fluid protein to serum protein ratio | > 0.5 |
| Pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH ratio | > 0.6 |
| Pleural fluid LDH | > 2/3 upper limit of normal serum LDH |

---

An effusion is exudative if **any one of these criteria is met** [^e1e40a6e]. These criteria maximize sensitivity but can misclassify some transudates as exudates, particularly in heart failure patients receiving diuretics [^23ead298].

---

## Pathophysiology

Exudative effusions arise from **increased capillary permeability** and impaired lymphatic drainage, leading to protein-rich fluid accumulation. Key mechanisms include:

- **Inflammation**: Cytokine-mediated endothelial injury increases permeability.
- **Infection**: Bacterial or mycobacterial invasion causes pleural inflammation.
- **Malignancy**: Tumor invasion or metastasis disrupts normal pleural physiology [^5aa8ddd7].
- **Pulmonary embolism**: Pleural ischemia and inflammation increase permeability [^cc9cb905].

---

## Common etiologies

Exudative pleural effusions have a broad differential; the **most common causes** include:

| **Category** | **Etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Parapneumonic effusions <br/> - Empyema <br/> - Tuberculous pleurisy [^839b57ba] |
| Malignant | - Lung cancer <br/> - Breast cancer <br/> - Lymphoma <br/> - Mesothelioma [^8a2986a4] |
| Autoimmune | - Rheumatoid pleurisy <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus [^a690ceb8] |
| Pulmonary embolism | Pleural effusions from pulmonary embolism [^cc9cb905] |
| Other | - Pancreatitis <br/> - Esophageal rupture <br/> - Post-cardiac injury syndrome [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential:

- **Initial tests**: Cell count with differential, glucose, pH, protein, LDH, cytology, Gram stain, and cultures [^68a42a58].
- **Advanced tests**: ADA or IFN-γ for TB [^003c67c3], NT-proBNP for heart failure [^c3088765], triglycerides for chylothorax, amylase for pancreatitis or esophageal rupture [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, ultrasound, and CT to characterize effusion and guide procedures [^d6f78c29].
- **Pleural biopsy**: Consider if cytology is inconclusive and malignancy or TB is suspected [^dfae281d].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Infectious effusions**: Antibiotics; drain complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyema [^68a42a58].
- **Malignant effusions**: Oncologic therapy, pleural drainage, pleurodesis, or indwelling pleural catheter [^8a2986a4].
- **Tuberculous effusions**: Anti-tuberculous therapy [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary embolism**: Anticoagulation [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

- **Misclassification**: Light's criteria can misclassify transudates as exudates, especially with diuretics; use protein or albumin gradients or NT-proBNP to correct [^22fddcb2] [^c3088765].
- **Low cytology yield**: Malignant effusions may have negative cytology; repeat or biopsy if suspicion remains [^3e4f0049].
- **Multiple etiologies**: Effusions can be multifactorial, requiring careful clinical correlation [^bd52c65b].

---

Exudative pleural fluid reflects increased pleural permeability and requires a **structured diagnostic and cause-directed management** approach. Light's criteria remain the cornerstone, but clinicians should anticipate exceptions and use adjunctive tests to avoid misclassification and ensure accurate diagnosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® workup of pleural effusion or pleural disease [^d6f78c29]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusions are categorized as transudative or exudative, with transudative effusions usually reflecting the sequala of a systemic etiology and exudative effusions usually resulting from a process localized to the pleura. Common causes of transudative pleural effusions include congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure, whereas exudative effusions are typically due to infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders. This document summarizes appropriateness guidelines for imaging in four common clinical scenarios in patients with known or suspected pleural effusion or pleural disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Importance

Thoracentesis is performed to identify the cause of a pleural effusion. Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax.

Objective

To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence.

Data Sources

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection

We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n=48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n=37 studies).

Results

The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1-250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95% CI, 6.8-46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95% CI, 5.5-38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein >0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH >0.6, or pleural fluid LDH >two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02-0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0% of cases (95% CI, 4.0%-7.0%). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0% of procedures (95% CI, 0.99%-2.9%) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08-1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06-5.3).

Conclusions and Relevance

Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults [^1dd1d781]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if the patient meets Light's criteria. The serum to pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients may help better categorize the occasional transudate misidentified as an exudate by these criteria. If the patient has a transudative effusion, therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. If the patient has an exudative effusion, attempts should be made to define the etiology. Pneumonia, cancer, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism account for most exudative effusions. Many pleural fluid tests are useful in the differential diagnosis of exudative effusions. Other tests helpful for diagnosis include helical computed tomography and thoracoscopy.

### Pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism [^cc9cb905]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review highlights both the radiographic and the fluid characteristics of pleural effusions occurring in patients with pulmonary embolism.

Recent Findings

Recent data show that one third of patients with pulmonary embolism have pleural effusions as demonstrated by chest radiograph. By using computed tomography or ultrasonography, pleural effusions have been observed in half of these patients. The effusions occupy one third or less of the hemithorax in 90% of the patients and are unilateral in more than three quarters of them (even if computed tomography is the reference technique). On computed tomography, about 20% of pleural effusions show loculations, which is true particularly in those patients with a delayed diagnosis. Although previously thought to be transudates on occasion, two recent series found that all of the effusions are exudates.

Summary

Pleural effusions associated with pulmonary embolism are usually small, unilateral and exudative when analyzed. If the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is delayed, the effusion may become loculated.

### Diagnostic accuracy of thoracic ultrasonography to differentiate transudative from exudative pleural effusion [^d2f4d04c]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data examining the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic ultrasonography (TUS) in distinguishing transudative from exudative pleural effusions.

Research Question

What is the diagnostic accuracy of TUS in distinguishing transudative from exudative effusions in consecutive patients with pleural effusion?

Study Design and Methods

Consecutive patients who underwent TUS and subsequently a diagnostic thoracentesis with a pleural fluid analysis were identified. TUS images of the pleural effusions were interpreted by previously published criteria. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of TUS findings in predicting a transudative vs exudative pleural effusions and specific pleural diagnoses.

Results

We evaluated 300 consecutive pleural effusions in 285 patients. The pleural effusions were classified as exudative in 229 of 300 cases (76%). TUS showed anechoic effusions in 122 of 300 cases (40%) and complex effusions in 178 of 300 cases (60%). An anechoic appearance on TUS was associated with exudative effusions (68/122; 56%) as compared with transudative effusions (54/122; 44%). The presence of a complex-appearing effusion on TUS was highly predictive of an exudative effusion (positive predictive value of 90%). However, none of the four TUS characteristics were highly specific of a pleural diagnosis.

Interpretation

Thoracic ultrasonography is inadequate to diagnose a transudative pleural effusion reliably. Although the TUS findings of a complex effusion may suggest an exudative pleural effusion, specific pleural diagnoses cannot be predicted confidently.

### Multilevel likelihood ratios for identifying exudative pleural effusions (*) [^9e3ec4af]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine multilevel likelihood ratios for pleural fluid tests that are commonly used to discriminate between exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

Design

Meta-analysis of patient-level data.

Patient Data

Selected studies included patients with diagnoses of exudative or transudative pleural effusions who underwent thoracentesis and laboratory analysis of their pleural fluid.

Measurements and Methods

Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE and related bibliographies. Data were obtained for 1,448 patients from seven primary investigators or extracted from dot plots in published reports. Likelihood ratios were calculated from extracted data stratified across ranges of test result values.

Results

Sufficient data were available to calculate multilevel likelihood ratios for the elements of Light's criteria (pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ratio of pleural fluid to serum LDH, and ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein), pleural fluid protein, ratio of pleural fluid to serum cholesterol, pleural fluid cholesterol, and gradient of pleural fluid to serum albumin. Each of these tests provided levels of likelihood ratios through the most clinically relevant range (0 to 10).

Conclusion

Multilevel likelihood ratios combined with a clinician's estimation of the pretest probability of an exudative effusion improve the diagnostic accuracy of discriminating between exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Likelihood ratios avoid the use of confusing terms, such as "pseudoexudates," that derive from the use of single cutoff points for pleural fluid tests.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^acb8a1e4]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Great progress has been made in building what is now a robust evidence base to inform a number of management strategies in MPE but nonetheless these still primarily focus on optimal drainage strategies. Over the next decade, more upstream research is needed to advance our understanding of the mechanistic drivers of MPE formation on a cellular level. Advances in immunological and intrapleural therapies pose exciting therapeutic directions that may offer targeted pharmacological treatment of MPE and it remains to be seen what effect the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies will have on the incidence of MPE. Early translational work has suggested that pleural fluid may not be an innocent bystander and may have pro-growth properties promoting cancer cell proliferation thus requiring pro-active drainage beyond palliative symptom control. As we increasingly define treatment pathways based on patient preference, there is a need for high quality qualitative data exploring the patient experience along the varied treatment strategies to inform discussions and to empower patients to make informed decisions.

### Pleural disease [^95283f7c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pleural effusion: 
- Definition: Pleural effusion is a disease characterized by pathologic accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
- Pathophysiology: Common causes of pleural effusions include congestive HF, pneumonia, malignancy, and PE.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of pleural effusion in the US is estimated at 400 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- Disease course: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space with resultant pleural irritation and compression atelectasis results in clinical manifestations of dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and dry cough.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: In hospitalized patients, pleural effusion is associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality of 15% and 32%, respectively.

### Incidence of discordant pleural fluid exudates and diagnostic patterns: a retrospective cohort study [^a3bc2bd7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Light's criteria utilises pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to differentiate pleural effusions as exudative or transudative. In a subset of exudative pleural effusions, discordance occurs between LDH and protein (protein high, LDH low or vice versa). Research QuestionWhat is the incidence and diagnostic profile associated with discordant pleural fluid biochemistry?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 995 pleural fluid samples between 2015-2017 from a UK tertiary centre. Exudates were subdivided into concordant or discordant, with low protein defined as <30g/L and low LDH <170IU/L. Demographics and diagnostic patterns were assessed in both groups. Demographics and diagnostic patterns were assessed in both groups. Chi-squared tests and odds ratios (+/- 95% confidence interval) were calculated for each diagnosis between discordant and concordant pleural effusions, and adjusted ORs calculated using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

In 715 exudative pleural fluid samples, 229 (32%) were discordant. 85 (37%) of these displayed low protein, with high LDH, and 144 (63%) low LDH with high protein. The median age was higher in the discordant group than the concordant group (75 versus 70 years, p=0.01). The proportion of patients with the following diagnoses were significantly higher in the discordant group compared to concordant: fluid overload (24/229, 10% discordant vs 10/486, 2% concordant, p<0.0001), benign asbestos related pleural effusion (33/229, 14% vs 44/486, 9%, p=0.031) and ICU associated effusion (20/229, 9% vs 15/486, 3%, p=0.001). The following were less frequent in the discordant group: pleural infection (14/229, 6% vs 79/486, 16%, p<0.0001), and malignant pleural effusion (77/229 34% vs 206/486, 42%, p=0.025). These patterns were maintained when adjusting for age and sex.

Interpretation

Discordant pleural effusions are common, and represent a biologically distinct entity with different diagnostic patterns compared to concordant effusions. Clinicians should assess for discordance early and tailor investigations accordingly.

### Malignant pleural effusion: presentation, diagnosis, and management [^8a2986a4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with cancer. Most malignant pleural effusions are secondary to metastases to the pleura, most often from lung or breast cancer. The presence of malignant effusion indicates advanced disease and poor survival; in lung cancer, the presence of malignant effusion upstages the cancer to stage 4. Usually presenting as a large, unilateral exudative effusion, most patients with malignant pleural effusion experience dyspnea. Prior to intervention, diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and exclusion of infection should be made. Thoracic imaging is typically performed, with computed tomography considered by many to be the gold standard. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful, particularly if diaphragmatic or pleural thickening and nodularity can be identified. Cytology should then be obtained; this is typically done via pleural fluid aspiration or pleural biopsy. Treatment focuses on palliation and relief of symptoms. Numerous interventions are available, ranging from drainage with thoracentesis or indwelling pleural catheter to more definitive, invasive options such as pleurodesis. There is no clear best approach, and a patient-centered approach should be taken.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^68a42a58]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

### The use of non-routine pleural fluid analysis in the diagnosis of pleural effusion [^6cbd4409]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The investigation of a pleural effusion is, in general, a very straight forward process with the combination of clinical history, examination, radiology and pleural fluid analysis leading to diagnosis in most cases. While most fluid samples are sent for routine analysis including protein, LDH, glucose, cytology and microbiology, there are a number of more unusual fluid analyses available which in some cases directly lead to, and in others are suggestive of the diagnosis. Moreover, other fluid markers are constantly being evaluated as a diagnostic tool. In this review, we describe these non-routine pleural fluid analyses in detail. English language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1 1990 to August 1 2009 were reviewed. Keywords searched in combination were pleural fluid, effusion, analysis, transudate, exudate and diagnosis.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^f484d1dd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The causes of exudative pleural effusions are diverse and frequently remain unclear despite exhaustive examinations. Recently recognized IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a fibroinflammatory disorder that can affect nearly any organ including the lungs. This review will focus on the involvement of IgG4 in exudative pleural effusion of unknown cause.

Recent Findings

IgG4 is found to be involved in a proportion of patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions. Pleural involvement in IgG4-RD can be seen in isolation or association with other organ disease. Pleural thickening and/or effusion are common clinical features of IgG4-related pleural lesions, and this condition is histologically characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells in the pleura. Although the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD is poorly understood, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates an antigen-driven process requiring T-cell and B-cell interaction in which autoantibodies, plasmablasts, follicular helper T cells and CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes participate.

Summary

The possibility of IgG4-related pleural lesion should be considered in patients with pleural effusion of unexplained cause when lymphoplasmacytic infiltration is seen in a pleural biopsy specimen. This condition is responsive to systemic steroid therapy.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^8a35b8eb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

The present meta-analysis was performed using the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews, as well as the Meta-analysis Statement and methods recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group. Institutional review board approval was not required for this retrospective meta-analysis.

Two investigators (YCS and HZ) searched in PUBMED and EMBASE for relevant articles published up to October 2013 in which the following search terms were used as Medical Headings and/or text words: “cholesterol”, “pleural effusion”, and “pleural fluid”. The syntax for the PUBMED searches was as follows: “pleural effusion” OR “pleural fluid” AND “cholesterol”. Reference lists of the included studies and review articles were also checked to identify additional studies.

Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) they were original research articles published in English; (2) they examined the ability of pleural cholesterol level or P/S cholesterol ratio for differentiating pleural transudates and exudates in humans; and (3) they reported sufficient data to allow calculation of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN) rates. Conference proceedings and studies published only as abstracts were excluded. To avoid selection bias, we also excluded studies involving fewer than 20 patients.

Two reviewers (LC and TW) independently identified eligible studies and extracted data, with which they prepared 2 × 2 tables of diagnostic performance. In case of disagreement, the two reviewers arrived at a consensus. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the 14-items Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) list.

Using bivariate regression, we calculated pooled estimates of sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) as the main outcome measures, and we constructed summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves. The bivariate approach investigates potential between-study heterogeneity and takes into account possible correlation between SEN and SPE. Based on the pooled estimates of SEN and SPE, we calculated positive likelihood ratios (PLR) and negative likelihood ratios (NLR). SEN and SPE estimates were paired to generate diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), which we used as an overall index of diagnostic accuracy. DOR relates the odds of positive test results in those with the condition with the odds of positive test results in those without the condition.

### Is it meaningful to use biochemical parameters to discriminate between transudative and exudative pleural effusions? [^2569841b]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The usefulness of biochemical criteria to separate pleural transudates from exudates is controversial, and the limitations of Light's criteria in patients receiving diuretic therapy is of general concern. We evaluated the added value of biochemical criteria to clinical judgment for separating transudates from exudates.

Setting

A community teaching hospital.

Design

A prospective, observational study for the evaluation of diagnostic tests.

Patients and Measurements

In 249 consecutive patients referred for diagnostic thoracentesis, two physicians classified the pleural effusion as transudate or exudate based on all available information just before performing the thoracentesis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the clinical presumption were compared with those of Light's criteria, and serum-pleural fluid albumin and protein gradients. The combined accuracy of biochemical and clinical criteria was also assessed.

Results

The accuracy of Light's criteria (93%) was significantly higher than that showed by the initial clinical presumption (84%; p < 0.01) and that of the alternative biochemical criteria: serum-pleural fluid albumin gradient (87%; p < 0.03) and serum-pleural fluid protein gradient (86%; p < 0.01). In patients receiving diuretic therapy, the accuracy of Light's criteria was 83% (60 of 72 cases), neither different to that of the albumin gradient (88%; 63 of 72 cases) nor to that of the protein gradient (86%; 62 of 72 cases). When these alternative biochemical criteria were applied exclusively to patients receiving diuretics who were thought to have a transudative effusion by clinical criteria, but having fluid identified as exudative by Light's criteria, the results did not improve significantly. Using a multiparametric model for the population receiving diuretics, the accuracy was greater (93%; 67 of 72 cases) than that of Light's criteria but without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.12).

Conclusions

Light's criteria are significantly superior to the clinical presumption to separate pleural transudates from exudates. In patients receiving diuretics, Light's criteria lose accuracy, which is similar to that showed by the use of alternative biochemical criteria alone or combined with clinical judgment.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^54d6df59]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The findings of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution because of several limitations. While our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria may have helped reduce selection bias, they led to a relatively small final set of studies for which statistical power may be inadequate for drawing definitive conclusions about the ability of pleural cholesterol levels to discriminate between exudates and transudates. For example, we included only studies published in English in a relatively small number of databases. Our results may be biased by our omission of unpublished studies, studies published in other languages and studies published in journals not indexed in the databases we searched.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^5de689dc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion often develops in patients with thoracic or systemic diseases. Such effusion has traditionally been classified as transudate or exudate based on the etiology and underlying pathology, and differentiating the two types of pleural effusion is critical for guiding treatment. Transudates are usually taken as a sign of underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis, which then becomes the focus of treatment. Because in the case of a transudate, aetiology and therapy are directed to the underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Alternatively, exudates are usually taken as a sign of, inflammatory disorders or malignancy, leading to more extensive diagnostic procedures.

The criteria most widely used to differentiate exudates and transudates in patients with pleural effusions are Light's criteria, established by Light et al. in 1972. These criteria rely on levels of total protein and of lactate dehydrogenase. The criteria maximize sensitivity at the expense of specificity: they typically identify 98% of pleural exudates, but they misclassify approximately 25% of transudates as exudates. As a result, patients misclassified with exudate undergo unnecessary and risky invasive diagnostic procedures, such as thoracoscopic pleural biopsy and image-guided percutaneous pleural biopsy. This highlights the need to develop better methods to differentiate exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

Since Light's criteria were published in 1972, pleural cholesterol levels have been explored for their usefulness in diagnosing pleural exudates. Cellular degeneration and vascular leakage due to increased permeability are thought to elevate pleural cholesterol levels. Several studies suggest that pleural cholesterol is increased in pleural exudates, making it a potential biomarker for differentiating exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Studies have come to conflicting conclusions about whether pleural cholesterol levels can provide adequate differentiating power, and other studies have explored the diagnostic potential of the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) and come to similarly conflicting conclusions. To help gain more reliable insights, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol level or the P/S cholesterol ratio to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^e8056d2f]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we have learned a great deal about the mechanisms and optimal management of malignant pleural effusion via research over the last 20 years. However, much remains unknown and further research is indicated across a number of areas, to better understand underlying biology of pleural fluid production and, thus, to achieve more targeted therapies.

Diagnosis of MPE has significantly advanced and will do further with more sensitive molecular techniques including the so called “liquid biopsy”. However, as pleural fluid cytology alone is poorly sensitive, and even when positive is often insufficient to provide full enough oncological information for treatment, nowadays biopsy remains a key investigation in the work up of potential MPE.

Our understanding of optimal treatment intervention in MPE has been greatly advanced by recent high quality randomised trials and there are a number of potential options. In future years, it is likely that combined diagnostic and therapeutic procedures allowing near total outpatient management of MPE will become popular – but such innovations require high quality evidence to assess their patient focused and diagnostic benefits and risks.

### Pathogenesis of the eosinophilic pleural effusions [^9b673d9c]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Eosinophilic pleural effusions (EPE) are defined as those that contain at least 10% eosinophils. EPEs account for 5 to 16% of exudative pleural effusions. However, their pathogenesis is poorly understood. The purpose of this review is to discuss the mechanisms that lead to eosinophilic pleural inflammation.

Recent Findings

Eosinophilic pleural effusions are caused by the presence of air or blood or both in the pleural space, infectious or other inflammatory diseases, malignancy, pulmonary emboli, asbestos exposure, and drug reactions. Differences in the clinical features suggest that a variety of mechanisms operate to induce eosinophilic pleural inflammation and pleural fluid accumulation. Human and animal studies indicate that interleukin (IL)-5 is an important common contributor of different pathogenetic pathways. The possible role of other cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in the development of EPE is under investigation.

Summary

Understanding the pathogenesis of EPE will permit the development of novel therapies for the persistent, symptomatic, posttraumatic and idiopathic EPE. Anti-IL-5 treatment is an interesting option that requires further research.

Diagnostic accuracy of the P/S cholesterol ratio

A total of 13 studies with 2,297 subjects examined the ability of the P/S cholesterol ratio to distinguish exudates from transudates. Table 3 summarizes the SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR, and DOR, while Figure 5 shows the SROC curve. The AUC was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98), suggesting high overall accuracy.

Investigations of heterogeneity and publication bias

Significant heterogeneity was identified among included studies, so we performed subgroup analysis to investigate the possible sources of this heterogeneity. Table 4 summarizes the influence of certain covariates on the SEN and SPE. SPE was significantly higher with some covariates, such as QUADAS score or blinding. However, these covariates did not significantly affect SEN. Deeks’ funnel plot asymmetry test was used to assess likelihood of publication bias in the final set of studies. The slope coefficient was associated with a P value of 0.50, suggesting symmetry in the data and low likelihood of such bias (Figure 6).

### Uniportal VATS pleural biopsy in the diagnosis of exudative pleural effusion: awake or intubated? [^5a03229b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions may develop in many different conditions and the most common causes in developed countries are congestive heart failure, pneumonia and malignancy, respectively. It is estimated that 1.5 million patients suffer from pleural effusion per year. To determine the etiology of pleural fluid, firstly, biochemical, cytological and microbiological analysis of the fluid is required by thoracentesis; however, this procedure allows diagnosis in only about 75–60% of cases. The second step diagnostic procedure in negative pleural effusions of unknown causes is conventional ‘blind’ pleural biopsy, i.e. non-image guided pleural biopsy. This procedure is inexpensive, easy to apply and still used in many institutions. The use of ‘blind’ pleural biopsy increases the diagnostic efficiency of malignant pleural fluid cytology by 7–27%. However, 20–40% of patients with exudative pleural effusion cannot be diagnosed by recurrent thoracentesis and ‘blind’ pleural biopsy. Image guided (computed tomography or ultrasound) pleural biopsy has been shown to have a diagnostic efficiency of 76–85% in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions.

### Pleural effusions: the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates [^585a9d81]. Annals of Internal Medicine (1972). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Light's Criteria for Exudative Effusions" for parapneumonic effusion and empyema and pleural effusion.

Light's Criteria for Exudative Effusions is a diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of pleural effusions. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with pleural effusion, a condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. The primary clinical utility of Light's Criteria is to differentiate between exudative and transudative pleural effusions, which is crucial in determining the underlying cause of the effusion and guiding subsequent management strategies. 

The criteria include three parameters: the ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein, the ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH, and the absolute value of pleural fluid LDH. An effusion is classified as exudative if one or more of the following conditions are met: the pleural fluid to serum protein ratio is greater than 0.5, the pleural fluid to serum LDH ratio is greater than 0.6, or the pleural fluid LDH exceeds two-thirds of the upper limit of normal serum LDH.

### Is the pleural fluid transudate or exudate? A revisit of the diagnostic criteria [^c324f6b8]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions are classified into transudates and exudates based on criteria developed in the 1970s. However, their accuracy has not been evaluated. We compared the performance of the pleural fluid absolute lactic dehydrogenase level (FLDH), fluid to serum ratio of LDH (LDHR), and fluid to serum ratio of total protein (TPR). TPR has been used instead of the absolute value of fluid protein based on the observation that fluid protein is influenced by changes in the serum protein concentration. However, the rationale for using LDHR remains unexplored.

Methods

Of 212 consecutive patients with pleural effusions, four with multiple causes and eight with an uncertain diagnosis were excluded. ROC curves were generated using sensitivity and 1-specificity values for TPR, FLDH, and LDHR and positive likelihood ratios (LR+ve) were computed using the optimum cut off values. The correlation between pleural fluid and serum concentrations of total protein and LDH was also estimated.

Results

Of 200 effusions studied, 156 were exudates and 44 were transudates. The optimum cut off levels were: FLDH 163 IU/l, TPR 0.5, LDHR 0.6, and the FLDH-TPR combination 163 and 0.4, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was: 0.89 (0.86 to 0.96) for FLDH, 0.86 (0.80 to 0.91) for TPR, 0.82 (0.77 to 0.89) for LDHR, and 0.90 (0.86 to 95) for FLDH-TPR. A significant correlation was observed between serum and pleural fluid protein levels in transudates and exudates (r=0.5 and 0.6, respectively), but the correlation between serum and pleural fluid LDH levels was insignificant.

Conclusion

FLDH is the most accurate marker for the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates and LDHR has no role in this process. Combining TPR with FLDH appears to improve the diagnostic accuracy slightly.

### Pleural fluid analysis: maximizing diagnostic yield in the pleural effusion evaluation [^4b2c99d7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Establishing the cause of a pleural effusion can be challenging. Analysis of pleural fluid is a powerful tool to determine the etiology of a pleural effusion. Surprisingly, despite the diagnostic power pleural fluid analysis (PFA), it is often underused. The purpose of this review is to provide a practical framework to maximize the diagnostic potential of the PFA. In this manuscript we will describe the role of a PFA in establishing the cause of a pleural effusion. We will also discuss challenges and limitations of PFA.

### Diagnostic accuracy of thoracic CT to differentiate transudative from exudative pleural effusion prior to thoracentesis [^60e0de27]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion is the pathologic accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, a closed space between the parietal and visceral pleura, due to numerous pathologic conditions with increased production (and/or a reduction in reabsorption) of pleural fluid (PF), including heart failure, lung infection, malignant tumors, collagen vascular disease, trauma, and so forth. The first step in the evaluation of PF is to distinguish exudative from transudative effusion. For the past several decades, exudative effusion has been differentiated from transudative effusion using Light’s criteria, which requires detection of protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the PF through thoracentesis. The goal of the initial thoracentesis is to determine the presence of exudate and alleviate dyspnea (if present). If the etiology of the pleural effusion favors leakage and there is supportive clinical history, such as heart failure, nephrotic syndrome or liver cirrhosis, thoracentesis may be postponed until it is clear whether the pleural effusion can be treated concurrently with direct treatment of the underlying disease. Therefore, accurate prediction of pleural effusion diagnosis before thoracentesis will have great influence on treatment method.

Morphologic features evaluated by computed tomography (CT), such as pleural thickening, pleural nodules, loculation and effusion density, and extrapleural fat tissue thickness, may aid in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusions. Accumulating evidence have shown that anemia can be detected on unenhanced CT of the thorax, based on density change of blood reflected by quantitative analysis of CT values. Moreover, an obvious linear correlation of hemoglobin concentration and CT attenuation has also been clearly demonstrated. Accordingly, it is reasonable to speculate that density differences between exudative and transudative effusions can be detected by CT value measurement. Indeed, several studies have evaluated the efficacy of CT value to differentiate transudative from exudative pleural effusion [,–]. Nevertheless, results from these studies are inconsistent or contradictory. Thus, in current study, we aim to investigate the diagnostic value of CT in distinguishing exudative and transudative effusions. Furthermore, we also assessed the strength of correlation between CT value and patients’ protein and LDH level in PF.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^998e0d4d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have investigated whether pleural cholesterol levels can aid in diagnosis of pleural exudates, and the results have varied considerably. To gain a more reliable answer to this question, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol or the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) as diagnostic tests to help identify pleural exudates.

Methods

Literature databases were systematically searched for studies examining accuracy of pleural cholesterol or P/S cholesterol ratios for diagnosing pleural exudates. Data on sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (PLR/NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled using bivariate-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to summarize overall test performance.

Results

Our meta-analysis included up to 20 studies involving 3,496 subjects. Summary estimates for pleural cholesterol in the diagnosis of pleural exudates were as follows: sensitivity, 0.88 (95%CI 0.84 to 0.92); specificity, 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98); PLR, 20.31 (95% CI 11.21 to 36.78); NLR, 0.12 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.17); DOR, 167.06 (95% CI 76.79 to 363.95); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98). The corresponding summary performance estimates for using the P/S cholesterol ratio were as follows: sensitivity, 0.94 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.96); specificity, 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.91); PLR 7.46 (95% CI, 5.47 to 10.19); NLR, 0.07 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.10); DOR, 107.74 (95% CI 60.91 to 190.60); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98).

Conclusions

Both pleural cholesterol level and the P/S cholesterol ratio are helpful for the diagnosis of pleural exudates. Nevertheless, the results of pleural cholesterol assays should be interpreted in parallel with the results of traditional tests and clinical information.

Statistical analysis

Categorical and continuous values were expressed as frequency (percentage) and mean ± SD or median. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and all other clinical characteristics of the study subjects. The primary outcome variable was to evaluate and assess the outcome and complications rate secondary to medical thoracoscopy and enlist causes of exudative effusions. Associations between two or more qualitative variables were assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher Exact test as appropriate. Relationship between two quantitative variables was examined using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. A 2-sided P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, Illinois).

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer pleural effusion and metastatic disease confirmation—Patients with lung cancer with an associated pleural effusion should undergo thoracentesis and cytology. A negative pleural cytology result does not exclude pleural involvement. Thoracoscopic evaluation of the pleura should be considered before starting curative intent therapy if pleural fluid is a lymphocytic exudate with negative pleural fluid cytology. Patients suspected of having a solitary site of metastatic disease should have tissue confirmation of that site if feasible. Patients suspected of having metastatic disease should have confirmation from one of the metastatic sites if feasible. Patients who may have multiple sites of metastatic disease—based on a strong clinical suspicion—should have biopsy of the primary lung lesion or mediastinal lymph nodes if it is technically difficult or very risky to biopsy a metastatic site. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Pleural disease | NEJM resident 360 (...) [^23ead298]. resident360.nejm.org (2018). Low credibility.

According to Light’s criteria, a patient is considered to have an exudative effusion when any one of the following findings is present: a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein higher than 0. 5, a ratio of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase level to serum LDH level higher than
0. 6, or a pleural fluid LDH level higher than 200 IU per liter. Clinical Pearls Q: Do Light’s criteria fully distinguish transudates from exudates. A: The use of Light’s criteria for differentiating exudative from transudative effusion, initially described in 1972, has remained the standard method over the past 45 years. Although these criteria correctly identify nearly all exudates, approximately 25% of transudates are misclassified as exudates, especially in patients who have underlying congestive heart failure and have received diuretics. Q: Does the presence of parapneumonic effusion affect mortality risk.

A: The most common exudative effusions are those associated with an underlying pneumonia, so-called parapneumonic effusions. Despite advances in the treatment of pneumonia, mortality is higher among patients who have an associated parapneumonic effusion than among patients with pneumonia and no effusion, and delays in drainage are associated with substantially higher mortality. A: Malignant pleural effusion is associated with a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 4 to 7 months from the time of diagnosis. If the patient does not feel better after a therapeutic large-volume thoracentesis, something else is causing the dyspnea. When patients with a pneumothorax are treated with chest tubes, the lung usually expands and the air leak ceases within 3 days. If the lung does not expand fully within 3 to 5 days, consideration should be given to thoracoscopy.

At thoracoscopy, blebs are stapled and an effort is made to create a pleurodesis, usually with pleural abrasion. The valves are then removed after the pleural defect has healed, typically in 6 weeks. After a patient has had a spontaneous pneumothorax, the likelihood of a recurrence exceeds 50%.

### Incidence, aetiology and clinical features of eosinophilic pleural effusion: a retrospective study [^4996cc9a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic pleural effusion (EPE) was first described by Harmsen in 1894. Since then, it has been of interest to clinicians. EPE, defined as a pleural effusion (PE) in which eosinophils comprise ≥ 10% of white blood cells (WBCs), accounts for 5–16% of exudative pleural effusions.

The diagnostic value and prognostic significance of EPE are still a matter of debate, as it can be a manifestation of a great variety of diseases including infections (bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, parasites), malignancies, autoimmune diseases, drug reactions, pulmonary embolism, chest trauma, asbestos exposure and many others. Early studies reported that air/blood was the most common cause of EPE (29%), and it was once believed that the finding of pleural fluid eosinophilia in an exudative effusion considerably reduced the probability of malignancy and conversely increased the likelihood of an underlying benign disorder. However, current studies, performed in the last 2 decades, have confirmed that malignancy accounts for 22.7- 40.1% of EPEs and is the most common aetiology of EPEs. This disparity could probably be explained by different study populations, and the various disease spectra of EPEs were a reflection of the populations studied.

Due to the rarity of EPE, our knowledge of this phenomenon is based on small series and case reports until now. We are aware of no related report in China. We performed an analysis of a series of samples of PE in our institution. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, aetiology and epidemic characteristics of EPE in our institution.

### A simple laboratory measurement for discrimination of transudative and exudative pleural effusion: pleural viscosity [^443fe6fa]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The initial step in establishing the cause of an effusion is to determine whether the fluid is a transudate or exudate. Plasma viscosity is influenced by the concentration of plasma proteins and lipoproteins with the major contribution resulting from fibrinogen. In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of pleural fluid viscosity in discrimination of transudate and exudates.

Materials and Methods

We studied prospectively 63 consecutive patients with pleural effusion in whom diagnostic or therapeutic thoracentesis had been performed. The criteria of Light were applied to differentiate transudates from exudates: 33 patients (23 male, 13 female, mean age=68+/-4 years) had exudates and 30 patients (17 male, 13 female, mean age=68+/-5) had transudates (due to congestive heart failure). Measurements of pleural fluid and plasma viscosity were performed using a viscometer.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference between patients with transudate and exudates in respect to plasma viscosity. However, pleural viscosities of the patients with exudates were significantly higher than those of patients with transudate (1.37+/-0.16 mPa vs 0.93+/-0.03 mPa s p<0.001, respectively). Pleural viscosity has a high sensitivity, specificity (94%, 93%, respectively), positive and negative predictive value (97%, 97%, respectively) for the discrimination of transudative or exudatetive pleural fluid.

Conclusion

We have demonstrated for the first time that pleural viscosity of the exudative effusion is higher than that of transudative effusion with high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. Regarding the simplicity of this measurement, it may play a valuable role in the accurate and fast discrimination of pleural fluid.

### Malignant pleural effusion: tumor-host interactions unleashed [^af2e0c56]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) poses a significant clinical problem. Current nonetiologic management is suboptimal in terms of efficacy and safety. In light of recent research progress, we propose herein a new view of MPE development, which may rapidly translate into meaningful changes in therapeutics. In addition to tumor-induced impairment of pleural fluid drainage, pertinent findings point toward another pathway to MPE formation: a vicious loop of interactions between pleural-based tumor cells and the host vasculature and immune system that results in increased net fluid production via enhanced plasma extravasation into the pleural space. The ability of tumor cells to trigger this cascade likely rests on a specific and distinct transcriptional repertoire, which results in important vasoactive events in the pleural space. Although the characterization of tumor-derived factors responsible for MPE development is in the making, an additional, indirect path to MPE was recently demonstrated: tumor cells recruit and co-opt host cells and mediators, which, in turn, amplify tumor cell-primed fluid leakage and impact tumor cell functions. Importantly, recent evidence suggests that the biologic events that culminate in clinical MPE are likely amenable to therapeutic inhibition and even prevention. In this perspective, the scientific basis for an update of current concepts of MPE formation is highlighted. Key questions for future research are posed. Finally, a vision for novel, effective, safe, and convenient treatment modalities that can be offered to outpatients with MPE is set forth.

We conducted a review of 22 consecutive patients undergoing VAD placement from August 2004 to January 2006. The clinical course of pleural effusions and their biochemical characteristics were studied by reviewing the patient charts and radiographs.

Results

Six of the 22 patients (18%) had pleural effusion before VAD placement. All 22 patients had effusions after VAD placement, with the majority being left sided (23%) or bilateral with left-sided predominance (41%). Four patients had large effusion, nine patients had moderate-sized effusions, and nine patients had small effusions. Nine patients (41%) required thoracentesis to relieve dyspnea. All were noted to have blood-tinged pleural fluid, and removal resulted in relief of dyspnea and improvement of clinical status. Seven patients had their pleural fluid examined in detail, and all met criteria for an exudate. No complications were experienced from thoracentesis.

Conclusions

Although pleural effusion is commonly seen in patients after VAD placement, this is the first study to examine the effusions in detail. In our series, pleural effusions developed in all patients, and most were either on the left side or bilateral. Those sampled were exudative in nature, blood tinged, and lymphocyte predominant. Drainage resulted in improvement in symptoms and was accomplished without complications.

### The accuracy of thoracic ultrasound in differentiating transudative from exudative effusions: a meta-analysis [^a34271bc]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Literature on the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic ultrasound (TUS) in differentiating transudates from exudates is sparse. We sought to summarize available evidence on the accuracy of TUS at distinguishing between transudative and exudative pleural effusions STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We included studies of patients with pleural effusions who underwent TUS and a thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis. We performed meta-analyses using a bivariate model to estimate and compare summary sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots were created to visualize the overall diagnostic accuracy of TUS for complex and anechoic patterns.

Results

We included five studies in the final analysis. A total of 1,422 effusions were included in the final analysis (491 anechoic transudates, 300 anechoic exudates, 34 echogenic transudates, and 597 echogenic exudates). An echogenic TUS pattern for detecting an exudate demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.82) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.99), with a diagnostic odds ratio of 34.82 (95% CI 4.23 to 286.42). The overall performance showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 and a partial AUC (pAUC) of 0.77. Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (I 2 = 90.9% for sensitivity and 91.9% for specificity).

Interpretation

An echogenic TUS pattern can reliably identify an exudative effusion, but an anechoic TUS pattern cannot reliably identify a transudative effusion. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, thoracentesis and pleural fluid analysis are still needed to correctly classify the effusion.

### Pleural effusions as markers of mortality and disease severity: a state-of-the-art review [^b0272414]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions are common and are the result of various etiologies. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) has a known high mortality, but there is also increasing evidence that patients with benign pleural effusions also have a poor prognosis. This review will discuss the most recent literature on mortality and prognostication in patients with pleural effusion.

Recent Findings

Survival in patients with MPE is influenced by many factors, the most significant of which are underlying tumor type, performance score, and markers of systemic inflammation. Prognostic models have been developed for patients with both MPE and those with pleural infection to aid with treatment decision-making and patient counseling. Patients with benign pleural effusions may benefit from more definitive treatment of their pleural effusion as opposed to repeated thoracentesis.

Summary

Both benign and MPEs are associated with high mortality. Prognostic models and studies comparing treatment modality effect on survival will continue to guide management of these complex problems.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^6ed4210f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pleural effusion is a common presentation, originating from a wide range of disorders, including congestive cardiac failure, pneumonia and cancer. The cause of a pleural effusion frequently remains unclear after thoracentesis. Light's criteria are used to help differentiate exudates from transudates by measuring the protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in the pleural fluid and the serum, and algorithms for the investigation of exudative pleural effusion have been developed [,–]. Nonetheless, the cause of exudative effusion remains uncertain in a substantial percentage of patients with lymphocytic pleural effusion after extensive examinations including thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Approximately 30% of cases of exudative pleural effusion are reported to be diagnosed with nonspecific pleuritis, that is no specific diagnosis, even after a complete investigation including thoracoscopy, and 12–15% of nonspecific pleuritis are ultimately diagnosed with pleural malignancy after a mean interval between thoracoscopy and the final diagnosis of 4.4–9.8 months. Therefore, 12–16 months of follow-up is suggested following thoracoscopy for patients with nonspecific pleuritis to exclude malignancy ; however, unexplained pleural effusions often present a management dilemma for clinicians because of ongoing uncertainty about the possibility of a false-negative result from sampling error. In addition, the clinical course of such pleural effusions varies, for example resolving, persistent and progressive. Hence, new approaches are needed to detect their causes. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a fibroinflammatory disorder of uncertain cause that affects various organs including the pleura. Several lines of evidence indicate that IgG4-RD accounts for a proportion of patients with pleural effusions of idiopathic cause.

### The separation of transudates and exudates with particular reference to the protein gradient [^431aec45]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The separation of pleural transudates from exudates, as the first step in the study of pleural effusions of unknown cause, is generally accepted as a useful practice. However, the optimal way to do this remains moot.

Recent Findings

New and more sophisticated biochemical markers have been proposed together, with new approaches to the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, new studies have consolidated the criteria of Light et al. as those with a better accuracy. Effective diuresis increases the concentration of most pleural biochemical parameters used to differentiate transudates from exudates and appears as the main cause of the failures of this dichotomic approach. Among the alternative criteria proposed for identifying transudates in the setting of diuresis, the total protein gradient between serum and pleural fluid seems to be the most cost effective.

Summary

Together with clinical judgment, the use of biochemical criteria seems mandatory. The criteria of Light et al. remain those of election. In the setting of effective diuresis, the use of the protein gradient is recommended. Although new and more sophisticated markers have been tested, it seems that looking for the causes of misclassification, when applying the criteria that to date have shown better efficiency, deserves preferential investigation.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^78887094]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusions are a common entity, and although around a third are due to malignancy,there is a wide differential diagnosis. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Pleural Disease guidelines recommend initial pleural aspiration,often of large volume to relieve breathlessness, before proceeding to further investigations and potentially definitive treatments. Aspiration is recommended when a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is suspected in order to obtain biochemical parameters (which may identify alternative diagnoses), provide cytology to confirm diagnosis and guide oncological treatment, and to identify both non-expansile lung (NEL) and those who experience symptomatic benefit, informing further pleural management choices.

Pleural fluid (PF) biochemistry allows the differentiation of transudate and exudate and identifies pleural inflammation. Although MPE is commonly considered to be exclusively exudative, case series have demonstrated transudates in 5% of cases.Biochemical parameters do not reliably differentiate between pleural infection and inflammatory MPE, with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low glucose and low pH well recognised in either diagnosis.

PF cytology has a diagnostic sensitivity of around 60%; however, with the expansion of personalised oncological treatments which require specific molecular testing, insufficient information may be derived from a single cytology sample. Tsim et al demonstrated that testing was ‘incomplete’ (ie, insufficient material to permit molecular testing) in 47% of cytology positive effusions. In patients with a CT scan suggestive of malignancy, the OR for a malignant diagnosis with negative cytology was 2.25, but specific malignant radiological features were not assessed.

Large volume aspiration may reveal the presence of NEL, where insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) is preferable to attempting pleurodesis as definitive pleural management.Therapeutic aspiration confirms symptomatic benefit from the pleural procedure. Psallidas et al showed that 85.7% of patients experienced a clinically significant symptomatic benefit after fluid drainage but it was not possible to predict which patients would not experience symptomatic relief.

### Pleural effusions in superior vena cava syndrome: prevalence, characteristics, and proposed pathophysiology [^b2e1cee4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights recent data detailing the prevalence and characteristics of pleural effusions occurring in patients with superior vena cava syndrome.

Recent Findings

Numerous case reports have described pleural effusions in conjunction with the superior vena cava syndrome. Recent data suggest that these effusions occur in 60% of superior vena cava syndrome cases. The effusions are small, usually occupying less than half the affected hemi-thorax, and occur about equally on either side or bilaterally. Although previously thought to be largely transudates, a large case series found that 18% of the effusions were chylous, with the remainder being exudates. None of the effusions sampled in the series were transudates. Occluded lymphatic flow from increased hydrostatic pressure in the superior vena cava and left brachiocephalic vein probably contributes to the development of chylous pleural fluid. The pathophysiology of the exudative effusions, however, remains unknown. Many factors, including diuresis, small pulmonary emboli, and the underlying inflammatory or malignant condition all likely contribute.

Summary

Chylous or exudative pleural effusions occur in most patients with superior vena cava syndrome. The effusions are usually small and resolve upon correction of the underlying superior vena cava obstruction.

### The evaluation of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure [^da3196ac]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the causes of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure, and the association of the characteristics of these statistics with the use of diuretics.

Subjects and Methods

Eighty-one patients with a definite diagnosis of heart failure who underwent thoracentesis were evaluated. Fluids were classified as transudates or exudates using Light's criteria.

Results

Forty-one effusions (in 34 patients) were transudates, and 54 (in 47 patients) were exudates. A specific cause was found for 32 of the exudates (27 patients); except for heart failure, no obvious cause was found for the remaining 22 fluids (20 patients). Exudates with a specific cause for an exudate were more likely to have at least two of Light's criteria (18 of 27 [67%]) than did exudates without a known cause (2 of 21 [10%]). Intravenous diuretic therapy in the 24 hours before thoracentesis was significantly more common among patients with exudates without a specific cause.

Conclusions

Patients with heart failure may have exudative pleural effusions without an obvious cause except heart failure.

Pathogenesis of malignant pleural effusion

Pleural invasion of malignancy

Although the pleura may be invaded through lymphangitic spread or by the infiltration from adjacent structures (i.e. diaphragm, pericardium, chest wall), data from autopsy studies showed that tumor cells spread to the pleura mainly by the bloodstream, initially invading the visceral pleura. Therefore, secondary diffusion to the parietal pleural occurs by tumor seeding along adhesions or by exfoliated malignant cells floating in the fluid. Once arrived at the parietal pleura, tumor cells adhere to the mesothelium, evading pleural immune defense mechanisms, invading pleural tissue, and gaining access to nutrients and growth factors. In MPE patients, a complex interaction between tumor and host cells results in a pleural immunosuppressive environment, mainly due to impaired macrophages and lymphocyte cytotoxic function as well as a massive production of pro-inflammatory and tumor-stimulating mediators. Despite their detachment from pleural tissue, tumor cells floating in pleural space are still able to form secondary foci in other sites of the cavity, which suggests their capacity to use alternative sources of energy and growth factors. Recent data from early translational work showed that cancer cell cultures proliferation is promoted by seeding the cells in pleural effusion regardless of the source, suggesting a pro-growth property of pleural fluid. Therefore, it is arguable that pleural fluid may not be a bystander of malignancy, but may be an active promoter of cancer progression, thus leading to a potential change in MPE treatment approach, no longer symptoms relief-focused but aiming to achieve an early pleural fluid control.

### Eosinophilic pleural effusions [^1e00f4f0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic pleural effusions, defined as a pleural effusion that contains at least 10% eosinophils, may be caused by almost every condition that can cause pleural disease. Eosinophilic pleural effusion occurs most commonly during conditions associated with the presence of blood or air in the pleural space, infections, and malignancy. Drug-induced pleural effusions, pleural effusions accompanying pulmonary embolism, and benign asbestos pleural effusions are also among the common causes of eosinophilic pleural effusion. No etiology is found in as many as one third of patients. Because studies evaluating different diagnostic approaches with eosinophilic pleural effusions are lacking, the authors suggest that certain noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tools must be used based on the patient's clinical characteristics.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^3ecca95a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

Pleural effusion without diagnosis after initial evaluation is a frequent problem in a respiratory division, for which thoracoscopic pleural biopsy is regularly necessary. Our data, which are the first Belgian data published, represent our experience with medical thoracoscopy. These data are comparable to other studies, as well in diagnostic yield, in diagnoses made, and safety data. Medical thoracoscopy has a high diagnostic yield, and is generally safe, certainly compared with the diagnostic and therapeutic importance. If malignant pleuritis is diagnosed after a diagnosis of nonspecific pleuritis, usually it is within 1 year, rarely within 2 years. Follow-up after diagnosis of nonspecific pleuritis should preferably be 2 years.

American Thoracic Society—Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) management—we suggest that therapeutic pleural interventions not be performed in patients with known or suspected MPE who are asymptomatic (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4B and E5B). Data are insufficient to recommend sampling or draining these asymptomatic effusions, and drainage would only subject the patient to the risks of the procedure without providing clinical benefit; however, if pleural fluid is required for diagnostic purposes, fluid and/or tissue sampling would be appropriate.

### Revisiting tuberculous pleurisy: pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yield of mycobacterial culture in an endemic area [^5a6fcee1]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculous pleurisy is the second most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB)and a common cause of pleural effusion in endemic TB areas.A definitive diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy usually requires mycobacterial culture of pleural fluid, pleural biopsy or other diagnostic tests.A high index of suspicion from a pleural fluid analysis is essential for diagnosis. However, the traditional concepts about the pleural fluid findings in tuberculous pleurisy mainly come from studies conducted decades ago that have not been validated in current practice.Pleural fluid has been frequently studied owing to the popular use of ultrasound, which may modify the pleural fluid findings at disease presentation.In addition, the data from previous studies on the diagnostic yields for tuberculous pleurisy have varied widely and are not consistent. These studies have suggested the following diagnostic yields: 12–70% for effusion culture,0–52% for sputum cultureand 50–90% for histological examination of pleural biopsy specimens.We consider that variations in the study results are related to the patient selection criteria, the small number of cases in most of the studies and variable TB prevalence. Furthermore, advances in culture techniques have improved the yield of mycobacterial culture in this disease. Liquid culture media have been shown to have higher yields and faster results than solid media.

The objective of the present study was to provide updated information about the pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yields of mycobacterial culture and pleural biopsy. Differences between the cases with positive and negative effusion mycobacterial cultures were compared to determine the predictors of a positive effusion culture.

### Etiologies of bilateral pleural effusions [^7f3935ba]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the safety, etiology and outcomes of patients undergoing bilateral thoracentesis.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral thoracenteses in an academic medical center from July 2009 through November 2010. Pleural fluid characteristics and etiologies of the effusions were assessed. Mean differences in levels of fluid characteristics between right and left lungs were tested. Associations between fluid characteristics and occurrence of bilateral malignant effusions were evaluated. The rate of pneumothorax and other complications subsequent to bilateral thoracentesis was determined.

Results

Exudates were more common than transudates, and most effusions had multiple etiologies, with 83% having two or more etiologies. Bilateral malignant effusions occurred in 19 patients, were the most common single etiology of exudative effusions, and were associated with higher levels of protein and LDH in the pleural fluid. Among 200 thoracenteses performed with a bilateral procedure, seven resulted in pneumothoraces, three of which required chest tube drainage and four were ex vacuo.

Conclusions

More often than not, there are multiple etiologies that contribute to pleural fluid formation, and of the combinations of etiologies observed congestive heart failure was the most frequent contributor. Exudative effusions are more common than transudates when bilateral effusions are present. Malignancy is a common etiology of exudative effusions. This study suggests that the overall complication rate following bilateral thoracentesis is low and the rate of pneumothorax subsequent to bilateral thoracentesis is comparable to unilateral thoracentesis.

### Tuberculous pleuritis: clinical presentations and diagnostic challenges [^839b57ba]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

PLEURAL FLUID ANALYSIS

Pleural fluid analysis is the first step towards approaching an undiagnosed pleural effusion. The gross appearance of pleural fluid due to TBP is mostly serous, although frank empyema, haemorrhagic and chylous appearance have been reported. TBP is typically exudative and lymphocyte predominant (> 50% of total leukocyte count, and often > 80%, of the pleural fluid). Other pleural diseases (e.g. mesothelioma, lung cancer, lymphoma, immunoglobulin G4-related pleurisy) may mimic TBP due to shared pleural fluid analysis profile [,–].

Neutrophilic effusion occurs in 4–11% of TBP [,,,–] and is associated with higher inflammatory markers in the serum and pleural fluid. Neutrophilic TBP may represent an early (acute) phase of TBP but may also indicate a concurrent inflammatory cause. Neutrophilic TBP is associated with a higher bacilli burden and positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, and positive culture of TB but lower rates of pleural tissue granuloma formation and pleural nodules. Neutrophilic TBP, therefore, mimics bacterial parapneumonic effusion and even MPE and can lead to misdiagnosis.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^5e6d0d27]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of pleural effusions is around 320 per 100 000 per year in industrialised countries, representing approximately 1.5 million new patients in the USA.Initial work up (anamnesis, physical exam, ECG, chest X-ray, blood sample and thoracocentesis) can yield a diagnosis in up to 74% of patients.So approximately one in four effusions remains of unclear origin. Further diagnostic procedures usually comprises repeat thoracocentesis (which can yield an extra 27% of diagnoses) and pleural biopsy. Pleural biopsy is most frequently performed by thoracoscopy. The main advantage of thoracoscopic biopsy is that a specimen of the most abnormal pleural surface can be examined. Second, when inspection shows suspicion of malignancy, poudrage can be performed. Diagnostic yield of thoracoscopy has been reported to be up to 93%.

This study represents our experience during an almost 10-year period with diagnostic thoracoscopy in patients with pleural exudates without a diagnosis after initial little invasive evaluation.

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^9239476d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we found no relation between pleural fluid appearance, chemical laboratory parameters, cytological results, or survival in patients with cancer presenting with recurrent symptomatic pleural effusion. Therefore, pleural fluid appearance should not be used as an indicator of MPE in this patient group.

Further studies that include measurements of more specific inflammatory biomarkers are required to determine if pleural fluid appearance can predict the degree of intrapleural inflammatory response as it could be one of the factors related with pleurodesis success.

### Pleural effusion: characterization with CT attenuation values and CT appearance [^6de0e417]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of CT in characterizing pleural effusions on the basis of attenuation values and CT appearance.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 100 pleural effusions in patients who underwent chest CT and diagnostic thoracentesis within 48 hours of each other. On the basis of Light's criteria, effusions were classified as exudates or transudates using laboratory biochemistry markers. The mean value in Hounsfield units of an effusion was determined using a region of interest on the three slices with the greatest quantity of fluid. All CT scans also were reviewed for the presence of additional pleural features such as fluid loculation, pleural thickening, and pleural nodules.

Results

Twenty-two of the 100 pleural effusions were transudates and 78 were exudates. The mean attenuation of the exudates (7.2 HU; [SD] 9.4 HU; range, 21-28 HU) was not significantly lower than the mean attenuation of the transudates (10.1 HU; 6.9 HU; range, 0.3-32 HU), (p = 0.24). None of the additional CT features accurately differentiated exudates from transudates (p > 0.1). Fluid loculation was found in 58% of exudates and in 36% of transudates. Pleural thickening was found in 59% of exudates and in 36% of transudates.

Conclusion

The clinical use of CT attenuation values to characterize pleural fluid is not accurate. Although fluid loculation, pleural thickness, and pleural nodules were more commonly found in patients with exudative effusions, the presence of these features does not accurately differentiate between exudates and transudates.

### Accuracy of computed tomography attenuation values in the characterization of pleural fluid: an ROC study [^9ca12c25]. Academic Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To assess the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) in characterizing pleural fluid based on attenuation values.

Materials and Methods

Protocol was approved by the local institutional review board and informed consent was waived. We retrospectively analyzed 145 pleural effusions of 145 patients (mean/standard deviation age: 60.7/15.9 years; 69 females) who underwent CT of the thorax and diagnostic thoracentesis within 7 days of each other. Effusions were classified as transudates or exudates using laboratory markers based on Light's criteria. The mean Hounsfield units (HU) of an effusion was determined by a region of interest on the three slices with the greatest anteroposterior diameter. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to determine threshold values for classification on the basis of mean HU and to examine overall accuracy, using the area under the curve (A(z)).

Results

Of the 101 exudates and 44 transudates, the mean attenuation of exudates (17.1 HU/standard deviation 4.4) was significantly higher than transudates (12.5 HU/6.3), (P < .001). There was a modest but significant positive relationship between mean HU and laboratory markers, with the strongest relationship with pleural/serum protein (r = 0.57, P < .001) and total pleural protein (r = 0.56, P < .001). The overall accuracy of attenuation values for identifying exudates was moderate, Az = 0.775, standard error = 0.039, with the largest limitation being the overlap with transudates in the 10-20 HU range, which constituted 66% (90/145) of the total effusions measured.

Conclusion

Although the mean attenuation of exudates is significantly higher than transudates, the clinical use of CT numbers to characterize pleural fluid is not recommended, as their accuracy is only moderate. Moreover, there is a notable overlap in attenuation values between transudates and exudates for a majority of effusions.

Key messages

In the modern era, the role of a pleural aspiration in the investigation and management of a suspected malignant pleural effusion should be re-evaluated.
It may be possible to triage some patients straight to a definitive procedure, rather than a pleural aspiration, but further assessment of the applicability and utility of this approach is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
This study reviews the recently published trial evidence and tests their conclusions in a real-world population, and suggests that a review of the current pleural pathway should be undertaken.

### A retrospective study on the combined biomarkers and ratios in serum and pleural fluid to distinguish the multiple types of pleural effusion [^367990fc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This is a retrospective survey and analysis of the biomarkers and ratios in the serum and PF for the differential diagnosis of the multiple types of PE. Inpatients, who underwent thoracentesis at Peking University People’s Hospital (PKUPH, a non-TB specialist, comprehensive teaching hospital in Beijing, China) from November 2016 to April 2019 with exudative PE according to Light’s criteria, were enrolled in this study. Exudative PE was further classified as TPE, MPE, CPPE, UPPE, or PE caused by CTDs.

Patients

We classified exudative PE etiology into five categories. (1) TPE diagnosis was based on the presence of a caseous granuloma in the pleural biopsy and/or a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in the PF or pleural tissue with exudative PE, presenting with both clinical and radiological responses to anti-TB treatment. (2) MPE was diagnosed when PF cytology or pleural biopsy was positive for malignant cells. (3) PPE was defined as exudative effusion associated with bacterial pneumonia, lung abscess, or bronchiectasis, with no MTB in the PF obtained by continuous thoracentesis procedures and no evidence of MTB in the pathological manifestations of inflammatory pleuritis, pleural fibrosis and plaques, or chronic empyema. PPE was further divided into UPPE, when patients responded to antibiotic treatment alone, and CPPE, when non-purulent-appearing effusions required medical interventions such as drainage. (4) PE caused by CTDs was defined by positive histopathology or serology with a final diagnosis of CTDs and excluding other causes of PE [,–].

### Machine learning-based diagnostic model for determining the etiology of pleural effusion using age, ADA and LDH [^78bfb18d]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusion is the accumulation of the fluid in the pleural cavity and often occurs in the clinical practice. The effective management requires identification of its underlying etiology. The most common etiologies include congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and cancer. However, existing diagnostic methods have limitations. Thoracentesis with fluid analysis is widely used to diagnose pleural effusion, but the diagnostic accuracy for malignant pleural effusion (MPE) varies widely. In regions with a high tuberculosis burden, tuberculosis pleural effusion (TPE) constitutes a larger proportion. Light’s criteria, though commonly employed, misclassify approximately 25% of transudates as exudates. Furthermore, diagnosing parapneumonic effusion (PPE) is challenging, particularly in excluding other causes, as there are no definitive criteria for diagnosing uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion. Thus, new tools to facilitate diagnosis are needed.

Though some invasive procedures, such as pleural needle biopsy and thoracoscopy, can provide definitive pathological diagnoses, but they carry a risk of complications, require time for pathological analysis and depend on the experience of the pathologists. These challenges highlight the need for integrated diagnostic methods based on objective laboratory tests, which can support clinical decision-making and offer crucial diagnostic information for pleural effusion in a more efficient and less invasive way. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) in the pleural effusion is a biomarker for TPE, with a summary sensitivity and specificity of 0.92 and 0.90 respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enhances the specificity in the detection of malignant and inflammatory exudates and is a key laboratory test in the Light’s criteria. Moreover, the diagnosis accuracy of pleural fluid ADA was affected by age. These laboratory-based biomarkers and demographic characteristic were considered as the potential features in developing more efficient diagnostic models for pleural effusion.

### Medical thoracoscopy for exudative pleural effusion: an eight-year experience from a country with a young population [^29f6caa8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among the most common respiratory illnesses encountered in day-to-day clinical practice are undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions. Thoracentesis is usually the first diagnostic procedure performed to identify the etiology of these effusions. Although etiologies vary from country to country, malignant diseases, tuberculosis and empyema remain the most commonly encountered causes for exudative pleural effusions. Unfortunately, 40% of patients with malignant pleural effusions remain undiagnosed after a routine cytological examination of the pleural fluid and TB culture is positive in only 20% of TPE. Blind pleural biopsy using Abrams needle is easy to perform, safe, and inexpensive. Although the value of closed needle biopsy in malignant pleural effusions is still a matter of controversy, it has a high yield (up to 80%) in TPE particularly when combined with pleural fluid TB culture. This has been attributed to the diffuse pattern in which TB affects the pleura. Hence, closed needle biopsy remains an important diagnostic tool in countries where the pre-test probability of TB is high and has been recommended as the initial diagnostic modality in these areas. Despite being more expensive than blind pleural biopsy, MT is becoming the standard diagnostic modality for undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions in developed and some developing countries as it enables direct visualization of the pleural space. Different studies from many countries have confirmed the high yield of MT in diagnosing exudative pleural effusions that exceeds 70% and can reach as high as 95% in malignant effusions and 99% in TPE [,–]. Taking into consideration the high prevalence of TPE in the study subjects, the diagnostic yield of MT in the current study is lower than what was anticipated. One explanation for the relatively lower yield in Qatar is the low threshold of performing MT for cases with extensive pleural adhesions (due to non-visualization) which has resulted in the finding of non-specific fibrinous pleuritis in as high as 17% of cases (Table 4). Furthermore, the number of thoracoscopic biopsies (2-4 biopsies) performed at Hamad General Hospital per case is lower than the international recommendation and may be a contributor to the low diagnostic yield. Two striking findings have been observed in the current study. The first was the very high percentage of TPE (as compared to malignant effusions) diagnosed by MT in Qatar (84.5% vs. 5.4%). This finding has not been observed in previous studies from other countries including those with high TB prevalence. The other striking finding was the young age of patients with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions who underwent MT. There are 3 plausible reasons for these findings; firstly, people below the age of 45 years constituted 85% of the total population in Qatar. Labor force from countries with high TB prevalence constitutes a significant proportion of such young population as well as 97% of TB cases encountered in this country. In contrast to pleural TB in developed countries, Ibrahim, et al. in a previous study of pleural TB in Qatar found that younger age groups were the most commonly affected by the disease (84% are below the age of 45 years, with mean age of 31.5). Furthermore, the pleural involvement in most of the cases resulted from primary infection rather than reactivation of an old pulmonary TB. Secondly, in contrast to other developing countries where closed needle biopsy is the initial diagnostic consideration in suspected pleural TB, this procedure is very rarely performed nowadays in Qatar and has largely been replaced by MT. Moreover, owing to the highly effective and strict National TB Control Program in Qatar, there is usually emphasis on tissue or microbiologic diagnosis of TB in the country. The median length of stay (LOS) and duration of chest tube in the current study were 3 days and 1 day respectively. These findings are in agreement with international figures. Nevertheless, we believe that other factors (unrelated to the procedure) such as waiting for confirmatory histologic reports and the process of incorporating patient’s data in TB registry prior to discharge are important contributors to the LOS following MT in Qatar. Recently, it has become feasible in a number of countries to perform the procedure as a day-case. The current study was the first to document the experience with MT in this country with a young population. The results of this study can be generalized to the whole country as Hamad General Hospital is the only tertiary referral center performing MT in Qatar and receives referrals from other health care facilities in the country. Nevertheless, in addition to the limitations inherent in a retrospective study, an important limitation of this study is the lack of comparison between MT and closed needle biopsy with regard to diagnostic yield, safety and cost effectiveness particularly in cases with suspected TPE from this region. Furthermore the finding of a high percentage of nonspecific fibrinous pleuritis due to extensive adhesions has limited the yield of MT in the current study.

### Bayesian analysis using continuous likelihood ratios for identifying pleural exudates [^c7c3b8f7]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To ascertain if equations that calculate continuous likelihood ratios (CLRs) for pleural exudates improve pleural fluid categorization, especially when false positive or false negative test results are obtained by using Light's criteria.

Design and Setting

Retrospective review of the clinical and pleural fluid data from a consecutive series of patients with pleural effusion who underwent thoracentesis at the University Hospital Arnau de Vilanova (Lleida, Spain) over an 11-year period.

Patients and Methods

A total of 1490 patients with pleural effusion (298 transudates and 1192 exudates) were recruited into the study. The presence of a transudate or exudate was established by clinical judgment. We examined the comparative diagnostic accuracy of 4 tests (i.e. pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and pleural fluid to serum protein and LDH ratios) for discriminating between transudates and exudates. Decision thresholds were determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Equations for calculating CLRs derived from a logistic regression analysis based on a previously described method.

Results

Individual pleural fluid tests did not differ in their diagnostic accuracies according to ROC analysis. We calculated CLRs for the elements of Light's criteria and pleural fluid protein, and also illustrated the sequential use of CLRs for determining posttest probabilities. Overall, CLR formulas had marginal performance for the correct categorization of pleural fluid.

Conclusions

CLRs provide a probabilistic statement as to the likelihood an effusion is a transudate or exudate. However, clinical judgment is little changed by the application of CLRs, and in doubtful cases a great amount of uncertainty remains. This Bayesian approach is likely to have no major impact on the clinical practice.

### Diagnostic performance of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid in tuberculous pleural effusion and relevant factors: a single-center experience with 1, 491 consecutive patients [^c28aed58]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that 2 to 3 billion people worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT), of which 5–15% will develop active TB during their lifetime ; reportedly about 10 million 400 thousand in 2015, according to The World Health Organization (WHO). A tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is one of the most common clinical manifestations of pulmonary TB. TPE often presents a diagnostic challenge because of the low microbiological confirmation rate in pleural fluid and the practicalities of an invasive pleural biopsy. Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important, however, since delay may increase morbidity and worsen prognosis. Markers in pleural fluid have therefore, attracted a lot of attention as potential alternatives to pleural biopsy because of their rapid results and convenience.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme produced by lymphocytes which participates in purine metabolism. Pleural fluid ADA concentration is considered to be an important diagnostic tool for evaluating exudative pleural effusion, as raised levels are typical of TPE, although, high levels are sometimes seen in pleural fluid in malignancy, rheumatoid pleurisy or in patients with empyema. ADA, as a biochemical index in pleural fluid, was first advocated in 1978 and has been widely used in TPE, because it is a simple, cheap, rapid and minimally invasive method, which can be carried out in most laboratories. Although widely used, hundreds of previous studies have reported different diagnostic accuracies and different threshold values for ADA, however, because of substantial heterogeneity and high risk of bias meta-analysis failed to draw any firm inference of relative clinical utility of different diagnostic thresholds. In addition, there are few studies on the factors affecting pleural ADA level, which may be of great relevance in its clinical application.

It is therefore of great importance to reassess the accuracy, optimal threshold and relevant factors affecting ADA levels in a large series of patients with TPE. Our study aimed to: a) reassess the ADA test accuracy in a large series of samples from a single center b) establish the optimal ADA cutoff value for TPE diagnosis, and c) determine whether demographic characteristics, pleural fluid and serum biochemistry, peripheral blood cell count, particular immune status variables and some chronic disease factors affect the ADA concentration in pleural fluid.

### Curious case of the unexplained exudative pleural effusion [^391e462b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of a 74-year-old male patient who was referred to the respiratory clinic with an incidental finding of a left sided pleural effusion. He was initially being treated by the general practitioner for chest infection with productive cough that had limited resolution after course of oral antibiotics. At the pleural clinic, 1.5 L of serosanguineous fluid was drained and sent for diagnostics. However, the diagnosis only reached as far as idiopathic exudative effusion with lymphocytes and plasma cells. He was then referred for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery pleural biopsy and pleurodesis. It revealed black pleura with abundant IgG4 positive cells. He is followed up in respiratory clinic where further discussion and treatment has commenced.

### The use of probrain natriuretic peptide in pleural fluid for the diagnosis of pleural effusions resulting from heart failure [^ab924023]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Natriuretic peptides are secreted by the myocardium in response to mechanical stretch and have been proposed as a possible test for assisting the diagnosis of heart failure. This article reviews the rationale for measuring N terminal probrain natriuretic peptide in pleural fluid to identify heart failure as the cause of a pleural effusion.

Recent Findings

Rapid and accurate testing of natriuretic peptides as biomarkers for heart failure is now a clinical reality. In patients presenting with dyspnea, heart failure is usually absent at blood brain natriuretic peptide levels less than 100 pg/mL, possible from 100 to 500 pg/mL, and probable at levels greater than 500 pg/mL. In evaluating natriuretic peptide assays, one needs to consider carefully laboratory and biologic variation, including gender, sex, obesity, renal function, and the assay used. Potential future applications of natriuretic peptide testing include the differential diagnosis of pleural effusion. A recent study has shown good diagnostic characteristics in cardiac pleural effusions, with likelihood ratios of 13 and a diagnostic accuracy of more than 90% for pleural fluid N terminal probrain natriuretic peptide levels > or =1500 pg/mL. Specifically, N terminal probrain natriuretic peptide pleural levels correctly categorized most cardiac effusions misclassified as exudates by standard criteria, and discriminated between cardiac and hepatic transudates.

Summary

Pleural fluid N terminal probrain natriuretic peptide may help accurately differentiate cardiac from noncardiac conditions in patients presenting with pleural effusion.

### Characteristics of pleural effusion with a high adenosine deaminase level: a case-control study [^70af8c3c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We demonstrated many characteristics of diseases with high pleural fluid ADA levels. The most frequent disease with ADA levels of ≥ 40 U/L was tuberculous pleurisy; however, approximately 60% of patients were diagnosed with other diseases. The higher the ADA levels are, the higher the likelihood of tuberculous pleurisy is, and an ADA level above 70 U/L is more reliable for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy. However, in our study, diseases other than tuberculous pleurisy were present in 21.8% of patients with ADA levels of ≥ 70 IU/L. ADA is categorized as ADA-1 and ADA-2. ADA-2 is mainly activated in tuberculous pleural effusion ; conversely, low ADA-2 activities are observed in other diseases, such as neoplastic exudate, empyema, and parapneumonic exudate. The ADA-1/total ADA activity ratio improves performance concerning diagnostic accuracy for tuberculous pleurisy. However, only total ADA can be routinely measured in our clinical practice. Therefore, pleural effusion with high ADA levels should not be diagnosed simply as tuberculous pleurisy. This study reports that many factors for distinguishing diseases. These factors can help diagnose patients with high ADA levels; thus, we developed a diagnostic flowchart for tuberculous pleurisy by using predicted factors with high diagnostic accuracy.

### Malignant pleural effusions because of lung cancer [^1830d75e]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The discovery of a pleural effusion in the setting of lung cancer has diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic challenges, some of which are addressed in this review.

Recent Findings

Around 20% of patients with lung cancer have minimal pleural effusions, which are not amenable to a diagnostic thoracentesis. These patients have a poorer overall survival (∼7.5 months) than those without effusions (∼12-18 months), although slightly better than those with proven malignant fluids (∼5.5 months). Tumor genotype techniques are feasible on pleural fluid specimens and clinically helpful in identifying patients who may benefit from targeted therapies. If limited pleural involvement is detected during lung cancer surgery despite the presurgical imaging studies, macroscopic complete resection of the lung tumor is still a treatment option. Cytological examination for cancer cells in pleural cavity washings at the time of thoracotomy (pleural lavage cytology) is recommended to uncover pleural dissemination. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer with visceral pleural invasion might be considered candidates for postsurgical adjuvant therapy.

Summary

Some predictors of adverse survival in patients with lung cancer include the presence of a minimal pleural effusion, positive pleural lavage cytology, visceral pleural invasion on pathologic examination, and unexpected pleural involvement during surgery.

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^078768b0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions are a common problem in cancer patients. In a postmortem series published by Rodriguez-Panadero and colleagues, there was evidence of malignant pleural involvement in 28% of patients with one or more malignant tumors, of whom approximately one-half presented with a pleural effusion. The incidence of malignant pleural effusions in the United States approaches 150,000 cases annually.

For patients presenting with clinical signs of a pleural effusion, the primary diagnostic tools include roentgenographic studies of the chest and a thoracentesis. Initial information about the pleural effusion comes from the color and appearance of the fluid obtained during thoracentesis. Additional information concerning the inflammatory characteristics of the fluid is obtained later, using indicators such as white and red blood cell counts, and chemical laboratory values including glucose, protein, LDH, amylase, and cholesterol [-].

A small number of previous publications have attempted to find an association between pleural fluid appearance and cytological diagnosis in patients presenting with a pleural effusion. Two studies on patients without a prior diagnosis of cancer reported an association between bloody effusions and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology. In a study of patients with parapneumonic or infection-related effusions, a fluid that was free-flowing and non-purulent indicated an infection that could be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas a fluid with a purulent appearance indicted the need for drainage of the affected pleural cavity.

To our knowledge, there are no publications in the medical literature evaluating the relationship between fluid appearance and the results of cytological evaluation and chemical laboratory testing of pleural effusions in patients with cancer. We therefore conducted a retrospective study in a population of cancer patients with a high pretest probability of having a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) to answer two questions: Is there any relationship between pleural fluid appearance and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology? Does fluid appearance correlate with cellular counts or chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions?

### Diagnostic procedure for idiopathic eosinophilic pleural effusion: a single-center experience [^e87f646c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EPEs account for 5 to 16% of the exudative pleural effusions, and IEPE is an important cause of EPEs which can almost always be treated medically. However, well-documented cases are limited. In this study, we tried to analyse the clinical characteristics of IEPE and to clarify the diagnostic procedure.

Archontogeorgis K et al. first investigated the diagnostic approach in 10 patients with IEPE, but the clinical characteristics of IEPE were not assessed. In this study, the clinical features of IEPE were described in 11 prospective cases. Shortness of breath is one of major symptoms of IEPE. Moreover, fever, productive cough, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and ascites often exist. Most patients had bilateral pleural effusion [–,], but unilateral effusion was also evident. We found all 11 patients developed respiratory symptoms which are similar to IEPE symptoms. Among these cases, 7 had bilateral effusion and 4 had lung involvement. Previous reports showed the eosinophils were always significantly elevated, reaching up to 3.5 × 10 9 /L. Contrarily, in this study, the number of eosinophils were normal or slightly elevated. Due to lack of pathognomonic characteristics and laboratory tests, some patients were initially misdiagnosed.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^bd52c65b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have more than one underlying cause. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions secondary to more than one aetiology.

Recent Findings

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant disease, the incidence of the complex pleural patient is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, have been suggested as a way of identifying contributing disease process.

Summary

Understanding that there are potentially concurrent causes to a pleural effusion is vital in establishing the diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify the complex pleural effusion. Further studies on whether the targeting of separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.

### Pleural fluid amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide in patients with pleural effusions [^6e0359ed]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Definite diagnosis of transudative or exudative pleural fluids often presents a diagnostic dilemma. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in pleural fluid has a diagnostic value for discriminating heart-failure-related pleural effusions from non-heart-failure effusions.

Methods

Sixty-six subjects (40 male, mean age 61 ± 18 y) with pleural effusions were included. Samples of pleural fluid and serum were obtained simultaneously from each subject. Biochemical analysis, bacterial and fungal culture, acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, and cytology were performed on the pleural fluid.

Results

Subjects with heart-failure-related pleural effusion had significantly higher pleural NT-proBNP levels than other subjects (P < .001). Pleural and serum NT-proBNP measures were closely correlated (r = 0.90, P < .001). An NT-proBNP cutoff value of ≥ 2,300 pg/mL in pleural fluid had a sensitivity of 70.8%, a specificity of 97.6%, and positive and negative predictive values of 94.4% and 85.4%, respectively, for discriminating transudates caused by heart failure from exudates. Eight heart-failure subjects were misclassified as exudates by Light's criteria, 5 of whom received diuretics before thoracentesis. All misclassified subjects had pleural NT-proBNP levels higher than 1,165 pg/mL, which predicted heart-failure-associated transudates with 95.8% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity.

Conclusions

Pleural fluid NT-proBNP measurement in the routine diagnostic panel may be useful in differentiation of heart-failure-related pleural effusions and exudative pleural fluids with reasonable accuracy, especially in heart-failure patients treated with diuretics.

### ANA positivity and complement level in pleural fluid are potential diagnostic markers in discriminating lupus pleuritis from pleural effusion of other aetiologies [^a690ceb8]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results showed that ANA positivity and levels of C3 and C4 in the pleural fluid could help discriminate lupus pleuritis from pleural effusion of other aetiologies with a high NPV. If we analysed exudative pleural effusion only (exudative lupus pleuritis vs infection-related or malignant pleural effusion; online supplemental table S3), the diagnostic performance of ANA would be slightly better, whereas those of C3 and C4 would not change. We have proposed a diagnostic algorithm (online supplemental figure S2). More studies are needed to validate our findings.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^4090e797]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Diagnoses made on pleural biopsy

The 44.3% of patients with malignant pleuritis is in the range of other studies (60.0%, 54.0%, 44.2%, 36.6%).Of course this also depends on previous diagnostic work up before thoracoscopy (eg, imaging, number of thoracentesis, closed pleural biopsy), but also on your patient population, and if the data were collected in TB-endemic countries.We have a higher percentage of nonspecific pleuritis compared with these other studies, and lower percentage of other benign conditions. We however have no empyema, haemothorax nor heart failure, which is prevalent in some other studies.Neither do we have (clinical) probable diagnoses, but only certain diagnoses, and we categorised all these uncertain diagnoses as nonspecific pleuritis.

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^12ce2d87]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid cytology, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to send a larger volume, if achievable, when a small volume aspirate (< 25 mL) has been nondiagnostic, except when there is a high suspicion of a tumor type associated with low pleural fluid cytology sensitivity (especially mesothelioma).

### Improving the predictive accuracy of identifying exudative effusions [^22fddcb2]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Application of Light's criteria results in misclassification of some transudative effusions as exudative, particularly because of congestive heart failure (CHF). We sought to determine if the serum to pleural fluid albumin (SF-A) and serum to pleural fluid protein (SF-P) gradients increased the predictive accuracy to correctly identify exudative effusions.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 1,153 consecutive patients who underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis at the Medical University South Carolina. Univariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the statistical significance of pleural fluid tests that correctly identified exudative effusions. Tests with significant diagnostic accuracy were combined in multivariable logistic regression models, with calculation of areas under the curve (AUCs) to determine their predictive accuracy. The predictive capability of the best model was compared with Light's criteria and other test combinations.

Results

Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), SF-A gradient, and SF-P gradient had a significant effect on the probability of identifying exudative pleural effusions. When combined together in a multivariable logistic regression, LDH (OR, 14.09 [95% CI, 2.25-85.50]), SF-A gradient (OR, 7.16 [95% CI, 1.24-41.43]), and SF-P gradient (OR, 6.83 [95% CI, 1.56-27.88]) had an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98).

Conclusions

Application of Light's criteria, not uncommonly, misclassifies CHF transudative effusions as exudates. In cases where no cause for an exudative effusion can be identified or CHF is suspected, the sequential application of the fluid LDH, followed by the SF-P and then the SF-A gradients, may assist in reclassifying pleural effusions as transudates.

### Pleural effusions following cardiac surgery: prevalence, risk factors, and clinical features [^d65d776f]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion is a common complication of cardiac surgery, but its characteristics and predisposing factors should be documented further. Our objective was to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and determinants of clinically significant pleural effusions, defined as those requiring therapeutic pleural drainage according to clinical assessment.

Methods

The prevalence and characteristics of patients who had a pleural effusion within 30 days of undergoing coronary artery bypass graft, valve replacement, or both were analyzed retrospectively at our institution over a 2-year period.

Results

Among the 2,892 patients included in the study (mean age, 66 years; men, 2,139), 192 patients (6.6%) had experienced a clinically significant pleural effusion in the 30 days postsurgery. These effusions occurred after a mean (+/- SD) duration of 6.6 +/- 5.9 days following interventions. Pleural fluid analysis was obtained in 114 patients (59.4%); all met the criteria for an exudate. Pleural fluid was hemorrhagic in 50% of cases. Age, body weight, baseline pulmonary function, and smoking status were similar between patients with and without effusion; however, the proportion of women; the number of patients with previous conditions of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or peripheral vascular disease; and the number of patients receiving therapy with an anticoagulant or antiarrhythmic agent was higher in the pleural effusion group. Patients with pleural effusion had an increased prevalence of postoperative complications.

Conclusions

Pleural effusion is a common complication of heart surgery, is associated with other postoperative complications, and is more frequent in women and in patients with associated cardiac or vascular comorbidities and medications used to treat those conditions.

### Utilization of B-type natriuretic peptide and NT-proBNP in the diagnosis of pleural effusions due to heart failure [^c3088765]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The natriuretic peptides B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and NT-proBNP have been incorporated into the existing clinical guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of heart failure. Recent evidence has provided important information regarding the relative value of each of these peptides to differentiate between pleural effusions caused by heart failure and those attributable to other causes.

Recent Findings

In a meta-analysis of 10 studies, which included 1120 patients, pleural fluid levels of NT-proBNP had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 94%, a positive likelihood ratio of 15.2, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.06 in identifying heart failure-related effusions. Because pleural fluid and serum natriuretic peptide levels are closely correlated and display similar discriminatory properties, blood tests alone are sufficient. More than 85% of heart failure patients whose pleural fluids meet exudative criteria exhibit high pleural NT-proBNP concentrations. The diagnostic performance of pleural fluid BNP has been reported to be inferior to that of NT-proBNP.

Summary

NT-proBNP is an established biomarker of heart failure-associated effusions and the most effective tool for recognizing cardiac effusions that are misclassified as exudates by Light's criteria. If clinicians choose pleural fluid specimens for natriuretic peptide testing, the lower diagnostic accuracy of BNP makes it a poor substitute for NT-proBNP measurements.

### A case of meigs' syndrome with preceding pericardial effusion in advance of pleural effusion [^cef02587]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although pleural fluid analysis plays an important role in diagnosing patients with pleural effusion, contradictory data regarding pleural fluid characteristics have been reported in patients with Meigs’ syndrome, as some studies have classified it as a transudate, whereas others stated that it is an exudate. Pleural fluid is generally characterized as either a transudate or an exudate based on Light’s criteria, which assess serum and pleural fluid protein and LDH. Transudative pleural effusion occurs in patients with imbalances in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures in the chest, such as chronic heart failure and nephrosis. In contrast, exudative pleural effusion results from a variety of mechanisms, including infection, malignancy, and trauma. According to a systematic review of 653 studies on Meigs’ syndrome, the majority of pleural effusions in patients are exudates, as is in our case, despite limited data reliably defining the characteristics of the pleural effusion. In addition, we needed to carefully differentiate Meigs’ syndrome from tuberculous pleural effusion, because the pleural effusion in our case was a lymphocyte-predominant exudate consistent with tuberculous pleurisy. As acid-fast bacilli stains and cultures are of low yield in the setting of tuberculous pleural effusion, such negative bacterial findings cannot rule out tuberculous pleurisy. When the bacterial evaluation of pleural fluid is not diagnostic, pleural biopsy, culture of pleural tissue, and an elevated pleural fluid ADA level are often useful to confirm the diagnosis. Pleural effusion in our case was unlikely to be caused by tuberculosis, due to the normal ADA level and the negative mycobacterial culture findings.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^c1b63c7a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pleural or pericardial effusions in NSCLC—staging and management: Pleural or pericardial effusion is a criterion for stage IV, M1a disease, and T4 with pleural effusion is classified as stage IV, M1a; pleural or pericardial effusions are malignant in 90% to 95% of patients, so pathologic confirmation of a malignant effusion by thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis is recommended, with thoracoscopy considered if thoracentesis is inconclusive. In the absence of nonmalignant causes, an exudate or sanguineous effusion is considered malignant regardless of cytology, and if the effusion is negative for malignancy (M0), treatment is based on the confirmed T and N stage; data suggest that most pleural or pericardial effusions are associated with unresectable disease in 95% of cases, and if positive for malignancy the tumor is defined as M1a and is treated with local therapy (ambulatory small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window) in addition to treatment as for stage IV disease.

### Pleural fluid procalcitonin to distinguish infectious from noninfectious etiologies of pleural effusions [^22b2b9e0]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In this study we investigate the diagnostic value of pleural fluid procalcitonin (PCT) in distinguishing infectious and noninfectious etiologies of pleural effusion. We reviewed the medical records of 75 hospitalized patients who underwent thoracentesis between 2011 and 2012. Data on pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), protein, albumin, cell count and differential, pH, Gram stain and culture, cytology, triglyceride, cholesterol, amylase, and PCT were collected. Data on serum LDH, protein, albumin, prothrombin time, normalized, and blood culture were also collected. Pleural effusions were classified into 2 groups, infectious and noninfectious. There were 18 infectious pleural effusions (IPE) and 57 noninfectious pleural effusions (NIPE). Median pleural fluid PCT was 1.088 ng/mL (0.312-2.940 ng/mL) in IPE and 0.123 ng/mL (0.05-0.263 ng/mL) in NIPE, with a P value < 0.0001. Pleural fluid PCT > 0.25 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 77.78% and specificity of 74.14% for diagnosing an IPE. A subgroup analysis of PCT in exudative infectious effusions versus exudative noninfectious malignant/paramalignant effusions showed higher levels in the former. PCT is a novel biomarker for diagnosing infectious pleural effusion, and it would be worthwhile to investigate the role of pleural PCT in assessing severity of illness, risk stratification, and antibiotic stewardship in hospitalized patients with pleural effusions.

### Clinical importance of echogenic swirling pleural effusions [^de8e4e77]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Thoracic sonography is an important tool in diagnosis and assessment of pleural effusions and can provide valuable information about the characteristics of accumulated pleural fluid, in addition to improving the safety of thoracentesis. In addition to the 4 classic sonographic pleural effusion patterns (anechoic, complex nonseptate, complex septate, and homogeneously echogenic), an echogenic swirling pattern has been previously described, which was originally thought to be associated with malignant effusion. Two cases of pleural effusion with an echogenic swirling pattern are described below, illustrating that this sonographic finding can be seen in both exudative and transudative effusions.

### Diagnostic accuracy of thoracic CT to differentiate transudative from exudative pleural effusion prior to thoracentesis [^5d28b18b]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This two-center retrospective study confirmed the difference in CT values between transudative and exudative effusions, and demonstrated the high diagnostic accuracy of CT values. Moreover, we proposed that a new relative index, PF to blood CT value ratio, can be used to distinguish exudates from transudates with better universality. Importantly, the diagnostic application of CT value and PF to blood CT value ratio evaluated in Luoyang Cohort was further validated using a separate cohort of patients (Zhengzhou Cohort). The strong positive correlation between CT value and protein level in pleural effusion is fundamental for the differential diagnostic performance. Our findings may reduce the incidences of unnecessary thoracentesis in patients with transudative pleural effusion.

The application of CT scan is well established in the diagnostic process for pleural effusion treatment. Previous studies have suggested that certain CT scan features, namely pleural thickening, pleural nodularity and loculation, are highly suggestive of exudative pleural effusion with an excellent specificity [–,,,]. Nevertheless, the absence of these features in a substantial proportion of exudative pleural effusions will reduce the sensitivity significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the specific CT value to improve differential diagnosis capability. However, there are very few high-quality evidence on diagnostic accuracy of CT attenuation value to distinguish transudative from exudative pleural effusion. Kiran et al. Kadihan et al. and Neşat et al. independently reported that the mean CT attenuation value of the exudates was significantly higher than those of the transudates, but the diagnostic accuracy was suboptimal. However, these studies show dampening limitations: such as (1) study size was small, (2) did not show rigorous workflow of patient enrollment, and (3) most importantly, did not validate their findings using a separate independent cohort. Our study addressed all these limitations by utilizing expanded sample size with strict execution of the enrollment criteria, and further testing our findings with an external validation patient cohort.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^337d6088]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion and Conclusion

Pleural effusions are relatively common in medical practice. It is estimated that the annual incidence of pleural effusions in the United States (US) is 1.5 million cases. The most common cause of pleural effusions is CHF with an estimated incidence of 500,000 cases in the US per year. Identifying the underlying etiology of pleural effusions requires a combination of strategies including clinical history, pleural fluid analysis, and potentially more invasive procedures such as pleural tissue biopsy. Clinical history is very important in the diagnosis of pleural effusions from a cardiac origin. However, alone, it does not appear to be very accurate. Romero-Candeira et al studied 64 patients with transudative pleural effusions of which 44 were due to CHF and showed that in 40% of cases initial clinical history failed to correctly classify the effusion. Pleural fluid analysis using Light's criteria is better than clinical history for diagnosing pleural effusions of cardiac origin however these criteria misclassify transudates as exudative effusions approximately 25% of the time, mainly related to the use of diuretics. Misclassification of transudates to exudates can lead to inappropriate management or potentially more invasive diagnostic investigations resulting in increased morbidity and health care costs. As a result, tests with higher diagnostic accuracy may prove beneficial in terms of reducing morbidity and improving cost-efficiency for diagnosing pleural effusions of cardiac origin.

In the last decade several studies have been reported assessing the diagnostic utility of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP in pleural effusions of cardiac origin. To summarize these studies, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included ten studies, of which seven were from Europe, with a total of 1120 patients and/or pleural effusions. We showed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity were identical (94% [95% CI: 90-97] and 94% [95% CI: 89-97]) with a diagnostic odds ratio of 246 (95% CI: 81-745). When the study by Seyhan et al, which was retracted from the literature, was excluded from the analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio remained the same within 95% confidence intervals.

### Calprotectin: a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of pleural effusion [^38f50409]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background:

Novel non-invasive biomarkers for the precise diagnosis of malignancy in pleural effusion (PE) are needed. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of calprotectin for predicting malignancy in patients with exudative PE.

Methods:

Calprotectin concentration was measured in 156 individuals diagnosed with exudative PE (67 malignant and 89 benign). Calprotectin accuracy for discriminating between malignant and benign PE was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to test the association between calprotectin levels and malignant PE.

Results:

Calprotectin levels were significantly lower in malignant pleural fluid (257.2 ng ml −1, range: 90.7–736.4) than benign effusions (2627.1 ng ml −1, range: 21–9530.1). The area under the curve was 0.963. A cutoff point of ⩽736.4 ng ml −1 rendered a sensitivity of 100%, with a specificity of 83.15%, which could prove useful to delimit those patients with negative cytology tests that should be referred for more invasive diagnostic procedures. Logistic regression demonstrated a strong association between calprotectin and malignancy (adjusted OR 663.14).

Conclusion:

Calprotectin predicts malignancy in pleural fluid with high accuracy and could be a good complement to cytological methods.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^3e4f0049]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Thoracentesis

Thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis is usually the first invasive approach in the suspicion of MPE, that commonly exhibits exudative features with a net predominance of mononuclear cells.

Even though pleural fluid cytology is the essential part of pleural fluid analysis, both sensitivity and specificity are suboptimal and vary depending on the primary cancer type.

Porcel et al. carried out a large retrospective study reporting an overall sensitivity of 51%. Likewise, overall sensitivity was confirmed in a prospective cohort study, which reported a value of 46% and showed that the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid analysis depends on cancer histotype, ranging from a significantly low accuracy in mesothelioma (6%) and hematological malignancies (40%) to higher value in adenocarcinomas (79%) (up to 95% in ovarian adenocarcinomas).

Interestingly, Mercer et al. found a negative association between pleural thickening on CT and both negative cytology (p < 0.001) and insufficient samples (p = 0.001).

Several attempts to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid cytology have been made. Literature data report that while a larger amount of pleural fluid volume doesn’t impact on sensitivity, a second, but not subsequent, pleural aspirations might be useful in increasing the diagnostic yield.

However, to optimize the utility of the cell block preparation, it might be suggested to submit at least 50 ml of pleural fluid.

Furthermore, additional immunocytochemistry tests, such as BAP1 loss and p16 deletion may help distinguishing between benign pleural effusion and MPE, particularly benign mesothelial hyperplasia from malignant pleural mesothelioma.

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^559e223e]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid biomarkers, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining pleural fluid NT-proBNP for the evaluation of HF as a cause of unilateral pleural effusion. Avoid obtaining it routinely as it is not superior to serum NT-proBNP.

### Pleural fluid adenosine deaminase to serum C-reactive protein ratio for diagnosing tuberculous pleural effusion [^6ac70b40]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion, an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pleural space, is not a disease itself but rather an important clinical manifestation of systemic and pleural diseases. Internationally the incidence of pleural effusion is 320 cases per 100,000 people in industrialized countries and only in the USA it is at least 1.5 million cases annually. Pleural effusion has several etiologies, which are usually grouped into two categories: exudative and transudative. Two of the most important causes of exudative effusions are tuberculosis (TB) and malignancy.

Tuberculosis occurs in every part of the world, but most cases and deaths are registered in developing countries. Nearly 10.6 million people around the world developed TB in 2021, with an estimated 1.6 million deaths. One of the most common presentations for extrapulmonary TB is tuberculous pleural effusion. Direct smears of pleural effusion or effusion cultures are often negative. Pleural fluid (PF) AFB smears are positive in only < 5% of cases, and culture is positive in only 10–20% of cases. Although pleural biopsy for histopathology is 80–100% sensitive in diagnosing tuberculous pleural effusion and 42–97% sensitive in diagnosing malignant pleural effusion, the procedure itself is invasive and requires expert and trained human resources.

Due to their low cost, and short turn-around time, PF biomarkers serve as complementary diagnostic tools. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is one such commonly explored investigation tool in the case of tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE)with 90% sensitivity and a 92% specificity. But ADA level can also be raised in malignancy, lymphoma, and collagen vascular disease. Ogata et al. (2011) also demonstrated that although ADA activity in pleural fluid is highly sensitive (85.5%) and specific (86.5%) in the diagnosis of TPE; lung cancer, or mesothelioma may show high ADA activity. Given ADA's inadequate diagnostic accuracy, it is still important to develop novel biomarkers to improve or replace it. C-reactive protein (CRP) was discovered in 1930 and is widely used as a sensitive but nonspecific marker of systemic inflammation. Increased serum C-reactive protein levels have been reported in many pulmonary disorders, including pneumonia, malignancies, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Although few studies reported differences in serum CRP levels between tuberculous and malignant effusion, serum CRP alone is not a reliable marker to differentiate between these two types of effusion.
