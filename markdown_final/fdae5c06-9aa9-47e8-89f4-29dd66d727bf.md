## Question

med to add to wellbutrin and sertraline for increased depression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication to add to a bupropion plus sertraline regimen for worsening depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this clinical picture truly meets criteria for treatment resistance and whether the current antidepressant trials have been optimized. Then, I should verify what current high-credibility guidelines recommend for partial response versus nonresponse, including when to augment versus switch and what role psychotherapy should play. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence for specific augmentation agents, especially atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole, alongside alternatives such as mirtazapine, lithium, and triiodothyronine. After that, I need to design a cautious dosing and monitoring plan that covers suicidality and metabolic safety, and I must double-check for drug–drug interactions with bupropion. Finally, I will outline a stepwise algorithm with contingencies if augmentation is not tolerated or ineffective, and I will consider when to escalate to esketamine or other modalities.

> Let me first confirm the treatment-resistance framing. A dual regimen of sertraline (an SSRI) and bupropion (an NDRI) suggests prior optimization attempts, but I should verify adequate dose, duration, and adherence before labeling this as treatment-resistant depression, typically staged after at least one to two adequate trials per Thase and Rush and contemporary TRD definitions, because misclassification can lead to premature polypharmacy and missed diagnoses such as bipolar spectrum or substance use disorders that drive nonresponse [^117VTy5M] [^115UtnfY].

> Next, I should review the guideline backbone so I don't jump to conclusions. The 2024 American Family Physician guidance recommends, for partial responders to an optimized antidepressant, either augmentation with a second-generation antipsychotic, a switch to a different antidepressant class, and adding psychotherapy; augmentation is often preferred when there has been any benefit or tolerability with the index agent, whereas switching is reasonable for nonresponders or intolerance [^111EzeEL] [^116ovRvS].

> I will now examine the evidence for atypical antipsychotic augmentation, and I should double-check the quality signals. Aripiprazole has robust RCT support and is FDA-approved as adjunctive therapy in MDD, and in the 2023 NEJM trial in older adults with TRD, aripiprazole augmentation improved well-being more than switching to bupropion, with a between-group difference of 2.79 points, while remission outcomes were comparable across augmentation arms, reinforcing augmentation as a viable first step when there is partial response or tolerability to the base regimen [^114VJXjM] [^114VJXjM].

> Wait, let me verify the practical dosing strategy because dosing details matter for tolerability. A cautious clinical approach is to start aripiprazole at 2 mg daily, titrating by 2–5 mg weekly as tolerated toward a usual target range of 5–15 mg for adjunctive use, while explicitly monitoring for akathisia and activation, which were notable tolerability issues in trials and routine care; this dosing and monitoring cadence aligns with trial practice parameters and expert reviews even though individual titration should be personalized to side effects and response [^112zPuEw] [^113Cf2Ty].

> Considering alternatives, I initially thought quetiapine was not FDA-approved for adjunctive MDD, but hold on, I should verify that. I should correct myself: quetiapine extended-release is FDA-approved as an adjunct in MDD and has supportive evidence, though sedation, orthostasis, and metabolic adverse effects often limit its use; other agents like risperidone and olanzapine have evidence from smaller studies, but they are not uniformly FDA-indicated for this purpose and carry higher metabolic burdens, so the risk–benefit calculus must be individualized [^114VJXjM].

> Let me consider mirtazapine because it is often proposed as a "mechanistically complementary" add-on. The phase III MIR trial in primary care TRD found no clinically meaningful advantage for adding mirtazapine to an ongoing SSRI/SNRI at 12 weeks and observed more adverse effects and discontinuations in the combination arm, and CO-MED likewise did not show superiority of combination over monotherapy in first-step treatment, so triple therapy with sertraline, bupropion, and mirtazapine should be reserved for cases where antipsychotic augmentation is contraindicated or not tolerated, with careful monitoring for sedation, weight gain, and serotonergic toxicity [^115WdF7i] [^113Qy6Wk] [^111EvZL1].

> I should not overlook classical augmentors with long track records. Lithium augmentation has decades of use and antisuicidal signals but requires renal, thyroid, and serum level monitoring, and triiodothyronine (T3) is another option with modest effect sizes; contemporary reviews still support their use when atypical antipsychotics are unsuitable or ineffective, though head-to-head evidence against aripiprazole is limited and patient selection plus lab monitoring are essential [^113Cf2Ty] [^112J5FPm].

> But wait, what if there has been minimal benefit from either sertraline or bupropion despite adequate trials, or augmentation is declined. In such cases, a switch strategy is appropriate: STAR✱D-level data show comparable remission rates when switching among bupropion SR, sertraline, or venlafaxine XR after SSRI failure, and smaller randomized data suggest across-class switches such as to duloxetine or bupropion can yield 60–70% responses over six weeks without clear between-drug differences, supporting a patient-preference–aligned switch if augmentation is not favored [^1144yeyY] [^117K8Ara].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic augmentation because adding psychotherapy can enhance outcomes without pharmacologic burden. Cognitive behavioral therapy has meaningful effect sizes in TRD meta-analytic syntheses, and guidelines endorse adding structured psychotherapy alongside medication optimization; matching therapy type to patient preference and access improves adherence and outcomes, which I need to keep front and center [^116DgY3w] [^116ovRvS].

> I need to ensure a robust safety plan. All antidepressant regimens warrant close monitoring for clinical worsening and suicidality, especially in the initial weeks and during dose changes; families and caregivers should be enlisted to watch for abrupt changes like agitation, insomnia, irritability, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, or emergent suicidal thoughts and to contact the prescriber promptly if they appear, per FDA labeling for bupropion and other antidepressants [^112KdZwp] [^113KXdGQ] [^1161rWGP]. For atypical antipsychotic augmentation, I should confirm baseline and follow-up metabolic parameters including weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipids, given class metabolic risk, and recheck at three months and then periodically in alignment with guideline-informed practice and the antipsychotic risk profile [^111EzeEL] [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interaction considerations because bupropion is a clinically meaningful perpetrator. Bupropion is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor and can increase exposure of coadministered CYP2D6 substrates, so when adding agents with 2D6 metabolism such as certain atypical antipsychotics, I should start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for adverse effects like akathisia or EPS, adjusting doses accordingly; a mechanism-informed approach to regimen construction helps minimize interaction risks while maximizing complementary pharmacodynamics [^111TamRB] [^113KXdGQ].

> Let me also reconsider differential diagnosis and staging, because missing these can derail any medication plan. I should confirm the absence of bipolar spectrum features, psychotic depression, active substance use, or prominent anxiety disorders that could require tailored strategies and can masquerade as antidepressant nonresponse, and I should use standardized symptom scales to document baseline severity and track change to guide timely adjustments in line with TRD management principles [^115UtnfY] [^117VTy5M].

> I should double-check escalation pathways if multiple standard steps fail. Esketamine shows high efficacy in rigorous syntheses and is increasingly positioned as second-line augmentation in some algorithms, but it is not generally a first-line augmenter in major guidelines; it becomes appropriate to consider when well-delivered pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic strategies have not achieved response or when rapid effect is prioritized, nested within REMS and monitoring requirements [^116DgY3w].

> Synthesis and primary recommendation: Given partial response or tolerability to the current bupropion plus sertraline regimen but worsening symptoms, I recommend adjunctive aripiprazole as the first-line pharmacologic augmentation, starting at 2 mg daily, reassessing for akathisia, activation, insomnia, and suicidality within 1–2 weeks, and titrating by 2–5 mg weekly toward 5–10 mg by weeks 2–4 if tolerated, with a formal response evaluation at 6–8 weeks using a validated scale; simultaneously, I would initiate structured psychotherapy such as CBT and maintain metabolic monitoring throughout antipsychotic exposure [^112zPuEw] [^111EzeEL] [^116DgY3w].

> Contingency planning if aripiprazole is contraindicated, intolerable, or ineffective: I would consider switching augmentation to quetiapine XR with informed consent about sedation and metabolic risk, or pivot to lithium or T3 augmentation with appropriate lab monitoring; alternatively, if there has been little benefit from the current antidepressants, I would execute a switch to an SNRI such as venlafaxine XR or duloxetine while deciding whether to continue bupropion based on prior tolerability and benefit signals, recognizing comparable outcomes across common switch options in STAR✱D and small RCTs and reinforcing the parallel use of psychotherapy [^114VJXjM] [^113Cf2Ty] [^1144yeyY] [^117K8Ara].

> Final check: I need to ensure the patient and caregivers receive clear education on early warning signs, a rapid contact plan for emergent symptoms, and scheduled follow-ups aligned with dose changes; if less than a 25% improvement is observed by 4–6 weeks of a well-tolerated augmentation, I should reassess diagnosis, adherence, comorbidities, and consider switching strategies or escalation to advanced treatments such as esketamine consistent with guideline positioning and patient preferences [^112KdZwp] [^116ovRvS] [^116DgY3w].

For patients with inadequate response to Wellbutrin (bupropion) and sertraline, the most evidence-based next step is to **add a second-generation antipsychotic** [^111EzeEL] such as aripiprazole or quetiapine [^112zPuEw], which are FDA-approved [^114VJXjM] for adjunctive use in treatment-resistant depression and have the strongest support for improving remission and response rates. If sedation or weight gain are concerns, consider **mirtazapine as an alternative**; it is effective for residual insomnia or appetite loss but has less robust evidence than antipsychotic augmentation. Lithium or liothyronine are options [^113Cf2Ty] if antipsychotics are not tolerated, and psychostimulants or modafinil may help with residual fatigue or cognitive symptoms, though evidence is limited [^112J5FPm]. Monitor closely for adverse effects, drug interactions, and suicidality [^112iPyMB], and use measurement-based care to guide adjustments [^111EvZL1].

## Evidence-based augmentation strategies

### Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs)

SGAs have the **strongest evidence** for adjunctive use in TRD [^111EzeEL]; aripiprazole and quetiapine are FDA-approved [^114VJXjM] and improve remission and response rates when added to antidepressants.

- **Aripiprazole**: 2–10 mg/day; partial dopamine agonist; low metabolic risk; akathisia possible.
- **Quetiapine**: 150–300 mg/day; sedating; metabolic risk; useful with insomnia/anxiety.
- **Brexpiprazole**: 1–3 mg/day; similar to aripiprazole; weight gain/akathisia possible.
- **Olanzapine**: 5–20 mg/day; effective but higher metabolic risk.

---

### Mirtazapine

Mirtazapine is **effective for residual insomnia or appetite loss**, with **moderate evidence** for augmentation [^113Cf2Ty] [^115WdF7i]. The **dose** is 15–45 mg/day; it is sedating at lower doses, and weight gain is common. It is also useful for insomnia/anxiety.

---

### Lithium

Lithium is a classic augmenter with **strong evidence** [^112J5FPm] for reducing suicidality and improving remission. Typical dosing is 600–900 mg/day with a target serum level of 0.6–1.0 mEq/L. Monitoring should include renal function, thyroid function, electrolytes, and serum lithium levels.

---

### Thyroid hormone (liothyronine, T3)

Liothyronine is **effective** [^112J5FPm], particularly for fatigue or cognitive symptoms. Typical dosing is 25–50 mcg/day with slow titration. Monitoring consists of thyroid function tests. Evidence is **moderate**.

---

### Psychostimulants and modafinil

Stimulants or modafinil may help with residual fatigue or cognitive symptoms, but **evidence is limited** [^112J5FPm] [^113Cf2Ty].

- **Methylphenidate**: 10–40 mg/day; insomnia/anxiety risk.
- **Modafinil**: 100–200 mg/day; insomnia/anxiety risk.
- **Evidence**: Limited; useful for fatigue/cognitive symptoms.

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

When adding a **third agent**, consider:

- **Drug interactions**: Serotonin syndrome, QT prolongation, CYP interactions [^111EzeEL].
- **Side effects**: Weight gain, metabolic syndrome, sedation, akathisia, mania.
- **Patient factors**: Comorbidities, preferences, prior responses.
- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment, labs, and measurement-based care [^111EvZL1].

## Recommended augmentation algorithm

| **Step** | **Augmentation strategy** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Aripiprazole or quetiapine [^111EzeEL] [^112zPuEw] | Strong | - FDA-approved <br/> - Monitor metabolic and EPS |
| 2 | Mirtazapine [^115WdF7i] | Moderate | - Sedating <br/> - Weight gain |
| 3 | Lithium [^113Cf2Ty] [^112J5FPm] | Strong | - Monitor renal <br/> - Thyroid <br/> - Levels |
| 4 | Liothyronine (T3) [^113Cf2Ty] | Moderate | - Monitor thyroid <br/> - Useful for fatigue |
| 5 | Psychostimulants or modafinil [^112J5FPm] | Limited | - Useful for fatigue <br/> - Monitor anxiety/insomnia |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The most evidence-based next step is to **add a second-generation antipsychotic** (aripiprazole or quetiapine) [^111EzeEL] to Wellbutrin and sertraline. If not tolerated, consider **mirtazapine, lithium, or liothyronine** [^115WdF7i] [^113Cf2Ty]. Use **measurement-based care** [^111EvZL1] and monitor for adverse effects, interactions, and suicidality [^112iPyMB].

### What are the comparative benefits and harms of augmentation treatments in major depression [^114VJXjM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients do not experience sufficient response to their initial antidepressant medication. Augmentation strategies, particularly the use of atypical antipsychotics to augment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have proliferated over the last 15 years. Two atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole and quetiapine, have received US Food and Drug Administration approval for adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant depression. Alternatively, data in treatment-resistant depression exist for most of the atypicals and for other treatments, including lithium, bupropion, methylphenidate, pindolol, and buspirone.

### Managing partial response or nonresponse: Switching, augmentation, and combination strategies for major depressive disorder [^113Cf2Ty]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the multitude of agents approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, approximately 50% of patients experience no response to treatment with a first-line antidepressant. Clinicians have four broad pharmacologic strategies to choose from for treating antidepressant nonresponders: increasing the dose of the antidepressant, switching to a different antidepressant, augmenting the treatment regimen with a nonantidepressant agent, and combining the original antidepressant with a second antidepressant.

At the time of writing, the most comprehensively studied treatment strategy for nonresponse or partial response to antidepressants is augmentation with atypical antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. However, augmentation or combination with other agents such as mirtazapine, mianserin, and omega-3 fatty acids is also supported by considerable efficacy data. Lithium, desipramine, triiodothyronine, and modafinil have mixed data. While more studies are needed, agents such as bupropion, desipramine, mecamylamine, and testosterone look promising.

Switching antidepressants, especially to the newer agents, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine, is also supported by considerable efficacy data. Clinicians should carefully reevaluate patients with major depressive disorder who are nonresponders to treatment, particularly those who have had several adequate trials. When choosing the best treatment strategy for antidepressant nonresponders, clinicians should take into account the efficacy and tolerability of the available options.

### Bupropion-SR, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR after failure of SSRIs for depression [^1144yeyY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

After unsuccessful treatment for depression with a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), it is not known whether switching to one antidepressant is more effective than switching to another.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 727 adult outpatients with a nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who had no remission of symptoms or could not tolerate the SSRI citalopram to receive one of the following drugs for up to 14 weeks: sustained-release bupropion (239 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 400 mg, sertraline (238 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 200 mg, or extended-release venlafaxine (250 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 375 mg. The study was conducted in 18 primary and 23 psychiatric care settings. The primary outcome was symptom remission, defined by a total score of 7 or less on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) at the end of the study. Scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR-16), obtained at treatment visits, determined secondary outcomes, including remission (a score of 5 or less at exit) and response (a reduction of 50 percent or more on baseline scores).

- **Results**: Remission rates as assessed by the HRSD-17 and the QIDS-SR-16, respectively, were 21.3 percent and 25.5 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 17.6 percent and 26.6 percent for sertraline, and 24.8 percent and 25.0 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. QIDS-SR-16 response rates were 26.1 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 26.7 percent for sertraline, and 28.2 percent for extended-release venlafaxine.

### Effects of bupropion augmentation on pro-inflammatory cytokines in escitalopram-resistant patients with major depressive disorder [^114WZbTc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Studies so far have provided contradictory results on immune system markers during the use of antidepressants. There are no data on changes in immune parameters after treatment augmentation. The present study aimed to clarify whether the addition of bupropion in escitalopram-resistant patients with major depression causes changes in the immune system and whether treatment response could be predicted by baseline levels of cytokines. We recruited 28 depressive patients (11 men and 17 women) who did not respond to a 12-week treatment with escitalopram (20 mg/d) for an augmentation trial with bupropion (150–300 mg/day). The levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha were measured before and 6 weeks after the addition of bupropion. For a control group, we recruited 45 healthy volunteers (19 men and 26 women). The results indicated that the baseline levels of studied cytokines did not predict treatment response to bupropion augmentation. The concentration of IL-8 increased during the treatment similarly in both responder and non-responder groups. Although bupropion augmentation had increased the response rate in escitalopram-resistant patients, this clinical improvement was not accompanied by specific changes in studied cytokine levels.

### Wellbutrin XL [^112KdZwp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Suicidal thoughts and behaviors**: Instruct patients, their families, and/or their caregivers to be alert to symptoms including:
	- Anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability
	- Hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness)
	- Hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior
	- Worsening of depression, suicidal ideation

	These symptoms are especially crucial to monitor early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Advise families and caregivers to observe for such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms like these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior, indicating a need for very close monitoring and possible changes in the medication.

- **Neuropsychiatric adverse events and suicide risk in smoking cessation treatment**: Inform patients that some individuals have experienced the following changes when attempting smoking cessation, although Wellbutrin XL is not indicated for this use:
	- Mood changes (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations
	- Paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility
	- Agitation, anxiety, panic, suicidal ideation, suicide

These mood and behavior changes have been observed with the active ingredient found in both Wellbutrin XL and Zyban.

### Mirtazapine added to SSRIs or SNRIs for treatment resistant depression in primary care: phase III randomised placebo controlled trial (MIR) [^117Evjrq]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

**What is already known on this topic**: Half of those in primary care who take antidepressants remain depressed despite adhering to treatment. There is a pharmacological rationale for adding mirtazapine, an antidepressant with a different and complementary mode of action, to the widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants — evidence from several small studies suggests that this combination might be effective. It was important to study this in primary care where most depression is diagnosed and managed, and this combination is used with increasing frequency.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^114aRKRY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications. This risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and others, show that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term clinical trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 subjects. The pooled analyses of placebo-cont…

### Mirtazapine added to SSRIs or SNRIs for treatment resistant depression in primary care: Phase III randomised placebo controlled trial (MIR) [^1124pY15]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Participants were followed up at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks. To maximize response rates, follow-up assessments at 12, 24, and 52 weeks were conducted at a face-to-face appointment with a researcher. If this was not possible, then questionnaires were posted or administered over the phone.

The primary outcome was the BDI II score at 12 weeks after randomization, measured as a continuous variable, adjusted for baseline. We aimed to recruit 200 participants in each group, giving 91% power to detect a difference of 0.33 standard deviations at a two-sided 5% significance level, which would be equivalent to a between-group difference of 3 or 4 points on the BDI II, reported to be a clinically important difference. Allowing for 15% loss to follow-up at 12 weeks, we planned to recruit 472 participants.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Response, defined as at least a 50% reduction in BDI II score compared with baseline; remission, defined as a score of less than 10 on the BDI II; depression using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), a brief measure included because it is widely used in primary care; anxiety symptoms measured with the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) assessment; adverse effects using the antidepressant side effect checklist; quality of life measured using the EQ-5D-5L; social and physical functioning using SF-12; and adherence to antidepressants using a four-item self-report measure. Secondary outcomes were measured at 12, 24 (excluding the antidepressant side effect checklist), and 52 weeks, with adjustments for baseline scores where appropriate.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in treatment-resistant depression [^116JUvqC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of depressed patients show only partial or no response to antidepressants, and even among responders to antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are rather common. When depression does not respond adequately to treatment with an antidepressant, clinicians may choose to keep the same antidepressant and add another "augmenting" compound. Augmentation strategies involve the use of a pharmacologic agent that is not considered a standard antidepressant but may boost or enhance the effect of an antidepressant. Alternatively, clinicians may choose combination strategies, in which they combine the antidepressant that did not produce an adequate response with another antidepressant, typically of a different class.

There are only a few controlled clinical trials of these two strategies among patients with treatment-resistant depression or among patients who have only partially benefited from antidepressant treatment. Most of the time, clinicians' decisions are guided by anecdotal reports, case series, and by some relatively smaller, uncontrolled clinical trials. These augmentation and combination strategies appear to be relatively safe and effective approaches to treatment-resistant depression, although there is a relative paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy.

These strategies typically aim to obtain a different neurochemical effect than the one obtained with the antidepressant that has not produced an adequate response. While drug-drug interactions may limit the use of some of these strategies, the potential loss of pa…

### Augmentation strategies to increase antidepressant efficacy [^115Uvm2Y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Augmentation strategies for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) are needed when patients with MDD have not tolerated or responded to antidepressant monotherapies. Clinicians can employ sequenced treatment steps, preferably coupled with the use of a treatment algorithm, to utilize augmentation strategies that will enable patients to achieve remission. The focus of augmentation therapy has been combining an antidepressant medication with another antidepressant; however, atypical antipsychotics are becoming commonly used to augment antidepressants. Beyond antidepressants and antipsychotics, alternative augmentation strategies include emerging pharmacologic treatments and nonpharmacologic strategies.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116apAE7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Although we examined treatment-resistant depression (TRD) severity as a dichotomous factor for its potential to influence treatment efficacy, we were neither able to look in detail at the different approaches used to assess treatment resistance, such as those compared to Massachusetts General Hospital staging models, nor did we categorize studies employing a sequential design or prospective open-label standardized treatment to determine TRD. Similarly, we did not examine the severity or chronicity of patients' depressive episodes as potential effect modifiers on clinical outcomes.

There are several other confounding factors that could have impacted effect sizes (ESs). These include blinding, incidences of unblinding, allegiance effects, statistical methods, the extent of the likely efficacy expectation effect, recruitment sources of patients, trial-specific eligibility criteria, generalizability (clinical or demographic), and treatment delivery. It is important to note that these effect modifiers may even differ between treatments, with newer interventions possibly subject to different methodologies than older interventions. In traditional between-subjects meta-analyses, these factors are largely accounted for within each study by direct group comparisons. Our comparison of within-subjects ESs between treatments does not account for this study-to-study variability directly.

### Wellbutrin SR [^114n3cS1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Neuropsychiatric adverse events and suicide risk in smoking cessation treatment**: Wellbutrin SR is not approved for smoking cessation treatment; however, it contains the same active ingredient as the smoking cessation medication Zyban. Serious neuropsychiatric adverse events have been reported in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation. These postmarketing reports have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. Some patients who stopped smoking may have been experiencing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, including depressed mood. Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in smokers undergoing a smoking cessation attempt without medication. However, some of these adverse events occurred in patients taking bupropion who continued to smoke.

	- Neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred in patients without and with pre-existing psychiatric disease; some patients experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses. Observe patients for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should stop taking Wellbutrin and contact a healthcare provider immediately if agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior.

How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call your healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

- **Thoughts about suicide or dying**: Attempts to commit suicide or new or worse depression.
- **New or worse anxiety**: Feeling very agitated or restless, panic attacks, trouble sleeping (insomnia), or new or worse irritability.
- **Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent**: Acting on dangerous impulses or an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania).
- **Other unusual changes** in behavior or mood.

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines? Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms. Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^117TyMdH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were randomized to at least one condition where either their continuation therapy was augmented by the addition of a second intervention, or simultaneous commencement of two interventions (two pharmacological agents or one pharmacological and one psychological therapy). For both pharmacological continuation and augmentation agents, treatments included in the Maudsley Treatment Inventory were permitted, in addition to pharmacological therapies that had reached significance in at least one meta-analysis for depression.

Psychological therapies from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, or those that had reached meta-analysis significance for treating MDD were deemed eligible. We made the decision to exclude neurostimulatory treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct stimulation, as exploration of these was considered beyond the scope of this review. Pharmacological or psychological comparators were examined in the review (i.e. pill placebo, a different pharmacological treatment, another psychological therapy, waiting list, or treatment as usual (TAU)), although other physical treatment comparators (e.g. ECT) were not considered in the review.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported clinical improvement of depression following treatment. Our primary outcome measure was the clinical improvement of depression (or depression symptoms).

- **Study quality and RoB**: This section contains the RoB ratings across criteria and studies. The RoB ratings were mostly low (n = 57) to moderate (n = 51), with only 5% (n = 6) of studies being adjudged to have a high RoB. The RoB criterion most commonly identified was 'allegiance', likely due to potential conflicts of interest between pharmaceutical companies funding research into their medications. The mean RoB ratings were stratified by treatment classes studied.

- **Primary outcomes**: The results of the meta-analyses are detailed in Table 1, with subgroup analyses investigating treatment-resistant depression (TRD) severity and duration of treatment. Below, the meta-analysis results for the most frequently investigated interventions are described. Figure 2 presents the results of treatments studied in more than three studies as a forest plot.

- **Table 1**: Results of meta-analyses detailing intervention-level data. Standard error, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and I² heterogeneity are reported. This table includes studies regardless of TRD severity or treatment duration, which differed in their contribution to heterogeneity. However, it excludes high RoB and combination studies, which added heterogeneity to analyses.

### Management of patients with treatment-resistant depression [^115UtnfY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression can be attributed to multiple causes, including nonadherence to medication and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Selecting the appropriate strategy for a patient with treatment-resistant depression — whether it be a single antidepressant, a combination of medications, or a nonpharmacologic method — depends on a correct determination of the cause of the patient's resistance to treatment.

### Wellbutrin SR [^115ejt9n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications. This risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and others, show that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term clinical trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults beyond age 24. There was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short‑term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 subjects.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116DgY3w]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Progressing towards optimized evidence-based guidelines, our demonstration of (es)ketamine being well-studied with high efficacy adds to the literature, indicating the potential for inclusion in guidelines. It is not currently recommended as a first-line augmentation strategy in major national or international guidelines. Its highest position is in the MPG where it is considered a second-line choice, but some older guidelines do not recommend this yet.

Likewise, bupropion appears effective and well-studied in early-stage TRD, albeit with marked heterogeneity, but is only regarded as a first-line pharmacological augmenter by one of the major national or international guidelines (MPG). Furthermore, its efficacy, safety, and tolerability in MDD have been reasonably demonstrated. Monotherapeutic bupropion is not currently licensed for MDD in some countries, such as the UK; therefore, we would cautiously recommend that the licensing status of bupropion in the UK be reconsidered.

Finally, despite a general paucity of evidence overall for psychological therapies, the effect size of CBT was greater than for other treatments, and although CBT is recommended in national guidelines for treating MDD, it is rarely specifically recommended as a therapy for TRD. Given the results presented in this work, we suggest reconsideration of this position.

In summary, in this large synthesis of augmentation and combination treatments of pharmacological and psychological treatments for TRD, we find both pharmacological and psychological therapies show larger treatment effects than placebo.

### Managing treatment-resistant major depression [^111Ut3ER]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A sizable proportion of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression experience only partial or no clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Switching, augmenting, and combining various pharmaceutical agents can be effective strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The empirical evidence supporting these approaches is inconsistent, however, and there is a paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. Additionally, it has been difficult to demonstrate the advantages of these strategies over increasing the dose or duration of the initial drug treatment.

This article reviews available evidence and clinical considerations regarding switching, augmenting, and combining various agents in the treatment of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression who have failed adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. More research is needed that controls for continued time on the initial agent, that compares different strategies, and that determines which patients are the best candidates for which treatment.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in resistant depression [^115edWSK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

A minority of patients with depression achieve remission with first-line antidepressant treatment; consequently, a second medication is often added to enhance the effects of the initial agent. The second medication may or may not be another antidepressant. Clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of many agents commonly used for augmentation or combination therapy, but well-designed, large trials with a clear definition of treatment resistance are needed.

### Wellbutrin XL [^113KXdGQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Wellbutrin XL is an aminoketone antidepressant, indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the prevention of seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

- **Major depressive disorder (MDD)**: Wellbutrin XL® (bupropion hydrochloride extended-release) tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The efficacy of the immediate-release formulation of bupropion was established in two 4-week controlled inpatient trials and one 6-week controlled outpatient trial of adult patients with MDD. The efficacy of the sustained-release formulation of bupropion in the maintenance treatment of MDD was established in a long-term (up to 44 weeks), placebo-controlled trial in patients who had responded to bupropion in an 8-week study of acute treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)**: Wellbutrin XL is indicated for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder. The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes was established in three placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients with a history of MDD with an autumn-winter seasonal pattern as defined in the DSM [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### To combine or not to combine? A literature review of antidepressant combination therapy [^115UgHAK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is a common clinical problem and a major public health concern. The use of antidepressant combinations to overcome treatment resistance, while somewhat controversial, is a popular strategy in practice. This paper reviews published trials on combination antidepressants to inform clinical practice.

- **Method**: A systematic but selective review of the published literature was conducted using EMBASE, PSYCHLIT, and MEDLINE with relevant search terms.

- **Results**: Several trials suggesting the efficacy of combination antidepressants were found. These are incorporated into numerous treatment guidelines for managing treatment-refractory depression. Clinicians should be cautious regarding pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, including serotonin syndrome. However, combination strategies are an effective option.

- **Conclusions**: Many antidepressants can be usefully combined, especially if they engage separate mechanisms of action. Clinically, antidepressant combinations provide a useful resort in otherwise treatment-resistant individuals. However, much further research is needed to determine relative efficacy and long-term outcomes.

### Wellbutrin SR [^115VKB8F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Although there are not yet independent trials demonstrating the antidepressant effectiveness of the sustained-release formulation of bupropion, trials have demonstrated the bioequivalence of the immediate-release and sustained-release forms of bupropion under steady-state conditions. Specifically, bupropion sustained-release 150 mg taken twice daily has been shown to be bioequivalent to 100 mg taken three times daily of the immediate-release formulation of bupropion with regard to both rate and extent of absorption for the parent drug and metabolites.

In a longer-term trial, outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an 8-week open trial on Wellbutrin SR (150 mg twice daily) were randomized to continue their same dose of Wellbutrin SR or switch to a placebo for up to 44 weeks to observe relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) for each of the final 3 weeks. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the investigator's judgment that drug treatment was necessary due to worsening depressive symptoms. Patients receiving continued treatment with Wellbutrin SR experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 44 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.

### Enhancing outcomes in the management of treatment resistant depression: A focus on atypical antipsychotics [^114MurXs]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical trials indicate that over 50% of depressed patients show an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy, and that incomplete recovery from major depressive disorder (MDD) increases the risk of chronicity and recurrence. Recovery, complete remission of symptoms, and a return to baseline psychosocial function should be the goal of therapy. Poor response to adequate antidepressant treatment has been termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Issues such as adherence and missed diagnosis of psychotic depression, bipolar disorder, or comorbid anxiety must be investigated as reasons why patients have not responded to initial therapeutic strategies.

Beyond ensuring optimal use of the index antidepressant, treatment strategies for TRD include switching to another antidepressant, and augmentation or combination with two or more agents. Since little comparative data exist, it is important to consider side-effect burden, partial response, and previous medication history when deciding between strategies. In patients with TRD, adding or augmenting with lithium, tri-iodothyronine, or atypical antipsychotics has demonstrated benefits. Augmentation with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and quetiapine, shows promising results in terms of improving remission rates.

Other interventions, including non-pharmacologic strategies and investigational physical treatments, have demonstrated some benefits, but availability and patient preference should also be considered. With today's therapeutic alternatives, full remission of depression is an attainable goal.

### A randomized, single-blind, comparison of duloxetine with bupropion in the treatment of SSRI-resistant major depression [^117K8Ara]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

For patients who continue to experience depressive symptoms despite an adequate antidepressant SSRI trial, an across-class switch is considered one of the best treatment options. The goal of the present work was to compare, in terms of efficacy, two different dual-action compounds: duloxetine and bupropion, in patients who failed to respond in two consecutive antidepressant trials with SSRIs.

- **Methods**: The patients were allocated randomly to duloxetine (120 mg daily) or bupropion extended release (300 mg daily). The intended medication period was six weeks. The primary measure of efficacy was depressive symptoms severity.

- **Results**: A total of 49 participants were randomly assigned to duloxetine 120 mg (n = 27) or bupropion 300 mg (n = 22). The ITT efficacy patient sample consisted of 46 patients. Relatively high response and remission rates in treatment groups were found: 60% to 70% of patients responded to treatment, and approximately 30% to 40% were in remission by the endpoint (week six). No statistically significant difference emerged between the two groups at any post-baseline assessment, neither on mean scores of rating scales nor on qualitative efficacy measures.

- **Limits**: Limitations of the study include the lack of a placebo arm, which was difficult to include owing to ethical reasons, and the relatively small size of the sample.

- **Conclusions**: These preliminary results seem to support the hypothesis that in patients unresponsive to SSRIs, the administration of antidepressants with different mechanisms of action is an effective switching strategy. Further studies are needed.

### Wellbutrin SR [^114HGZLW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Wellbutrin SR (bupropion hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The efficacy of bupropion in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in two 4-week controlled inpatient trials and one 6-week controlled outpatient trial of adult subjects with MDD [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The efficacy of Wellbutrin SR in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Wellbutrin SR is an aminoketone antidepressant, indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

### Antidepressant combinations: Cutting edge psychopharmacology or passing fad [^112XAEf8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This article reviews the rationale for and history of combining antidepressants, as well as the state of the evidence in the treatment of major depression. Although it has long been suggested that some individuals may benefit from regimens that combine two dissimilar antidepressants, enthusiasm for this practice has waxed and waned, and there was never a strong empirical foundation to support this practice. The tangibly better safety profiles of the newer generation antidepressants, both singly and in combination, have permitted greater use of such combinations in contemporary practice than ever before.

Combinations that pair a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with a dissimilar antidepressant, such as bupropion or mirtazapine, are now widely used for patients who have not responded to trials of first- or second-line antidepressant monotherapies and have been tested as a potential way of speeding the benefits of treatment. However, there still is no strong evidence that even the most widely used combinations have particular merit, and clinicians should be mindful that alternatives exist with more established efficacy. Moreover, aside from selected cases of drug-drug interactions, it may take full therapeutic doses of both drugs across a typically adequate duration of exposure to achieve the desired effects of combined treatment.

### Treatment-resistant depression: prevalence, risk factors, and treatment strategies [^1117eMwL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Full symptomatic remission is the optimal outcome for patients with major depression. Unfortunately, initial antidepressant efficacy is limited to a partial response for many patients. Incomplete remission of depressive symptoms is associated with increased risk of relapse, decreased functioning in work and social settings, and increased risk of suicide. Factors that increase the likelihood of treatment resistance include chronicity, severe symptomatology, and comorbid illnesses.

Strategies to manage patients who do not respond to an initial course of antidepressant medication include optimizing the dose, switching antidepressants, or adding adjunctive treatment (i.e. psychotherapy or a second medication). Augmentation may be the preferred strategy for improving response if tolerability to the original agent is acceptable and the initial medication has had some beneficial effects. Tracking patients' depressive symptoms with standardized measurement tools during the course of treatment is necessary for identifying incomplete remission and providing appropriate treatment modification.

### Combining antidepressants for treatment-resistant depression: A review [^115ckRNH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Many patients with depression remain poorly responsive to antidepressant monotherapy. One approach to managing treatment-resistant depression is to combine antidepressants to capitalize on multiple therapeutic mechanisms of action. This review critically evaluates the evidence for the efficacy of combining antidepressants.

A MEDLINE search of the last 15 years (up to June 2001), supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to select studies included published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals, diagnosis of depression with partial or no response to standard treatments, any combination of two antidepressants with both agents used to enhance antidepressant response, outcome measurement of clinical response, and a sample size of four or more subjects.

Twenty-seven studies (total N = 667) met the inclusion criteria, including five randomized controlled trials and 22 open-label trials. In the 24 studies (total N = 601) reporting response rates, the overall mean response rate was 62.2%. Methodological limitations included variability in definitions of treatment-resistant depression and response to treatment, dosing of medications, and reporting of adverse events.

There is limited evidence, mostly from uncontrolled studies, supporting the efficacy of combination antidepressant treatment. Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination antidepressant strategy for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Which patients benefit from adding short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy to antidepressants in the treatment of depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data [^112yqUwC]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and IPD meta-analysis to examine which patients benefit from adding STPP to antidepressants in the treatment of depression. Across the seven studies identified by a thorough literature search, we found baseline HAMD and episode duration moderating post-treatment efficacy, and baseline HAMD and anxiety disorder comorbidity moderating efficacy at follow-up. Adding STPP to antidepressants was more efficacious for participants with high baseline depression levels, for participants with episode durations of more than two years, and for participants without a comorbid anxiety disorder.

Regarding baseline depression, our findings align with work reporting treatment effects to increase with symptom severity for antidepressants [Stone, Kalaria, Richardville, & Miller], psychotherapy [Driessen, Cuijpers, Hollon, & Dekker], and the addition of the cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy to antidepressants [Furukawa et al.]. Thus, baseline severity appears to moderate depression treatment efficacy in general rather than applying to STPP specifically. These findings imply that, relative to low-severity patients, high-severity patients are in more need of treatments with specific effects to achieve wellness [Driessen et al.].

Concerning episode duration, our findings align with studies demonstrating the effects of psychodynamic therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression [Fonagy et al; Town, Abbass, Stride, & Bernier], who typically suffer from long-duration episodes.

### The use of antidepressants in novel combination therapies [^112Wa2nY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Antidepressant monotherapy is used more often than other therapies to achieve symptom remission in depressed patients; however, for patients resistant to antidepressants, other strategies are necessary. Many novel combination therapies have been proposed to treat resistant depression. The efficacy of combination therapies, such as lithium augmentation of antidepressants, is supported by a large amount of evidence, including data from controlled trials. Nonetheless, anecdotal reports suggest that these combinations are underutilized. Data from studies of the use of the combination of atypical antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors suggest that this is a particularly promising therapeutic avenue. However, more research is needed to corroborate these early results.

### Exploration of baseline and early changes in neurocognitive characteristics as predictors of treatment response to bupropion, sertraline, and placebo in the EMBARC clinical trial [^112mxo7u]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) is imprecise and often involves trial-and-error to determine the most effective approach. To facilitate optimal treatment selection and inform timely adjustments, the study investigated whether neurocognitive variables could predict an antidepressant response in a treatment-specific manner.

- **Methods**: In the two-stage Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial, outpatients with non-psychotic recurrent MDD were first randomized to an 8-week course of sertraline (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or placebo. Behavioral measures of reward responsiveness, cognitive control, verbal fluency, psychomotor, and cognitive processing speeds were collected at baseline and week 1. Treatment responders then continued for another 8-week course of the same medication, whereas non-responders to sertraline or placebo were crossed-over under double-blinded conditions to bupropion (a noradrenaline/dopamine reuptake inhibitor) or sertraline, respectively. Hamilton Rating for Depression scores were also assessed at baseline, weeks 8, and 16.

- **Results**: Greater improvements in psychomotor and cognitive processing speeds within the first week, as well as better pretreatment performance in these domains, were specifically associated with a higher likelihood of response to placebo. Moreover, better reward responsiveness, poorer cognitive control, and greater verbal fluency were associated with a greater likelihood of response to bupropion in patients who previously failed to respond to other treatments.

### Comparing the rapidity of response during treatment of major depressive disorder with bupropion and the SSRIs: a pooled survival analysis of 7 double-blind, randomized clinical trials [^112no6zg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Several controlled studies, as well as a meta-analysis, suggest that the efficacy of bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is comparable to that of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The analysis was undertaken to determine if these antidepressants differ in rapidity of clinical effect.

- **Method**: Individual patient data were obtained from 7 double-blind, randomized studies of 8 weeks' duration that compared bupropion (N = 836) and SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and escitalopram; N = 836). Time to first response and first remission were compared between treatment groups using Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by trial number, with depression severity at baseline as a covariate. A secondary analysis compared outcomes in the 2 bupropion versus escitalopram studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were then conducted to confirm the survival-analysis findings.

- **Results**: There was no statistically significant difference between bupropion and the SSRIs in time to first response (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.955; p = .43) and first remission (HR = 1.00; p = .97). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference between bupropion and escitalopram in time to first response (HR = 0.897; p = .29), and first remission (HR = 0.999; p = .99). These results were confirmed with the use of random-effects meta-analyses (p > .05, all 4 analyses).

- **Conclusion**: There does not appear to be any statistically detectable difference in the rapidity of antidepressant effect between bupropion and the SSRIs.

### A novel augmentation strategy for treating resistant major depression [^114dJJyS]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is a significant public health concern; drug switching or augmentation often produces limited results. The authors hypothesized that fluoxetine could be augmented with olanzapine to successfully treat resistant depression.

An 8-week double-blind study was conducted with 28 patients diagnosed with recurrent, nonbipolar, treatment-resistant depression without psychotic features. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: olanzapine plus placebo, fluoxetine plus placebo, or olanzapine plus fluoxetine.

Fluoxetine monotherapy produced minimal improvement on various scales that rate the severity of depression. The benefits of olanzapine monotherapy were modest. Olanzapine plus fluoxetine produced significantly greater improvement than either monotherapy on one measure and significantly greater improvement than olanzapine monotherapy on the other measures after 1 week. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on extrapyramidal measures nor significant adverse drug interactions.

Olanzapine plus fluoxetine demonstrated superior efficacy for treating resistant depression compared to either agent alone.

### A case of bupropion-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome with acute psoriatic exacerbation [^1153SFAS]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Bupropion is a very popular medication prescribed to millions of patients globally for depression (Wellbutrin, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) as well as an aid in smoking cessation (Zyban, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). It has been reported to have some common dermatologic side effects, such as pruritus, urticaria, and serum-sickness-like reaction. The authors report a case of bupropion-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) with a concomitant acute psoriatic exacerbation in a 56-year-old woman who began taking bupropion for the treatment of depression. While the United States (U.S.) prescribing information for bupropion does include SJS as a rare potential side effect, it does not mention the worsening of psoriasis. Physicians should be aware of the potential life-threatening adverse effects of this commonly prescribed medication as well as the risk in patients with known psoriasis.

### Mirtazapine added to SSRIs or SNRIs for treatment resistant depression in primary care: Phase III randomised placebo controlled trial (MIR) [^111guHdL]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

- **Comparison to other studies**: Two earlier small studies, one involving treatment-resistant patients and another involving those who had responded to previous treatment, reported that mirtazapine in combination with an SSRI showed greater improvement than monotherapy. A further recent study also indicated benefits in non-resistant patients, noting that mirtazapine was well tolerated in combination with either an SSRI or venlafaxine (an SNRI). The STAR*D study compared venlafaxine plus mirtazapine with tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant. Although the combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed a modest advantage over the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, no placebo group was included in this comparison. The large CO-MED (Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes) randomized trial compared the combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine with escitalopram (an SSRI) and placebo in patients with either major depression or chronic depression lasting at least two years. Response rates did not differ between the two groups; however, the burden of adverse effects was greater in the combined antidepressant group. Those recruited into CO-MED differed from our study population in that they were not necessarily taking an antidepressant at baseline.

- **Unanswered questions**: Half of those who take antidepressants in an adequate dose for an adequate duration remain depressed. This represents a substantial burden of illness and an unmet or inadequately met need. Although many patients in this group can benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, it is not always readily available.

### Combination of antidepressant medications from treatment initiation for major depressive disorder: a double-blind randomized study [^117LPjiQ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). High credibility.

Various classes of antidepressant medications generally induce remission of major depressive disorder in only about one-third of patients. In a previous study using mirtazapine or paroxetine alone or in combination from treatment initiation, the rate of patients who achieved remission within a 6-week period was twice that of patients using either drug alone. In this double-blind study, the authors sought to produce evidence for the superiority of different combinations of antidepressant drugs from treatment initiation.

- **Method**: Patients (N = 105) meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive, from treatment initiation, either fluoxetine monotherapy (20 mg/day) or mirtazapine (30 mg/day) in combination with fluoxetine (20 mg/day), venlafaxine (225 mg/day titrated in 14 days), or bupropion (150 mg/day) for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score.

- **Results**: The overall dropout rate was 15%, without notable differences among the four groups. Compared with fluoxetine monotherapy, all three combination groups had significantly greater improvements on the HAM-D. Remission rates (defined as a HAM-D score of 7 or less) were 25% for fluoxetine, 52% for mirtazapine plus fluoxetine, 58% for mirtazapine plus venlafaxine, and 46% for mirtazapine plus bupropion. Among patients who had a marked response, double-blind discontinuation of one agent resulted in a relapse in about 40% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: The combination treatments were as well tolerated as fluoxetine monotherapy and more clinically effective.

### Antidepressant augmentation versus switch in treatment-resistant geriatric depression [^112zPuEw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The benefits and risks of augmenting or switching antidepressants in older adults with treatment-resistant depression have not been extensively studied.

- **Methods**: We conducted a two-step, open-label trial involving adults 60 years of age or older with treatment-resistant depression. In step 1, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to augmentation of existing antidepressant medication with aripiprazole, augmentation with bupropion, or a switch from existing antidepressant medication to bupropion. Patients who did not benefit from or were ineligible for step 1 were randomly assigned in step 2 in a 1:1 ratio to augmentation with lithium or a switch to nortriptyline. Each step lasted approximately 10 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in psychological well-being, assessed with the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction subscales (population mean, 50; higher scores indicate greater well-being). A secondary outcome was remission of depression.

- **Results**: In step 1, a total of 619 patients were enrolled; 211 were assigned to aripiprazole augmentation, 206 to bupropion augmentation, and 202 to a switch to bupropion. Well-being scores improved by 4.83 points, 4.33 points, and 2.04 points, respectively. The difference between the aripiprazole-augmentation group and the switch-to-bupropion group was 2.79 points (95% CI, 0.56 to 5.02; P = 0.014, with a prespecified threshold P value of 0.017); the between-group differences were not significant for aripiprazole augmentation versus bupropion augmentation.

### Mirtazapine added to SSRIs or SNRIs for treatment resistant depression in primary care: phase III randomised placebo controlled trial (MIR) [^115WdF7i]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Statistical analysis and reporting were conducted in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, based on a prespecified statistical analysis plan approved by the trial steering committee. Primary analyses compared the two groups as randomized, without imputing missing values. Depending on the type of outcome variable — continuous or binary — we used linear or logistic regression models to compare the groups as randomized, adjusting for stratification and minimization variables and, where available, the corresponding baseline value.

Secondary analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes included additional adjustments for variables showing noticeable imbalance at baseline, ascertained using descriptive statistics. In these analyses, we present regression coefficients (or odds ratios for binary outcomes) with 95% confidence intervals and P values. Effect sizes for the BDI II outcomes are presented and calculated based on Cohen's d statistic.

In prespecified subgroup analyses, we introduced appropriate interaction terms into the regression models to investigate differential effects according to baseline severity of depression (BDI II). We also performed a multilevel measure of the degree of treatment resistance based on the duration of symptoms and previous treatment with antidepressants. This latter variable was categorized as: not prescribed antidepressants in the past; prescribed antidepressants in the past and depressed for less than one year; prescribed antidepressants in the past and depressed for one or two years; and prescribed antidepressants in the past and depressed for more than two years.

### Combining medications to enhance depression outcomes (CO-MED): Acute and long-term outcomes of a single-blind randomized study [^111EvZL1]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Two antidepressant medication combinations were compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy to determine whether either combination produced a higher remission rate in first-step acute-phase (12 weeks) and long-term (7 months) treatment.

The single-blind, prospective, randomized trial enrolled 665 outpatients at six primary and nine psychiatric care sites. Participants had at least moderately severe, nonpsychotic chronic, and/or major depressive disorder. Escitalopram (up to 20 mg/day) plus placebo, sustained-release bupropion (up to 400 mg/day) plus escitalopram (up to 20 mg/day), or extended-release venlafaxine (up to 300 mg/day) plus mirtazapine (up to 45 mg/day) was delivered (1:1:1 ratio) by using measurement-based care. The primary outcome was remission, defined as ratings of less than 8 and less than 6 on the last two consecutive applications of the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology — Self-Report. Secondary outcomes included side effect burden, adverse events, quality of life, functioning, and attrition.

Remission and response rates and most secondary outcomes were not different among treatment groups at 12 weeks. The remission rates were 38.8% for escitalopram-placebo, 38.9% for bupropion-escitalopram, and 37.7% for venlafaxine-mirtazapine, and the response rates were 51.6%-52.4%. The mean number of worsening adverse events was higher for venlafaxine-mirtazapine (5.7) than for escitalopram-placebo (4.7). At 7 months, remission rates (41.8%-46.6%), response rates (57.4%-59.4%), and most secondary outcomes were observed.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for complicated depression [^111FuA3Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately half of the patients with depression do not respond or only partially respond to first-line antidepressant monotherapy. To enhance treatment response, the treating clinician may choose to augment the antidepressant with a non-antidepressant agent or combine the initial antidepressant with another antidepressant, typically of another class. Although the augmentation and combination strategies reviewed here appear relatively safe and effective, additional controlled studies are needed to compare these treatment options, guide treatment selection for individual patients, and answer questions regarding the duration of combination or augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Mirtazapine added to SSRIs or SNRIs for treatment resistant depression in primary care: Phase III randomised placebo controlled trial (MIR) [^113Qy6Wk]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

No between-group difference was found for adverse effects using the antidepressant side effect checklist at 12 weeks (Table 3). We also collected spontaneous participant reports of adverse effects. In the first 12 weeks, most reported adverse effects were minor. Eleven serious adverse events resulted in hospital admission, of which eight occurred in the intervention group (see supplementary Table A5). More patients in the intervention group reported non-serious adverse effects, with 46 participants reporting adverse effects in this group stopping their drug compared with nine in the placebo group (Table 4).

- **Table 4: Most common types of adverse events (AEs) spontaneously reported by participants at 12 weeks from randomisation**

SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; SNRI = serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor.

We compared our analyses of the primary outcome using complete cases with analyses tackling missing data. The findings using complete cases seemed to be robust to various assumptions about missing data (see supplementary Table A6).

We found no evidence that either of the two preplanned subgroup analyses had any effect on the difference between the mirtazapine and placebo groups (P = 0.101 for interaction with treatment group for baseline depression severity; P = 0.30 for interaction with treatment group for treatment resistance).

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^115yhizH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

With the exception of OFC, each treatment combination, i.e. two intervention/controls initiated simultaneously, had only been assessed in one study per combination and with wide-ranging effect sizes (ES). Given the methodological differences between these studies, no conclusions can presently be made about specific combinations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Additional analyses stratifying between early-stage and substantive TRD criteria required for inclusion in each study are presented. For all treatments studied, the ES 95% confidence interval (CI) had large overlaps when comparing studies defining TRD as 1 failed treatment (FT) and 2 failed treatments (FTs), suggesting treatment efficacy was not sensitive to TRD definition. The exception to this rule was buspirone, where the ES and 95% CIs were considerably higher when TRD was defined as 2 FTs (1 FT: ES = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.61–1.07; 2 FTs: ES = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.14–2.02), although this consisted of only one small study.

- **Subgroup analyses**: Additional analyses stratifying treatment ES by the duration of study treatment are presented. As previously mentioned, study durations were defined as "short-term" (12 weeks). Perhaps surprisingly, subgroups of "short-term" and "adequate duration" studies did not result in any consistent findings concerning treatment efficacy. Approximately half of the treatments studied in this subgroup analysis showed an ES increase when focusing on studies conducted over an "adequate" duration, while the other half did not.

### Augmentation strategies to increase antidepressant tolerability [^113ZZMvp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The goal of antidepressant treatment is full remission; however, adverse events prevent many patients from reaching and sustaining this goal. It is important to make a differential diagnosis between antidepressant side effects and adverse events related to other causes. Antidepressant side effects may be transient or persistent and may occur early or later in treatment. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies can be used to improve the tolerability of antidepressants, resulting in a greater probability of achieving and sustaining remission.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with depressive disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of bupropion in combination with naltrexone for patients with amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder with co-occurring depressive disorders.

### Switching treatments for complicated depression [^116REw2c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients will not experience remission when treated with a first-line antidepressant. As a next-step strategy for patients who achieve partial response to the initial antidepressant, clinicians may opt to augment the first antidepressant with another medication or combine it with a second antidepressant. For nonresponders or for patients experiencing intolerable side effects, clinicians may choose to switch medications. Switching can be done within the same drug class to obtain different pharmacologic properties, or to another class to obtain a different neurochemical effect. Switching appears to be fairly well tolerated and effective for patients with treatment-resistant depression, but should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and preferences.

### Switching antidepressants for treatment-resistant major depression [^116HVjWS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of patients suffering from major depression experience insufficient clinical response, despite appropriate treatment. Switching to a different monotherapy antidepressant medication is the preferred option for many patients and clinicians. The possible advantages of switching to a different monotherapy, as compared to adding a second agent (i.e. augmenting or combining), include reduced medication costs, fewer drug interactions, better adherence, and less patient burden over time. Response rates for switching are based largely on open trials, which reveal a response rate of approximately 50%. These response rates are comparable to the response rates reported with augmentation or combination, again established largely by noncomparative open trials. This review article summarizes clinical considerations and available evidence regarding switching antidepressants in the treatment of major depression. Practical issues, such as when to consider switching and how to switch from one medication to another, are addressed.

### Using mechanism of action to choose medications for treatment-resistant depression [^111TamRB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Remission rates for depression continue to be low, and many patients require complex treatment regimens for optimal response. Many physicians may not fully understand how and why depression medications work or which ones will complement each other. This CME webcast covers the different mechanisms of action of pharmacotherapeutic options for depression, including both monotherapy and adjunctive medications. It demonstrates to clinicians how to use their understanding of mechanisms of action to choose the most effective treatment strategy, especially for patients with treatment-resistant or difficult-to-treat depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^117VTy5M]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric conditions, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of approximately 12%. MDD imposes a substantial burden of illness and is the leading cause of disability internationally. The most common treatments for MDD are broadly classified as pharmacological or psychological, with a multitude of different treatments from each category available.

A significant proportion of patients with MDD do not respond to treatments and are considered 'treatment resistant'. Although there is no universally accepted definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), the most frequently used criterion is the failure to respond to two trials of pharmacological therapy of adequate dose and duration, in the episode. Less commonly, failure of psychological therapies is also considered to contribute towards the definition of treatment resistance.

- **Thase and Rush model**: The most widely used staging model of TRD. In this model, failure to respond to one adequate antidepressant trial from a major antidepressant class is considered Stage I TRD. Those who then do not respond to a second adequate antidepressant trial (from a different class than the antidepressant used in Stage I) are termed Stage II TRD. There are variations between measures, studies, and groups in terms of requiring a second antidepressant to be from a different class. It has been suggested that permitting two 'failed' treatments from within a class, and permitting psychological treatments, should be incorporated into updated definitions.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^112rUhQn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool. Using this tool, nine domains were assessed: appropriate and clearly focused research question, allocation sequence randomly generated, allocation adequately concealed, knowledge of allocation adequately prevented, group comparability at baseline ensured, differences among multiple sites adequately addressed (if applicable), selective outcome reporting avoided, intention-to-treat analysis applied, and presence of for-profit bias (allegiance). Studies were assessed by two authors, and an RoB rating (high, low, or unclear) was given for each of the categories above. Disagreements were resolved by senior authors. Each study was then assigned an overall RoB rating of low, moderate, or high based on previous criteria.

- **Measures of treatment effect**: Continuous data that described treatment effectiveness were extracted (e.g. pre- and post-severity scores or longitudinal change in severity scores) and presented as a standardized mean difference (Hedges' g effect size). Using a random-effects model, meta-analyses computed a pooled effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the I² statistic. Statistical heterogeneity was considered high if I² exceeded 60% and was explored using subgroups. The following comparisons were planned to assess the primary outcome:

	- Pooled effects of augmentation or combination intervention/comparator categories (i.e. psychological treatment, psychological comparator, pharmacological treatment, and pharmacological comparator)

### Wellbutrin XL [^111gz6mQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A longer-term, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial demonstrated the efficacy of bupropion HCl sustained-release in the maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The trial included adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD, who had responded during an 8-week open-label trial of bupropion 300 mg per day. Responders were randomized to continuation of bupropion 300 mg per day or placebo for up to 44 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined as a CGI-Improvement Scale score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) for each of the final 3 weeks. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the investigator's judgment that drug treatment was needed for worsening depressive symptoms. Patients in the bupropion group experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 44 weeks compared to those in the placebo group.

Although there are no independent trials demonstrating the efficacy of Wellbutrin XL in the acute treatment of MDD, studies have demonstrated similar bioavailability between the immediate-, sustained-, and extended-release formulations of bupropion HCl under steady-state conditions (i.e. the exposures [Cmax and AUC] for bupropion and its metabolites are similar among the three formulations).

### Mirtazapine added to SSRIs or SNRIs for treatment resistant depression in primary care: phase III randomised placebo controlled trial (MIR) [^116MHrnW]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

- **Strengths and weaknesses of this study**: Participants, investigators, and assessors were blind to the allocation up to and including the primary outcome at 12 weeks. Follow-up rates throughout the trial were good at all sites, with overall follow-up rates of 90% at 12 weeks, 84% at 24 weeks, and 81% at 52 weeks. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of missing data on the analysis of the primary outcome. Whether the missing data were estimated under the assumption of a best or worst-case scenario or using multiple imputation, the observed difference in BDI II scores at 12 weeks between treatment groups was small. Some minor baseline imbalances existed between the two groups, but adjustment for these did not materially affect the results.

The criteria for defining inadequate response to treatment that we adopted have been used elsewhere in primary care research and were designed to be inclusive while reflecting treatment guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Our approach accords with the Maudsley staging method, where treatment failure after an adequate dose of an antidepressant for six weeks is an important starting point on a continuum of treatment failure. The authors point out that in addition to treatment failure, severity and duration of depression are important dimensions of treatment resistance. Nearly all (90%) of our participants had been taking an antidepressant for at least six months, and the range of symptom severity in our sample was evenly spread between mild to moderate, moderate to severe, and severe groups.

### Wellbutrinxl [^113hZcxt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality), or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and others, show that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; rather, there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^1161rWGP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about the drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e. beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

- **Monitoring requirements**: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases [see Boxed Warning].

- **Symptoms reported**: The following symptoms have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric: anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania. Although a causal link between these symptoms and either the worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for depression [^112J5FPm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression represents a common problem, with the vast majority of depressed patients showing incomplete response to antidepressant trials. Augmentation and combination strategies are commonly employed to address this problem, but there are few randomized, controlled studies to guide treatment choice. Indeed, some of the most common augmentation strategies in depression are those with the least controlled evidence. The popularity of bupropion, psychostimulants, and atypical antipsychotics as augmentors may not be warranted by existing controlled studies, whereas two less commonly used augmentors — lithium and thyroid hormone — have substantial controlled evidence to support their use. This paper summarizes the state of the evidence for commonly used augmenting strategies and explores preliminary findings for more investigational approaches.
