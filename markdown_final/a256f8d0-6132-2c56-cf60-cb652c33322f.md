## Question

what is the treatment plan for medial tibial stress sybdrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment plan for medial tibial stress syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the initial management priorities, including load modification and pain control. Next, I will examine targeted rehabilitation, biomechanical interventions, and adjunctive therapies. After that, I need to consider advanced or refractory options, including ESWT and surgery. Finally, I should integrate prevention, monitoring, and a practical timeline, while double-checking the strength of evidence for each recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude high-stakes mimics, because MTSS presents as diffuse posteromedial tibial pain over at least 5 cm that is exercise-induced and often lingers after activity, and I need to ensure I am not missing a stress fracture or compartment syndrome. Plain radiographs are reasonable initially to screen for overt fractures, but MRI is the modality of choice when symptoms persist or when I suspect a stress fracture or pseudofracture, given its sensitivity and specificity for bone stress injuries and cortical lesions, so I should not jump to conclusions without imaging when red flags are present [^71905689] [^eca9d95b] [^9d16d9b7].

> Wait, let me verify the differential and when to escalate imaging. Focal, pinpoint tenderness and pain at rest push me toward stress fracture, whereas diffuse tenderness and pain that abates with rest favor MTSS; if uncertainty remains or symptoms persist beyond a few weeks, MRI helps distinguish MTSS from stress fracture, pseudofracture, or other causes of leg pain, and I should remember that pseudofractures can masquerade as MTSS and require vitamin D repletion rather than prolonged rest alone [^7ea626b8] [^9d16d9b7].

> Next, I should review initial management priorities. Relative rest is foundational, with activity modification to pain-free cross-training such as cycling or pool running while avoiding hills, hard surfaces, and excessive volume; I need to ensure the athlete understands that complete rest is rarely necessary and may be counterproductive for tissue conditioning, so I should frame this as load management rather than cessation of activity [^8d55de61] [^a2ad9417].

> I will now examine pain control and anti-inflammatory strategies. NSAIDs can be used short term for analgesia if no contraindications exist, but I should confirm that we are not masking pain to permit harmful loading; ice after activity and graded return once pain subsides are prudent, and I should double-check that we are not relying on medications to substitute for load modification [^8d55de61] [^7ea626b8].

> Let me consider targeted rehabilitation, and I need to ensure I prioritize proximal drivers. Hip abductor and core strengthening, along with calf and soleus stretching, are first-line given the links between hip weakness, altered kinematics, and MTSS; I should confirm that programs are progressive and symptom-guided, and I will incorporate balance and proprioception work to enhance load distribution during running [^3654ab29].

> Hold on, I should verify biomechanical interventions. Footwear assessment and, when indicated, prefabricated foot orthoses can reduce medial loading in overpronators, though I should avoid implying that orthoses alone will cure MTSS; gait retraining to reduce rearfoot eversion duration and increase step rate has both immediate biomechanical effects and emerging clinical support for symptom reduction, so I will integrate cue-based running form adjustments with feedback when feasible [^824ac192] [^7ddb973d] [^e74c39b1].

> Next, I should review adjunctive therapies, and I need to be cautious about overpromising. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy shows promise as an adjunct to a graded running program, with prospective data suggesting faster recovery, and a recent systematic review supports ESWT as an adjunct in MTSS; however, I should confirm that ESWT is layered onto load management and rehabilitation rather than used in isolation, and I will reserve it for persistent cases after a trial of conservative care [^bb5c611d] [^6c5acca5].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite optimized conservative care. I should double-check for occult stress fracture, pseudofracture, or vitamin D deficiency, because pseudofractures require vitamin D repletion and weight-bearing as tolerated to heal; if a true stress fracture is identified, management shifts to protected weight bearing and a more prolonged, graded return, whereas isolated MTSS without fracture does not require casting or non-weight-bearing [^f79d3807] [^7ea626b8].

> I will now examine surgical options, and I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. Surgery is rarely indicated for pure MTSS; when performed, fasciotomy of the deep posterior compartment or periosteal stripping can reduce pain in selected refractory cases, but only about 41% return to preinjury levels despite pain reduction, so I should counsel patients carefully and reserve surgery for failures of comprehensive conservative therapy over at least 6–12 months [^c77cb4e2].

> Let me think about prevention and risk factor modification, because recurrence is common. Modifiable risks such as higher BMI, navicular drop, excessive ankle plantarflexion, and hip external rotation ROM should be addressed prospectively; gait retraining and graded load progression reduce incidence in at-risk military cohorts, and I should integrate preseason screening and load monitoring to mitigate spikes that precipitate symptoms [^c8cdb68e] [^e74c39b1] [^1e65a58c].

> I should confirm a practical timeline and milestones. In acute MTSS, expect 2–4 weeks of relative rest with cross-training, then 4–6 weeks of progressive strengthening and gait work before a structured return-to-run program; total recovery often spans 8–12 weeks, but I need to individualize based on symptom severity, imaging findings, and training demands, and I will use the MTSS score to track outcomes and guide progression [^8d55de61] [^65ccd3e7].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overlooked any key element. Load management remains the cornerstone, rehabilitation targets proximal control and calf flexibility, biomechanics are optimized with footwear and form cues, ESWT is a reasonable adjunct for recalcitrant cases, surgery is a last resort with guarded return-to-sport expectations, and prevention hinges on risk-factor modification and load monitoring; I need to ensure each step is tied to patient-specific goals and tissue irritability to avoid setbacks [^8d55de61] [^6c5acca5] [^c77cb4e2] [^c8cdb68e].

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is best managed with a **conservative, load-management approach** that prioritizes activity modification, targeted strengthening, and biomechanical correction [^8d55de61] [^7ddb973d]. Most patients recover within **6–12 weeks** [^71905689] with this plan, and surgery is rarely needed [^c77cb4e2].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and differential diagnosis

- **Clinical diagnosis**: MTSS presents as diffuse pain along the posteromedial tibia, typically ≥ 5 cm, worsened by weight-bearing activity and relieved with rest [^71905689] [^25bd3f2e].

- **Imaging**: Not routine; consider MRI if symptoms persist > 3 months or to exclude stress fracture, compartment syndrome, or nerve entrapment [^f79d3807] [^7ea626b8].

- **Differential**: Stress fracture, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, popliteal artery entrapment, nerve entrapment, and tendinopathy [^312a2ff9] [^42576e6f].

---

## Conservative management

### Activity modification and load management

Relative rest entails **reducing impact activity** (e.g. replace running with cycling or swimming) until pain resolves, then implement a **graded return** with a 10% weekly increase in volume or intensity [^notfound].

---

### Physical therapy

- **Strengthening**: Focus on hip abductors, extensors, core, and calf muscles to correct biomechanical deficits [^notfound].

- **Flexibility**: Emphasize calf (gastrocnemius/soleus) and hamstring stretching [^notfound].

- **Gait retraining**: Address excessive pronation, hip adduction, or rearfoot eversion to reduce tibial load [^7ddb973d] [^e74c39b1].

---

### Footwear and orthotic interventions

Footwear should provide **adequate support and cushioning**; avoid worn-out shoes. Orthotics are indicated for **excessive pronation** or navicular drop > 10 mm, using prefabricated medial arch supports [^12362482].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

- **Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)**: Consider for persistent cases; moderate evidence supports faster recovery when added to exercise [^bb5c611d] [^6c5acca5].

- **Manual therapy**: Deep tissue massage may reduce pain and improve function, though evidence is limited [^e558dc80].

- **Vitamin D**: Screen and replete if deficient, especially in athletes with prolonged symptoms or suspected bone stress injury [^f79d3807] [^9d16d9b7].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** (> 12 months) that fail conservative care. Options include fasciotomy or periosteal stripping, with about 70% pain reduction but only ~41% returning to preinjury activity [^c77cb4e2].

---

## Expected outcomes and recovery timeline

Most patients recover within **6–12 weeks** with conservative care; recurrence is common without addressing biomechanics and load. Return-to-sport is guided by pain-free activity, normal strength, and gradual progression [^8d55de61].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Training load**: Avoid rapid increases in volume/intensity; monitor acute:chronic workload ratios [^1e65a58c].

- **Strength and flexibility**: Maintain hip/core/calf conditioning and flexibility [^notfound].

- **Footwear**: Replace shoes regularly and use orthotics if indicated [^12362482].

- **Education**: Teach symptom recognition and early intervention [^notfound].

---

MTSS is managed with **load control, strengthening, and biomechanics**, with most recovering in 6–12 weeks; reserve surgery for refractory cases and embed prevention to limit recurrence.

### Outcome of surgical treatment of medial tibial stress syndrome [^c77cb4e2]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Medial tibial stress syndrome is a common chronic sports injury characterized by exercise-induced pain along the posteromedial border of the tibia. The reported outcomes of surgical treatment of this condition have varied.

Methods

Of seventy-eight patients who underwent surgery for medial tibial stress syndrome, forty-six (thirty-one men and fifteen women) returned for follow-up. The outcomes of the surgery were determined by comparing preoperative and postoperative pain levels as indicated on a visual analog pain scale and ascertaining the ability of the athletes to return to presymptom levels of exercise.

Results

The mean duration of postoperative follow-up was thirty months (range, six to sixty-three months). Surgery significantly reduced pain levels (p < 0.001) by an average of 72% as indicated on the visual analog pain scale. An excellent result was achieved in 35% of the limbs; a good result, in 34%; a fair result, in 22%; and a poor result, in 9%. Despite the success with regard to pain reduction, for a variety of reasons only nineteen (41%) of the athletes fully returned to their presymptom sports activity.

Conclusions

Surgery can significantly reduce the pain associated with medial tibial stress syndrome. Despite this reduction in pain, athletes should be counseled that a full uninhibited return to sports is not always achieved.

### Chronic leg pain in athletes [^42576e6f]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic leg pain is commonly treated by orthopaedic surgeons who take care of athletes. The sources are varied and include the more commonly encountered medial tibial stress syndrome, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, stress fracture, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, nerve entrapment, Achilles tightness, deep vein thrombosis, and complex regional pain syndrome. Owing to overlapping physical examination findings, an assortment of imaging and other diagnostic modalities are employed to distinguish among the diagnoses to guide the appropriate management. Although most of these chronic problems are treated nonsurgically, some patients require operative intervention. For each condition listed above, the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management option, and outcomes are discussed in turn.

### Stress fractures: pathophysiology, clinical presentation, imaging features, and treatment options [^eca9d95b]. Emergency Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Stress fracture, in its most inclusive description, includes both fatigue and insufficiency fracture. Fatigue fractures, sometimes equated with the term "stress fractures", are most common in runners and other athletes and typically occur in the lower extremities. These fractures are the result of abnormal, cyclical loading on normal bone leading to local cortical resorption and fracture. Insufficiency fractures are common in elderly populations, secondary to osteoporosis, and are typically located in and around the pelvis. They are a result of normal or traumatic loading on abnormal bone. Subchondral insufficiency fractures of the hip or knee may cause acute pain that may present in the emergency setting. Medial tibial stress syndrome is a type of stress injury of the tibia related to activity and is a clinical syndrome encompassing a range of injuries from stress edema to frank-displaced fracture. Atypical subtrochanteric femoral fracture associated with long-term bisphosphonate therapy is also a recently discovered entity that needs early recognition to prevent progression to a complete fracture. Imaging recommendations for evaluation of stress fractures include initial plain radiographs followed, if necessary, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is preferred over computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy. Radiographs are the first-line modality and may reveal linear sclerosis and periosteal reaction prior to the development of a frank fracture. MRI is highly sensitive with findings ranging from periosteal edema to bone marrow and intracortical signal abnormality. Additionally, a brief description of relevant clinical management of stress fractures is included.

### Shockwave treatment for medial tibial stress syndrome in athletes; a prospective controlled study [^bb5c611d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the results of two treatment regimens for medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS); a graded running programme and the same running programme with additional shockwave therapy (extracorporeal shockwave therapy; ESWT). Design A prospective observational controlled trial. Setting Two different sports medicine departments. Participants 42 athletes with MTSS were included. Intervention Patients from one hospital were treated with a graded running programme, while patients from the other hospital were treated with the same graded running programme and focused ESWT (five sessions in 9 weeks). Main Outcome Measures Time to full recovery (the endpoint was being able to run 18 min consecutively without pain at a fixed intensity). Results The time to full recovery was significantly faster in the ESWT group compared with the patients who only performed a graded running programme, respectively 59.7 ± 25.8 and 91.6 ± 43.0 days (p = 0.008). Conclusions This prospective observational study showed that MTSS patients may benefit from ESWT in addition to a graded running programme. ESWT as an additional treatment warrants further investigation in a prospective controlled trial with the addition of randomisation and double blinding.

### A practical approach for the differential diagnosis of chronic leg pain in the athlete [^312a2ff9]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic lower leg pain results from various conditions, most commonly, medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fracture, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, nerve entrapment, and popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. Symptoms associated with these conditions often overlap, making a definitive diagnosis difficult. As a result, an algorithmic approach was created to aid in the evaluation of patients with complaints of lower leg pain and to assist in defining a diagnosis by providing recommended diagnostic studies for each condition. A comprehensive physical examination is imperative to confirm a diagnosis and should begin with an inquiry regarding the location and onset of the patient's pain and tenderness. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires performing the appropriate diagnostic studies, including radiographs, bone scans, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, compartmental pressure measurements, and arteriograms. Although most conditions causing lower leg pain are treated successfully with nonsurgical management, some syndromes, such as popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, may require surgical intervention. Regardless of the form of treatment, return to activity must be gradual and individualized for each patient to prevent future athletic injury.

### Leg pain in the running athlete [^a2ad9417]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Leg pain is a common complaint among recreational and professional athletes who compete in running sports. Evaluation of the individual with intermittent or constant leg pain should be well organized and inclusive. Duration of the pain, its relation to injury, intensity of the pain, and its pattern are important factors. Additionally, changes in the training regimen, its level, intensity, or duration, or in the nature of the routine are critical components of the assessment. Physical examination can help differentiate bony from soft-tissue etiologies. Studies are dictated by the differential diagnosis but include radiographs in almost all patients and selected use of other modalities. These include bone scans and magnetic resonance imaging for medial tibial stress syndrome and stress fractures and intracompartmental pressure measurements for chronic compartment syndrome. Treatment often requires either rest or a change in training regimen. Surgery for conditions such as chronic compartment syndrome frequently allows a return to preinjury activities.

### Comparison of ESWT and deep tissue massage in individuals… [^e558dc80]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison of ESWT and Deep Tissue Massage in Individuals With Medial Tibial Stress SyndromeClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study, titled "Comparison of the Effectiveness of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy and Deep Tissue Massage in Individuals with Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome, " is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. The research will be conducted at the Sports Health Laboratory of the Ankara Bilkent City Hospital, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. The study population will consist of individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for MTSS and present to the Sports Medicine outpatient clinic. All participants will undergo an exercise program recommended in the literature for the treatment of MTSS. Participants will be randomly assigned into two groups using a sealed-envelope method.

One group will receive deep tissue massage in addition to the exercise program, while the other group will receive extracorporeal shock wave therapy alongside the exercises. Additionally, all participants will be treated with conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation at 100 Hz for pain control. Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome is often inadequately treated with standard methods. This study aimed to investigate the effects of deep tissue massage, considered as an alternative and adjunct treatment method, on pain and functional capacity in individuals diagnosed with MTSS, and to compare its efficacy with Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy, a widely accepted treatment. The study was designed as a prospective, parallel-group trial and conducted at a sports health laboratory affiliated with a physical therapy and rehabilitation hospital.

The study population consisted of patients who met MTSS diagnostic criteria and presented to a sports medicine outpatient clinic. Various treatment approaches have been proposed for MTSS, including rest, activity modification, exercise programs, ESWT, and injections. Limited studies exist evaluating the efficacy of radial ESWT, which have shown improved recovery and return-to-sport rates compared to control groups. Nevertheless, ESWT has been insufficient for some patients, highlighting the need for alternative treatments. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of deep tissue massage on pain in individuals with MTSS and to compare it with ESWT. A pilot study was planned with a total of 22 participants, based on an estimated large effect size.

### Stress fractures: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^7ea626b8]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Stress fractures are common injuries in athletes and military recruits. These injuries occur more commonly in lower extremities than in upper extremities. Stress fractures should be considered in patients who present with tenderness or edema after a recent increase in activity or repeated activity with limited rest. The differential diagnosis varies based on location, but commonly includes tendinopathy, compartment syndrome, and nerve or artery entrapment syndrome. Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) can be distinguished from tibial stress fractures by diffuse tenderness along the length of the posteromedial tibial shaft and a lack of edema. When stress fracture is suspected, plain radiography should be obtained initially and, if negative, may be repeated after two to three weeks for greater accuracy. If an urgent diagnosis is needed, triple-phase bone scintigraphy or magnetic resonance imaging should be considered. Both modalities have a similar sensitivity, but magnetic resonance imaging has greater specificity. Treatment of stress fractures consists of activity modification, including the use of nonweight-bearing crutches if needed for pain relief. Analgesics are appropriate to relieve pain, and pneumatic bracing can be used to facilitate healing. After the pain is resolved and the examination shows improvement, patients may gradually increase their level of activity. Surgical consultation may be appropriate for patients with stress fractures in high-risk locations, nonunion, or recurrent stress fractures. Prevention of stress fractures has been studied in military personnel, but more research is needed in other populations.

### Treatment of medial tibial stress syndrome with radial soundwave therapy in elite athletes: current evidence, report on two cases, and Proposed treatment regimen [^6aa8c6c4]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Two case reports of high-level athletes with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), 1 an Olympian with an actual stress fracture, are presented. Successful treatment included radial soundwave therapy, pneumatic leg braces, relative rest using an antigravity treadmill, and temporary foot orthoses. Radial soundwave therapy has a high level of evidence for treatment of MTSS. We also present recent evidence of the value of vitamin D assessment. Both patients had a successful outcome with minimal downtime. Finally, a suggested treatment regimen for MTSS is presented.

### Low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy as a treatment for medial tibial stress syndrome [^336579ba]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is a pain syndrome along the tibial origin of the tibialis posterior or soleus muscle. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (SWT) is effective in numerous types of insertional pain syndromes.

Hypothesis

Shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for chronic MTSS.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Forty-seven consecutive subjects with chronic recalcitrant MTSS underwent a standardized home training program, and received repetitive low-energy radial SWT (2000 shocks; 2.5 bars of pressure, which is equal to 0.1 mJ/mm²; total energy flux density, 200 mJ/mm²; no local anesthesia) (treatment group). Forty-seven subjects with chronic recalcitrant MTSS were not treated with SWT, but underwent a standardized home training program only (control group). Evaluation was by change in numeric rating scale. Degree of recovery was measured on a 6-point Likert scale (subjects with a rating of completely recovered or much improved were rated as treatment success).

Results

One month, 4 months, and 15 months from baseline, success rates for the control and treatment groups according to the Likert scale were 13% and 30% (P < .001), 30% and 64% (P < .001), and 37% and 76% (P < .001), respectively. One month, 4 months, and 15 months from baseline, the mean numeric rating scale for the control and treatment groups were 7.3 and 5.8 (P < .001), 6.9 and 3.8 (P < .001), and 5.3 and 2.7 (P < .001), respectively. At 15 months from baseline, 40 of the 47 subjects in the treatment group had been able to return to their preferred sport at their preinjury level, as had 22 of the 47 control subjects.

Conclusion

Radial SWT as applied was an effective treatment for MTSS.

### Medial tibial stress syndrome needs a new name-make No bones about It [^407a8460]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Pain near the posteromedial tibia is common in running and jumping athletes. This problem has had many names, with "shin splints" and "medial tibial stress syndrome" (MTSS) the most common. The term shin splints is nonspecific and nondescript, and has never gained clinical traction. Similarly, the clinical use of MTSS with athletes and coaches is often met with confusion as "tibial stress" is frequently misinterpreted as indicating a bone stress injury. With no conclusive evidence regarding the pathophysiology of MTSS, we advocate renaming it "Load Induced Medial-Leg Pain" (LIMP). LIMP avoids the use of "tibial stress", which is problematic due to the unknown pathology of the condition and its confusion with bone stress injury. Using the term LIMP instead of MTSS gives clinicians, researchers, and athletes a clearer, more accurate way to approach managing exercise-related lower leg pain.

### Diagnosis of medial knee pain: atypical stress fracture about the knee joint [^e06d1a64]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Resident's case problem.

Background

A 19-year-old female, currently enrolled in a military training program, sought medical care for a twisting injury to her right knee. The patient reported her symptoms as similar to an injury she incurred 1 year previously while enrolled in the same military program. The patient's past medical history included a nondepressed fracture of the medial tibial plateau and complete tear of the deep fibers of the medial collateral ligament.

Diagnosis

Physical exam revealed nonlocalized anterior and medial knee pain without evidence of internal derangement. Initial knee and tibia radiographs were unremarkable. Referral for orthopedic physician evaluation resulted in concurrence with the therapist's diagnosis and plan of care, and the patient was allowed to continue with limited physical training demands. Despite periods of rest, the patient's symptoms progressively worsened upon attempts to resume running. The examining therapist referred the patient for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the patient's worsening symptoms, normal radiographs, and concern for a proximal tibia stress fracture. MRI revealed a severe proximal tibial metaphysis stress fracture.

Discussion

Stress fractures are commonly encountered injuries in individuals subjected to increased physical training demands. Early evaluation may not yield well-localized findings and may mimic other conditions. Nonmusculoskeletal conditions should be considered in the management of patients with stress fractures. This resident's case problem illustrates the importance of serial physical examinations and collaboration with other healthcare practitioners in the comprehensive assessment and management of a patient with a severe stress fracture.

### Common running injuries: evaluation and management [^8d55de61]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Running is a common form of exercise but predisposes athletes to several running-related injuries. Most running injuries are due to overuse and respond to conservative treatment. Tendinopathies in the patellar, Achilles, and hamstring tendons are common, and are primarily treated with eccentric exercise. Iliotibial band syndrome and patellofemoral pain syndrome are less common than patellar tendinopathy and are treated by strengthening exercises for the core and legs in addition to flexibility exercises. Acute hamstring strains and medial tibial stress syndrome require a period of relative rest, followed by stretching and graded return to activity. Tibial stress fractures require an extended period of relative rest, followed by a more gradual return to activity. Early mobilization improves recovery from ankle sprains, and exercise therapy and functional bracing while running for six to 12 months prevents reinjury. Plantar fasciopathy (plantar fasciitis) can be significantly improved with stretching, heel raises, and orthoses that provide arch support.

### Bilateral looser zones or pseudofractures in the anteromedial tibia as a component of medial tibial stress syndrome in athletes [^5e2f3e05]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) or shin splints are stress-induced injuries described by diffuse (≥ 5 cm) pain of the (postero-)medial tibia. It is a common injury especially in athletes exposed to a repetitive load of the lower limbs and may display osseous signal alterations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or translucent bone structures in radiographs and/or computed tomography (CT). There are a clinical overlap and ongoing variability of terminology in stress injuries, MTSS, pseudofractures, and stress fractures. Whereas stress injuries serve as an umbrella term for all load-induced lesions, MTSS, pseudofractures, and stress fractures represent distinct entities.

The pathophysiology of MTSS is still under debate with recent results suggesting biomechanical factors and a disbalance of local bone remodeling with subsequent failure to repair load-induced microdamage. In most cases, clinical examination provides sufficient information to diagnose MTSS but especially when symptoms are prolonged or not characteristic, more advanced lesions and differential diagnoses (i.e. pseudofractures or stress fractures) need to be evaluated in more detail by the use of conventional imaging such as MRI/CT.

Pseudofractures are defined as local, radiolucent cortical defects found in patients with severe osteomalacia, caused by hereditary (e.g. X-linked hypophosphatemia) or in patients with severe vitamin D deficiency which may occur bilateral or multilocular. Supplementation of vitamin D is crucial and leads to normalization of clinical symptoms in most cases. In the context of repetitive high impact in athletes with underlying vitamin D deficiency, pseudofractures represent an important differential diagnosis in athletes with prolonged tibial pain. As the treatment consists predominantly of establishing sufficient vitamin D levels, the detection of such lesions is of paramount importance to optimize patient outcomes and sustain physical activity in the long-term.

Nine patients presented, initially diagnosed as bilateral MTSS, of whom four had additional bilateral anterior mid-shaft pseudofractures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specific differences regarding bone density, microstructure and turnover in MTSS patients with and without pseudofractures. The assessment included biochemical analysis (n = 9), bone densitometry via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; n = 9), and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography (HR-pQCT; n = 3).

### Risk factors for medial tibial stress syndrome in physically active individuals such as runners and military personnel: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c8cdb68e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is a common injury in runners and military personnel. There is a lack of agreement on the aetiological factors contributing to MTSS, making treatment challenging and highlighting the importance of preventive efforts. Understanding the risk factors for MTSS is critical for developing preventive measures. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess what factors put physically active individuals at risk to develop MTSS. Selected electronic databases were searched. Studies were included if they contained original research that investigated risk factors associated with MTSS, compared physically active individuals with MTSS and physically active individuals without MTSS, were in the English language and were full papers in peer-reviewed journals. Data on research design, study duration, participant selection, population, groups, MTSS diagnosis, investigated risk factors and risk factor definitions were extracted. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed. When the means and SDs of a particular risk factor were reported three or more times, that risk factor was included in the meta-analysis. There were 21 studies included in the systematic review and nine risk factors qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Increased BMI (weighted mean difference (MD) = 0.79, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.20, p < 0.001), navicular drop (MD = 1.19 mm, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.84, p < 0.001), ankle plantarflexion range of motion (ROM; MD = 5.94°, 95% CI 3.65 to 8.24, p < 0.001) and hip external rotation ROM (MD = 3.95°, 95% CI 1.78 to 6.13, p < 0.001) were risk factors for MTSS. Dorsiflexion and quadriceps-angle were clearly not risk factors for MTSS. There is a need for high-quality, prospective studies using consistent methodology evaluating MTSS risk factors. Our findings suggest that interventions focused on addressing increased BMI, navicular drop, ankle plantarflexion ROM and hip external rotation ROM may be a good starting point for preventing and treating MTSS in physically active individuals such as runners and military personnel.

### Tibial stress fractures in athletes [^d29a5245]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Tibial stress fractures are common in the athlete. There are various causes of these fractures, the most common being a sudden increase in training intensity. Most of these injuries are treated conservatively; however, some may require operative intervention. Intervention is mostly dictated by location of the fracture and failure of conservative treatment. There are several surgical options available to the treating surgeon, each with advantages and disadvantages. The physician must understand the nature of the fracture and the likelihood for it to heal in a timely manner in order to best treat these fractures in this patient subset.

### 17-year-old runner with shin pain [^4819b2a4]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2014). Low credibility.

Stress injury is a common cause of exercise-induced anterior shin pain. It is important to distinguish between the various causes of stress injury in a timely manner in order to optimize favorable treatment outcomes. Here, we will discuss a case of medial tibial stress syndrome, or shin splints, as one of the causes of shin pain, as well as how to approach shin pain for a successful diagnosis.

### Bilateral looser zones or pseudofractures in the anteromedial tibia as a component of medial tibial stress syndrome in athletes [^c21cf0b6]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The assessment of bone microarchitecture in the patient with pseudofractures revealed superior parameters compared to patients' with MTSS and no pseudofracture. Supporting the results of BMD analysis, no generally impaired bone microarchitecture compared to references was detected. Interestingly, a recent study described an impairment of trabecular bone microarchitecture in soldiers affected by bone stress injuries, yet no differentiation regarding the type of lesion or comparison to reference values was conducted. However, in our study, Ct.BMD was the only reduced value in the patient with pseudofracture, indicating aggravated mineralization deterioration at the cortical site correlating to the development of Looser's zones and corresponding to the reported decrease of mineralization at the lesions' sites.

In these patients, the treatment consisted of vitamin D supplementation, additional oral calcium supplementation in cases of diagnosed pseudofractures or secondary hyperparathyroidism, and weight-bearing as tolerated followed by a gradual increase with a return to training. By applying non-elastic horizontal tape above the ankle, a redirection of forces at the tendon-to-bone insertion is achieved with greater potential potential for rehabilitation of the bone. Clinical symptoms disappeared allowing a return to competition in all patients. As this causative treatment approach is easily accessible and cost-effective, it should not be missed, especially in athletes with prolonged pain at the (anteromedial) tibia. As in general, a high rate of recurrence and, in particular, tibial stress fractures, is known for MTSS, vitamin D supplementation should be maintained according to the individual's needs. However, further understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms is needed to elaborate, whether higher BMD values impose an additional risk factor under simultaneous conditions of vitamin D deficiency for the development of pseudofractures and not MTSS.

### Bilateral looser zones or pseudofractures in the anteromedial tibia as a component of medial tibial stress syndrome in athletes [^9d16d9b7]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) represents a common diagnosis in individuals exposed to repetitive high-stress loads affecting the lower limb, e.g. high-performance athletes. However, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic regimens are not well established.

Methods

Nine patients, diagnosed as MTSS, were analyzed by a comprehensive skeletal analysis including laboratory bone turnover parameters, dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA), and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT).

Results

In 4/9 patients, bilateral pseudofractures were detected in the mid-shaft tibia. These patients had significantly lower levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol compared to patients with MTSS but similar levels of bone turnover parameters. Interestingly, the skeletal assessment revealed significantly higher bone mineral density (BMD) Z-scores at the hip (1.3 ± 0.6 vs. − 0.7 ± 0.5, p = 0.013) in patients with pseudofractures and a trend towards higher bone microarchitecture parameters measured by HR-pQCT at the distal tibia. Vitamin D supplementation restored the calcium-homeostasis in all patients. Combined with weight-bearing as tolerated, pseudofractures healed in all patients and return to competition was achieved.

Conclusion

In conclusion, deficient vitamin D levels may lead to pseudofractures due to localized deterioration of mineralization, representing a pivotal component of MTSS in athletes with increased repetitive mechanical loading of the lower limbs. Moreover, the manifestation of pseudofractures is not a consequence of an altered BMD nor microarchitecture but appears in patients with exercise-induced BMD increase in combination with reduced 25-OH-D levels. The screening of MTSS patients for pseudofractures is crucial for the initiation of an appropriate treatment such as vitamin D supplementation to prevent a prolonged course of healing or recurrence.

### Stress fractures about the tibia, foot, and ankle [^ee77fb35]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

In competitive athletes, stress fractures of the tibia, foot, and ankle are common and lead to considerable delay in return to play. Factors such as bone vascularity, training regimen, and equipment can increase the risk of stress fracture. Management is based on the fracture site. In some athletes, metabolic workup and medication are warranted. High-risk fractures, including those of the anterior tibial diaphysis, navicular, proximal fifth metatarsal, and medial malleolus, present management challenges and may require surgery, especially in high-level athletes who need to return to play quickly. Noninvasive treatment modalities such as pulsed ultrasound and extracorporeal shock wave therapy may have some benefit but require additional research.

### Externally validated machine learning algorithm accurately predicts medial tibial stress syndrome in military trainees: a multicohort study [^2022218a]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical implications

Having high predictive capacity should facilitate prevention of MTSS. If training, coaching, command staff or trainees themselves can identify their risk, then risks can be managed. The interactive nomogram (figure 3) allows individualised risk profiling for MTSS. The probability of MTSS development is calculated based on an individual's risk factor scores. Once an individual's risk of MTSS is calculated, targeting the modifiable risk factors may serve as the strongest preventative measure for this difficult-to-treat condition. Using this tool, interventions can be modelled and customised to reduce individual risk within their profile of modifiable and unmodifiable characteristics.

This investigation has revealed an MTSS incidence of 35% within a first year ADFA population. This is consistent with previous prospective research in military samples with 24%and 35% incidence rates. However, the rates of reporting MTSS symptoms to Duntroon Health Centre Physiotherapists in this study were low. This is not the first time to have occurred within prospective studies of military personnel. In Yates and White's investigation into 124 Naval recruits, only 30% of recruits who developed MTSS followed up with medical treatment. Furthermore, Almeida et al investigated gender differences in lower limb musculoskeletal injury reporting rates within a US military population. A total of 35.8% of injuries went unreported, with MTSS identified as the most common unreported diagnosis. These findings in combination with the present study may highlight a trend of reluctance to report injuries within the military to avoid being downgraded or medically restricted during their PT. Giving the cadets the option to have/not to have their MTSS symptoms confirmed by a clinician also likely influenced the rates of reporting. Another reason that may explain under-reporting of MTSS symptoms was the COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions. Structured PT sessions ceased. Participants in the study were therefore limited to their own PT, including self-directed running and body weight exercises. Consequently, there may have been a reduced desire for cadets to present to physiotherapy to have any underlying MTSS complaints assessed and treated. Out of the 10 features within our model, MTSS history yielded the strongest impact on the performance of the combined CRFM. A history of MTSS is a known risk factor for the condition. However, there were very weak correlations between the features, likely signifying the importance of interaction between all the risk factors combined.

### The medial tibial stress syndrome score: a new patient-reported outcome measure [^65ccd3e7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

At present, there is no validated patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for patients with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS).

Aim

Our aim was to select and validate previously generated items and create a valid, reliable and responsive PROM for patients with MTSS: the MTSS score.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was performed in multiple sports medicine, physiotherapy and military facilities in the Netherlands. Participants with MTSS filled out the previously generated items for the MTSS score on 3 occasions. From previously generated items, we selected the best items. We assessed the MTSS score for its validity, reliability and responsiveness.

Results

The MTSS score was filled out by 133 participants with MTSS. Factor analysis showed the MTSS score to exhibit a single-factor structure with acceptable internal consistency (α = 0.58) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.81). The MTSS score ranges from 0 to 10 points. The smallest detectable change in our sample was 0.69 at the group level and 4.80 at the individual level. Construct validity analysis showed significant moderate-to-large correlations (r = 0.34–0.52, p < 0.01). Responsiveness of the MTSS score was confirmed by a significant relation with the global perceived effect scale (β = −0.288, R² = 0.21, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The MTSS score is a valid, reliable and responsive PROM to measure the severity of MTSS. It is designed to evaluate treatment outcomes in clinical studies.

### Patellofemoral pain [^4d2bff94]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain is characterized by insidious onset anterior knee pain that is exaggerated under conditions of increased patellofemoral joint stress. A variety of risk factors may contribute to the development of patellofemoral pain. It is critical that the history and physical examination elucidate those risk factors specific to an individual in order to prescribe an appropriate and customized treatment plan. This article aims to review the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of patellofemoral pain.

### Gait retraining and incidence of medial tibial stress syndrome in army recruits [^e74c39b1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Gait retraining, comprising biofeedback and/or an exercise intervention, might reduce the risk of musculoskeletal conditions. The purpose was to examine the effect of a gait-retraining program on medial tibial stress syndrome incidence during a 26-wk basic military training regimen.

Methods

A total of 450 British Army recruits volunteered. On the basis of a baseline plantar pressure variable (mean foot balance during the first 10% of stance), participants classified as at risk of developing medial tibial stress syndrome (n = 166) were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 83) or control (n = 83) group. The intervention involved supervised gait retraining, including exercises to increase neuromuscular control and flexibility (three sessions per week) and biofeedback enabling internalization of the foot balance variable (one session per week). Both groups continued with the usual military training regimen. Diagnoses of medial tibial stress syndrome over the 26-wk regimen were made by physicians blinded to the group assignment. Data were modeled in a survival analysis using Cox regression, adjusting for baseline foot balance and time to peak heel rotation.

Results

The intervention was associated with a substantially reduced instantaneous relative risk of medial tibial stress syndrome versus control, with an adjusted HR of 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.53). The number needed to treat to observe one additional injury-free recruit in intervention versus control at 20 wk was 14 (11 to 23) participants. Baseline foot balance was a nonspecific predictor of injury, with an HR per 2 SD increment of 5.2 (1.6 to 53.6).

Conclusions

The intervention was effective in reducing incidence of medial tibial stress syndrome in an at-risk military sample.

Sprains

Background: Knee sprains include injury to any of the ligamentous structures within the knee joint. Major ligaments include the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and will be discussed here. Additionally, there are the anterolateral ligament (ALL), transverse meniscal ligament, posterior meniscofemoral ligament, oblique popliteal ligament, arcuate ligament, popliteofibular ligament, and the ligaments that form the joint capsule.
Etiology: Ligamentous knee sprains are due to trauma or sports injury, both with contact and non-contact forces. The ACL is commonly injured during plant and cut maneuvers due to increased knee abduction during hip adduction and knee valgus during hip internal rotation. Additionally, internal rotation of the tibia increases risk of ACL strain. These three movements are combined in landing from jump with hip extended and internally rotated, knee extended and valgus, tibia internally rotated, and foot planted. Hewett et al evaluated ACL injury mechanics in female athletes and found that abduction angle was 8° greater in ACL injury and those with ACL injury had 2.5 times greater abduction moments.PCL injuries are usually concomitant with injury to other ligaments particularly when varus or valgus stress or rotational force is involved. The PCL is injured with posterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. Force is required and a PCL tear is commonly known as a "dashboard injury" which occurs when the flexed knee hits a motor vehicle dashboard during a collision and is translated posteriorly, or during hyperflexion of the knee with the foot in plantar flexion, such as falling onto the flexed knee.
MCL injuries can occur in isolation or in combination with the ACL or PCL. The MCL originates at the medial epicondyle of the tibia deep to the pes anserine and inserts 5–7 cm below the joint line. It functions as the primary medial knee stabilizer and resists valgus stress, anterior tibial translation, and internal rotation. The most common mechanism of injury to the MCL is direct lateral force to the knee or maneuvers that induce severe valgus stress to the knee, and injury most often occurs at the femoral insertion. The LCL is the primary stabilizer of the lateral knee, originates at the lateral epicondyle of the femur and inserts on the medial fibular head. It resists varus stress, external rotation and posterior displacement of the fibula; therefore, it can be injured by contact and non-contact forces in these planes. Common mechanism of injury is direct varus force to the medial knee or hyperextension stress across the knee.
Diagnostic Criteria: Sprains are graded based on severity: Grade 1 – mild, painful stretching or minimal tearing of fibers, Grade 2 – moderate, painful, partial tearing of fibers, Grade 3 – severe, painful or sometimes not painful, complete rupture of ligament and may demonstrate instability. Clinical physical exam findings: ACL – knee line pain, positive Lachman's test. PCL – dimple sign, posterior drawer test, posterior sag test, quadriceps active test, external rotation recurvatum test.MCL – medial joint line pain and tenderness, positive valgus stress test. LCL – lateral joint line pain and tenderness, lateral joint edema, positive varus stress test, lateral compartment laxity with figure 4 position. History and physical exam support the clinical diagnosis, and imaging should include weight — bearing knee series and stress radiographs; however, the gold standard for diagnosis of ligament injury in the knee is MRI.
Treatment: Symptomatic pain emanating from knee sprains is typically managed conservatively with topical or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in those without contraindications as well as alternating ice and heat. From an orthopedic perspective, grade I and II sprains are treated with progressive weight bearing as tolerated, bracing, gentle active assisted range of motion, and strengthening of surrounding supportive musculature and are specific to each ligament involved. Some isolated Grade 3 sprains are treated with a longer period of immobilization and bracing, toe touch weight bearing, followed by aggressive range of motion (ROM); however, combined injury or severe Grade 3 sprains with complete ligament rupture can be treated surgically, particularly if the ACL is involved.

### High-risk stress fractures: evaluation and treatment [^240edf6d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2000). Low credibility.

Stress fractures are common overuse injuries seen in athletes and military recruits. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and usually involves repetitive submaximal stresses. Intrinsic factors, such as hormonal imbalances, may also contribute to the onset of stress fractures, especially in women. The classic presentation is a patient who experiences the insidious onset of pain after an abrupt increase in the duration or intensity of exercise. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, but imaging modalities such as plain radiography, scintigraphy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging may provide confirmation. Most stress fractures are uncomplicated and can be managed by rest and restriction from the precipitating activity. A subset of stress fractures can present a high risk for progression to complete fracture, delayed union, or nonunion. Specific sites for this type of stress fracture are the femoral neck (tension side), the patella, the anterior cortex of the tibia, the medial malleolus, the talus, the tarsal navicular, the fifth metatarsal, and the great toe sesamoids. Tensile forces and the relative avascularity at the site of a stress-induced fracture often lead to poor healing. Therefore, high-risk stress fractures require aggressive treatment.

### Biomechanical overload syndrome: defining a new diagnosis [^824ac192]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We have applied the same reasoning to other exertional lower-limb problems such as medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) and deep-posterior CECS. By viewing these conditions with the new paradigm of BOS we have sought to address biomechanical deficiencies in order to reduce the load on the tissues and structures thought to be responsible for the pain experienced in these exertional lower-limb conditions. In the case of MTSS, this reduction in load may be sufficient to promote repair while still allowing for continuation of sport-specific training.

We have developed a one-week inpatient 'running re-education' programme where patients with BOS undergo initial assessment with the Provocation Challenge Test (PCT) and assessment of two-dimensional (2D) running kinematics. The PCT is conducted on a treadmill wearing high combat boots carrying initially 15 kg load. Subjects start at 6.5 km/h for 5 min, then the incline is increased to 5% at 6.5 km/h for a further 5 min, following which the subject then removes the Bergen and the speed is increased to 11 km/h for the final 5 min period. Subjects continue until they cannot carry on due to pain and then the score is the time sustained. Patients undergo a programme of running coaching, dynamic core and gluteal strengthening, podiatric input and hip, knee ankle triple flexion alignment improvement, supported by delivery of an education package. The inpatient course is followed by a 3-month individualised gait rehabilitation programme based around return to running and improved lower-limb conditioning. Follow-up assessment with 2D kinematics at the 3-month stage confirmed that patients had retained their new running form and a 70% success rate in resolution of symptoms was measured using a repeat of the PCT and an individuals employability using the functional activity assessment (FAA) score and Joint Medical Employment Standard (JMES) score. The success in the maintenance of these changes and the resolution of symptoms lead the authors to believe that BOS defines the exertional compartment pain seen in running and that there is clear evidence that intracompartmental pressure measurement should no longer be considered a valid diagnostic tool for CECS.

Further studies to define the kinematic changes in running technique, alongside resolution of symptoms, will be an important step forward in alleviating suffering, reducing surgical intervention and maximising return to sport. Care should be taken in recommending a surgical intervention where the pathophysiological and diagnostic evidence for surgery are not clearly defined.

### Running retraining to treat lower limb injuries: a mixed-methods study of current evidence synthesised with expert opinion [^7ddb973d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Importance

Running-related injuries are highly prevalent.

Objective

Synthesise published evidence with international expert opinion on the use of running retraining when treating lower limb injuries.

Design

Mixed methods.

Methods

A systematic review of clinical and biomechanical findings related to running retraining interventions were synthesised and combined with semistructured interviews with 16 international experts covering clinical reasoning related to the implementation of running retraining.

Results

Limited evidence supports the effectiveness of transition from rearfoot to forefoot or midfoot strike and increase step rate or altering proximal mechanics in individuals with anterior exertional lower leg pain; and visual and verbal feedback to reduce hip adduction in females with patellofemoral pain. Despite the paucity of clinical evidence, experts recommended running retraining for: iliotibial band syndrome; plantar fasciopathy (fasciitis); Achilles, patellar, proximal hamstring and gluteal tendinopathy; calf pain; and medial tibial stress syndrome. Tailoring approaches to each injury and individual was recommended to optimise outcomes. Substantial evidence exists for the immediate biomechanical effects of running retraining interventions (46 studies), including evaluation of step rate and strike pattern manipulation, strategies to alter proximal kinematics and cues to reduce impact loading variables.

Summary and Relevance

Our synthesis of published evidence related to clinical outcomes and biomechanical effects with expert opinion indicates running retraining warrants consideration in the treatment of lower limb injuries in clinical practice.

### Conservative treatment of anterior chronic exertional compartment syndrome in the military, with a mid-term follow-up [^43371715]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Objectives

To assess the outcome of conservative treatment for chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) as it relates to the reduction in surgical fasciotomy and return to active duty in a military population.

Methods

Historic cohort. From 2015 to 2018, 75 surgically eligible patients with pressure-positive anterior CECS (Group 1), or with positive pressures and associated medial tibial stress syndrome (Group 2), underwent a conservative treatment programme emphasising gait retraining of running and marching. Treatment success was defined as return to duty, without surgery. Fifty patients from 2015 to 2017 were surveyed to assess mid-term outcomes.

Results

The average duration of conservative treatment was 144.9 (± 59.6) days. Initially, 65% (49/75) were able to return to duty; 28% (21/75) were referred for surgery and 7% (5/75) left the armed forces. There was no difference in outcomes between Group 1 and Group 2. Survey response rate, on average after 742 days (SD 267, range 381–1256), was 84% (42/50); 57% (24/42) had continued duty, without surgery; of them, 43% were at the same military specialty, 57% in a physically less demanding job.

Conclusion

A conservative treatment programme for anterior CECS was able to return 65% of patients to active duty, without surgery. At 2 years, the success rate decreased slightly, but remained positive at 57%. In this high-risk group, initiating a conservative treatment protocol with an emphasis on gait retraining can significantly reduce the need for surgical fasciotomy. For those that fail conservative treatment, surgical release may still be indicated.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^25bd3f2e]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5.3 Tibial and/or fibular stress syndrome

These diagnoses also fall under the umbrella of exercise‐induced leg pain, and typically present with leg pain onset with running, most often at the medial tibia (medial tibial stress syndrome). A condition of many names, such as periostitis and shin splints, the pathophysiology is thought to arise from reaction of bone to repetitive loading. Medial tibial stress syndrome is among the most common conditions affecting runners and running athletes, with an estimated incidence up to 34% and prevalence more than 9% in this population. In contrast to exertional compartment syndrome, the pain of tibial and/or fibular stress syndrome often persists for hours to days after cessation of exercise and may be reproduced on physical examination with palpation along the affected bone(s), such as at the medial tibial border, typically exquisitely tender over a span ≥ 5 cm in length. Because of the lingering nature of pain and its distribution, it may be mistaken for radiculopathy. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, but to rule out stress fracture, plain x‐rays are often sufficient. However, if required for diagnosis and/or severity grading, MRI can be used.

### Contributing factors to medial tibial stress syndrome: a prospective investigation [^987bcbba]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To conduct a prospective, multisite, cohort study investigating the possible risk factors for medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) in college athletes.

Methods

One hundred and forty-six healthy, collegiate athletes from NCAA Division I and Division II institutions participated in the study. Subjects first completed a health history questionnaire to establish previous history of injury and underwent a physical examination to assess their ankle/foot strength, ankle/foot range of motion, tibial varum, and navicular drop before the start of their respective athletic season. Athletes were instructed to report to a certified athletic trainer if they developed pain on their tibia. If MTSS was present, subjects were then placed into the symptomatic group. Independent t-tests and chi-square analyses were used to determine whether differences existed between MTSS and healthy athletes for the continuous and the discrete dependent variables, respectively. The significant dependent variables were then used in the discriminant function analysis.

Results

Twenty-nine subjects developed MTSS during this study. Athletes that had been participating in athletic activity for fewer than 5 yr were significantly more likely to develop MTSS (P = 0.002). Additionally, athletes with a previous history of MTSS (P = 0.0001), a previous history of stress fracture (P = 0.039), and the use of orthotics (P = 0.031) were more likely to develop MTSS compared with those who did not develop MTSS.

Conclusion

This study established that the factors most influencing MTSS development were previous history of MTSS and stress fracture, years of running experience, and orthotic use. These data demonstrate the importance of establishing a thorough history before the start of the season so that athletes who might be at risk for MTSS development can be identified.

### Externally validated machine learning algorithm accurately predicts medial tibial stress syndrome in military trainees: a multicohort study [^ee23e9b4]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

The outcomes of this study demonstrate that an inexpensive model including a suite of evidence-based risk factors can accurately predict which military trainees will develop MTSS. The model maintains accuracy when externally validated in an unrelated military sample. These outcomes enable future research to develop individualised injury prevention programmes that address the modifiable MTSS risk factors. The application of predictive modelling methodologies targeting risk factor profiling combined with training load monitoring is worth investigating within military settings. Further understanding of how these variables interact and influence MTSS outcomes will help bridge the gap in reducing MTSS incidence.

### Patellofemoral syndrome a paradigm for current surgical strategies [^1b151625]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The literature regarding suggested treatments for patellofemoral problems is often conflicting and confusing. In this discussion I present the approach I take in evaluating and considering surgery for patients with any of a wide variety of anterior knee pain problems. It has been useful to concentrate on the biomechanics — the mechanical consequence to each tissue affected by any surgical change. In the proposed paradigm, it is assumed that pain is the result of an abnormal load — related either to tension or compression — being applied to each tissue in question. The challenge is to understand how and why that abnormal load was generated. It is essential to make an independent assessment of the condition of the lower limb skeleton, the patellofemoral ligaments, and the trochlear and patellar articular cartilage in each patient. While only a long book can address this subject in detail, this discussion provides a guide for formulating an analysis of the key issues when planning the operative treatment of patellofemoral pain and dysfunction.

### Low regional tibial bone density in athletes with medial tibial stress syndrome normalizes after recovery from symptoms [^602992ad]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although the exact cause of medial tibial stress syndrome is unclear, changes in bone metabolism are likely to be involved.

Hypothesis

Localized low bone mineral density at the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the tibia in patients with medial tibial stress syndrome develops in conjunction with the symptoms; these changes are reversible and are not inherited.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

Bone mineral density in 14 adult male athletes with long-standing medial tibial stress syndrome was measured when they were symptomatic and after recovery (mean follow-up, 5.7 years). Repeat measurements were also made prospectively in 13 nonathlete control subjects and single measurements were made in 18 healthy athletes.

Results

Bone mineral density was 9% ± 11% higher in the proximal tibia but 11% ± 12% lower in the tibial region corresponding to pain in patients when compared with nonathlete control subjects. It increased by 19% ± 11% in the region of pain after recovery from symptoms and, at follow-up, was no lower than in nonathlete control subjects.

Conclusion

Athletes with medial tibial stress syndrome and increased scintigraphic uptake regain normal tibial bone mineral density after recovery from symptoms. Initially localized low bone mineral density is not an inherited condition, but instead may develop in conjunction with the symptoms.

### The management of injuries to the medial side of the knee [^e61cd615]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Injuries to the medial side of the knee are the most common knee ligament injuries. The majority of injuries occur in young athletes during sporting events, with the usual mechanism involving a valgus contact, tibial external rotation, or a combined valgus and external rotation force delivered to the knee. Although most complete grade III medial knee injuries heal, some do not, which can lead to continued instability. For these patients, a thorough understanding of the presenting history and a physical examination are important because these injuries can often be confused with posterolateral corner injuries. The main anatomic structures of the medial side of the knee are the superficial medial collateral ligament, deep medial collateral ligament, and posterior oblique ligament. In addition, accurately locating 3 bony prominences over the medial aspect of the knee-the adductor tubercle, gastrocnemius tubercle, and medial epicondyle-is important to conduct a proper physical examination and for surgical repairs and reconstructions. Clinical diagnosis of medial knee injuries is primarily performed via the application of a valgus stress in full extension and at 30° of knee flexion. In addition, an examination of the amount of anteromedial tibial rotation is performed at 90° of flexion, while the dial test, performed at 30° and 90° of flexion, is important because it evaluates for rotational abnormalities. Valgus stress radiographs are useful to objectively determine the amount of medial compartment gapping and to discern whether there is medial or lateral compartment gapping when a medial or posterolateral corner knee injury cannot be differentiated, especially with a chronic injury. The majority of acute grade III medial knee injuries will heal after a nonoperative rehabilitation program. In most instances when there is a knee dislocation or multiligament injury, a primary repair with sutures may be indicated. In severe midsubstance injuries or chronic medial knee injuries, an anatomic medial knee reconstruction with grafts may be indicated. Rehabilitation principles for acute medial knee injuries involve controlling edema, regaining range of motion, and avoiding any significant stress on the healing ligaments. A well-guided rehabilitation program can result in excellent functional outcomes in the majority of patients.

### Bilateral looser zones or pseudofractures in the anteromedial tibia as a component of medial tibial stress syndrome in athletes [^e6ebbad2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of BMD revealed no systemic reduction but significantly higher values in patients with pseudofractures compared to those with MTSS without pseudofractures. To our best knowledge, this finding has not been stated before and indicates that systemically intact bone status does not protect individuals from the development of local bone lesions, i.e. pseudofractures or MTSS. Furthermore, elevated BMD as a physiological response to increased mechanical load may even increase the risk for the development of pseudofractures in case of simultaneous vitamin D deficiency due to higher demand for mineral supply within the context of increased bone remodeling.

Previous studies of patients with MTSS have reported locally reduced BMD in affected tibiae, indicating increased remodeling taking place at these sites, as DXA measures mineralized tissue only. Consequently, the skeleton is more vulnerable to the development of pseudofractures in states of chronic vitamin D deficiency. Importantly, after normalization of clinical symptoms, BMD increased again and was re-established.

### Externally validated machine learning algorithm accurately predicts medial tibial stress syndrome in military trainees: a multicohort study [^71905689]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is a common cause of exercise-induced leg pain. Yates and White define MTSS as 'pain along the posteromedial border of the tibia that occurs due to exercise, excluding pain from ischaemic origin or signs of stress fracture'. Pain is typically spread over a minimum of 5 cm, and is recognisable on palpation of this posteromedial tibial border. Symptoms are described as a dull ache following exercise, lasting for hours or days. In severe cases, pain may be provoked at rest and during activities of daily living.

MTSS is frequently seen in active individuals, including runners, jumping athletes and military personnel. A 2012 systematic review, including 3500 runners, identified an incidence of 13.6%–20% over 12 months. This review highlighted MTSS as the most common running-related musculoskeletal injury, ahead of Achilles tendinopathy and patellofemoral pain syndrome.MTSS presents a significant medical burden among military populations, with up to 35% incidence reported across 10 weeks. Prospective data from 6608 British Army recruits found that MTSS is associated with the longest rehabilitation time, accounting for 19.8% of total recovery days. Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), a triservice officer cadet training facility, injury surveillance data from 2008 showed a mean of 57.5 days of incapacity per individual due to MTSS, which equates to $A6820 of wage costs for working days lost. In running populations, some runners may even take up to 300 days to recover sufficiently enough to complete an 18 min run.

### Abnormally decreased regional bone density in athletes with medial tibial stress syndrome [^ede88387]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Medial tibial stress syndrome, a common condition of uncertain origin found in athletes, is characterized by pain in the distal posteromedial aspect of the tibia during exercise, with or without increased scintigraphic uptake in the affected region. To determine whether medial tibial stress syndrome with increased scintigraphic uptake is associated with a change in tibial bone mineral density confined to the site of the increased uptake, we measured bone mineral density (in grams per square centimeter) in 18 adult male athletes with long-standing medial tibial stress syndrome and compared the measurements with those of 16 age- and sex-matched control subjects and with those of 18 athletes without medial tibial stress syndrome who had a comparable training regimen. Tibial bone mineral density in the region corresponding to the pain was 15% ± 9% lower in the patients than in control subjects and 23% ± 8% lower than in the athletic control subjects (both significant differences). Bone mineral densities in most other regions of the body were higher than in the control subjects but lower than in the athletic controls at the corresponding sites. In summary, medial tibial stress syndrome is associated with low regional bone mineral density.

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^d54d215a]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

What is already known?

Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is a progressive condition occurring along a continuum from tendon pain and dysfunction to acquired flatfoot deformity.
Management in the early stages is typically conservative, focusing on local strengthening exercises and arch-supporting devices.

What are the new findings?

High-quality clinical trials for the efficacy of exercise management in posterior tibial tendon dysfunction are lacking.
Exercise prescription parameters are poorly reported in the literature.
Preliminary evidence suggests exercise is beneficial in reducing pain and disability.

### Externally validated machine learning algorithm accurately predicts medial tibial stress syndrome in military trainees: a multicohort study [^a1f35fc4]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Objectives

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is a common musculoskeletal injury in both sporting and military settings. No reliable treatments exist, and reoccurrence rates are high. Prevention of MTSS is critical to reducing operational burden. Therefore, this study aimed to build a decision-making model to predict the individual risk of MTSS within officer cadets and test the external validity of the model on a separate military population.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

This study collected a suite of key variables previously established for predicting MTSS. Data were obtained from 107 cadets (34 women and 73 men). A follow-up survey was conducted at 3 months to determine MTSS diagnoses. Six ensemble learning algorithms were deployed and trained five times on random stratified samples of 75% of the dataset. The resultant algorithms were tested on the remaining 25% of the dataset, with models then compared for accuracy. The most accurate new algorithm was tested on an unrelated data sample of 123 Australian Navy recruits to establish external validity of the model.

Results

Calibrated random forest modelling was the most accurate in identifying a diagnosis of MTSS; (area under curve (AUC) = 98%, classification accuracy (CA) = 96%). External validation on a sample of Navy recruits resulted in comparable accuracy; (AUC = 95%, CA = 94%). When the model was tested on the combined datasets, similar accuracy was achieved; (AUC = 92%, CA = 91%).

Conclusion

This model is highly accurate in predicting those who will develop MTSS. The model provides important preventive capacity which should be trialled as a risk management intervention.

### Outcomes of surgical treatment for anterior tibial stress fractures in athletes: a systematic review [^298c71cf]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Although most anterior tibial stress fractures heal with nonoperative treatment, some may require surgical management. To our knowledge, no systematic review has been conducted regarding surgical treatment strategies for the management of chronic anterior tibial stress fractures from which general conclusions can be drawn regarding optimal treatment in high-performance athletes.

Purpose

This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the surgical outcomes of anterior tibial stress fractures in high-performance athletes.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

In February 2017, a systematic review of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL databases was performed to identify studies that reported surgical outcomes for anterior tibial stress fractures. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were screened, and reported outcome measures were documented.

Results

A total of 12 studies, published between 1984 and 2015, reporting outcomes for the surgical treatment of anterior tibial stress fractures were included in this review. All studies were retrospective case series. Collectively, surgical outcomes for 115 patients (74 males; 41 females) with 123 fractures were evaluated in this review. The overall mean follow-up was 23.3 months. The most common surgical treatment method reported in the literature was compression plating (n = 52) followed by drilling (n = 33). Symptom resolution was achieved in 108 of 123 surgically treated fractures (87.8%). There were 32 reports of complications, resulting in an overall complication rate of 27.8%. Subsequent tibial fractures were reported in 8 patients (7.0%). Moreover, a total of 17 patients (14.8%) underwent a subsequent procedure after their initial surgery. Following surgical treatment for anterior tibial stress fracture, 94.7% of patients were able to return to sports.

Conclusion

The available literature indicates that surgical treatment of anterior tibial stress fractures is associated with a high rate of symptom resolution and return to play in athletes, although the high complication rate and potential need for subsequent procedures are important considerations for surgeons and patients.

### The incidence and risk factors in the development of medial tibial stress syndrome among naval recruits [^96f78c3a]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify the incidence of medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) in a group of naval recruits undergoing a 10-week basic training period and to determine potential risk factors.

Method

One hundred and twenty-four recruits (84 men and 40 women) were followed prospectively during basic training. Anthropometric and lower limb biomechanical data were recorded at the start of the program along with injury history and previous sporting activity for the 3 months prior to enlisting. Recruits were monitored during training for development of medial tibial strees syndrome and were asked to complete an exit interview at the end of the program.

Results

Forty recruits (22 men and 18 women) developed medial tibial stress syndrome, giving an incidence of 35%. A significant relationship existed between gender and medial tibial stress syndrome (P = 0.012), with female recruits more likely to develop medial tibial stress syndrome than male recruits (53% vs 28%). A risk estimate revealed a relative risk of 2.03. The biomechanical results indicated a more pronated foot type (P = 0.002) in the medial tibial stress syndrome group when compared to the control group. A risk estimate established that recruits with a more pronated foot type had a relative risk of 1.70.

Conclusion

Identifying a pronated foot type prior to training may help reduce the incidence of medial tibial stress syndrome by early intervention to control abnormal pronation. Findings of a higher incidence of medial tibial stress syndrome among female recruits require further investigation.

### Use of extracorporeal shockwave therapies for athletes and physically active individuals: a systematic review [^6c5acca5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and investigate outcomes following the use of ESWT for athletes and physically active individuals.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and searched four databases: PubMed (NLM), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL Complete (EBSCO) and Web of Science (Clarivate).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Included studies were randomised controlled trials, cohort and case-control studies, cases series and reports that evaluated outcomes following ESWT for athletes, physically active individuals and occupational groups requiring regular physical activity such as military cadets.

Results

56 studies with 1874 athletes or physically active individuals were included. Using the Oxford level of evidence rating, included studies were 18 level I (32.1%), 3 level II (5.4%), 10 level III (17.9%), 13 level IV (23.2%) and 12 level V (21.4%). Based on the level I studies, ESWT may be effective alone in plantar fasciitis, lateral epicondylitis and proximal hamstring tendinopathy and as an adjunct to exercise treatment in medial tibial stress syndrome and osteitis pubis in athletes or physically active individuals. In most studies, athletes were allowed to continue activities and training and tolerated ESWT with minimal side effects.

Conclusion

ESWT may offer an efficacious treatment alone or as an adjunct to concurrent exercise therapy in selected sports-related injuries and without major adverse events. Further high-level research is needed to better define the role and clinical outcomes of ESWT.

### Conservative treatment of anterior chronic exertional compartment syndrome in the military, with a mid-term follow-up [^e711d1d0]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Inclusion

Medical records at the department of Military Sports Medicine were searched for all patients diagnosed with anterior CECS (Group 1) and anterior CECS+medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) (Group 2) sent from the Central Military Hospital in the years 2015–2018. The following baseline information was obtained: age (years), sex (male/female), height (m), weight (kg), body mass index, diagnosis (anterior CECS or anterior CECS+MTSS), intracompartmental pressure measurement values, duration of symptoms (months), repeat episode (yes/no), symptoms in first year of service (yes/no), the Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) score at intake. This SANE score is a single question instrument evaluating patients' subjective injury status with the following question: 'how would you rate your lower leg today as a percentage of normal, on a 0–100 scale, with 100 being normal' The SANE score was developed and validated in a military healthcare setting.

### Knee pain and mobility impairments: meniscal and articular cartilage lesions revision 2018 [^85f97e70]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Medium credibility.

Knee pain and mobility impairments — treatment planning principles emphasize phase of rehabilitation and irritability matching. Interventions are listed by phase of rehabilitation (early, early to late phase), and because irritability level often reflects the tissue's ability to accept physical stress, clinicians should match the most appropriate intervention strategies to the irritability level of the patient's condition; additionally, clinicians should consider influences from psychosocial factors in patients in all stages of recovery.

### Section modulus is the optimum geometric predictor for stress fractures and medial tibial stress syndrome in both male and female athletes [^67a03a6f]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Various tibial dimensions and geometric parameters have been linked to stress fractures in athletes and military recruits, but many mechanical parameters have still not been investigated.

Hypotheses

Sedentary people, athletes with medial tibial stress syndrome, and athletes with stress fractures have smaller tibial geometric dimensions and parameters than do uninjured athletes.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Using a total of 88 subjects, male and female patients with either a tibial stress fracture or medial tibial stress syndrome were compared with both uninjured aerobically active controls and uninjured sedentary controls. Tibial scout radiographs and cross-sectional computed tomography images of all subjects were scanned at the junction of the midthird and distal third of the tibia. Tibial dimensions were measured directly from the films; other parameters were calculated numerically.

Results

Uninjured exercising men have a greater tibial cortical cross-sectional area than do their sedentary and injured counterparts, resulting in a greater value of some other cross-sectional geometric parameters, particularly the section modulus. However, for women, the cross-sectional areas are either not different or only marginally different, and there are few tibial dimensions or geometric parameters that distinguish the uninjured exercisers from the sedentary and injured subjects. In women, the main difference between the groups was the distribution of cortical bone about the centroid as a result of the different values of section modulus. Last, medial tibial stress syndrome subjects had smaller tibial cross-sectional dimensions than did their uninjured exercising counterparts, suggesting that medial tibial stress syndrome is not just a soft-tissue injury but also a bony injury.

Conclusion

The results show that in men, the cross-sectional area and the section modulus are the key parameters in the tibia to distinguish exercise and injury status, whereas for women, it is the section modulus only.

### The effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in common lower limb conditions: a systematic review including quantification of patient-rated pain reduction [^5594b83b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in treating Achilles tendinopathy (AT), greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), patellar tendinopathy (PT) and proximal hamstring tendinopathy (PHT).

Design

Systematic review.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised and non-randomised studies assessing ESWT in patients with AT, GTPS, MTSS, PT and PHT were included. Risk of bias and quality of studies were evaluated.

Results

Moderate-level evidence suggests (1) no difference between focused ESWT and placebo ESWT at short and mid-term in PT and (2) radial ESWT is superior to conservative treatment at short, mid and long term in PHT. Low-level evidence suggests that ESWT (1) is comparable to eccentric training, but superior to wait-and-see policy at 4 months in mid-portion AT; (2) is superior to eccentric training at 4 months in insertional AT; (3) less effective than corticosteroid injection at short term, but ESWT produced superior results at mid and long term in GTPS; (4) produced comparable results to control treatment at long term in GTPS; and (5) is superior to control conservative treatment at long term in PT. Regarding the rest of the results, there was only very low or no level of evidence. 13 studies showed high risk of bias largely due to methodology, blinding and reporting.

Conclusion

Low level of evidence suggests that ESWT may be effective for some lower limb conditions in all phases of the rehabilitation.

### Cycling injuries of the lower extremity [^8c7f9545]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Cycling is an increasingly popular recreational and competitive activity, and cycling-related injuries are becoming more common. Many common cycling injuries of the lower extremity are preventable. These include knee pain, patellar quadriceps tendinitis, iliotibial band syndrome, hip pain, medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fracture, compartment syndrome, numbness of the foot, and metatarsalgia. Injury is caused by a combination of inadequate preparation, inappropriate equipment, poor technique, and overuse. Nonsurgical management may include rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection, ice, a reduction in training intensity, orthotics, night splints, and physical therapy. Injury prevention should be the focus, with particular attention to bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, proper rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training.

### One out of four recruits drops out from elite military training due to musculoskeletal injuries in the Netherlands armed forces [^3e6d9c11]. BMJ Military Health (2022). High credibility.

Statistical methods

For statistical analysis, R V.3.5.3 was used in RStudio. Sample characteristics were summarised as frequencies and percentages for nominal variables, mean and SD for continuous variables with an approximate normal distribution and median and IQRs for continuous variables with a skewed distribution and ordinal variables. Dropout rates and dropout due to MSIs were described as percentages of the total number of persons in training. Acute and gradual onset injuries were described as a percentage of all MSIs. We calculated incidence density rates per 100 person-years (100 py), with a corresponding 95% CI.MSI incidence density rates are presented per body region for the RNLMC and AMB separately. As 'shin pain' is part of the code for leg/thigh complaints but is not covered by a unique ICPC-2 code, one researcher (ID) ran a query on the following terms in the diagnosis column: shin*, medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), MTSS, chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS), CECS, lower leg*. The retrieved records were interpreted and classified as shin pain or other leg/thigh complaints by the same researcher. We explored the number of training days with activity restrictions due to the MSIs with the highest incidence density rates and presented these as the average number of days per injury. When a military physician-prescribed activity restrictions of 'several weeks' we computed 21 days, and in case of prescribing 'several months', we computed 91 days. Lastly, primary care treatments are summarised descriptively and evaluated on common pitfalls; overuse of imaging, overuse of surgery, overuse of opioids, and failure to provide injury-specific information and management options.

### Paradoxical change in subchondral bone density in the medial compartment of the proximal tibial articular surface after high tibial osteotomy: a detailed subchondral bone density analysis [^38174506]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High tibial osteotomy (HTO) aims to realign the varus knee to alleviate stress in the medial compartment. However, detailed information on the impact of HTO on stress distribution across the tibiofemoral joint surface still needs to be completely elucidated.

Purpose/Hypothesis

The present study aimed to analyze the subchondral bone density distribution to validate the alignment threshold causing paradoxical changes. We hypothesized that there would be a paradoxical stress change in the medial compartment beyond a specific threshold for lower limb realignment after HTO.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

A retrospective clinical study of 32 knees from 30 patients who underwent medial opening-wedge HTO between 2015 and 2019 was conducted at Hokkaido University Hospital. The subchondral bone density across the tibiofemoral joint was analyzed using computed tomography-osteoabsorptiometry before and after HTO. The high-density area (HDA) within the medial and lateral compartments and their subregions, which were quartered in the coronal plane, was specifically examined.

Results

The hip-knee-ankle angle, medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), joint line obliquity (JLO), and joint line convergence angle significantly changed after HTO (P < .01). The HDA of the medial compartment to the total HDA ratio decreased from 83% to 77%. Paradoxically, the HDA in the most central subregion of the medial compartment increased from 24% to 30%. There were significant differences between MPTA and JLO in patients with and without paradoxical changes in the HDA. MPTA and JLO cutoff values causing paradoxical changes in the HDA were 94° and 4°, respectively.

Conclusion

There was a paradoxical stress increase in the M4 region at the medial compartment associated with the MPTA and JLO beyond specific thresholds. Therefore, surgical planning should be cautiously performed to prevent overcorrection, which can lead to adverse stress distribution changes.

### Shedding light on the non-operative treatment of the forgotten side of the knee: rehabilitation of medial collateral ligament injuries-a systematic review [^30538ae8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Isolated MCL injuries are primarily treated non-surgically, including physiotherapeutic intervention in rehabilitation and exercise therapy. The non-surgical treatment of most isolated injuries is logical, as the deep part of the MCL has historically been described as having good self-healing capacity because it is related to the joint capsule. Recent advances in clinical practice have suggested that the location of the MCL injury better explains why some MCL injuries heal well. In contrast, femoral MCL injuries tend to do well unless there is an avulsion off the bone, while tibial injuries can be more problematic. As part of the non-surgical treatment of isolated MCL injuries, typically grade II or III, a hinged brace can protect the knee from further valgus stress. Some injuries may, however, be recommended for acute surgery: grade III isolated MCL tears in athletes, with medial joint opening in full extension with valgus applied, or a tibial avulsion with the MCL folded into the medial joint, or a Stener lesion with the MCL lying superficial to the pes anserine tendons; or a positive dial test indicating anteromedial rotatory instability. Following the failure of non-surgical treatment, a patient may experience persistent symptoms and/or activity limitations, and surgical treatment may be considered. Despite the practice of non-surgical treatment for most isolated MCL injuries, the evidence regarding the structure and content of rehabilitation is limited. In addition, there is no aggregated evidence on the outcome of non-surgical treatment after MCL injury. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed the current literature regarding the non-surgical treatment of isolated MCL injuries. A secondary objective was to investigate surgical and non-surgical treatment outcomes for MCL injuries.

### Incidence and risk factors of medial tibial stress syndrome: a prospective study in physical education teacher education students [^d5447498]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has some limitations that need to be addressed. First, our study used a self-evaluation injury registration. This method may overestimate the actual incidence of MTSS. We attempted to minimise this effect by using a validated questionnaire and a precise definition. Second, our study managed to reach a response of 87%. The 13% missing may bias the results, underestimating the incidence of MTSS and the significance of the risk factors. Third, we did not control for sports exposition. Fourth, the physical screening test results may have limited reliability. Most of the conducted tests are well documented in the literature and have good reliability. However, we did not analyse inter-rater reliability during the training sessions. Thus, the results should be treated with care.

This study also had some strengths. First, we used a relatively large population compared with previous prospective studies, and we included both men and women. Second, we used a relatively extended follow-up period in comparison with most previous studies on MTSS.

### Externally validated machine learning algorithm accurately predicts medial tibial stress syndrome in military trainees: a multicohort study [^1e65a58c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Future research

This study did not successfully capture week-to-week training loads, only the self-reported baseline running load. Investigation into risk factor screening combined with training load monitoring to predict future injury is not well established. Studies have typically used either analysis of risk factors alone, or training loads and their relationship with injury. It is proposed that those accustomed to increased training loads have reduced injuries compared with those unaccustomed individuals. In team sport, evidence exists supporting that sharp increases in training load and spikes in acute (7 days) to chronic workload (28 days) ratios (ACWR) are associated with higher injury rates. Research by Rossi et al has shed light on the accuracy of using global positioning systems (GPS) training data in combination with ML algorithms to forecast injury risk in team sport athletes. Rossi et al used GPS data to calculate individual ACWR profiles. However, rather than focusing purely on the ACWR, Gabbettrecommend consideration of known moderators to the workload–injury relationship (eg, injury history and other factors known to influence the risk of injury). A moderator may either increase or decrease risk of injury at a given training load. Specific to MTSS, example moderators to the workload–injury relationship may include MTSS history and previous years of running experience. Importantly, Wang et al highlighted several potential limitations of using the ACWR. These authors suggest that the ACWR is vulnerable to sparse data bias, time-dependent confounding and recurrent injuries. An alternative may be the use of causal inference-based strategies, which account for time dependencies of activity and confounders (eg, training schedules). Future research using the ACWR may consider using both time-to-event and multilevel modelling. Nevertheless, the application of an ML methodology that targets risk factor profiling combined with training load monitoring is worth investigating within military settings.

Risk factor profiling for MTSS only contributes to one piece of the puzzle. The next step to managing this difficult condition may be through modifying the modifiable risk factors. Once an individual has been identified as 'at risk', the design and implementation of injury prevention programmes may serve as the best approach to reducing MTSS incidence. Like other musculoskeletal conditions, risk prediction for MTSS is often complex and multivariate. In Lahti et al s' work in professional football players, multifactorial and individualised risk reduction programmes were prescribed based on the outcomes of risk factor screening. Such approach is worth investigating within a military sample.

### Stress injuries to bone in college athletes: a retrospective review of experience at a single institution [^28e6c0c8]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

No comprehensive studies have been published on stress injuries to bone in college athletes.

Purpose

To review, in a college athlete population, the epidemiologic aspects of stress injuries to bone, and to examine a subset of patients who were treated with a uniform protocol for return to activities, with magnetic resonance imaging as the primary tool for diagnosis.

Study Type

Retrospective review.

Methods

Ten years of medical records from a Division I college institution were reviewed. Location and grade of stress injury to bone and duration of disability were recorded. All injured athletes followed the same treatment program, with the exception of football players, who were excluded from the return to sport analyses.

Results

Seventy-four athletes had lower extremity symptoms consistent with stress injury to bone. Diagnosis was confirmed in 68 of these athletes, 61 via magnetic resonance imaging, 6 via positive radiographs only, and 1 via bone scan only. Distance runners accounted for the most stress injuries to bone for both men and women. The tibia (37%) was the most frequently involved bone; however, as an anatomic region, the foot (44%) was the site of the most stress injuries. There was a significant correlation between grade of injury and time to full return to activity.

Conclusions

The grading system used at this institution is a standardized tool that can be used to predict time to return to sport. A standardized rehabilitation protocol allowed for an appropriate plan to return the athletes to pain-free competition.

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^1212d5ac]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was performed using a predetermined protocol in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. It was registered with PROSPERO (trial registration number CRD42017076156) and is available at.

Search strategy and data sources

To answer the research question about the treatment effects of local strengthening exercises for PTTD, four electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, Embase and PubMed) were searched from inception to June 2018 for full-text papers published in peer-reviewed journals. A comprehensive search strategy was developed to capture variations in terminology used in the literature for PTTD and key conservative interventions (online supplementary table 1). No further limits were applied to the initial search strategy. Reference list checks and author searches were also performed to ensure all relevant literature was identified.

Eligibility criteria

Eligibility criteria were determined prospectively using the patient, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) framework. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they investigated individuals with PTTD or adult-acquired flatfoot deformity due to PTTD, if they were randomised, and if local strengthening was compared with other forms of conservative management with respect to pain, function and/or physical impairment outcome measures. A diagnosis of PTTD was required to be made based on a minimal list of diagnostic criteria, with two or more of the following: tenderness on palpation of the posterior tibial tendon, pain and/or swelling along the posterior tibial tendon, medial foot pain, difficulty and/or pain with single leg heel raise, and inability to invert the calcaneus on double leg heel raise. Flatfoot deformity was not considered as a selection criterion and as such all stages of PTTD were included.

Trials were excluded if they compared surgical interventions for PTTD, did not include a comparator group and combined data for individuals diagnosed with conditions other than PTTD. Reviews, case studies and trials for paediatric flatfoot, asymptomatic flatfoot, neurological conditions and rheumatoid arthritis were also excluded.

Study selection

The lead reviewer (MHR) performed the search and exported all retrieved records into EndNote V.X7 (Thompson Reuters, Carlsbad, California, USA). Duplicates were removed and titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers (MHR and RM), based on established eligibility criteria. Full texts were retrieved for all potentially eligible papers and reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Where there were uncertainties, at least one additional author (MDS or BV) was consulted to determine final eligibility.

### Clinical outcomes of exercise rehabilitation for degenerative tibial meniscal tears: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^3bfd2e9e]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, the treatment options for DMLT mainly include surgical and conservative approaches. Conservative treatment aims to alleviate pain and swelling through rest, ice application, and the use of topical analgesics, as well as physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises to strengthen the supporting muscles around the knee and promote joint function recovery. Surgical treatment is the primary option for most meniscal injuries, comprising meniscal repair, meniscectomy, and meniscal transplantation. Meniscal repair involves fixing the damaged meniscal tissue using sutures or other techniques while preserving as much of the normal tissue as possible; meniscectomy mainly involves removing part or all of the damaged meniscal tissue; meniscal transplantation replaces the damaged meniscal tissue with healthy tissue from a donor, depending on the extent of the meniscal injury.

Whether it's conservative or surgical treatment, rehabilitation and recovery training are crucial steps. Through physical therapy and exercise rehabilitation, patients are assisted in restoring joint function, strengthening muscle support, reducing pain, and improving the quality of life. A plethora of past research has demonstrated that exercise therapy facilitates the healing and recovery of injured tissues. Appropriate exercise training can enhance muscle strength, improve joint stability, promote soft tissue repair, and bone reconstruction, thereby accelerating the recovery process. Regular physical exercise enhances the muscular resilience of DMLT patients, improves joint flexibility and balance, thereby aiding in the reduction of joint stress and consequently alleviating pain. It also helps in relieving anxiety and depression, improving self-perception and psychological state, returning to normal life and work conditions, and enhancing the quality of life.

X-ray, MRI, CT, Bone Scan

X-ray: According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, radiographs should be the initial imaging modality utilized for the evaluation of knee pain. Radiographs provide adequate evaluation of the joint space, osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation, displaced or chronic stress fractures, joint effusions, and sclerosis in the subarticular region.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): If radiographs are normal, or demonstrate a joint effusion, the ACR recommends an MRI without intravenous (IV) contrast as the next most appropriate study. MRI accurately demonstrates the soft tissues of the knee, without the use of ionizing radiation, and depicts tendon and ligamentous damage, tears and other abnormalities of the meniscus, the presence of synovitis, the extent of effusions, the presence and/or rupture of a popliteal cyst, the extent of cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions, subchondral insufficiency fractures, tibial stress fractures, and osteonecrosis.
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or a joint effusion is detected. However, the utilization of IV contrast may be beneficial to help more accurately diagnose such causes of chronic knee pain as infrapatellar bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome ("runner's knee"), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), and Hoffa's fat pad syndrome.
Computed tomography (CT): While not a first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of knee pain, according to the ACR, under certain circumstances, a CT without IV contrast may be indicated for the evaluation of knee pain, especially in settings where MRI may be contraindicated (ie, in a patient with a non-MRI compatible pacemaker, spinal column stimulator, or deep brain stimulator). CT offers enhanced bony detail and may be useful to confirm a prior osseous injury such as a subtle acute non-displaced fracture or chronic stress fracture. In the setting of chronic knee pain related to patellofemoral syndrome, CT may be helpful in evaluating the patellofemoral anatomy.CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated but may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies.
Bone scan: Bone scan is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with knee pain. Bone scan has low specificity and decreased anatomic resolution when compared to CT or MRI. However, bone scan may help to distinguish between bone and soft-tissue origins for pain.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not often useful as a diagnostic tool for the comprehensive examination of the knee. It may be appropriate to use ultrasound to confirm a suspected effusion or popliteal cyst, and can be utilized to guide in aspiration of synovial fluid which can be evaluated for crystal disease or infection. It also may be utilized to evaluate for synovial pathology, where the use of power Doppler ultrasound can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow that is associated with knee pain. Ultrasound is also useful for following patients with iliotibial (IT) band syndrome and in evaluating medial plicae. Ultrasound can also demonstrate an extrusion of the meniscus (with is suggestive of an underlying meniscal tear) and, on occasion, can detect peripheral meniscus tears, and chondrocalcinosis.

### Factors contributing to medial tibial stress syndrome in runners: a prospective study [^3654ab29]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is one of the most common overuse injuries sustained by runners. Despite the prevalence of this injury, risk factors for developing MTSS remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate differences in passive range of motion, muscle strength, plantar pressure distributions, and running kinematics between runners who developed MTSS and those who did not.

Methods

Twenty-four National Collegiate Athletic Association Division 1 cross-country runners participated in this study. Participants underwent a clinical examination documenting passive range of motion and muscle strength at the hips and ankles. Plantar pressure analysis was used to quantify mediolateral pressure balances while walking and 3D motion capture was used to quantify running kinematics. Participants were followed up for a 2-yr period during which time any runners who developed MTSS were identified by the team's certified athletic trainer.

Results

Runners who developed MTSS demonstrated tighter iliotibial bands (P = 0.046; effect size [ES] = 1.07), weaker hip abductors (P = 0.008, ES = 1.51), more pressure under the medial aspect of their foot at initial foot contact (P = 0.001, ES = 1.97), foot flat (P < 0.001, ES = 3.25), and heel off (P = 0.034, ES = 1.30), greater contralateral pelvic drop (P = 0.021, ES = 1.06), and greater peak amounts (P = 0.017, ES = 1.42) and durations (P < 0.001, ES = 2.52) of rearfoot eversion during stance phase. A logistic regression (χ = 21.31, P < 0.001) indicated that every 1% increase in eversion duration increased odds of developing MTSS by 1.38 (P = 0.015).

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that the development of MTSS is multifactorial, with passive range of motion, muscle strength, plantar pressure distributions, and both proximal and distal kinematics all playing a role. We suggest that coaches or sports medicine professionals screening runners for injury risk consider adopting a comprehensive evaluation which includes all these areas.

Meniscal Injuries

Background: The menisci function to absorb shock and transmit load forces across the femorotibial joint and protect the articular cartilage. The medial and lateral menisci are composed of layers of collagen fibers. The superficial layer is finely woven, the surface layer comprises randomly oriented fibers, and the deepest layer is a combination of circumferential and radial fibers. The menisci are located between the medial and lateral femorotibial joints. The medial meniscus is attached to the tibial plateau by the coronary ligaments and is C-shaped. The lateral meniscus is circular and more mobile with loose attachments. The outermost 3 mm is the "red zone", is well vascularized from the peri-meniscal plexus off the genicular arteries. Most tears in the red zone will heal. Within 3–5mm from the capsular junction is the "white zone", with reduced perfusion, some tears will heal. The remaining meniscus > 5mm from the capsular junction makes up the inner two-thirds, is avascular, receives nutrients from the synovial fluid, and most tears will not heal. Meniscus tears cause knee pain by direct effect on the nociceptors in the meniscus tissue and synovium, as well as by elevated levels of intra-articular cytokines.
Types of traumatic tears: Longitudinal vertical tear: if lesion stable then conservative management. Surgical debridement vs repair for unstable lesions. Radial tear: debridement vs surgical repair. Root tear: often associated with ACL tear, debridement vs surgical repair.
Types of degenerative tears: Horizontal cleavage in young athletes: rare, due to overuse, if cessation of the activity fails then proceed to surgical intervention. Degenerative meniscal lesions in the elderly: prevalence increases with age, 60% asymptomatic, associated with osteoarthritis, conservative management.
Diagnostic criteria: Clinical presentation includes joint line pain, knee locking, and positive special tests including McMurray, Ege, and Thessaly due to their high sensitivity and specificity. Radiologic evaluation with weightbearing AP, lateral, and Schuss views are first-line evaluation to assess for alternative sources of pain such as osteoarthritis. If pain persists despite conservative therapy, MRI is obtained to evaluate the menisci.
Treatment: Similar to sprains, pain secondary to meniscal injuries is managed symptomatically (ie, PT and NSAIDs). If the pain fails to respond to conservative care and/or persists beyond the acute phase, intra-articular injections should be considered.
Intra articular platelet-rich-plasma injection has not been identified to improve meniscus healing. If the joint is unstable and/or non-invasive treatment modalities fail, surgical intervention is usually indicated, depending on the type and severity of the tear.

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^94f6f0dd]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

It was common among included trials for the intervention protocol to include cointerventions such as stretching and orthoses, in addition to specific local strengthening exercises. It is possible that the effect of the local strengthening intervention was affected by these cointerventions. As no randomised trial has looked at local strengthening in isolation (ie, not combined with stretching/orthoses or balance and stretching exercises), it is difficult to ascertain to what degree improvements can be attributed to targeted exercises only. Two trials that investigated stretching, orthoses and local strengthening compared with stretching and orthoses alone showed similar improvement in pain and function in all groups. It is possible that orthoses and/or stretching play a role in the reduction of pain. Future research is required to investigate strength interventions in isolation of other treatments to establish its efficacy in the management of PTTD.

Interestingly, stretching exercises were included in all intervention groups across the three included trials. Both gastrocnemius and soleus stretches were prescribed for 3–10 repetitions of 30 s duration, 2–4 times per day. This stretch is performed in maximal dorsiflexion, which increases the compressive as well as the tensile load on the posterior tibial tendon posterior to the medial malleolus, the combination of which has been found to be most damaging to the tendon. Load management for pain relief in tendinopathy rehabilitation is twofold, incorporating the reduction of both compressive and tensile loads. So while foot orthoses and activity modification may aid in altering tensile loads (supporting the medial longitudinal arch and reducing the torque required from the tibialis posterior during activities), accompanying these interventions with static stretches in full dorsiflexion may be counterproductive to pain management and rehabilitation.

Distal Femoral and Proximal Tibial Osteotomies

The final tool in the orthopedic armamentarium for joint preservation about the knee has been mechanical alignment procedures. Patients with greater than 5 degrees of mechanical malalignment have been shown to be at increased risk of progressive arthritic deformity in the overloaded knee compartment. This poses a difficult problem as younger patients with symptomatic unicompartmental arthritic changes are at increased risk of failure and dissatisfaction with arthroplasty procedures. As such, distal femoral and proximal tibial osteotomies have been proposed to neutralize alignment and treat unicompartmental pain. For varus deformities, a closing wedge lateral tibial/femoral osteotomy or opening medial femoral/tibial osteotomy is typically performed. Conversely, for valgus deformities, an opening wedge lateral tibial/femoral osteotomy or closing wedge medial femoral/tibial osteotomy can be performed. Comparison of opening and closing wedge osteotomies is not definitive and advantages/risks exist with either treatment method. Closing wedge osteotomy proponents advocate stability of bone-on-bone apposition for healing, while opening wedge osteotomy proponents argue that correction is less reliant upon preoperative planning and there is greater ability to augment correction intraoperatively. In addition, specific anatomic concerns with each approach make this surgeon dependent. Despite this, literature suggests that young patients (< 60 years of age), with isolated unicompartmental arthritis, good preoperative range of motion and ligamentous stability benefit clinically from distal femoral osteotomy or high tibial osteotomy. There are concerns however as survivorship at 10 years is somewhere between 51% and 90%, and conversion from an osteotomy to an arthroplasty is technically demanding.

### Incidence and risk factors of medial tibial stress syndrome: a prospective study in physical education teacher education students [^0a489791]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Objective

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is a common lower extremity overuse injury often causing long-term reduction of sports participation. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of MTSS in first-year Dutch Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) students.

Methods

This prospective study consisted of physical measures at baseline (height, weight, fat percentage, 3000 m run test, navicular drop test, hip internal and external range of motion, hip adduction and adduction strength, single leg squat and shin palpation), an intake questionnaire at baseline (age, sport participation, presence of MTSS, MTSS history, insole use and use of supportive shoes) and an MTSS registration procedure during the academic year of 2016–2017 (10 months) using a validated questionnaire. In total 221 first-year PETE students were included, of whom 170 (77%) were male and 51 (23%) female. The evaluation of risk factors was conducted with univariable and multivariable logistic generalised estimating equation analyses.

Results

In total 55 (25%) subjects, 35 (21%) men and 20 (39%) women, developed MTSS during the follow-up period. The associated risk factors were female sex (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.39 to 7.11), above-average age (OR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.76), above-average body mass index (OR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 5.16) and history of MTSS (OR = 5.03, 95% CI 1.90 to 13.30).

Conclusion

The incidence of MTSS is high in PETE students. Several risk factors were identified. These results demonstrate the need for prevention and may provide direction to preventive intervention design.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 2: surgical techniques, outcomes and rehabilitation [^abef1c1e]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Indications for PCL-R

Operative treatment of PCL injuries is indicated for patients with symptomatic grade III (complete) tears displaying inadequate functional improvement in response to non-operative treatment. Furthermore, patients with PCL injuries with high-grade knee laxity, or combined with intraarticular or capsuloligamentous injuries should be considered for operative treatment. A side-to-side difference in posterior tibial translation (PTT) greater than 8 mm revealed by stress-radiography indicates a complete PCL tear and presents an indication for operative treatment for symptomatic patients. Additionally, the patient's demands are essential in treatment decision-making, leading to the recommendation of PCL-R in an athletic population. There is currently insufficient evidence in the literature to support a definitive treatment protocol; however, the historical preference towards non-operative treatment of isolated PCL injuries has recently displayed a shift in favor of operative treatment. Indications for operative treatment may be based on increased translational and rotational tibial movement compared to contralateral PCL intact knees (as measured on in vivo kinematic analyses). An increasing number of intra-articular injuries (meniscus, cartilage), pathological changes of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and an increased joint contact pressure (tibiofemoral and patellofemoral) have been observed in PCL deficient patients.

A failure rate of 1–25% after primary PCL-R is reported, mounting to 45% if unfavorable patient-reported outcomes (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score < 40 points) are considered as subjective failure. However, inadequate reporting and varying definitions of failures require caution in the interpretation of failure rates. Debilitating pain and functional impairment during daily activities combined with a PTT of ≥ 10 mm or confirmed graft failure based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are accepted indications for revision PCL-R. The aim of revision PCL-R is to address the cause of initial failure and eliminate concurrent pathological changes causing pain and instability. Therefore, in case of revision PCL-R, extended diagnostic work-up including MRI, hip-knee-ankle radiographs, and computed tomography (CT) scans are required to assess concomitant injuries, lower limb alignment, and prior bone tunnel placement. The requirement of bone grafting due to prior semi-anatomic bone tunnels or the need for corrective osteotomies sometimes require staged revision PCL-R.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^1b7bbebb]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The medial knee joint is more susceptible to mechanical stress which leads to overloading of the articular cartilage and can cause early degeneration. Unloader or offloading braces work to remove some of the medial or lateral compartment stress on the knee joint as well as improve bone alignment. These braces may in fact provide significant improvement in pain and function. In medial compartment OA, the varus deformity that develops can be offset by the valgus force against the joint from a brace; unloading the medial joint which has become compressed. Valgus offloading or unloader braces may be used. One study failed to show a difference both radiographically and clinically between the N = 50 Bledsoe Thruster brace and the N = 50 SofTec OA brace at 2 and 12 weeks follow-up, showing that both braces are effective in treating of varus medial knee OA (Level 1, Grade C). One paper concludes with a low quality of evidence that wearing a knee brace past 12 months as compared to not wearing one does not provide a difference in pain reduction or increased joint function and there is evidence that wearers may discontinue use due to this lack of effect. A Cochrane review showed bracing to be effective in treating unicompartmental OA, especially medial compartment allowing for improved function, which improved activity levels, thus allowing more opportunity for strengthening and weight loss. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), the OsteoArthritis Research Society International (OARSI), and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recently put forth that knee OA management suggests the use of medications, exercise, strength training. There is however a lack of consensus regarding knee offloader braces. The OARSI did not recommend offloading braces citing "inconclusive evidence" of their symptomatic benefit, yet were "strongly recommended" in the new ACR guidelines.

Follow-up

During the follow-up period, subjects were asked to complete an MTSS registration form every five curricular weeks, in total on seven occasions. MTSS was defined as an exercise-induced pain at the medial side of the tibia. The registration form included the Dutch version of the MTSS score questionnaire, designed and validated by Winters et al (2016). The questionnaire contained an entry question regarding the presence of MTSS on the left leg, the right leg or both legs. When MTSS was indicated, the nature of the complaints had to be specified in four questions with four answer options: (1) limitations for participating in sporting activities (no limitations - no participation); (2) pain while performing sporting activities (no pain - unable to exercise); (3) pain during walking (no pain - unable to walk); and (4) pain at rest (no pain - very painful). Based on the answers an MTSS severity score (scale: 0–10, with 0 indicating no complaints and 10 indicating maximal complaints) was calculated.

Data analysis and statistics

Subjects were included in the study when (1) at least three follow-up questionnaires were completed, and (2) only one or two questionnaires were completed, but with the indication of MTSS in at least one questionnaire. Legs with an MTSS severity score equal or higher than 1 in one or more of the follow-up questionnaires were considered as MTSS legs. Baseline test results were presented in mean and SD for continuous variables and numbers and percentages in dichotomous variables. Continuous data from men and women were combined after dichotomising the data as higher and lower than average for men and women separately. The association between the potential risk factors and MTSS was analysed at the leg level using logistic general estimating equation (GEE) analysis. GEE was used to take into account the dependency of the observations of the two legs within the subject. Both univariable and multivariable logistic GEE analyses were performed. Only variables with a p value lower than 0.20 in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. P values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical tests were performed with IBM SPSS V.24.

### Risk factors of lower extremity injuries in youth athletes [^48927722]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The number of sport-related injuries in youth athletes has steadily increased, due to increased sports participation. Lower extremity sports injuries frequently occur during an individual's growth period. Research into the numerous factors related to sports injuries is important for preventing acute and overuse disorders.

Sport-related injuries can be divided by cause according to trauma or overuse. Examples of acute traumatic sports injuries include ligament tears, fractures and contusions. Numerous studies on traumatic injuries have been conducted to determine methods for injury prevention. A hip-focused injury prevention programme also demonstrated a significant reduction in anterior cruciate ligament knee injuries in female basketball players. Prevention programmes have also been reported to significantly reduce the risk of ankle injuries.

Overuse injuries, known as chronic injuries, are a category of sport-related injuries that have an insidious onset and do not have a single definable event associated with their onset. Typical examples of overuse injuries include tendinitis, bursitis, medial tibial stress syndrome and stress fractures. Female athletes between the ages of 5 and 17 years had a higher rate of overuse injuries than traumatic injuries. Osgood-Schlatter disease, a traction apophysitis of the tibial tuberosity caused by repetitive strain on the quadriceps femoris muscle, typically occurs in adolescents ranging from 10 to 14 years of age and mainly affects boys involved in sports activities that require repetitive jumping (such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, baseball and tennis). Medial tibial stress syndrome is also one of the common injuries in young athletes. Incidence rates of 14%–20% have been reported for medial tibial stress syndrome in runners. Recent studies have focused attention on the prevention of overuse injuries. Numerous overuse injuries result from a complex interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors are defined as individual biological characteristics such as anatomical factors, growth-related factors and previous injuries, while extrinsic factors include training workload, equipment and environment.

The object of the current study was to analyse the risk factors of lower extremity sports injuries in youth athletes. The secondary objective of this study was to clarify the factors related to new injuries after a lower extremity injury. The hypothesis for this study is that the incidence of lower extremity injuries is related to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. These results might help suggest how to create a new injury prevention programme.

Preoperative planning and surgical procedure

Preoperative planning was a standard practice, involving the analysis of anteroposterior standing full weightbearing lower limb radiographs to measure the mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA) and proximal medial tibial angle (PMTA) for determining correction angles. The goal was to align the mTFA to a range of neutral to 2° of valgus. All surgical procedures were conducted by an experienced fellowship trained surgeon (M.H.). After adequately exposing the proximal tibia, a biplane osteotomy was performed with an angle of 110°–120° in the coronal plane to enhance primary stability. Internal fixation was achieved using a TomoFix™. The gap was filled in every case, in the vast majority with allograft and in some cases with bone fillers. Notably, no concomitant procedures, such as meniscectomies, chondral lesion treatments or ligament surgeries, were performed in this group. Patients were initially allowed partial weight‐bearing with 20 kg for 6 weeks, progressing to full weight‐bearing thereafter. Scheduled routine follow‐ups were conducted at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and annually thereafter.

### Incidence and risk factors of medial tibial stress syndrome: a prospective study in physical education teacher education students [^1a2f42cb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is one of the most common lower extremity injuries. It is induced by weight-bearing activities, like running or jumping, and characterised by pain on the posteromedial border of the tibia. Incidence rates of 7%–35% are reported in military personnel,14%–20% in runnersand 20% in female Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) students. Usually, MTSS leads to a prolonged period of physical complaints and a reduced ability to participate in sports activities. To design preventive measures, a profound insight into, preferably modifiable, factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing MTSS is needed.

Several intrinsic risk factors for MTSS have been identified in review studies. The most significant risk factors are female sex, history of MTSSand higher navicular drop. Other significant risk factors are high body mass index (BMI), increased weight, high plantar flexion range of motion (ROM), high hip external ROM, lower internal rotation ROM, lower calf girth, previous running injury, running experienceand orthotic use. Numerous other potentially relevant factors have been investigated for their association with MTSS, including shin pain at palpation, shin oedema, knee varus-valgus, running performance and sports participation. However, the literature is not consistent on the significance of the above risk factors.

For a more indepth exploration of the risk factors, there is a need for more prospective studies. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the incidence of MTSS in PETE students. The secondary goals investigated the significance of factors associated with an increased risk for developing MTSS, including sex, BMI, length, weight, fat percentage, age, MTSS history, shin pain at palpation, shin oedema, navicular drop, hip ROM, hip strength, knee varus-valgus, running performanceand sport participation.

### Conservative treatment of anterior chronic exertional compartment syndrome in the military, with a mid-term follow-up [^25bacc29]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Comprehensive conservative outpatient treatment programme

At the department of Military Sports Medicine, each patient received a comprehensive conservative outpatient treatment programme with a selection of interventions described in the literature:stretching and/or strengthening of lower extremity musculature, massage of hypertonic musculature, dry needling of trigger points, extracorporeal shockwave therapy to the medial tibial border, supplementation of vitamin D, evaluation of running shoes, evaluation of shoe inlays, maintaining fitness with a low impact training programme, gait retraining of running and marching and a progressive running schedule. For each of the aforementioned interventions, local protocol describes criteria for application (table 1). If patients received extracorporeal shockwave therapy for MTSS (once per week, four sessions), gait retraining was postponed for the duration of this treatment. Once free of pain in rest, every service member received a 6-week progressive running programme building up to a 15 min uninterrupted run. Some service members with a physically demanding specialty, received an additional 6-week progressive running schedule to build to a 30 min uninterrupted run, before return to base. Overall, special emphasis was placed on gait retraining of running and marching, in shoes and boots and retention of these newly learnt movement skills. Each patient with anterior CECS received four–six individual gait retraining sessions also described previously in detail.

Standard care for exercise-related leg pain: criteria for application (version 2018)

Evaluation of clinical progress was done every time the patient visited the department. If resumption of running and marching with low pain scores was not possible and it was unlikely that treatment success was to be expected, the patient was sent back to the department of surgery in the Central Military Hospital. Patients were allowed to return to base, when they could run at least 12 min pain free and when patient and physician both thought return to base could lead to resumption of military duties. During final evaluation, the SANE score was recorded again (SANE-evaluation).

Follow-up survey

Minimal follow-up was set at 1 year. Therefore, in December 2018 and January 2019, all 2015–2017 patients were contacted by telephone by an instructed medical student. A brief survey with closed questions on military status (active duty, yes/no), less demanding military specialty (yes/no), fasciotomy (yes/no), symptoms (yes/no) and SANE score (0–100) was conducted.

### High tibial osteotomy for varus deformity of the knee [^6faf2bb9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient Evaluation and Selection

Nonsmoking patients up to 60 years of age with a high preoperative activity level, a body mass index < 30 kg/m², mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the medial compartment defined as Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2 or less, and intact cartilage and meniscus in the lateral compartment are considered the ideal patients for valgus HTO. Surgical indications include varus alignment with the aforementioned medial compartment pathologies in addition to chronic lateral ligamentous instability and failed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with deformity in the setting of revision ligamentous reconstruction in a combined or staged fashion when appropriate.

In addition to a thorough history, including past surgical and nonsurgical treatments such as appropriate physical therapy, bracing treatment, and/or injections, along with a complete physical examination, the initial evaluation should include standing alignment radiographs along with dedicated radiographs of the knee. A complete radiographic evaluation for preoperative planning should include weight-bearing AP, PA flexion, and lateral and patellofemoral views. Advanced imaging with an MRI is commonly used to evaluate the extent of cartilage and meniscus pathology in the medial compartment and the integrity of these structures laterally. The constellation of these findings helps to determine the appropriate surgical treatment when nonsurgical treatment has failed to provide adequate symptomatic relief. In cases of varus deformity with a symptomatic medial compartment, HTO may be an appropriate intervention. In some cases, preoperative staging or intraoperative arthroscopy may also be used to determine the extent of medial compartment pathology and ensure the health of the lateral compartment.

### Externally validated machine learning algorithm accurately predicts medial tibial stress syndrome in military trainees: a multicohort study [^ee3a3f7e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The measurements of hip ER PROM followed the procedure by Garnock et al. The measurement of ankle PF was performed with the subject in long sitting. The goniometer stationary axis was aligned with the lateral malleolus, and the fibula and base of the fifth metatarsal served as the moving axis landmark.

Navicular drop was calculated as the difference in height of the navicular tuberosity between relaxed stance and single-leg weight-bearing. This process yields moderate intrarater reliability (ICC = 0.61–0.79)and a high inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.84).

A paper-based survey included questions about previous history of MTSS, prior orthotic use and years of running experience. The additional variables of estimated average number of runs per week and distance per run in the last 6 months were included, as they had not been investigated in previous research. The survey was completed by participants within 2 weeks of the initial physical examination (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flowchart of participants (first year Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) officer cadets). MTSS, medial tibial stress syndrome.

At 3-month follow-up, a paper-based survey captured the incidence and severity of any MTSS cases. Survey items were taken from the MTSS Score, including questions on shin pain after exercise (including marching), while walking and at rest. A physical examination by a Physiotherapist was conducted to confirm any symptoms of MTSS. This examination followed a three-step process (pain history, location of pain and shin palpation). This study was not approved for imaging investigations. As such, a systematic procedure was then followed by the Physiotherapist to minimise the risk of other lower leg injury syndromes that may masquerade as MTSS, such as stress fractures. Focal pain areas of only 2–3 cm are thought to be more typical of stress fracture, and thus the > 5 cm rule was emphasised to reduce the risk of more significant bone stress injuries being included.

### Assessing accuracy requirements in high tibial osteotomy: a theoretical, computer-based model using AP radiographs [^e1b12c65]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a recognised treatment for medial compartment knee arthritis and in recent years has regained popularity. Preoperative planning of wedge opening is based on standing AP radiographs, aiming to deliver the WBL to a desired point. Clinical results can be unpredictable, and this may be due to an inability to deliver the preoperative plan. This study explores the theoretical wedge opening accuracy required to deliver preoperative plans, based on clinical AP radiographs.

Methods

A theoretical 2-D model of osteotomy was developed to determine the degree of radiological wedge opening accuracy required to deliver the weight-bearing line to a preoperative target of 62–66% of the width of the tibial plateau.

Results

This model suggests that, to deliver the weight-bearing line to the preoperative target on plane radiographs, the theoretical medial wedge must be opened to an accuracy of ± 0.9 mm.

Conclusion

Although this study only explores a model of wedge opening based on AP radiographs, with current surgical systems, it is unlikely that the surgeon can achieve this level of accuracy within a real-life surgical setting. Surgical accuracy in HTO is known to be important for both short- and long-term clinical outcomes. This study highlights the need for improved surgical accuracy aids and/or patient stratification to mitigate the effects of surgical errors.

### Inferior heel pain in soccer players: a retrospective study with a proposal for guidelines of treatment [^12bfa1bd]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the review of the literature, data show that heel pain is one of the most frequent reasons for medical examinations among players.

The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiological difference of heel pain among soccer players and to propose specific therapeutic guidelines.

From our data, it appears that the inferior heel pain among soccer players is due to the local biomechanical stress, but there are also other causes; in the case of heel pain, from compression of the sural nerve and of abductor digiti minimi, there is an associated neurological cause.

The main nerves affected in heel pain are the posterior tibial (in tarsal tunnel syndrome), the medial calcaneal (heel neuroma), the medial plantar and the lateral plantar including the first branch to abductor digiti minimi, and the sural (including lateral calcaneal) nerves.

Nerves reported more commonly in plantar heel pain of neurological origin are the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's nerve)and the medial calcaneal nerve.

Among the possible causal factors of nerve compression, as indicated in the literature among the possible causative factors of the nervous compression that deserve differential diagnosis, obesity, venous insufficiency, trauma and lesions that occupy space (as tumours), but in soccer players is linked to a history of mechanical sciatica.

Nevertheless the major studies have focused on the plantar fasciitis and possible treatments. Many studies have been on intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors related to the development of this disease, such as body weight and body mass index (BMI), the plantar load, the biomechanical overload factors, and the exercise mode.

Referring to the 2010 clinical practice guidelines developed by the CPG Heel Pain Committee of the ACFAS, the initial patient evaluation in suspected plantar heel pain consists of a significant history of isolated plantar heel pain, weightbearing pain after periods of rest, morning pain, barefoot walking or use of inappropriate shoes. If there are associated significant findings such as pain on palpation of the inferior heel or plantar fascia, obesity/high BMI, pronated foot architecture, localised swelling or atrophy of infracalcaneal fat pad, radiographs may be helpful. The treatment options suggested by evidence-based medicine as regards plantar heel pain have been graded according to three steps (figure 8).

### Surgical versus conservative treatment for high-risk stress fractures of the lower leg (anterior tibial cortex, navicular and fifth metatarsal base): a systematic review [^03a4ec8b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare surgical and conservative treatment for high-risk stress fractures of the anterior tibial cortex, navicular and proximal fifth metatarsal.

Methods

Systematic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and PEDro were performed to identify relevant prospective and retrospective studies. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Main outcomes were return to sport and complication rate.

Results

18 studies were included (2 anterior tibia (N = 31), 8 navicular (N = 200) and 8 fifth metatarsal (N = 246)). For anterior tibial fracture, no studies on initial surgery were eligible. Conservative treatment resulted in high complication rates and few cases returned to sport. For navicular fracture, a weighted mean return to sport of 22 for conservative and 16 weeks for surgical treatment was found. Six weeks of non-weightbearing cast was mostly used as conservative treatment. Surgical procedures varied widely. For the fifth metatarsal fracture, weighted mean return to sport was 19 for conservative and 14 weeks for surgical treatment. Surgery consisted of intramedullary screw fixation or tension band wiring. For conservative methods, insufficient details were reported. Overall, there was a high risk of bias; sample sizes were small and GRADE level of evidence was low.

Conclusions

Strong conclusions for surgical or conservative therapy for these high-risk stress fractures cannot be drawn; quality of evidence is low and subjected to a high risk of bias. However, there are unsatisfying outcomes of conservative therapy in the anterior tibia. The role of initial surgery is unknown. For the navicular, surgery provided an earlier return to sport; and when treated conservatively, weightbearing should be avoided. For the fifth metatarsal, surgery provided the best results. Treatment decision-making would greatly benefit from further prospective research.

### A contemporary international expert consensus statement on the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of injuries to the posterolateral corner of the knee [^e1e93d96]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To utilize a modified Delphi technique to generate an expert consensus statement on the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of posterolateral corner(PLC) injuries of the knee.

Methods

A five-individual working-group developed a list of 62 statements regarding PLC injuries for use in a three-round modified Delphi series. Ultimately 40 statements were retained, and a 100% participation rate was observed in all rounds. Consensus for each statement was quantified.

Results

Overall, 82.5% of statements reached consensus. Consensus was reached regarding the following: (1) diagnostic utility of the dial, posterolateral drawer, and external rotation recurvatum tests, magnetic resonance imaging, varus-stress radiographs, and bilateral hip-to-ankle radiographs; (2) presence of concomitant meniscal pathology or neuromuscular injury influences surgical timing; (3) useful classification systems to guide treatment of PLC injuries currently do not exist; (4) acute soft tissue avulsions involving a single stabilizing structure can be repaired; (5) isolated repair of grade III PLC tears should not be performed without augmentation/reconstruction and complete grade III PLC injuries should undergo PLC reconstruction; (6) no universally-accepted PLC reconstruction technique exists, although the LaPrade technique (anatomic reconstruction of the FCL, PLT, and PFL using two grafts secured in two femoral tunnels, one fibular tunnel, and one tibial tunnel) may confer superior outcomes; and (7) there is no consensus on the utility of routine postoperative varus stress radiographs as an objective measure of surgical success.

Conclusion

Statements that achieved unanimous consensus(all experts stating they "strongly agree"), concerned routine use of physical and radiographic evaluations to confirm varus laxity due to PLC injuries and bilateral hip-to-ankle radiographs in the setting of chronic PLC injuries. Individualized treatment based on the presence of concomitant injuries and staged rehabilitation programs are essential. The significance of a grade III posterolateral drawer test in detecting external rotational laxity and whether a common peroneal nerve neurolysis should be routinely performed remain in question. No single reconstruction technique confers optimal clinical outcomes. Postoperative varus stress radiographs are not reliable for determining residual laxity.

### Patellofemoral pain [^8d6e5e3d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to physical therapy, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to offer exercise therapy with combined hip-targeted (targeting posterolateral hip musculature) and knee-targeted exercises (either weight-bearing exercises, such as resisted squats, or non-weight-bearing exercises, such as resisted knee extension; as both exercise techniques target the knee musculature) to reduce pain and improve patient-reported outcomes and functional performance in the short, medium, and long term. Prefer a combination of hip- and knee-targeted exercises over solely knee-targeted exercises to optimize outcomes. Consider preferring hip-targeted exercise over knee-targeted exercise in the early stages of treatment.

### Surgical parameters influence paediatric knee kinematics and cartilage stresses in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: navigating subject-specific variability using neuromusculoskeletal-finite element modelling analysis [^dbecb4e3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The regression analysis identified significant predictors of nRMSE for both the lateral and medial tibial cartilage. Graft pre‐tension emerged as a crucial factor affecting nRMSE in both regions, with higher pre‐tension associated with reduced nRMSE, indicating potentially favourable biomechanical outcomes post‐ACLR. Deviation from optimal graft positioning increased nRMSE in the lateral tibial cartilage, highlighting the importance of precise graft placement during surgery. Knee phenotype also influenced nRMSE, with larger knees exhibiting slightly higher values of nRMSE, underscoring the complexity of the relationship between surgical parameters and knee biomechanics. Although graft type and size were excluded from the regression analysis, sensitivity analysis suggests they directly and/or indirectly affect kinematics and may subsequently alter tibial cartilage stresses. This discrepancy may be attributed to factors such as multi‐collinearity and overfitting, emphasizing the limitations of regression analysis in capturing the full complexity of these relationships.

Results indicated ACLR can result in both higher and lower magnitude cartilage stresses compared to corresponding intact knees (Table 2, Figure 2) depending on the specific surgical parameters used. The surgical combination associated with the highest nRMSE was accompanied by significantly larger maximum principal stress in both the medial and lateral tibial cartilage, as compared to the combination resulting in the lowest nRMSE (across diverse knee types). Abnormal cartilage stresses (e.g. under‐ or over‐loading), when chronic (e.g. during walking which is a most common motor task), are known precursors to degeneration and eventual OA onset. Previous studies have consistently highlighted elevated risk of early onset knee OA following ACLR and presence of abnormal contact loads in ACLR knees. The propensity for ACLR to disrupt normative cartilage stresses underscores the importance of patient‐specific surgical planning and graft selection to restore normal biomechanics (motion, loading, and tissue stress) to the post‐operative knee. With respect to the onset of knee OA, some studies indicate initial cartilage damage to the medial compartment post‐ACLR, a region more frequently affected by degeneration than its lateral counterpart. Conversely, other studies propose more instances of post‐ACLR knee OA in the lateral compartment. Our study identified greater deviation in stress patterns on lateral tibial cartilage across knee sizes (Table 1). These contradictory findings from literature underscore the complexity of the relationship between ACLR and knee OA onset, suggesting the potential subject specificity in the predilection for either the medial or lateral compartment to develop OA.

The baseline characteristics of legs with and without MTSS are shown in table 2 for men and women separately. In univariable analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with the development of MTSS: female sex, history of MTSS, above-average hip exorotation ROM, use of supportive shoes and shin oedema (table 3). In multivariable regression analysis, the following variables were found to be associated with the development of MTSS: female sex, below-average age, above-average BMI and history of MTSS (table 3).

### High accuracy of component positioning and restoration of lower limb alignment using robotic medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty [^7ed5b167]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The current study did not show a significant difference between the planned and final femoral and tibial implant position, except for the posterior slope of the tibial component. The posterior tibial slope was increased by 0.7° compared to the pre‐surgery plan, and its clinical relevance is questionable. Finite Element Analysis studies showed no changes in contact stress when the posterior tibial slope is within a range of 2°. Preserving the posterior slope is crucial to avoid overstuffing the femorotibial compartment in flexion, which may restrict knee flexion. The natural posterior slope is 6.4° ± 3.6° for the medial tibial plateau and 5.6° ± 3.4° for the lateral plateau according to the analysis of 234 CT scans. The natural posterior slope of the patients was respected up to 7°. However, when the posterior slope of the tibial component exceeds 7°, no changes in contact pressure were observed in the polyethylene insert at the medial compartment, but an increase in contact pressure occurred in the lateral compartment. The increase in slope increases strain in the anterior cruciate ligament, causes a lateral shift of the patella in the trochlea during the early stage of knee flexion, increases strain in the MCL and decreases strain in the PCL. An analysis of the posterior tibial slope's effect on gait using a finite element model reported an increase in contact pressure at the medial compartment during the first peak of the ground reaction force, followed by a decrease during the second peak.

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^e7ad1e05]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first systematic review on exercise therapy for PTTD. Based on the limited available literature, it appears that local strengthening exercises provide some benefit in PTTD, and eccentric exercises may be superior for improving pain, disability and self-reported overall foot function than concentric exercises and foot orthoses and stretching alone. No recommendations can currently be made regarding optimal exercise prescription based on published clinical trials. Clinicians should be guided by presenting impairments to prescribe exercise, which holds some promise in managing PTTD.

### Patellofemoral pain [^12362482]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to orthoses and taping, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to offer prefabricated foot orthoses to reduce pain, but only in the short term (up to 6 weeks), in patients with greater than normal pronation. Combine foot orthoses, if used, with an exercise therapy program. Insufficient evidence to recommend custom foot orthoses over prefabricated foot orthoses.

### Incidence and risk factors of medial tibial stress syndrome: a prospective study in physical education teacher education students [^02d1ee00]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Review studies report that women (athletes, runners and militaries) are more likely to develop MTSS compared with men by 2.35 (95% CI 1.58 to 3.50)and 1.71 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.54)times. Our study found a relative risk of 3.14 (95% CI 1.39 to 7.11) for the female sex, which is slightly higher but in agreement with the literature. It is unknown why women are more predisposed to develop MTSS. Newman et al suggest that differences in running kinematics between men and women may be attributed to the increased risk for women.

Most review studies on the risk factors of MTSS report a significant relationship between a higher BMI and MTSS risk. Our study found an OR of 2.29 (95% CI 1.02 to 5.16) for the group with an above-average BMI, which is consistent with the literature. An explanation for this finding is that a higher body weight relative to body height causes a relatively high mechanical loading to the tibia during weight-bearing activities. When this frequently occurs during a prolonged period, the body is unable to recover appropriately, producing bony overload and adhering complications.

Our study found conflicting results with the literature regarding age as a risk factor for developing MTSS. The literature consistently reports that age is not associated with an increased risk. Our study found an OR of 0.31 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.76) for the above-average age group. Observations from practice are in line with this result. Therefore, this might be a specific risk factor in our PETE population. A rationale for this finding is that older students are more likely to sustain an acute lower extremity injury compared with younger students. Older and injured students may be less actively involved in the sports programme and therefore less susceptible to developing MTSS. However, we lack data to support this rationale.

All the other risk factors in our study did not have a significant relationship with the development of MTSS in our PETE students. These include height, weight, fat percentage, running performance, sports participation, insole use, use of supportive shoes, hip exorotation ROM, hip endorotation ROM, hip adduction and abduction strength, hip adduction-abduction strength ratio, navicular drop, squat knee angle, shin pain at palpation, and shin oedema.
