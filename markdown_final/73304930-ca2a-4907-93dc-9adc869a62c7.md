## Question

elevated mcv with elevated liver enzymes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate an elevated MCV together with elevated liver enzymes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining and quantifying the abnormalities and classifying the liver enzyme pattern. Then, I should identify shared etiologies that plausibly explain both findings. Next, I will prioritize the differential diagnosis. After that, I should lay out a systematic diagnostic evaluation with history, labs, and imaging. Then, I need to interpret clinical significance and prognosis. Finally, I will outline management principles and special contexts, making sure to verify each claim against the cited guidance and primary references as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions and patterns before jumping to causes. Macrocytosis is generally defined as MCV greater than 100 fL, and the red blood cell lifespan of about 120 days means MCV changes can lag and persist after the inciting factor resolves, so I need to remember that when timing exposure histories, especially alcohol and medications. I should classify the liver test pattern as hepatocellular when AST/ALT predominate or cholestatic when alkaline phosphatase predominates, because that will narrow etiologies, and I must also note that "normal" ALT ranges in practice may be set too high and that clinical context outweighs degree of elevation for prognostic value [^117MpALN] [^113z2Ems] [^117VSnab].

> Now, I will consider shared etiologies, starting with alcohol because it is common and mechanistically connected to both macrocytosis and liver enzyme elevation. Alcohol can directly injure erythrocytes, possibly via acetaldehyde adducts, and also deplete folate, yielding macrocytosis, while simultaneously causing alcoholic liver disease that drives hepatocellular enzyme elevations; MCV is a non-specific but supportive biomarker whose discriminatory power is modest, and population and dependence cohorts show dose-dependent MCV increases with alcohol exposure [^113VhQCo] [^111gmyw9] [^113BSm1h]. Wait, I should verify the commonly taught AST:ALT ratio threshold; the classic teaching is that an AST:ALT ratio greater than 2 suggests alcoholic liver disease, but since my provided guidelines summaries do not explicitly specify that numeric threshold, I will be more precise and say that in alcohol-related injury AST often exceeds ALT, and I should integrate that pattern with the rest of the clinical picture rather than rely on a single ratio cut-point [^117MpALN].

> Next, I should review nutritional deficiencies that frequently co-occur with liver disease and alcohol. Folate deficiency can produce a megaloblastic picture with macro-ovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils on smear, and chronic liver disease and alcohol misuse can impair folate handling, so I need to check folate and look at the smear to confirm a megaloblastic process when suspected [^111bDP7o] [^113VhQCo]. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause macrocytosis, and although B12 deficiency is less directly tied to elevated transaminases, I should still assess B12 because megaloblastic anemia is common and treatable, and overlooking it would be a mistake [^111bDP7o].

> Hold on, I should not miss systemic conditions that link both red cell indices and liver enzymes. Hypothyroidism can cause macrocytosis and mildly abnormal aminotransferases, so TSH should be in the first-line panel, and metabolic syndrome with NAFLD is a leading cause of mild transaminitis; there are epidemiologic data associating higher MCV with metabolic syndrome components, though mechanisms are not fully established, so I should assess waist circumference, glucose, lipids, and insulin resistance in parallel [^112yo3Df]. But wait, smoking is an independent driver of higher MCV and can confound the attribution to alcohol or nutrition, so I should specifically ask about tobacco exposure and consider cotinine-confirmed studies showing this association [^11185Ssu].

> I need to check for medication-induced liver injury, keeping in mind that macrocytosis typically requires either a megaloblastic process or marrow effect independent of hepatotoxicity. Agents like lomitapide are well known to raise transaminases and hepatic fat, albendazole can cause transaminase elevations and rarely severe hepatitis, and clarithromycin has been associated with small increases in liver enzymes; newer agents such as veozah and vafseo require structured LFT monitoring, so a careful drug history with start dates and dose changes is essential to align temporal relationships [^111Go5PB] [^114z5zPT] [^1126SyZM] [^113MwrjF] [^113Qy5ar] [^115WRUmV].

> Let me now synthesize a prioritized differential diagnosis without premature closure. The leading consideration is alcohol use disorder with alcohol-related liver disease given the dual effect on MCV and transaminases; next, NAFLD or NASH combined with folate deficiency is common in metabolic syndrome; hypothyroidism with liver involvement is also plausible; medication-induced hepatocellular injury with a separate cause of macrocytosis is possible; and if macrocytosis remains unexplained after addressing reversible causes, I should consider primary marrow disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes or a reticulocytosis-driven macrocytosis from hemolysis, integrating the reticulocyte count and smear to sort these pathways [^112yo3Df] [^111bDP7o].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, starting with history and exam, because missing the basics would undermine the rest of the workup. I should quantify alcohol exposure using a structured tool such as AUDIT-C, review all prescribed and over-the-counter drugs and supplements, assess diet quality and weight change for nutritional deficiency risk, elicit family history of liver and hematologic disease, and look for stigmata of chronic liver disease and thyroid findings; risk stratification for harmful drinkers should include non-invasive fibrosis assessment where available [^117J7mYC] [^112yo3Df] [^113z2Ems].

> Next, I should review targeted laboratory testing to separate megaloblastic from non-megaloblastic macrocytosis and to phenotype liver injury. A CBC with reticulocyte count and peripheral smear helps distinguish macro-ovalocytes with hypersegmented neutrophils from non-megaloblastic patterns, and I should measure vitamin B12, RBC folate, and TSH; simultaneously, I need a full liver panel including AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, and PT/INR, plus hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody, and iron studies for hemochromatosis when appropriate; calculating non-invasive fibrosis scores or arranging transient elastography is advisable when abnormalities persist beyond several months; noting whether AST exceeds ALT can support an alcohol-related pattern but should not be used in isolation [^111bDP7o] [^113z2Ems] [^112yo3Df] [^117MpALN]. I should double-check tobacco exposure because smoking can independently raise MCV and mislead attribution if unrecognized [^11185Ssu].

> Let me consider imaging and referral thresholds so I do not delay escalation when indicated. Abdominal ultrasound is warranted for persistent enzyme elevation beyond about six months, abnormal fibrosis assessment, or clinical suspicion of cirrhosis, and referral to hepatology is appropriate for persistently elevated aminotransferases, elastography suggesting advanced fibrosis, features of portal hypertension, or unexplained macrocytosis despite correction of reversible causes [^113z2Ems] [^117J7mYC]. Hold on, I should verify the elastography cut point; values above roughly 16 kPa are commonly used to flag advanced disease in harmful drinkers for referral pathways in guideline frameworks, so I will incorporate that prudently with clinical findings rather than as a standalone rule [^117J7mYC].

> I need to interpret prognostic meaning carefully because the height of aminotransferases can be misleading without context. The guidelines emphasize that degree of liver test abnormality does not determine prognosis and that diagnosis and clinical setting are paramount, so a mildly elevated ALT in NAFLD may carry long-term risk, whereas dramatic spikes can occur in self-limited processes; similarly, prior "normal" reference ranges for ALT may be too high, potentially masking pathology in metabolic liver disease [^113z2Ems] [^117VSnab]. For macrocytosis, very high MCV values often point to megaloblastic anemia, whereas alcohol-related macrocytosis is typically more modest, so I should integrate MCV magnitude with smear and vitamin assays before concluding etiology [^111bDP7o] [^113VhQCo].

> Let me think about clinical contexts to avoid anchoring. In patients with clear alcohol misuse, persistent macrocytosis can reflect heavy intake over preceding months due to red cell lifespan, and liver enzymes may follow an alcoholic hepatocellular pattern; in those with metabolic syndrome, macrocytosis may relate to poor diet and folate insufficiency while transaminases reflect NAFLD; in older adults, I must consider hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency, and polypharmacy as contributors, alongside routine viral and iron studies per primary care algorithms [^111gmyw9] [^112yo3Df] [^111bDP7o].

> I should now outline management principles, making sure to link intervention to cause. Alcohol cessation is the highest-yield step when relevant and is often accompanied by gradual normalization of transaminases and correction of macrocytosis over months; folate and B12 repletion is indicated for deficiencies, while NAFLD management hinges on weight loss and metabolic control; potentially hepatotoxic medications should be discontinued or substituted when feasible; and I should plan to repeat CBC and liver enzymes after approximately three months of intervention to document trajectory and decide on further fibrosis assessment or biopsy if abnormalities persist without explanation [^112yo3Df] [^113z2Ems] [^116HcWAh] [^111bDP7o]. If macrocytosis persists despite addressing alcohol and vitamin deficiencies, I need to consider marrow evaluation for myelodysplasia in collaboration with hematology to avoid delayed diagnosis [^111bDP7o].

> But wait, what about special populations and mimics that can distract the evaluation. Elevated liver enzymes are common in hospitalized COVID-19 and can be mild and cholestatic or hepatocellular, yet macrocytosis would usually be unrelated, so context and timing of infection matter; in pregnancy, HELLP and other obstetric conditions produce liver enzyme elevations with hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, more often with microcytosis from iron deficiency rather than macrocytosis; and in Turner syndrome, fluctuations in liver enzymes are common and warrant reassessment and referral if persistent or more than twice the upper limit of normal [^112NwVNx] [^113ttgJN] [^114eyJeX] [^115i7bvN] [^11499cio] [^111M3tfK].

> Let me recap the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency before finalizing. The co-occurrence of macrocytosis and elevated liver enzymes most strongly suggests alcohol use disorder but remains non-specific and must be verified with history, biomarkers, and pattern recognition; NAFLD with nutritional deficiency and hypothyroidism are important alternatives; extent of enzyme elevation does not dictate prognosis, so diagnosis and fibrosis staging guide urgency; and the peripheral smear plus B12 and folate testing are pivotal to distinguish megaloblastic from other causes of macrocytosis, with targeted lifestyle and etiologic treatment followed by reassessment to confirm resolution or trigger hematology/hepatology referrals as needed [^113VhQCo] [^112yo3Df] [^113z2Ems] [^111bDP7o] [^117VSnab].

Elevated MCV with elevated liver enzymes most often reflects **alcohol use** or **liver disease** (ALD, NAFLD/NASH) [^112yo3Df] but may also indicate vitamin B12/folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, or medication effects [^111bDP7o]. Alcohol-related macrocytosis is **dose-dependent** [^113VhQCo] and commonly coexists with GGT/AST elevations [^117MpALN], while NAFLD/NASH is linked to metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance [^112yo3Df] [^116vL4kT]. Evaluate with a CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, B12/folate, TSH, liver panel, hepatitis serologies, and iron studies [^111bDP7o] [^117MpALN]; consider imaging [^113z2Ems] and, if needed, liver biopsy [^116HcWAh]. For **management**, address the cause — alcohol cessation [^117J7mYC], nutritional repletion [^111bDP7o], metabolic risk control [^112yo3Df], and stopping hepatotoxic drugs [^111Go5PB] — and refer to a specialist for persistent or severe abnormalities [^113z2Ems].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms underlie concurrent **elevations in MCV and liver enzymes**:

- **Alcohol consumption**: Alcohol has direct hematotoxic effects, causing macrocytosis through interference with erythrocyte stability and structure. Acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol, accumulates in erythrocytes, leading to cell damage and immune-mediated responses. Alcohol also induces liver injury, reflected by elevated liver enzymes [^113VhQCo].

- **Liver disease**: Chronic liver diseases, such as alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cirrhosis [^117MpALN], are associated with macrocytosis due to altered lipid metabolism, impaired erythropoiesis, and nutritional deficiencies (e.g. vitamin B12, folate) [^111bDP7o].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies cause megaloblastic anemia, characterized by macrocytosis and elevated liver enzymes due to impaired DNA synthesis and hepatocellular injury.

- **Medications and toxins**: Certain medications (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, antiretrovirals) [^111bDP7o] and toxins can cause macrocytosis and hepatotoxicity, leading to elevated liver enzymes [^111Go5PB].

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic **diagnostic approach** is essential to determine the underlying cause:

- **Clinical history and examination**: Assess alcohol intake, medication use, dietary habits, and symptoms of liver disease or anemia [^117MpALN].

- **Laboratory tests**: Perform complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, vitamin B12 and folate levels, liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin) [^117MpALN], hepatitis serologies, and iron studies [^113z2Ems].

- **Imaging studies**: Abdominal ultrasound or MRI to evaluate liver structure, steatosis, or cirrhosis [^113z2Ems].

- **Liver biopsy**: Consider in cases of unexplained persistent elevations or suspected advanced liver disease [^116HcWAh].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Concurrent elevation of MCV and liver enzymes **indicates significant underlying pathology**, often due to chronic liver disease, alcohol misuse, or nutritional deficiencies. Prognosis depends on the cause, severity of liver injury, and response to treatment. Persistent elevations increase the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, necessitating prompt evaluation and management.

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **addressing the underlying cause**:

- **Alcohol cessation**: Essential in alcohol-related liver disease [^117J7mYC].

- **Nutritional supplementation**: Vitamin B12 and folate replacement in deficiencies [^111bDP7o].

- **Medication adjustment**: Discontinuation or dose adjustment of hepatotoxic drugs [^111Go5PB].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, and exercise in NAFLD [^117MpALN].

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and hematological parameters [^113z2Ems].

---

- **Elevated MCV with elevated liver enzymes** signals underlying pathology — such as alcohol misuse, liver disease, nutritional deficiencies, or medication effects — and warrants a systematic diagnostic approach with targeted management to improve outcomes.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^113VhQCo]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

The molecular basis for the increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) that occurs with alcohol misuse is incompletely understood. A study involving 105 alcohol-dependent individuals, 62 moderate drinkers, and 24 abstainers demonstrated that the increase in MCV was dose-dependent. Alcohol may have direct haematotoxic effects by interfering with cell structure and erythrocyte stability. Interestingly, the levels of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol, show a significant increase inside erythrocytes of alcohol-dependent individuals. Since acetaldehyde is a toxic metabolite and can bind to proteins, this may lead to erythrocyte damage directly or through an immune-mediated mechanism via the development of anti-acetaldehyde adduct antibodies. Folate deficiency also occurs with alcohol misuse, particularly in patients with liver disease, and may be implicated in increasing MCV.

It is important to note, however, that MCV is a non-specific biomarker. Other factors such as age, smoking, malnutrition, and underlying diseases, including hypothyroidism, liver disease, and pernicious anaemia, are also known to affect MCV. There is also a genetic contribution to MCV, in addition to the genetic factors identified for other haematological indices. Genetic factors have been implicated in high alcohol consumption — our recent study showed genome-wide significant effects across six loci following meta-analysis in two large independent cohorts. The relationship between the genetic loci that determine MCV and those associated with excess alcohol drinking, however, remains unclear.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis.

When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Other possible etiologies include hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders), which are some of the more common causes.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: Causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver diseases.

The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels.

The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e. waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 1**: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months [level 2b, grade B].

- **Research recommendation 1**: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended [level 5, grade D].

- **Recommendation 2**: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted following a review of the previous results, past medical history, and medical condition [level 5, grade D].

- **Recommendation 3**: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context [level 5, grade D].

- **Recommendation 4**: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of the level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range [level 2b, grade B].

- **Recommendation 5**: In adults, a standard liver aetiology screen should include an abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and serum immunoglobulins.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests, such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations.

The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Abnormal liver tests in COVID-19: A retrospective observational cohort study of 1,827 patients in a major U.S. hospital network [^112NwVNx]. Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality attributable to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Liver injury has been reported as a nonpulmonary manifestation of COVID-19, but characterization of liver test abnormalities and their association with clinical outcomes is incomplete.

- **Approach and results**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,827 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the Yale-New Haven Health System between March 14, 2020, and April 23, 2020. Clinical characteristics, liver tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total bilirubin [TBIL], and albumin) at three time points (preinfection baseline, admission, and peak hospitalization), and hospitalization outcomes (severe COVID-19, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, and death) were analyzed. Abnormal liver tests were commonly observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, both at admission (AST 66.9%, ALT 41.6%, ALP 13.5%, and TBIL 4.3%) and peak hospitalization (AST 83.4%, ALT 61.6%, ALP 22.7%, and TBIL 16.1%). Most patients with abnormal liver tests at admission had minimal elevations 1–2× the upper limit of normal (ULN; AST 63.7%, ALT 63.5%, ALP 80.0%, and TBIL 75.7%). A significant proportion of these patients had abnormal liver tests prehospitalization (AST 25.9%, ALT 38.0%, ALP 56.8%, and TBIL 44.4%).

### The association of higher levels of within-normal-limits liver enzymes and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome [^1112hUfL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

The notion that persistently elevated liver enzyme concentrations, even within the so-called "reference" range, is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and future disease has been previously demonstrated. In fact, it has been shown that several liver enzymes, in particular GGT, are associated with the appearance of cardiovascular events. This is also relevant to individuals with Metabolic Syndrome. Thus, recognizing that the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome increases even in individuals whose liver enzymes are in the lower part of the 'normal' reference range might have clinical significance in terms of early recognition of these dysmetabolic changes.

We recognize several limitations in the analysis. First, our conclusions are of a descriptive nature and are based essentially only on associations between parameters. Based on its cross-sectional design, the present findings are inherently limited in the ability to infer causal relationships. Second, since some of the study population had several risk factors, we could not fully eliminate the possible effect of underlying diseases and medications used for these diseases on the present findings. Further prospective population-based studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms to answer these questions. Finally, serum GGT is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and/or liver dysfunction, such as fatty liver, and is also high in patients with liver diseases: chronic viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or drug-induced liver injury. These liver diseases are present in community-dwelling persons and require additional consideration in the context of the study's findings.

### High mean corpuscular volume predicts poor outcome for patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma [^112ZYD3F]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

High MCV plasma levels were significantly correlated with diminished OS and DFS, defining the preoperative MCV plasma level as an independent prognostic factor for patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction. Besides MCV, the prognostic role of MCH, MCHC, RDW, and Hb levels was evaluated, but only MCH, MCHC, and RDW could be shown as independent prognostic factors for OS and DFS.

Anemia is common among cancer patients, and the prognostic role of hematologic parameters has been reported for a number of malignancies, including ESCC. However, at the time of writing, no data exist on the correlation between MCV and the survival of patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction. Because MCV is an indicator for the red blood cell volume, it often is used for detection of megaloblastic- or iron-deficiency anemia. Macrocytosis often is related to liver and blood disease, alcohol consumption, smoking, and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.

In contrast to ESCC, no correlation exists between alcohol consumption and the development of AEG. Therefore, other reasons for elevated MCV must exist in patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction. A potential explanation might be the location of the tumor at the gastroesophageal junction. Malignant tumors located near the cardia of the stomach, developing from chronic atrophic gastritis, could result in an impaired function of the parietal cells and therefore could lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia.

### Unilateral leg swelling and liver enzyme elevation in an adolescent [^116mLSjL]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 15-year-old female developed sudden onset right lower extremity swelling, pain, and erythematous linear streaking from the ankle to mid-thigh. Duplex venous ultrasound revealed multiple superficial and deep venous thrombi in the right lower extremity. Incidentally, the patient was also noted to have elevated transaminases and a microcytic anemia with significant iron deficiency. Additional evaluation ultimately led to the diagnosis of two distinct but interconnected chronic conditions, one of which progressed to requiring liver transplantation.

### Green neutrophilic inclusions in liver disease [^1167Qupv]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute hepatic failure is traditionally diagnosed based on clinical presentation, historical information, and a collection of abnormal laboratory findings, including elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, serum bilirubin, and alpha-fetoprotein. Non-specific hematological findings such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and changes in erythrocyte morphology are well documented in patients with liver failure. However, it is believed that there are no specific morphological findings on peripheral blood smears directly linked to liver failure.

This report describes two patients diagnosed with acute hepatic failure, both having coarse, bright-green cytoplasmic inclusions identified within their neutrophils. One previous case of a patient with similar neutrophil findings and concomitant liver disease has been reported in the literature; however, a direct relationship to liver failure was not proposed. It is suggested that the findings may be directly related to liver failure and may also serve as a prognostic indicator of impending death.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason, this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs, as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice.

Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation, convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is emerging literature suggesting that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises both the unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated by comparing two patients: one receiving statin therapy with an ALT level of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment, and another with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L, whose life expectancy may be weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs. However, it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which abnormal liver bloods may not necessarily be of clinical concern is pregnancy, where alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin levels are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, warranting prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after reviewing previous results, past medical history, and medical condition.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, and serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST). Testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration are also considered.

Observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices were used as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests.

Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Hypersplenism [^112yqVXD]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cytopenias in liver disease are a common finding and have historically been attributed to pooling and/or destruction of blood cells in the enlarged spleen, leading to the term "hypersplenism". With recent advances in the understanding of the physiology of blood formation, particularly with the discovery of several hematopoietic growth factors, new insights into the pathophysiology of blood cell derangements in liver disease have been obtained. Recombinant hematopoietic growth factors present new opportunities for the support of the hematopoietic system, which is required because of toxic antiviral therapies or surgical interventions in these patients.

### Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes [^113ttgJN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 is now a critical threat to global public health. Although the majority of patients present with respiratory illness, several studies have described multiorgan involvement. This study evaluated the prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in COVID-19 patients on admission and their association with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center retrospective analysis of all inpatients with COVID-19. Demographic and clinical factors, and liver enzyme tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were noted on admission. The association of liver enzyme elevation with outcomes such as inpatient death, need for intubation, and vasopressor use was determined using the chi-square test and multivariate regression analysis.

- **Results**: Among 200 patients, AST and ALT elevation was seen in 55% and 20%, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase elevation was seen in 28%. AST elevation was associated with inpatient death (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.05; P = 0.035), need for vasopressors (OR 1.034, 95% CI 1.015–1.055; P = 0.001), and intubation (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05; P = 0.002). An AST/ALT ratio of 2 or more was seen in 34% of patients and was associated with need for intubation (OR 2.678, 95% CI 1.202–5.963; P = 0.016), and need for vasopressors (OR 3.352, 95% CI 1.495–7.514; P = 0.003).

- **Conclusion**: Serum aminotransferase levels are useful markers of hepatocellular injury. Patients with elevated AST or AST/ALT ratio are at higher risk of severe disease, as evidenced by intubation, vasopressor use, and inpatient outcomes.

### Budd-Chiari syndrome: a rare and life-threatening complication of Crohn's disease [^112HjKWm]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Laboratory studies determined that he had iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin 5.7 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 57 fL, undetectable serum iron and ferritin of 9 mg/dL) from chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. His bilirubin levels were normal (total: 0.8 mg/dL and unconjugated: 0.4 mg/dL), as were his creatinine levels (0.6 mg/dL). However, his prothrombin time was increased (16.6 s), he had hypoalbuminaemia (2.2 g/dL), and elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase: 138 U/L; alanine transaminase: 83 U/L; aspartate transaminase: 81 U/L).

Stool examination revealed positive faecal leucocytes but was otherwise negative for faecal culture for enteric pathogens, including Clostridium difficile toxin, Giardia antigen, Cryptosporidium antigen, and other ova and parasites. The elevation of his liver enzymes remained unexplained, as he had no history of alcohol abuse, and serological studies for hepatotropic viruses were negative. Laboratory studies performed to evaluate for Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cholangitis were also negative.

Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with moderate ascites. Ascitic fluid was sampled, which showed findings consistent with portal hypertension. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed to further evaluate his bleeding and history of IBD. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed erythema in the antrum of the stomach and multiple superficial duodenal ulcers (figure 1). Biopsies from the upper and lower GI tract showed gastroduode.

### Iron overload may be critical for liver dysfunction in anorexia nervosa, and the role of haematocrit-adjusted albumin in assessing nutritional status: a case report [^1134oFeX]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is often associated with liver dysfunction. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are found in 30% of the restricting type and 7.3% of the binge eating type. Elevations can occur during malnutrition and reportedly occur in one-third of patients with AN during refeeding. Some reports attribute the elevations to hepatocyte autophagy and fat deposition, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. We present a patient with AN exhibiting elevated liver enzymes, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Her ALT and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels decreased with nutritional improvement, in association with TSAT and ferritin reduction.

Studies suggest that repeated blood transfusions may cause an iron overload (IOL), increasing labile non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), followed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in heart and liver damage. We hypothesized that malnutrition-induced low transferrin levels in AN might cause IOL and hepatic injury. This study investigated the relationship between liver enzymes and nutritional indices or iron metabolism markers in a patient with restricting-type AN.

Blood albumin (Alb) and pre-albumin are known nutritional markers; however, a recent systematic review has suggested that they may not reflect nutritional status in malnourished patients without inflammatory diseases. Since restricting-type AN is often complicated by dehydration, we hypothesized that we could use these markers if we could eliminate the effects of dehydration.

### Hemgenix [^113cHHhU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Five subjects experienced AST elevations greater than 2–3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with a range of 71 IU/L to 118 IU/L. Additionally, three subjects had AST elevations greater than 3–5 times ULN, with values ranging from 127 IU/L to 163 IU/L. One subject had an AST elevation exceeding 5 times ULN, reaching 327 IU/L, which occurred 11 months after the administration of HEMGENIX.

Seventeen subjects exhibited ALT level elevations within the first four months following HEMGENIX infusion, with levels ranging between 41 IU/L and 275 IU/L. Eleven of these subjects' ALT levels resolved within four months post-infusion, with ranges from 41 IU/L to 275 IU/L. However, five subjects did not achieve normalization of ALT levels by the last follow-up, with values ranging from 48 IU/L to 110 IU/L at the two-year follow-up. An additional seven subjects experienced ALT elevations with onset occurring between months 6 to 24, with levels ranging from 42 IU/L to 193 IU/L. Among these, five subjects had additional risk factors such as Hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) contributing to elevated transaminase levels. In three subjects, ALT levels did not normalize by the last follow-up, with values ranging from 59 IU/L to 193 IU/L.

### Pulmonary hypertension with warm hands [^112cfRYX]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

Routine blood chemistry revealed a haemoglobin level of 16.0 g/dL, haematocrit at 57%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 72, and a reticulocyte index of 18%, coupled with a serum iron of 6.1 μmol/L and a ferritin level of 7 μg/L, indicative of anaemia secondary to severe iron deficiency, likely due to hypermenorrhoea. The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated to 196 pg/mL. Thrombocytes, white blood cells, kidney function, liver enzymes, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within reference values.

No abnormalities were noted on the chest radiograph; however, a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild right ventricular (RV) dilatation and dysfunction, with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 23 mm, an estimated RV systolic pressure of 57 mm Hg, and right atrial pressure of 5 mm Hg. Of note, there was no evidence of paradoxical septal motion. Cardiac magnetic imaging (CMR) confirmed mild RV dysfunction with an RV ejection fraction of 47%. The RV appeared mildly dilated and hypertrophic, with no signs of valvular abnormalities or intracardiac shunts, pointing to a pulmonary cause for her RV dysfunction.

Spirometry showed a total lung capacity of 3.97 L (4.84 L; 82%), a residual volume of 1.08 L (1.31 L; 82%), FVC of 2.65 L (3.59 L; 74%), and FEV1 of 1.75 L (3.13 L; 56%). The carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) was 97.64 μmol/s/kPa (60%), and the 6-minute walking distance was 370 m with no drop in SpO2, leading to a suspicion of pulmonary hypertension (PH).

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays are crucial for understanding congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I. A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) level ranging from 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 100–120, and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases exhibit a normal MCV. There are reports of transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected. The hallmark of CDA-I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis.

Ineffective erythropoiesis was initially demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, which calculate the fraction of ⁵⁹Fe present in peripheral red blood cells two weeks post-intravenous infusion. In cases of effective erythropoiesis, such as anaemia due to bleeding, iron deficiency, or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing ⁵⁹Fe is approximately 75–80%. However, in ineffective erythropoiesis, it can be as low as 25–30%. Recently, a new clinical index called the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI) has been developed to differentiate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. It is defined as: (absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb). This index has shown a high sensitivity (90.4%) for achieving a clinical diagnosis of CDA-II and is likely to be useful in CDA-I, though it has yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as depicted in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, and irregular shapes.

### Elevated concentrations of liver enzymes and ferritin identify a new phenotype of insulin resistance: Effect of weight loss after gastric banding [^1149i42e]. Obesity Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Several studies have associated elevated liver enzymes (LFTs) with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and a link has been established between insulin resistance (IR) and elevated ferritin concentrations. We examined the relationship between LFTs, ferritin, and IR in morbidly obese subjects and the effect of weight loss after bariatric surgery.

- **Methods**: We measured liver enzymes, ferritin, insulin resistance, and glucose tolerance (by OGTT) in 159 morbidly obese subjects (BMI = 44.4 ± 0.4 kg/m²) at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year after laparoscopic-adjustable-gastric banding (LAGB). Subjects were divided into two groups: increased LFTs (ALT > 30; AST/ALT < 1) versus normal LFTs.

- **Results**: A large proportion of morbidly obese subjects had increased LFTs (44%), which were associated with increased IR and ferritin, suggesting potential liver disease. A majority of the morbidly obese with increased LFTs, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and T2DM were male and had almost double ferritin concentrations, which were strongly correlated with ALT (r = 0.43, p < 0.0001). Both ferritin and ALT correlated with waist circumference and IR. One year after LAGB, glucose tolerance improved, LFTs and IR were reduced; ferritin did not change significantly, but was still correlated with IR.

- **Conclusions**: Ferritin may be an additional useful marker for more severe hepatic IR.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^111scnKz]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 5190/μL without abnormal fractionation. His haemoglobin (Hb) was 7.8 g/dL (normal range 13.5–17.6 g/dL), and the mean corpuscular volume was 107.4 fl (normal range 83–93 fl), reflecting macrocytic anaemia. The platelet count was 11.7×10⁴/μL (normal range 13.1×10⁴–36.2×10⁴/μL), reflecting mild thrombocytopaenia. Aspartate aminotransferase was 477 IU/L (normal range 7–97 IU/L), and alanine aminotransferase was 155 IU/L (normal range 6–43 IU/L), indicating liver dysfunction. Blood urea nitrogen was 26.7 mg/dL (normal range 10–20 mg/dL), and creatinine was 2.41 mg/dL (normal range 0.6–1.0 mg/dL), indicating kidney dysfunction. The blood glucose level was normal at 137 mg/dL. The ammonia level increased to 166 μg/dL (normal range 30–80 μg/dL). Serum ferritin significantly increased to 9506 ng/mL (normal range 39.4–340 ng/mL), and C-reactive protein was 5.89 mg/dL (normal range 0.0–0.3 mg/dL). However, urinary white blood cells and bacterial urine were negative, excluding pyelonephritis. Additionally, ascites had no bacteria, and the white blood cell count in ascites was 32/μL, thus excluding spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The following data are reference values post-vitamin ingestion at the emergency department: serum vitamin B1 was 91 ng/mL (normal range 24–66 ng/mL), and serum vitamin B12 was > 1500 pg/mL (normal range 180–914 pg/mL). Prothrombin time (PT) was 16.5 s (normal range 11–14 s), and PT% was 51.9% (normal range 80–120%). Head CT revealed no abnormality; however, abdominal CT showed…

### Albenza [^1126SyZM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

In clinical trials, treatment with Albenza has been associated with mild to moderate elevations of hepatic enzymes in approximately 16% of patients. These elevations have generally returned to normal upon discontinuation of therapy. There have also been case reports of acute liver failure of uncertain causality and hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Monitor liver enzymes (transaminases) before the start of each treatment cycle and at least every two weeks during treatment. If hepatic enzymes exceed twice the upper limit of normal, consideration should be given to discontinuing Albenza therapy based on individual patient circumstances. Restarting Albenza treatment in patients whose hepatic enzymes have normalized off treatment is an individual decision that should take into account the risk/benefit of further Albenza usage. Perform laboratory tests frequently if Albenza treatment is restarted.

Patients with elevated liver enzyme test results are at increased risk for hepatotoxicity and bone marrow suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinue therapy if liver enzymes are significantly increased or if clinically significant decreases in blood cell counts occur.

Patient evaluation is imperative as undiagnosed neurocysticercosis may be uncovered in patients treated with Albenza for other conditions. Patients with epidemiologic factors who are at risk for neurocysticercosis should be evaluated prior to initiation of therapy.

### Validity of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%CDT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) and mean corpuscular erythrocyte volume (MCV) as biomarkers for chronic alcohol abuse: a study in patients with alcohol dependence and liver disorders of non-alcoholic and alcoholic origin [^112y1t8s]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

To test the clinical performance of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%CDT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT), and mean corpuscular erythrocyte volume (MCV) as biomarkers for alcoholism with a special focus on patients suffering from liver diseases.

- **Design**:
	- Well-characterized collectives of alcohol-dependent patients with consumption (ALC patients, n = 101) and relevant control groups (115 social drinkers, 46 patients with unspecifically increased gamma-GT, 51 hepatitis patients, and 20/31 patients with non-alcohol/alcohol-dependent liver cirrhosis) were included in the study. The positive Alcohol Use Disorders Test (AUDIT) score, International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10)/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) criteria, and blood drawn within 4 days of last drinking were inclusion criteria for subjects with regular heavy drinking. %CDT was determined using an automated assay that had recently been completely modified.

- **Findings**:
	- Median AUDIT scores of patients without/with regular heavy drinking were 1–3/27. The following medians/95th percentiles were obtained for %CDT: social drinkers 2.2/3.0, patients with unspecifically increased gamma-GT 2.1/3.0, hepatitis 2.0/4.4, non-alcohol-dependent liver cirrhosis 2.4/4.8, alcohol-dependent liver cirrhosis 3.0/5.9, ALC patients 3.9/14.9. Differences between patients without and with alcohol abuse were highly significant (P < 0.001). No differences in CDT values were found between males and females. There was no correlation between %CDT values, gamma-GT, MCV, and the amount of alcohol consumption.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels, while cholestatic injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels.

The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males and 19 to 25 IU/l for females; levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation.

- **Evaluation of hepatocellular injury**: Testing includes viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Additionally, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought.

- **Evaluation of alkaline phosphatase elevation**: For elevations determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be conducted.

### Juxtapid [^111Go5PB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Juxtapid carries a warning for the risk of hepatotoxicity. It can cause elevations in transaminases. In the Juxtapid clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients treated experienced at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at or above 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Juxtapid also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 and 78 weeks of treatment, rising from 1% at baseline as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hepatic steatosis associated with Juxtapid treatment may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment, and then measure ALT and AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, adjust the dose of Juxtapid if ALT or AST levels are at or above 3× ULN. Discontinue Juxtapid for clinically significant liver toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Hemgenix [^1144G66t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Nineteen subjects had elevations in AST levels within three months after Hemgenix infusion (range = 32 IU/L - 163 IU/L). Nine of these subjects' AST elevations resolved within four months post-infusion (range = 35 IU/L – 163 IU/L), three resolved within 7 to 13 months post-infusion (range = 35 IU/L – 62 IU/L), and seven of these subjects' AST levels never normalized as of the last follow-up (range of values at 2-year follow-up = 36 IU/L – 327 IU/L). The remaining five subjects with AST elevation had onset between six months and two years post-infusion (range = 36 IU/L – 127 IU/L), and AST levels had not normalized as of the last follow-up for one subject (AST at 2-year follow-up = 127 IU/L) who had additional risk factors for having elevated transaminase levels.

Nine subjects with ALT elevations received a tapered course of corticosteroids. The mean duration of corticosteroid treatment for the elevated ALT was 81.4 days. Nineteen of the 24 subjects with ALT elevations also had related AST elevation. Twenty-one subjects had elevated transaminase levels and were not treated with corticosteroids [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Iron overload may be critical for liver dysfunction in anorexia nervosa, and the role of haematocrit-adjusted albumin in assessing nutritional status: a case report [^113vBvGM]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is frequently associated with liver dysfunction, but the precise mechanism remains undefined. Since the nutritional marker albumin has a low correlation with changes in body weight in AN, and patients with AN often have dehydration as a complication, we also examined whether haematocrit (HCT)-adjusted serum albumin could be a better nutritional marker in AN.

- **Case presentation**: We describe a 15-year-old girl with severe weight loss and liver damage whose liver enzymes normalized after 1.5 months of hospitalization and weight gain. We found a significant correlation between body weight (BW) and HCT-adjusted serum albumin (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rₛ = 0.66, P = 5.28 × 10⁻³) and between BW and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (rₛ = −0.825, P = 8.45 × 10⁻⁵).

	- After division by HCT, correlations between serum albumin and ALT (rₛ = −0.835, P = 5.24 × 10⁻⁵) and between the iron-storage protein ferritin and the liver enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (rₛ = 1.0, P = 0.017) were also statistically significant.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that improvement of the nutritional status in AN could relieve liver dysfunction and facilitate iron transport. Since a decrease in the iron-transport protein transferrin presumably increases labile non-transferrin-bound iron, resulting in excess reactive oxygen species production, a defect in iron transport due to malnutrition could be one of the causes of liver injury in AN. In addition, HCT-adjusted albumin could be a better marker than its raw data to assess changes in nutritional status in AN.

### Spontaneous hepatic rupture caused by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome [^115i7bvN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The causes of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome or hepatic hemorrhage as a serious complication of HELLP are not known. Although spontaneous hepatic rupture associated with HELLP syndrome is a rare complication of pregnancy, hepatic rupture results in life-threatening complications. The cornerstone of prognosis is early diagnosis. Hepatic rupture in HELLP syndrome should be considered a differential diagnosis in pregnant patients with sudden onset of abdominal pain or hypotension. We report a case of a 30-year-old primigravida female with spontaneous hepatic rupture caused by HELLP syndrome, presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^113BSm1h]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 139,921 individuals were excluded from the UKB cohort: 1,502 declined to provide information on their drinking status, 1,984 were drinking at levels at least 4 SDs above sex-specific means, 7,060 had liver disease, 23,385 had missing MCV data, 104,788 failed GWAS quality control (including ethnic inclusion), and 1,202 had missing covariate information. This study included 362,595 participants, of whom 194,706 (53.7%) were females and the average age was 56.9 (SD = 7.9) years. There were 82,235 (24.6%) zero, 146,436 (40.1%) light, 114,946 (30.2%) moderate and 18,978 (5.0%) heavy drinkers, with the median units per week being 6.0 [interquartile range (IQR) = 13.0] in females and 15.6 (IQR = 23.9) in males. There was evidence of hypothyroidism and vitamin B12 deficiency in 14,781 and 777 participants, respectively.

- **Alcohol consumption and MCV**: Alcohol consumption was associated with higher MCV (P < 1.0 × 10⁻³²⁰). Increasing alcohol consumption by 5 units (40 g) per week resulted in a 0.3% increase in MCV. Variation by drinking status was evident; compared with light drinkers (reference group), zero drinkers had 0.9% lower mean values, while moderate and heavy drinkers had 1.1% and 2.8% higher mean values, respectively (all P < 1.0 × 10⁻³²⁰) [Table 1]. Results from multivariate analysis for MCV were consistent in terms of direction and magnitude when those classified as teetotal were removed (Supplementary Material Table S1).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are increasingly checked in both primary and secondary care. This increased usage aims to exclude liver disease, monitor potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver, such as statins, and investigate generally unwell patients. These tests often yield abnormal results, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases, they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and the likelihood of liver disease. Additionally, blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons, such as chronic disease monitoring.

This scenario commonly leads to a cycle of repeated liver blood testing in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Notably, most patients referred to hospitals with abnormal liver tests do not present evidence of significant liver disease. For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130,849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016 from 82 general practices. Of these, 38,636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range.

The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland demonstrated that over a 10-year period, 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third showing at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was notably high.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117J7mYC]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

- **Recommendation 9**: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or a Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa, if available.

Patients flagged up with the AUDIT-C but drinking 100 U/L) then consideration should be given to an assessment of liver fibrosis, as for the higher-risk group.

- **Research recommendation 2**: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^111gmyw9]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Stratification of participants by drinking status did not identify any loci that determined the effect of alcohol intake on mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This suggests that the pathways through which alcohol influences MCV are not mediated by genetic variation. This was supported by the causal inference for alcohol on MCV levels when using rs1229984 as a proxy for alcohol consumption in the Mendelian randomization analysis. However, the discriminatory power of MCV in identifying heavy alcohol use is modest, given that alcohol accounts for only about 65% of MCV values above 100 fL. Additionally, the turnover of erythrocytes is around 120 days, meaning that recently abstinent individuals will present with evidence of alcohol consumption for several months.

Using a genetic score to define alcohol metabolism, we did not find evidence to support that acetaldehyde accumulation is important in determining MCV levels. This is contrary to the findings in Asians for MCV and other alcohol-related liver function in Europeans. The lack of association with MCV is likely due to the fact that rs1229984 (ADH1B) is rare in Europeans and the ubiquitous presence of active ALDH2, the enzyme primarily involved in the rapid metabolism of acetaldehyde to acetate. Similar results to our own for ALDH gene polymorphisms were reported in a study of 510 white alcohol-dependent patients.

The PheWAS analysis showed SNP level pleiotropy for variants involved in MCV, suggesting a shared genetic risk with a number of conditions. Many of these combinations have strong physiological connections with one another (e.g. mineral metabolism).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement in a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason, threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used to direct the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature; prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and the context within which the tests are requested. For illustration, consider two patients: one with an acute hepatitis A infection may have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C may have an ALT within the normal reference interval. Yet, 10 years later, the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of management, while the patient with hepatitis C, if not investigated and diagnosed, is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease.

Indeed, the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the upper limit of normal for many liver enzymes (for example, ALT) may be too high, likely due to patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^112nLmed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Below, we describe the findings for tests assessed in four or more studies:

- **Cell counts**: white blood cell count increase and decrease, neutrophil count increase and decrease, monocyte count increase, lymphocyte count decrease, platelets decrease
- **Liver function**: alanine aminotransferase increase, aspartate aminotransferase increase, albumin decrease, total bilirubin
- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP increase, procalcitonin increase, IL-6 increase
- **Other markers**: creatine kinase increase, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase increase

The summary of findings for the individual tests, including sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs), are shown in Table 1. All HSROC curves were close to the non-informative diagonal, with DORs varying between 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.78) and 4.53 (95% CI 1.89 to 10.88). As an indication, a test with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 70% has a DOR of 5.0.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^1144QJH3]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Alcohol misuse and abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2016, global statistics suggested that 5.1% (approximately 3 million) of deaths and 5.3% (approximately 133 million) of disability-adjusted life years were caused by the harmful use of alcohol. Early identification of individuals who are misusing alcohol is critical for interventions to stop progression towards alcohol dependence and alcohol-related end-organ damage.

Unfortunately, a history from a patient is not always reliable, and laboratory tests vary in their diagnostic accuracy, availability, and usage. In clinical practice, therefore, it is usual to use a combination of history (including alcohol intake and symptoms consistent with organ damage), physical examination (to look for features of organ damage), and laboratory markers that support alcohol misuse as the underlying etiology. The most widely used laboratory tests are:

- **Liver function tests**: In particular, gamma-glutamyl transferase, which indicates liver damage.
- **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: A measure of the mean size and volume of erythrocytes, which is a non-specific marker of alcohol misuse.

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia, such as vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, or bleeding, before initiating VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients both before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is below 20%. Most patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly for the first 6 months after initiation, then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if these elevations are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food and should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: Recommendations for evaluation and long-term management [^116XvCtm]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of four inherited disorders, each resulting from a deficiency in the activity of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. These disorders present clinically with acute neurovisceral symptoms, which may be sporadic and, when severe, can be life-threatening. Diagnosis is often missed or delayed as the clinical features resemble other more common medical conditions.

- **Subgroups**: There are four major subgroups: symptomatic patients with sporadic attacks (< 4 attacks/year) or recurrent acute attacks (≥ 4 attacks/year), asymptomatic high porphyrin precursor excretors, and asymptomatic latent patients without symptoms or porphyrin precursor elevations.

Given their clinical heterogeneity and potential for significant morbidity with suboptimal management, comprehensive clinical guidelines for initial evaluation, follow-up, and long-term management are needed. Particularly, because no guidelines exist for monitoring disease progression or response to treatment, the Porphyrias Consortium of the National Institutes of Health's Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, which consists of expert centers in the clinical management of these disorders, has formulated these recommendations.

- **Recommendations basis**: These recommendations are based on the literature, ongoing natural history studies, and extensive clinical experience.

- **Initial assessments**: Initial assessments should include diagnostic confirmation by biochemical testing, subsequent genetic testing to determine the specific acute hepatic porphyria, and a complete medical history and physical examination.

### Prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and its association with type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi adults [^116vL4kT]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The biological mechanism underlying the association between hepatic enzymes and the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear; however, some possible pathways can be considered. One explanation is that elevated levels of ALT, AST, and GGT reflect excess fat deposition in the liver, a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is considered to be involved in metabolic syndrome, which encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors related to insulin resistance, hypertension, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and T2D. Moreover, NAFLD is closely linked to obesity and visceral fat accumulation. It is a common feature of insulin resistance syndrome, and visceral adiposity is considered a significant contributor to T2D.

A second possibility is that serum GGT plays an important role in intracellular antioxidant defense systems, primarily by regulating intracellular glutathione levels. Increased oxidative stress may contribute to the development of diabetes, as chronic oxidative stress results in declined responsiveness to insulin, which eventually leads to T2D. Although the associated mechanism remains largely unknown, changes in inflammation that occur through oxidative stress are predicted to be a common step in the pathogenesis of T2D. In a previous study, after adjusting for C-reactive protein, a marker of oxidative stress and inflammation, GGT showed a significant association with the risk of diabetes. The significant association between GGT and T2D observed in the present study also supports previous study findings.

### Approach to the liver biopsy in the patient with chronic low-level aminotransferase elevations [^116HcWAh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pathologists sometimes encounter a liver biopsy from an asymptomatic patient with unexplained low-level parenchymal liver enzyme elevations. These biopsies often exhibit minor histologic changes but are otherwise almost entirely normal. This situation presents a quandary regarding the clinical significance of these features and how to formulate a diagnosis from the possibly nonspecific findings of a near-normal biopsy.

The discussion focuses on the histologic changes observable in these biopsies and the practical issues involved in making a diagnosis that provides useful information to clinicians. The literature and textbooks addressing the histologic and clinical features of these cases are reviewed, emphasizing the clinical implications of finding nonspecific histologic alterations in these patients.

### Does this patient with liver disease have cirrhosis [^112hkzh2]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Among adult patients with liver disease, identifying those most likely to have cirrhosis noninvasively is challenging.

- **Objective**: To identify simple clinical indicators that can exclude or detect cirrhosis in adults with known or suspected liver disease.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to December 2011) and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks.

- **Study selection**: We retained 86 studies of adequate quality that evaluated the accuracy of clinical findings for identifying histologically proven cirrhosis.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate summary LRs across studies.

- **Results**: Among the 86 studies, 19,533 patients were included in this meta-analysis, among whom 4,725 had biopsy-proven cirrhosis (prevalence rate, 24%; 95% CI, 20%-28%). Many physical examination and simple laboratory tests increase the likelihood of cirrhosis, though the presence of ascites (LR, 7.2; 95% CI, 2.9–12), a platelet count < 100,000 (LR, 9.4; 95% CI, 2.6–37), and a Lok index < 0.2 are the most frequently studied, reliable, and informative results.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^117Fe5z6]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of liver cirrhosis, specifically in terms of managing hepatorenal syndrome through pharmacotherapy, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend considering serial measurements of central venous pressure or other methods to assess central blood volume. This is in addition to routine monitoring for patients receiving albumin. The aim is to prevent circulatory overload by optimizing fluid balance and appropriately titrating the albumin dose.

### Malaria in pregnant woman masquerading as HELLP syndrome [^11499cio]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Malaria may be complicated by the development of thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and/or hemolysis, which can be difficult to distinguish from HELLP (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome in a pregnant patient. A 33-year-old woman developed a HELLP-like syndrome and persistent fever postpartum without symptoms of preeclampsia. A malaria blood smear was performed and was positive for Plasmodium falciparum. The patient was immediately treated with quinine. The follow-up was uneventful, with the total disappearance of fever and a prompt resolution of biochemical signs of HELLP-like syndrome three days later. Malaria in a pregnant woman can masquerade as HELLP syndrome. The wide overlap in symptoms, such as headache, malaise, and digestive symptoms, does not suggest that symptoms would be effective in differentiating malaria from preeclampsia. Recent travel to an endemic area, combined with a malaria blood smear and clinical examination, should be key in the differential diagnosis.

### Veozah [^113Qy5ar]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Risks of hepatotoxicity**: Hepatotoxicity has occurred with the use of Veozah in the postmarketing setting.

- **Hepatic laboratory testing**: Perform hepatic laboratory tests prior to initiation of treatment to evaluate for hepatic function and injury. Do not start Veozah if aminotransferase is ≥ 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if total bilirubin is ≥ 2 x ULN for the evaluating laboratory. Perform follow-up hepatic laboratory testing monthly for the first 3 months, and then at 6 months and 9 months of treatment.

- **Patient advice**: Advise patients to discontinue Veozah immediately and seek medical attention, including hepatic laboratory tests, if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury, such as new onset fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, dark urine, or abdominal pain.

- **Discontinuation criteria**: Discontinue Veozah if transaminase elevations are > 5 x ULN, or if transaminase elevations are > 3 x ULN and the total bilirubin level is > 2 x ULN. If transaminase elevations > 3 x ULN occur, perform more frequent follow-up hepatic laboratory tests until resolution.

### The association of higher levels of within-normal-limits liver enzymes and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome [^1166Q8eT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors known to be associated with increased future atherothrombotic events. Previous studies have shown that elevated liver enzyme concentrations are associated with the diagnosis of MetS and its components.

However, little is known about the association between the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among individuals having within-normal-range liver enzymes. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one paper which demonstrated that even 'normal' levels of ALT are associated with the long-term development of multiple metabolic disorders, including MetS and diabetes mellitus.

Since both elevated GGT and ALT have demonstrated significant associations with both atherothrombotic burden and vascular risk, we have performed a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the prevalence of MetS in a relatively large sample of apparently healthy individuals in whom both GGT and ALT, as well as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were all within normal limits.

### Recommendations for clinical monitoring of patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) [^111gNiEK]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

At the initial evaluation of liver involvement, liver panels should include tests for ferritin, iron saturation, and viral and autoimmune serology to rule out potential co-morbidities. Periodic liver panels (every 6–12 months), such as transaminases, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time/INR, can assist in the assessment of liver function, although these tests commonly underestimate the extent of liver disease and fibrosis. Hepatocellular synthetic function, assessed by INR and albumin levels, may be preserved even in the setting of advanced cirrhosis. While elevated hepatic transaminases are seen in most patients, liver enzyme levels may be normal or only slightly elevated in the early stages of liver fibrosis.

Accurate assessment of the progression of liver fibrosis is important in managing ASMD patients. This can now be performed noninvasively by ultrasound-based transient elastography to measure liver stiffness. This method has been validated to reliably detect stage 2 versus stage 3 versus stage 4 fibrosis in the general population, in which it has also been shown to predict complications of liver disease as well as the occurrence or appearance of liver lesions. Elastography readings of 150,000/mm³ are unlikely to have high-risk varices, allowing patients to avoid endoscopies. Expanded criteria have been validated, and the recommended thresholds for performing upper GI endoscopy to screen for varices are when elastography exceeds 25 kPa and platelets fall below 110,000/mm³.

### Liver enzyme elevation in coronavirus disease 2019: A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study [^114eyJeX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated liver enzyme levels are observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these features have not been characterized.

- **Methods**: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17 to February 12, 2020, were enrolled. Liver enzyme level elevation was defined as alanine aminotransferase level > 35 U/L for men and 25 U/L for women at admission. Patients with normal alanine aminotransferase levels were included in the control group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and patients symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared.

- **Results**: Of 788 patients with COVID-19, 222 (28.2%) patients had elevated liver enzyme levels (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 47.0 [35.0–55.0] years; 40.5% women). Being male, overweight, and smoking increased the risk of liver enzyme level elevation. The liver enzyme level elevation group had lesser pharyngalgia and more diarrhea than the control group. The median time from illness onset to admission was 3 days for liver enzyme level elevation groups (IQR, 2–6), whereas the median hospitalization time for 86 (38.7%) discharged patients was 13 days (IQR, 11–16). No differences in disease severity and clinical outcomes were noted between the groups.

- **Discussion**: We found that 28.2% of patients with COVID-19 presented with elevated liver enzyme levels.

### Severity of liver test abnormalities in coronavirus disease 2019 depends on comorbidities and predicts early in-hospital mortality [^111ydZco]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, and in-hospital mortality.

- **Methods**: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe.

- **Results**: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. In adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years were associated with incremental risk of mortality with increased severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. Hypertension was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present.

- **Conclusion**: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.

### Liver stiffness increases acutely during sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis [^1179DK2c]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important cause of end-organ damage. It is estimated that 10–39% of VOC occurs with hepatic involvement. Assessments of hepatic involvement during VOC are unsatisfactory. We investigated transient elastography (TE) as a marker of hepatic involvement, its relationship with histology, and biochemical markers during VOC. SCD patients were evaluated with biochemical markers and TE at steady-state and during VOC. Change in TE and biochemical markers were correlated with length of hospital stay. When available, liver biopsy and tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) at steady-state were correlated with TE.

Twenty-three patients were evaluated (mean age = 34.3 years, standard deviation = 7.96). In 15 patients with liver biopsies, TE correlated with fibrosis (P = 0.01) and TRV (P = 0.0063), but not hepatic iron. Hemolysis biomarkers changed during VOC (P < 0.022), but not alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Paired comparison of TE at steady-state and during VOC showed an increase from 6.2 to 12.3 kPa (P = 0.0029). Increasing TE during VOC was associated with increasing ALT and alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.0088 and 0.0099, respectively). At steady-state, increasing inflammation on biopsy (P = 0.0037) and TRV (P = 0.0075) correlated with increasing TE during VOC. Increased hospital stay was associated with higher ALT (P = 0.041), lower albumin (P = 0.046), hemoglobin/hematocrit (P < 0.0021) but not TE. TE may identify patients with hepatic involvement during VOC independent of biochemical measures. Increase in TE may reflect both hepatic pathology and other systemic factors not fully explained by current biochemical markers.

### Active smoking and macrocytosis in the general population: Two population-based cohort studies [^11185Ssu]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes, is a highly prevalent phenomenon in adult individuals. MCV measures the average volume of red blood cells, and macrocytosis is defined as an MCV exceeding 100 fL. Textbooks and guidelines mention a myriad of causes for macrocytosis, with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, alcohol use, myeloid dysplastic syndromes, and liver disease being the most prominent. In the 1970s, several papers reported a positive association between smoking and MCV. However, this has not resulted in the inclusion of cigarette smoking as an important cause of macrocytosis in textbooks and guidelines. Hence, in the study, we aimed to investigate the association between smoking, assessed by both questionnaire and 24-hour urinary cotinine excretion as objective measurements of nicotine exposure, with MCV in two large population-based cohorts.

### Juxtapid [^114z5zPT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Risk of hepatotoxicity**: Juxtapid can cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic steatosis, as described below [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. To what extent Juxtapid-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. Although cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated transaminases with increase in bilirubin or INR) or hepatic failure have not been reported, there is concern that Juxtapid could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of Juxtapid in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Elevation of transaminases**: Elevations in transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are associated with Juxtapid. In the clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients with HoFH had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3× ULN, and 4 (14%) of the patients had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 5× ULN. There were no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful elevations in bilirubin, INR, or alkaline phosphatase [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

During the 78-week HoFH clinical trial, no patients discontinued prematurely because of elevated transaminases. Among the 19 patients who subsequently enrolled in the HoFH extension study, one discontinued because of increased transaminases that persisted despite several dose reductions, and one temporarily discontinued because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24× ULN, AST 13× ULN).

### Elevated liver enzymes: Emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This issue has become more prevalent with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine-focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

- **Discussion**: The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

- **Conclusions**: By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management.

### Liver volume in thalassaemia major: Relationship with body weight, serum ferritin, and liver function [^114d2k8r]. Pediatric Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

It is not known whether body weight alone can adjust for the volume of the liver in the calculation of the chelating dose in beta-thalassaemia major patients, who frequently have iron overload and hepatitis.

- **Objective**: The hypothesis is that liver volume in children and adolescents suffering from beta-thalassaemia major is affected by ferritin level and liver function.

- **Materials and methods**: Thirty-five beta-thalassaemia major patients aged 7–18 years and 35 age- and sex-matched controls had liver volume measured by MRI. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and ferritin levels were obtained in the thalassaemia major patients.

- **Results**: Body weight explained 65% and 86% of the change in liver volume in beta-thalassaemia major patients and age-matched control subjects, respectively. Liver volume per kilogram body weight was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in thalassaemia major patients than in control subjects. There was a significant correlation between ALT level and liver volume per kilogram body weight (r = 0.55, P = 0.001). Patients with elevated ALT had significantly higher liver volume per kilogram body weight (mean 42.9 ± 12 cm³/kg) than control subjects (mean 23.4 ± 3.6 cm³/kg) and patients with normal ALT levels (mean 27.4 ± 3.6 cm³/kg).

- **Conclusions**: Body weight is the most important single factor for liver-volume changes in thalassaemia major patients, but elevated ALT also has a significant role. Direct liver volume measurement for chelation dose adjustment may be advantageous in patients with elevated ALT.
