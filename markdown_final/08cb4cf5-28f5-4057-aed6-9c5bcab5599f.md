## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and its role across the cancer care continuum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular biology and biology of CEA and its CEACAM family. Then, I should verify prognostic implications in colorectal cancer (CRC) preoperatively and postoperatively. Next, I will review surveillance and recurrence detection performance and thresholds. After that, I need to check its role in metastatic CRC and treatment monitoring. Then, I should examine non-CRC contexts like lung, gastric, and medullary thyroid cancers. I will now evaluate emerging tools such as ctDNA and kinetics. Finally, I must synthesize practical clinical recommendations and note limitations and confounders, ensuring I continuously self-check assumptions against guidelines and high-quality data.

> Let me first confirm the molecular identity and function. CEA (CEACAM5) belongs to the CEACAM immunoglobulin superfamily. It is normally apically restricted in colon epithelium, but in malignancy it loses polarity and is shed into the circulation, enabling serum detection and reflecting tumor burden and activity, with emerging data linking soluble CEA to angiogenesis and immune modulation that may influence metastasis and microenvironment signaling [^114hdmFw] [^116QweMi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify prognostic value across time points. Preoperative CEA elevation is consistently associated with worse survival in colon and rectal cancer and is endorsed by guidelines as an independent prognostic factor, with hazard estimates around a 62% increase in death risk for elevated preoperative CEA, supporting baseline measurement before surgery to establish a reference for surveillance and risk stratification [^117PSNNw] [^1138KBi6] [^113owKnE].

> Wait, let me verify postoperative dynamics, because this often changes management. Persistently elevated postoperative CEA, especially after allowing a 4–6 week washout, strongly portends recurrence and inferior survival, whereas normalization of a previously elevated CEA indicates substantially better outcomes and not worse than patients with normal preoperative CEA; this has been demonstrated in large cohorts and reinforced by meta-analyses showing approximately 2–3 fold higher hazards for recurrence and mortality with elevated postoperative CEA [^116HVHg2] [^113phEfQ] [^111jbo5F].

> I should double-check practical thresholds and timing. Most clinical guidance operationalizes a CEA of 5 ng/mL as the upper limit of normal, with a median of about 4.3 weeks from surgery to the first postoperative measurement; in liver metastasis cohorts, postoperative CEA greater than 5 ng/mL independently predicts recurrence and worse survival, reinforcing its utility as a minimal residual disease signal in the perioperative window [^113phEfQ] [^11722fWu].

> Next, I should review surveillance performance and test characteristics. CEA is not sensitive enough alone for recurrence detection; pooled sensitivity and specificity at a 10 ng/mL threshold are about 68% and 97%, respectively, with the trade-off that lower thresholds increase sensitivity but generate more false positives, especially in the 5–15 ng/mL range; trends outperform single values, yet even trend-based approaches do not reach the sensitivity needed for standalone surveillance, mandating combination with imaging and clinical review [^115y5T1x] [^116ZKwC6] [^113ee2Kt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that lowering the CEA threshold to 2.5 ng/mL might solve sensitivity problems, but I should correct that. Although sensitivity can rise to roughly 80–82% at 2.5 ng/mL, specificity falls to about 80%, causing frequent false alarms. NCCN notes that many elevations between 5 and 15 ng/mL are false positives, while values above 35 ng/mL are almost always true positives, so I need to ensure that modest rises are confirmed and interpreted in trend and clinical context before escalating imaging [^115y5T1x] [^111ssa1N] [^113VCGLX].

> I will now examine the workup of rising CEA after resection. Standard evaluation includes a careful history and exam, colonoscopy, and contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. If these are unrevealing but CEA continues to rise, repeating CT in 3 months and considering FDG-PET/CT is reasonable, but blind laparotomy or anti-CEA scintigraphy are not recommended by guidelines, and any imaging-triggered findings should guide oncologic management rather than marker-driven surgery [^1169KMiD] [^116gSEUt] [^116qBfgJ].

> Let me consider metastatic disease and treatment monitoring. In mCRC, CEA kinetics correlate with outcomes. Rapid early decreases and sustained suppression are favorable, whereas transient "flare" can occur and paradoxically predict better response and survival compared with rising CEA, likely reflecting tumor lysis. Conversely, failure to normalize or early rebound portends inferior progression-free and overall survival, and CEA ratio changes during therapy track with radiologic response and survival, supporting serial CEA as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in this setting [^113M7uUQ] [^114QjBbf] [^111JMsyt] [^115HbY5r].

> But wait, what if CEA is normal and the patient still relapses? I need to ensure I do not over-rely on CEA. False negatives occur, particularly with low-burden or non-CEA–producing disease, and tissue CEA expression may be discordant with serum levels; tissue CEA positivity has been associated with worse prognosis and may explain why some patients recur with normal serum CEA, reminding me to integrate clinicopathologic features and imaging rather than relying on CEA alone [^1129UY7D] [^113vHzCd] [^115rQExd].

> Next, I should review non-CRC contexts. In early-stage NSCLC, elevated preoperative CEA and failure to normalize postoperatively independently predict worse survival, with particularly poor outcomes in those with persistently high postoperative CEA. However, guidelines remain cautious about routine CEA surveillance intervals, so I should confirm that CEA is used as an adjunct rather than a replacement for standard thoracic follow-up protocols [^116Ytd54] [^112Kscpn] [^116Dc8os].

> I need to check gastric cancer data. Preoperative CEA correlates with lymph node metastasis and depth of invasion, and combining CEA with imaging can improve diagnostic performance for nodal disease; however, CEA is not consistently an independent prognostic factor across multivariable models, so I should interpret CEA in gastric cancer primarily as a risk adjunct rather than a standalone determinant of outcome [^114Yoiki] [^115AF3AM].

> Let me verify medullary thyroid carcinoma nuances. CEA is not useful for early detection of MTC, but once MTC is established, rising CEA alongside calcitonin signals disease progression; rare cases with advanced MTC may have rising CEA with stable calcitonin, so I should confirm that CEA trends are interpreted in the context of calcitonin and clinical findings rather than in isolation [^115u6Zss].

> I will now examine emerging tools and kinetics. Circulating tumor DNA has been explored as a surveillance adjunct, but prospective cohorts suggest ctDNA does not clearly outperform guideline-concordant CEA plus imaging, particularly missing some low-burden lung recurrences; thus, I should avoid replacing CEA-based surveillance with ctDNA alone and instead view ctDNA as investigational or complementary pending larger prospective validation [^114L3Zrs] [^112B8mCB] [^115pxS8H].

> Hold on, I should verify kinetic interpretation principles. CEA trends outperform single values for recurrence detection, and small but persistent rises, even within the normal range, can be meaningful. A rise greater than 1 ng/mL from an individual's baseline has shown about 80% sensitivity and 86% specificity for recurrence, and a threefold increase approximates the diagnostic accuracy of fixed cutoffs, so I should confirm that patient-specific baselines and delta changes are incorporated into decision-making rather than rigid universal thresholds alone [^113YMzMj] [^117TvWGm] [^113ee2Kt].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. Preoperative CEA should be obtained in all patients with colon and rectal cancer to establish baseline risk and enable surveillance interpretation. Postoperative CEA should be measured about 4–6 weeks after surgery and then every 3–6 months for 2–3 years and every 6–12 months thereafter, recognizing that routine CEA and CT beyond 5 years is not recommended. Any confirmed rise, especially above 10–15 ng/mL or a persistent upward trend, should trigger guideline-based imaging and clinical reassessment, with PET/CT considered if conventional imaging is negative but suspicion remains high [^1138KBi6] [^113phEfQ] [^116qsKtx] [^1169KMiD] [^116gSEUt].

> I should confirm limitations and confounders before concluding. CEA can be elevated in smokers and in benign liver, biliary, pulmonary, and inflammatory conditions, and false positives in the 5–15 ng/mL range are common, whereas values above 35 ng/mL are rarely false; conversely, false negatives occur, so a normal CEA does not exclude recurrence, and surveillance must remain multimodal with imaging and clinical vigilance to avoid missed disease [^114H3K6y] [^113VCGLX] [^115rQExd].

> In summary, CEA remains a pragmatic, guideline-endorsed biomarker that informs baseline risk, gauges adequacy of resection via postoperative normalization, and guides surveillance intensity. It is not a screening test, not sufficiently sensitive to stand alone, and must be interpreted in trend and clinical context, with escalation warranted for persistent or large rises and with the understanding that normal values do not obviate the need for standard imaging and follow-up [^117PSNNw] [^115y5T1x] [^111ssa1N].

CEA is a **glycoprotein tumor marker** most associated with colorectal cancer, but it is not specific to CRC and can be elevated in other cancers and benign conditions [^113WP3We] [^114H3K6y]. It is **primarily used for prognosis, treatment monitoring, and surveillance** — not for screening or diagnosis — because of limited sensitivity and specificity [^115y5T1x] [^116ZKwC6]. Preoperative CEA elevation indicates worse prognosis; postoperative or serial rises suggest recurrence and warrant imaging and clinical evaluation [^117PSNNw] [^116HVHg2] [^1169KMiD]. CEA is most useful when interpreted in clinical context and combined with imaging, as it can miss recurrences or yield false positives [^116ZKwC6] [^113ee2Kt].

---

## Clinical significance of CEA in cancer

CEA is a **tumor marker** that provides prognostic and monitoring information, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) [^117PSNNw]. It is not specific to CRC and can be elevated in other malignancies, including lung, breast, gastric, pancreatic, and medullary thyroid cancers [^113Ti5tt] [^112Hyc7s]. CEA is also elevated in some benign conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, and smoking [^114H3K6y].

## CEA in colorectal cancer (CRC)

### Prognostic value

Preoperative CEA elevation is associated with worse prognosis, higher recurrence rates, and reduced overall survival in CRC [^117PSNNw]. Postoperative CEA elevation indicates **residual disease or recurrence** and is associated with significantly worse outcomes [^111jbo5F] [^116HVHg2].

---

### Monitoring treatment response

During treatment, CEA levels typically decline with effective therapy; **persistent elevation or a rise suggests treatment failure** or disease progression [^113M7uUQ] [^111JMsyt]. CEA kinetics correlate with treatment response and survival in metastatic CRC [^113M7uUQ].

---

### Surveillance for recurrence

Serial CEA measurements are recommended post-resection to detect recurrence early [^111ssa1N]. A confirmed rise should prompt **imaging and clinical evaluation** [^1169KMiD]. However, CEA alone is insufficiently sensitive for surveillance; combining CEA with imaging improves detection of recurrence [^116ZKwC6] [^113ee2Kt].

---

## Limitations of CEA as a biomarker

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: CEA has limited sensitivity and specificity, leading to false positives and false negatives [^116ZKwC6] [^115y5T1x].
- **False positives**: Elevated CEA can occur in benign conditions (e.g. smoking, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease) [^114H3K6y].
- **False negatives**: Some cancers, particularly early-stage or well-differentiated tumors, may have normal CEA levels [^notfound].
- **Not for screening**: CEA is not recommended for cancer screening due to its limited accuracy [^111YP2hh] [^112DSYT7].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical context** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Preoperative assessment | Obtain baseline CEA for prognosis and surveillance reference [^117PSNNw] [^1138KBi6] |
| Postoperative surveillance | Measure CEA every 3–6 months for 2–3 years, then annually [^112B8mCB] |
| Metastatic disease monitoring | Use CEA to assess treatment response and detect progression [^113M7uUQ] [^111JMsyt] |
| Elevated CEA | Confirm with repeat testing and imaging; avoid blind surgery [^1169KMiD] [^116qBfgJ] |

## Emerging biomarkers and complementary approaches

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging biomarker for **early detection of recurrence** and **monitoring treatment response** [^116ngyqB]. However, current evidence suggests ctDNA does not definitively outperform standard CEA and imaging surveillance strategies [^114L3Zrs] [^115pxS8H]. Combining CEA with other biomarkers (e.g. CA 19–9) or imaging modalities may improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value [^116KzPQS] [^116ZKwC6].

CEA is a **valuable tumor marker** for prognosis, treatment monitoring, and surveillance in CRC, but its limitations necessitate careful interpretation and combination with other clinical and imaging findings [^117PSNNw] [^116ZKwC6].

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^11425Cii]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

There is much interest in developing strategies for tumour-specific delivery of agents to increase our diagnostic capability or enhance the selectivity and effectiveness of therapeutics. These strategies rely on the ability to target tumour cells accurately using biomarkers that are differentially expressed between tumour and normal tissue. In colorectal cancer, the most commonly used biomarkers include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumour-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), and folate receptor- α (FR α). Carcinoembryonic antigen and TAG-72 are membrane-bound glycoproteins that are expressed in over 80% of colorectal cancers with relatively little expression in normal mucosa. Folate receptor- α is a membrane-bound protein that binds and transports folic acid and is overexpressed in epithelial-derived cancers, including those of the colorectum. It appears to be expressed relatively infrequently in colorectal tumours but is absent in the vast majority of normal tissues, hinting at a potentially high specificity. Epithelial growth factor receptor is a well-known target for anti-cancer therapies but the literature concerning the degree and frequency of EGFR overexpression in colorectal cancer is contradictory, with reported expression varying from 33% to 97% of cases. It is also reported to be expressed in up to 48% of normal colorectal samples, which could compromise its specificity for cancer tissue.

Identification of biomarkers that are sensitive and specific for colorectal cancer opens up many avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic exploitation. The ability to visualise tumours and their metastases during surgery may facilitate more accurate and disease-specific operations. Fluorescence-based, laparoscopic imaging, using antibodies targeting antigens found on tumour cells, has already shown considerable potential. In non-invasive imaging, iodine-124 labelled antibodies to CEA have been administered to enhance PET cancer scanning, and CEA antibodies have been conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles to improve MRI imaging. In therapeutic applications, radioisotope antibodies, usually directed towards CEA or TAG-72, have been used to deliver tumour selective radiotherapy and have been shown to be particularly effective in small-volume disease. Similarly, targeted cytotoxic drug delivery has the potential to deliver high-dose chemotherapy to cancer cells, while limiting damage to normal cells, and has utilised a variety of biomarkers, including FR α, EGFR and CEA.

### Assessing the prognostic value of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen-specific T-cell responses in colorectal cancer [^114BiRhQ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

CEA-specific T-cell responsiveness could also reflect more advanced tumor stages, ie, presence of micrometastases that are not demonstrated by conventional staging techniques. Whilst further studies are required to uncover why CEA-specific T-cells confer harm, it is clear that measuring these responses could offer crucial prognostic information independent of tumor stage and help identify patients at risk for tumor recurrence. Although this particular study was limited by the relatively small sample size without a validation cohort and by the fact that immunological data were not available for all patients, the conclusions from this study raise the possibility that targeting adjuvant treatments at CEA + T-cell responders may improve treatment outcome.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^112B8mCB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Surveillance strategies in the management of resected locoregional and metastatic colorectal cancer have been investigated thoroughly during the last several decades. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and intensive imaging have been investigated as sole or combination strategies in the surveillance of resected stage I to III disease, considerable disagreement remains regarding the impact of these assays on colorectal cancer outcome. Despite the limited benefits of measuring CEA levels and imaging on the overall survival among patients with colorectal cancer, these tests are still believed to have value in the early detection of metastatic disease recurrence, which can lead to curative surgery. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) currently recommends the surveillance of stage II and III colorectal cancer with measurement of CEA levels every 3 to 6 months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for 3 years. In addition, patients with stage II to III colorectal cancer are to undergo computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 to 12 months for 2 years followed by yearly imaging for 3 years. For resected stage IV disease, the NCCN recommends a similar CEA surveillance strategy and intensive imaging, with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 3 to 6 months for 2 years followed by every 6 to 12 months for another 3 years. The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) has largely endorsed a similar surveillance strategy. Neither the NCCN nor the ESMO recommend the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays for surveillance of colorectal cancer.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^1123F6Rn]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The third main result of this study is the independent predictive value of postsurgery CEA levels. In our multivariate analysis the postoperative level of CEA replaced that of postoperative CA19–9 as the major determinant (with a statistically relevant weight for relative survival), although the two had apparently similar prognostic roles at univariate analysis. In most of the previous studies aimed at evaluating the implications of CEA levels for staging and prognosis, the serum concentration of CEA was evaluated preoperatively and, despite some conflicting results, the majority of them showed a direct prognostic value (a nice review on this topic is available in a recent paper by). Since the CEA level seems to roughly reflect the tumour burden and/or diffusion, its preoperative evaluation might offer a crude estimate of neoplastic spread and, thus, of the probable difficulty of achieving successful radical resection. A drop in CEA levels after the resection is considered a favourable indicator of the completeness of the surgical excision, although CEA concentration is generally regarded as more sensitive for hepatic and retroperitoneal metastases than for local recurrence or peritoneal and pulmonary metastases. According to, the measurement of the CEA level in the blood intraoperatively taken from the mesenteric vein offers some advantage, as both indicator of hepatic metastases and predictor of 5-year survival. The same investigators also found a higher recurrence rate in patients with both high CEA levels and positive citology in peritoneal washings taken at the beginning of surgery. Several patients in the present series were referred to our unit from a neighbouring hospital with preoperative CEA often not technically comparable or even not assessed. However, we know that apart from cases with documented distant metastases (stage IV), some patients have CEA levels higher than normal after putatively radical operations, without any instrumental macroscopic evidence of persisting local residual disease or distant spread. Since the half-life of CEA serum level has been calculated to be a few days – from 3.0 to 4.3 or 6.2 – our evaluation at a mean interval of 42 days after surgery – and rarely after less than 4 weeks – seems able to reliably reflect the presence of occult spread of the disease. In such cases, the clinical problem is whether to plan adjuvant therapy according to the TNM stage only or whether to consider also the altered marker value as an important worsening factor.

### Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer resection: recommendations of the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^1121tFtA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer resection — scope and modalities covered: This updated document focuses on the role of colonoscopy in patients after CRC resection and reviews possible adjunctive roles of fecal testing and CT colonography (CTC), while stating that the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CT scans of the liver, as well as chest radiographs are beyond the scope of this document and are not reviewed. Although the optimal surveillance strategy is still not clearly defined, the role of colonoscopy is primarily to clear the colon of synchronous cancers and polyps and prevent metachronous neoplasms.

### Soluble carcinoembryonic antigen activates endothelial cells and tumor angiogenesis [^116QweMi]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, CD66e, CEACAM-5) is a cell-surface-bound glycoprotein overexpressed and released by many solid tumors that has an autocrine function in cancer cell survival and differentiation. Soluble CEA released by tumors is present in the circulation of patients with cancer, where it is used as a marker for cancer progression, but whether this form of CEA exerts any effects in the tumor microenvironment is unknown. Here, we present evidence that soluble CEA is sufficient to induce proangiogenic endothelial cell behaviors, including adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and migration in vitro and tumor microvascularization in vivo. CEA-induced activation of endothelial cells was dependent on integrin β-3 signals that activate the focal-adhesion kinase and c-Src kinase and their downstream MAP-ERK kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt effector pathways. Notably, while interference with VEGF signaling had no effect on CEA-induced endothelial cell activation, downregulation with the CEA receptor in endothelial cells attenuated CEA-induced signaling and tumor angiogenesis. Corroborating these results clinically, we found that tumor microvascularization was higher in patients with colorectal cancer exhibiting higher serum levels of soluble CEA. Together, our results elucidate a novel function for soluble CEA in tumor angiogenesis.

### Serum carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring after curative resection for colorectal cancer: clinical significance of the preoperative level [^114J6trZ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

We evaluated preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a prognostic factor for colorectal cancer and determined when surveillance of this marker was useful.

Methods

Serum CEA was measured preoperatively in 1,263 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer at 3-month intervals for the first 2 postoperative years and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Mean follow-up was 48 months (range 1–156 months).

Results

The 5-year disease-free survival was less in patients with a high preoperative serum CEA level (P < 0.0001). Among patients with a tumor recurrence, 38.5% had high follow-up serum CEA levels. The number of patients with high postoperative serum CEA levels exceeded the number of patients with high preoperative levels. High preoperative and follow-up serum CEA levels were independent prognostic factors for tumor recurrence (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). In patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels, CEA surveillance had a 92.3% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 96.1% negative predictive value (NPV). The mean interval between postoperative serum CEA elevation and the diagnosis of a tumor recurrence [diagnostic interval (DI)] was 2.5 months (range 5–17 months). The DI was 0 in 18.8% of patients with a tumor recurrence.

Conclusion

High serum CEA levels preoperatively and at follow-up are prognostic factors for colorectal cancer. Postoperative serum CEA surveillance is used most effectively when patients have high preoperative serum CEA levels. Considering the DI of 0 in 18.8% of the patients, the current CEA surveillance schedule might be changed.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen kinetics predict response to first-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer: analysis from PRODIGE 9 trial [^113M7uUQ]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To examine the relationship between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) kinetics and prognosis in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients receiving first-line chemotherapy in the PRODIGE9 trial.

Methods

Associations between monthly CEA measurements within 6 months since baseline and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using a joint-latent class-mixed model. A validation set was used to test our prognosis model. Correlations between CEA trajectories (classes) and baseline characteristics were also investigated.

Results

Three classes were identified. Class 1 had low baseline CEA with small variations. Class 2 had high baseline CEA with a rapid decrease reaching the same CEA level at 6 months as in class 1. Class 3 had high baseline CEA with a transient decrease followed by an increase to reach, at 6 months, the same CEA level as at baseline. Six-month PFS was significantly lower in class 3 than in classes 1 and 2 (57% vs. 91% and 93% respectively; p < 0.01). Class 3 was significantly associated with ECOG 2 status, a high LDH level and non-resected primary tumor.

Discussion

Variations in CEA kinetics correlate with prognosis in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for mCRC. We propose here a user-friendly application to classify CEA trajectory.

### Prognostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen staining in cancer tissues of gastric cancer patients [^112uTSxE]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to assess the significance of the correlation among tissue carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression with serum CEA (sCEA) levels and long-term survival to highlight the clinical prognostic significance of tissue CEA expression in gastric cancer patients.

Methods

Immunohistological method and radioimmunoassay were used to assess tissue and sCEA expression, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine correlations, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to investigate the prognostic significance.

Results

Our results demonstrate that tissue CEA in gastric cancer is significantly correlated with preoperative sCEA levels (p = 0.031), depth of invasion (p = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), distant metastasis (p = 0.001), and TNM staging (p < 0.001). The 5-year survival rates were 67.6, 53.9, and 40.1% for negatively, moderately, and intensely positively stained tissues (p < 0.001), and 57.0 and 37.9% for serum with normal and elevated CEA expression (p = 0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed that tissue CEA can be considered an independent prognostic factor. Further analysis illustrated that patients with negative expression in both tissue and serum had better prognosis compared with those positively expressing CEA in both tissue and serum and/or those positively expressing CEA in either tissue or serum (p < 0.001). Our results also demonstrated that patients with negative tissue CEA staining and elevated sCEA expression had a better 5-year survival.

Conclusion

Tissue CEA expression in gastric cancer is directly correlated with sCEA levels and long-term prognosis. Thus, tissue CEA expression can be considered as a useful biomarker to improve the interpretation of sCEA levels in predicting long-term survival.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^114BmLSk]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumour types in the world, with about 400 000 deaths annually. In the United States, despite a slight decrease in its incidence and mortality during the past two decades, CRC remains the third most common cancer, affecting about 140 000 people and accounting for 50 000 cancer-related deaths per year. In China, where the incidence rate was initially low, due to the changes in lifestyle and nutritional habits, the CRC rate is increasing by 4.2% annually.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most commonly used tumour marker for the diagnosis of CRC and evaluation of prognosis or recurrence after treatment. The guideline of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) indicated that for T2 or greater lesions, a CEA test is recommended at baseline and every 3 months for 2 years. CEA can be detected and quantitatively measured in the serum and the tumour tissue of CRC patients, but their role in the prognosis of CRC remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic value of CEA both in tumour tissue and in serum of the patients with CRC.

### Conditional survival and the prognostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in oldest old with colorectal cancer [^1146zTkv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a highly glycosylated antigen of 201 kDa, which is expressed on the apical surface of colon epithelial cells and excreted through the intestinal cavity. With the destruction of normal tissue structure in malignant tumors and the loss of polarization of neoplastic cells in the depth of tumor glandular tissue, CEA may be expressed on the entire cell surface and may eventually enter the bloodstream, resulting in an increase in its serum level. The serum level of CEA is a significant tumor marker used to aid in the management of CRC, notably in the preoperative and postoperative assessment of the patients. A higher preoperative CEA level has been identified as an independent and practical predictor of both overall and disease-free survival of CRC. Periodic measurement of CEA levels is important as it could not only reflect the remaining disease when measured postoperatively but also predict cancer recurrence when measured during the surveillance period. A recent study was performed to assess the positive role of CEA in the management of CRC. The data indicated that the 5-year OS and DFS rates for patients with CEA levels ≥ 2.5 ng/ml were 73% and 79% respectively, which were lower than those with CEA level < 2.5 ng/ml (85% and 86% respectively). Recent study has shown that CEA also has a great role in predicting metastatic CRC (mCRC). In mCRC patients with baseline CEA ≥ 10 ng/ml, CEA levels can predict disease progression after first-line induction therapy in mCRC patients with baseline CEA ≥ 10 ng/ml. A prospective study has noted that CEA kinetic measurements are clinically relevant to the early prediction of treatment outcome in patients with mCRC. When CEA is combined with CA19–9 and CA72–4 to form a joint prediction model, it is more effective in diagnosing and predicting prognosis of CRC patients. Under the circumstances of COVID-19, We believe that it is inconvenient for the elderly to go to the hospital for regular check-ups, especially for some CT and MRI examinations. In this circumstance, by using a liquid biopsy of tumor marker CEA, the prognosis of the elderly can be briefly estimated according to the CEA level. Obviously, as a classical tumor marker, we should spare no effort to explore more value of CEA in clinical diagnosis and treatment, and provide guidance and reference for various CRC patients.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^111F5wf8]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

A large body of investigational data demonstrates that the prognosis of patients undergoing bowel resection for colorectal cancer is mainly determined by factors related to local tumour growth and the presence or absence of nodal and/or distant metastases. Many classification systems have been devised to categorise these anatomical factors for clinical use but an increasing number of new pathological and nonanatomical elements show interesting correlations with survival and would be worth testing systematically for selective integration into the available staging classifications. Improvement of the prognostic accuracy of these classifications might allow a more flexible use of the increasing number of new drugs and therapeutic options now available for postsurgical management of patients with colorectal cancer. However, since this malignancy is a disease of the elderly and the populations of developed countries are ageing rapidly, overall survival, as currently investigated, may not be the most suitable outcome parameter for evaluating the real prognostic impact of tumour-linked factors. Because about one-half of all colorectal carcinomas in our series occur in people aged 65 years or older, and a considerable number of these subjects die of other causes with no evidence of cancer, a fraction of these deaths should not be related to the tumour.

There are two main purposes of the present work: (1) to verify the prognostic significance of the current clinicopathological factors through a study of both overall and relative survival, this latter being a selective estimate of the chance of surviving the effects of cancer; (2) to include – among the factors to be tested – the linear dimensions of the resected tumour as an estimate of its preoperative volume. Tumour size has never shown a clear prognostic value, but its potential effect has always been evaluated through overall survival analyses, in which it has shown a satisfying correlation with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) levels. Since these markers are commonly considered of prognostic value, but are inconstantly expressed, a re-evaluation of the predictive value of tumour size through an analysis of relative survival might yield definitive results on this matter.

### A general cutoff level combined with personalized dynamic change of serum carcinoembryonic antigen can suggest timely use of FDG PET for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer [^1114uqmn]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

FDG PET that has been used is good for diagnosing asymptomatic colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence in patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. However, there is no reference level of CEA rise that would universally suggest the necessity of a PET study. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the high-risk group of CRC recurrence through an examination of the dynamics of the CEA level rise as a recurrence indicator.

Patients and Methods

Between July 2002 and May 2010, 112 patients (59 men, 53 women; age, 18–87 years) had FDG PET for suspicious CRC recurrence indicated by elevated CEA level. We reviewed the PET results and the medical records for recurrence verification and calculated the ratio of increase and the velocity of change in CEA levels for risk stratification.

Results

The patient-based sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET are 96.6%, 91.3%, and 95.5%, respectively. The probability of recurrence positively correlated with the CEA level rise and the newly diagnosed disease stage. Carcinoembryonic antigen level greater than 13 ng/mL indicated significantly higher risks of recurrence. In patients with CEA level rise of 13 ng/mL or less, an increase over 3.34 times the individualized baseline also indicated high risks of recurrence.

Conclusions

A posttreatment CEA level rise to greater than 13 ng/mL is suggestive of the optimal use of FDG PET, and so is a mild increase below 13 ng/mL at an increase rate over 3.34.

### Community compliance with carcinoembryonic antigen: follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer [^116Kzz5h]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine whether recommendations for surveillance carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing in stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) are adhered to upon discharge from our cancer center, patterns of care after CEA elevation, and whether differences in outcomes exist between patients who did and did not receive recommended CEA monitoring.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective, single-institution chart review was completed at the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) in Edmonton, Alberta. The Alberta Cancer Registry (ACR) identified patients with CRC diagnosed between January 1 and December 31, 2001. Patients with stage II/III CRC seen and/or treated at the CCI and later discharged to the community with follow-up recommendations based on American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines were included. Carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring ≥ every 4 months for ≥ 2 years was deemed acceptable for study purposes.

Results

The ACR identified 152 stage II/III CRC cases meeting inclusion criteria. Eleven patients (7.2%) received the minimum predefined CEA follow-up. Eighty-seven CEA follow-up tests were elevated; only 20 (23%) elevated CEAs were investigated with predefined timely intervention. Twenty-six patients (17.1%) had documentable tumor recurrence. There was no difference in overall survival or time to recurrence between the groups who received and did not receive appropriate follow-up, although small numbers limit the effectiveness of statistical analysis.

Conclusion

Post-therapy surveillance is important in CRC management. Our study reveals follow-up recommendations based on best available evidence for interval CEA testing are not followed in the community. These findings suggest the need for review of recommendations and change in management for monitoring discharged patients with stage II/III CRC.

### Effect of 3 to 5 years of scheduled CEA and CT follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer: the FACS randomized clinical trial [^117Pizhn]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common practice but is based on limited evidence.

Objective

To assess the effect of scheduled blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and computed tomography (CT) as follow-up to detect recurrent colorectal cancer treatable with curative intent.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial in 39 National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom; 1202 eligible participants were recruited between January 2003 and August 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: CEA only (n = 300), CT only (n = 299), CEA+CT (n = 302), or minimum follow-up (n = 301). Blood CEA was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years; CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years; and the minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent; secondary outcomes were mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

Results

After a mean 4.4 (SD, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% CI, 14.5%-18.7%) overall; 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated for recurrence with curative intent, with little difference according to Dukes staging (stage A, 5.1% [13/254]; stage B, 6.1% [34/553]; stage C, 6.2% [22/354]). Surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 2.3% (7/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% (20/300) in the CEA group, 8% (24/299) in the CT group, and 6.6% (20/302) in the CEA+CT group. Compared with minimum follow-up, the absolute difference in the percentage of patients treated with curative intent in the CEA group was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.23–7.33), in the CT group was 5.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-9.5%; adjusted OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.51–8.69), and in the CEA+CT group was 4.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.10–8.71). The number of deaths was not significantly different in the combined intensive monitoring groups (CEA, CT, and CEA+CT; 18.2% [164/901]) vs the minimum follow-up group (15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -2.6% to 7.1%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging or CEA screening each provided an increased rate of surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage in combining CEA and CT. If there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression in human tumors: a tissue microarray study on 15, 413 tumors… [^113Ti5tt]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract e15181 Background: Carcinoembryonic antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein which is overexpressed in various cancers but reported prevalence data vary considerably for many tumor types. Because of its overexpression in various cancer types and the limited expression in normal tissue CEA has become a potential drug target with several potential drug candidates currently being evaluated. CEA is also shed into the blood stream, so that CEA measurement in the serum is used as a tool for early detection and recurrence monitoring of cancer. Results: CEA was detectable in 65 of 120 tumor categories including 49 tumor types with at least one strongly positive case. CEA positivity was most common in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, other gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, medullary carcinomas of the thyroid, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, mucinous carcinomas. of the ovary and the breast, squamous cell carcinomas of various sites, and small cell carcinomas of the lung, the urinary bladder, and the prostate as well as non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma pTa G3, pTa G2 high-grade and pTa G2 low-grade. High CEA expression was linked to high grade tumors and invasive growth in urinary bladder cancer as well as estrogen receptor positivity and HER2 positivity in invasive breast cancer of no special type. In 1. 250 colorectal adenocarcinomas, reduced CEA expression was associated with mismatch repair deficiency but not with pT and pN stage. CEA expression level was unrelated to clinico-pathological tumor parameters in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and the stomach, endometroid endometrium carcinoma as well as in serous and endometroid carcinomas of the ovaries.

In the NORDIC-VII patient cohort, we previously reported that an elevated level of IL-6 was associated with an impaired prognosis, especially in patients with BRAF -mutant tumours. To examine the relationship between CA 19–9 and IL-6, we included information about IL-6 levels (cut-off value 5.6 ng/L) in the analysis of how CA 19–9 predicts OS. Table 3, showing results from patients with BRAF -mutant tumours, demonstrates that at high levels of IL-6 with poor survival there was still a further impaired outcome associated with high CA 19–9. This suggests that IL-6 and CA 19–9, at least partly, reflect independent mechanisms associated with inferior prognosis.

### The significance of preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the prediction of lymph node metastasis and prognosis in locally advanced gastric cancer: a retrospective analysis [^115AF3AM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

For patients with LAGC, preoperative CEA is a strong factor for determining LNM and may be useful for improving the sensitivity of conventional methods in determining LNM when the two approaches are combined. Serum CEA can be used for the diagnosis of GC and can assist in predicting prognosis, but it is not an independent prognostic factor.

### Increased serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels as an early sign of medullary thyroid carcinoma [^112Hyc7s]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To emphasize the potential association between increased levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).

Methods

We present two case reports of this association, including long-term serial measurements of CEA in one patient.

Results

CEA is a tumor marker often associated with colon cancer. In recent years, increased CEA in plasma has been reported in patients with other cancers. Diagnoses of MTC in two patients were preceded by increased CEA levels (for 6 years in one patient). Because CEA levels returned to normal after thyroidectomy, MTC may have been the cause of the increases.

Conclusion

In patients with increased plasma CEA levels, MTC should be considered in the differential diagnosis even if thyroid palpation is nonrevealing and thyroid function is normal.

### ASCO 2006 update of recommendations for the use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancer [^114ZaXS5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the recommendations for the use of tumor marker tests in the prevention, screening, treatment, and surveillance of gastrointestinal cancers.

Methods

For the 2006 update, an update committee composed of members from the full Panel was formed to complete the review and analysis of data published since 1999. Computerized literature searches of Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The Update Committee's literature review focused attention on available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published tumor marker studies.

Recommendations and Conclusion

For colorectal cancer, it is recommended that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) be ordered preoperatively, if it would assist in staging and surgical planning. Postoperative CEA levels should be performed every 3 months for stage II and III disease for at least 3 years if the patient is a potential candidate for surgery or chemotherapy of metastatic disease. CEA is the marker of choice for monitoring the response of metastatic disease to systemic therapy. Data are insufficient to recommend the routine use of p53, ras, thymidine synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, thymidine phosphorylase, microsatellite instability, 18q loss of heterozygosity, or deleted in colon cancer (DCC) protein in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. For pancreatic cancer, CA 19–9 can be measured every 1 to 3 months for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease receiving active therapy. Elevations in serial CA 19–9 determinations suggest progressive disease but confirmation with other studies should be sought. New markers and new evidence to support the use of the currently reviewed markers will be evaluated in future updates of these guidelines.

### The impact of carcinoembryonic antigen flare in patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy [^114QjBbf]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) flare may have a favourable response to chemotherapy, but its impact on survival is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of CEA flare and its impact on objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Patients and Methods

Patients with histologically proven advanced colorectal cancer undergoing first-line chemotherapy with three or more serial CEA measurements (one at baseline and two or more during treatment) were included. Patients were grouped according to CEA kinetic as flare (F), decreasing CEA, normal baseline CEA, stable CEA and increasing CEA (I).

Results

From January 2000 to February 2008, 837 patients were screened of whom 670 were eligible. CEA flare occurred in 78 (11.6%) patients. On multivariate analysis, compared with patients with increasing CEA, patients with CEA flare had a significantly better ORR [I versus F: 11% versus 73%; risk ratio (RR): 27.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.55–81.88; P < 0.001], PFS (median 3.1 versus 8.3 months; RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.26–0.56; P < 0.001) and OS (median 10.9 versus 17.7 months; RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34–0.82; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Compared with patients with rising CEA, flare was an independent favourable predictive and prognostic factor for tumour response and survival.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^1129UY7D]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the serum and the tumour tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is the most commonly used tumour marker for the diagnosis and evaluation of prognosis or recurrence after treatment, but the role remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic value of CEA both in serum and tumour tissue in CRC.

Method

A total of 173 patients with CRC in stages I-III were retrospectively assessed with the endpoint of recurrence or metastasis after curative operation. CEA was assessed both in serum and tumour tissue.

Results

37.0% (64/173) patients had a high level of CEA in serum (S-CEA) while 39.3% (68/173) had high CEA in tumour tissue (T-CEA). There were no significant differences in clinico-pathological features between the low and high S-CEA or T-CEA groups. The high S-CEA group had a worse prognosis than the low S-CEA group but the difference was not significant. The high T-CEA group had a significantly poorer prognosis than the low T-CEA group (P = 0.028) in the univariate analysis. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the T-CEA was an independent prognosis factor in CRC. Because many factors would affect the concentration of S-CEA, there was no correlation between S-CEA and T-CEA directly.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that a high T-CEA concentration may be a useful and independent predictor for poor outcome after surgery in CRC patients. It may be stronger than a high preoperative serum CEA level.

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^112NMqoZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Clinical characteristics and serum levels of CEA and CA 19–9

The frequency distribution of the levels of CEA and CA 19–9 is shown in Fig. 2a, b, respectively. From 545 analysed patients, 96 (18%) had serum levels of CEA below 5 µg/L and 449 (82%) had elevated CEA levels (≥ 5 µg/L). Furthermore, 494 patients had detectable serum levels of CA 19–9 in their serum samples. Of these patients, 188 (38%) had a serum level of CA 19–9 below 35 kU/L and 306 (62%) had elevated CA 19–9 (≥ 35 kU/L). From 51 patients (9%), CA 19–9 was below the detection limit.

Fig. 2
Histograms. Distribution of serum level of (a) CEA (median: 36 µg/L; range: 0.5–32,916 µg/L) and (b) CA 19–9 (median 50 kU/L; range 5–185,991 kU/L). Fifty-one patients had undetectable levels of CA 19–9 in the serum

For both CEA and CA 19–9, elevated serum levels were associated with impaired baseline clinical patient characteristics, such as inferior WHO performance status, intact primary tumour, synchronous metastases, elevated ALP level, elevated platelet (> 400/nL) and white blood cell (> 10/nL) counts and elevated CRP (> 10 mg/L) (Supplementary Table 1). Elevated CA 19–9 was somewhat more frequent in patients with colon cancer as compared to rectal cancer, while there was no association between CEA level and origin of primary tumour. Furthermore, 33% and 71% of the patients with lung-only metastases had levels of CEA below 5 µg/L and CA 19–9 below 35 kU/L, respectively. No relationship between other metastatic sites and serum levels of CEA or CA 19–9 was observed.

In patients with elevated serum CA 19–9 (≥ 35 kU/L), the median was numerically higher in those with with BRAF -mutant tumours (853 kU/L) compared to those with RAS -mutant or RAS/BRAF wild-type tumours (336 and 254 kU/L, respectively). Furthermore, 8 of the 16 patients with an isolated elevated CA 19–9 (i.e. CEA not increased) had BRAF -mutant tumours. There was no difference in median CEA value between subgroups based on RAS or BRAF mutation status.

### Clinical validity of tissue carcinoembryonic antigen expression as ancillary to serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration in patients curatively resected for colorectal cancer [^113vHzCd]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Although serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is prognostic in colorectal cancer, the prognostic role of tumour CEA expression is unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the prognostic and surveillance roles of tissue CEA expression along with serum CEA concentration in patients curatively resected for colorectal cancer.

Method

Between January and December 2003, 294 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer were included in the study. Correlation of tissue CEA expression with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and elevated serum CEA concentration at tumour recurrence were analysed.

Results

Tissue CEA expression was positive in 215 patients (73.1%). CEA expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.537, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.065–6.042, P = 0.035] and DFS (HR = 3.090, 95% CI = 1.405–6.795, P = 0.005). Elevation of serum CEA at tumour recurrence was significantly lower in patients without than with tissue CEA expression (14.3 vs 57.6%, P = 0.045). Moreover, when patients were grouped according to a combination of serum CEA elevation and tissue CEA expression, those with tissue CEA expression and elevated serum CEA (group 3) had significantly poorer OS and DFS (P < 0.001 each) than those without CEA expression and elevated serum CEA (group 1) and those with either tissue CEA expression or elevated serum CEA (group 2). OS (P = 0.006) and DFS (P = 0.027) were both significantly greater in group 1 than in group 2.

Conclusion

Tissue CEA expression is a prognostic factor in patients with colorectal cancer. Analysis of tissue CEA expression may be helpful in determining the clinical utility of serial measurements of serum CEA as surveillance in patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^111Dx6bR]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

The results of this series suggest that the prognostic value of T-CEA concentration may be superior to that of preoperative S-CEA level. The disease-free survival time after surgery for patients with a high T-CEA concentration was significantly shorter in univariate analysis than those with a low T-CEA. Multivariate analysis also revealed that T-CEA status (high or low) was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. The hazard of recurrence and metastasis postoperatively in the high T-CEA group is 1.587 times compared with the low T-CEA group. It is coincident with the study of Nakagoe et al. We think that the prognostic value of T-CEA concentration may be more reliable than preoperative S-CEA levels. However, strict statistical process in a large number of patients is needed to clarify the issue.

In conclusion, our study suggests that a high T-CEA concentration may be a useful and independent predictor for poor outcome after surgery in CRC patients, and it may be stronger than a high preoperative serum CEA level.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^113raZpY]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

A surprising feature of all the above examples of targeted tumour delivery is that the choice of biomarker used is rarely justified in terms of its tumour sensitivity and specificity. The characteristics of suitable cancer biomarkers are that they must be highly expressed in a large majority of tumours and have low or no expression in normal tissue, encompassing the normal tissue from which the tumour is derived and – ideally – most or all normal adult tissues accessible to systemic delivery. Suitable molecules must also be located on the external facing surfaces of cancer cells so as to be accessible to systemically delivered recognition molecules. To our knowledge, expression of the most commonly used markers for colorectal cancer has never been rigorously evaluated in a well-defined cohort of cancer and normal tissue. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the four most commonly used markers for colorectal cancer, CEA, TAG-72, FR α, and EGFR, to define which is most suitable for in vivo tumour targeting.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^113Vc55q]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study is limited by its small size, small number of recurrences, and short follow-up. We defined ctDNA-detected recurrence as a true recurrence despite the lack of a mandate of a radiographic progression; however, our decision to proceed with such a definition was based on supporting evidence that persistent ctDNA positivity has been associated with recurrence in all patients in 2 studies. In addition, delayed recurrences have been seen in patients with colorectal cancer, although infrequently. Hence, the lack of radiographic recurrence, even at 5 years, in a patient with persistent ctDNA positivity does not preclude the presence of minimal residual disease or later recurrences. Nonetheless, all our patients with ctDNA-detected relapses did eventually experience radiographic recurrence and hence represent true-positive findings by radiographic criteria, adding further strength to our findings. Our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between measurement of CEA levels and ctDNA, as well as combined measurement of CEA levels and imaging, probably reflecting that our analysis is underpowered by the small sample size. Additional limitations include the heterogenous patient population by stage and treatment, which may limit the generalization of our data within different populations with colorectal cancer. Nonetheless, the correlation between low-burden lung recurrence and negative ctDNA findings is striking and calls for larger prospective studies to assess the sensitivity of ctDNA vs standard of care surveillance. Such studies should be standardized to include intensive surveillance approaches as supported by NCCN and ESMO guidelines.

### Relationship among circulating tumor cells, CEA and overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^116WEGCf]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We previously reported results of a prospective trial evaluating the significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This secondary analysis assessed the relationship of the CTC number with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and overall survival.

Patients and Methods

Patients with mCRC had CTCs measured at baseline and specific time points after the initiation of new therapy. Patients with a baseline CEA value ≥ 10 ng/ml and CEA measurements within ± 30 days of the CTC collection were included.

Results

We included 217 patients with mCRC who had a CEA value of ≥ 10 ng/ml. Increased baseline CEA was associated with shorter survival (15.8 versus 20.7 months, P = 0.012). Among all patients with a baseline CEA value of ≥ 25 ng/ml, patients with low baseline CTCs (< 3, n = 99) had longer survival than those with high CTCs (≥ 3, n = 58; 20.8 versus 11.7 months, P = 0.001). CTCs added prognostic information at the 3–5- and 6–12-week time points regardless of CEA. In a multivariate analysis, CTCs at baseline but not CEA independently predicted survival and both CTCs and CEA independently predicted survival at 6–12 weeks.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that both CEA and CTCs contribute prognostic information for patients with mCRC.

### Circulating biomarkers for therapeutic monitoring of anti-cancer agents [^114H3K6y]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Tumor Markers

Extensive efforts have been invested into identifying tumor markers with greater specificity in evaluating tumor burden and response to therapy. Biomarkers with variable clinical utility have been proposed, including those that attempt to recapitulate the tumor burden of cancers with certain histopathological origins.

Cancer Antigen 125

Bast et al first suggested CA 125 (MUC16) as a diagnostic marker of epithelial ovarian cancer in 1983. At present, CA 125 maintains a role in monitoring disease response and is recommended alongside imaging criteria for response assessment in relapsed ovarian cancer by the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup. Despite this, the use of CA 125 elevation as a threshold for initiating treatment before radiological disease recurrence has not been linked to an improvement in OS. Moreover, the sensitivity of CA 125 declines in heavily treated ovarian cancer that is resistant to platinum chemotherapy, reflecting a potential concerning dynamic change in test performance as cancer biology evolves.

Prostate-Specific Antigen

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease which is exclusively produced by prostatic epithelium and escapes into circulation in the setting of malignancy. Blood PSA levels are highly specific for disease recurrence and are also directly linked with survival outcomes in advanced disease. Serum PSA is routinely used to assess disease response in patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with either chemotherapy or androgen receptor axis-targeted treatment. Indeed, PSA is included in standard response assessment criteria in castrate-resistant prostate cancer put forth by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3. A notable exception to this would be prostate tumors with neuroendocrine features without significant PSA production.

Carcinoembryonic Antigen

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is an adhesion molecule involved in signal transduction within adenocarcinomas. Increased serum CEA levels have been described in breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, and ovarian malignancies but can also be observed in benign conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, cigarette smoking, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, liver disease, and alcohol consumption. Although CEA has a weak role as a screening tool for colorectal cancer (CRC), it has been validated as a prognostic biomarker and surrogate of disease burden pre-operatively for patients undergoing CRC resection, as well as a predictor of disease recurrence during follow-up. Stable CEA levels are associated with significantly improved PFS in patients with unresectable metastatic CRC.

### False-positive elevations of carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with a history of resected colorectal cancer [^113VCGLX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Routine monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels is standard in patients with resected colorectal cancer (CRC). The incidence of false-positives and the upper limits of false-positive elevations have not been previously well characterized. A search of medical records at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 728 patients who underwent an R0 resection of locoregional CRC between January 2003 and December 2012 and who had an increase in CEA level above the normal range after a normal perioperative CEA level. Of these, 358 had a false-positive elevation of CEA level, 335 had a true-positive elevation indicative of recurrent CRC, and 35 had a true-positive elevation indicative of the development of a new, non-CRC malignancy. Of those with false elevations, 111 had a single isolated CEA level elevation (median highest CEA level of 5.5 ng/mL) with no further abnormal measurements, whereas 247 had elevations on 2 or more readings, with a median highest level of 6.7 ng/mL. Of these 247 patients with confirmed false-positive CEA level elevations, only 5 (2%) had measurements greater than 15 ng/mL, and no confirmed elevation greater than 35 ng/mL was a false-positive. False-positive CEA test results in the range of 5 to 15 ng/mL are common. Confirmation of CEA elevation in this range before initiating imaging studies may be appropriate. False-positive results greater than 15 ng/mL are rare, and all confirmed CEA levels greater than 35 ng/mL were associated with cancer recurrence.

### The significance of preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the prediction of lymph node metastasis and prognosis in locally advanced gastric cancer: a retrospective analysis [^112cRm4L]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Since carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one of the most common tumour markers, is known to reflect the clinical tumour burden in GC, it might be helpful in detecting positive lymph nodes. However, there have been few reports on the prediction of LNM in LAGC using preoperative serum CEA. However, because early GC and LAGC are significantly different in terms of lymph node statue and survival, the predictive value of CEA for determining LNM may be low if the two stages are not separated. In addition, whether preoperative CEA levels can predict the survival of patients with GC is still controversial.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the predictive value of preoperative serum CEA for determining LNM, and to compare its sensitivity and specificity with those of imaging examination for detecting LNM, to explore the relationship between preoperative serum CEA and survival in patients with LAGC.

### Prediagnostic levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 242 in colorectal cancer: a matched case-control study [^112DSYT7]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the classical tumor marker for colorectal cancer. The main clinical utility is in monitoring patients with colorectal cancer. Like carcinoembryonic antigen, the plasma level of CA 242 is elevated in patients with colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and/or CA 242 were elevated before clinical diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

Methods

The Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort was linked to the Swedish National and Regional Cancer registries, and 124 prospective cases with colorectal cancer were identified. Two referents for each case were randomly selected and matched for gender, age, date of sampling, and fasting time. Plasma from the included patients was analyzed for carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 242 using specific immunoassays.

Results

An elevated level of carcinoembryonic antigen before diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of developing manifest colorectal cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 7.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1–29.1; P = 0.002). An elevated level of CA 242 was not significantly related to colorectal cancer risk. Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels were only seen in samples collected in the two-year time interval immediately before diagnosis. In this group, 30.4 percent of all plasma samples from cases were carcinoembryonic antigen-positive and 71.4 percent were future Dukes A or B cases. The specificity of the carcinoembryonic antigen test for identifying future colorectal cancer patients was 0.99 with a sensitivity of 0.12. For CA 242 the specificity was 0.92 and the sensitivity was 0.1.

Conclusions

Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels strongly indicate occult colorectal cancer. Although the specificity of the carcinoembryonic antigen test in its present form is high, the sensitivity is disappointingly low, prohibiting the use of the carcinoembryonic antigen test for mass screening.

### CA 19–9 as a marker in addition to CEA to monitor colorectal cancer [^115wLMnK]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the commonly used tumor marker in patients with colorectal cancer, and CA 19–9 might be an additional marker. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether CA 19–9 levels can be used to monitor the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer who had no elevated CEA levels. The secondary aim was to determine if preoperative increased levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were associated with mortality.

Materials and Methods

Two sets of data from patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, were included in a single-center study. First, patients with a minimum of 3 serial measurements of CA 19–9 and CEA tumor markers were related to the clinical course of their disease. Second, patients with preoperative levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were related to survival.

Results

In patients with colorectal cancer and 3 serial measurements of tumor markers, 7.3% had only increased CA 19–9 levels without increased CEA levels, and 55.4% of the patients had an increase of CA 19–9 and CEA levels. In the patients with available preoperative markers, patients with only an increase of CA 19–9 had a significantly decreased 5-year survival compared with patients with an increase of only CEA (P = 0.013).

Conclusion

CA 19–9 can be used as additional marker to follow the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer without an increase in CEA level. Patients with preoperative increased CA 19–9 level had a poorer 5-year survival than patients with preoperative increased CEA levels.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and other tumor markers in preoperative evaluation — key points are that routine laboratory bloodwork and a CEA level are part of the preoperative evaluation. The baseline CEA level before initiating elective treatment is prognostic of long-term survival and is used as a reference during posttherapy surveillance. Although CEA levels assessed at different time points during multimodality treatment can correlate with treatment response, CEA does not reliably predict pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of other tumor markers such as CA19–9 in the evaluation of patients with rectal cancer.

### Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 plus carcinoembryonic antigen for prognosis in colorectal cancer: an observational study [^116KzPQS]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a primary prognostic marker and can detect colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence; however, it has low sensitivity. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) can be used as a supplemental tumour marker along with CEA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative CA 19–9 added to CEA helped predict long-term prognosis and whether follow-up CA 19–9 added to CEA had additional benefits in diagnosing the recurrence of CRC.

Method

We retrospectively assessed patients who underwent surgery for primary CRC between January 2004 and December 2015 at Seoul National University Hospital. Data on demographics, preoperative and follow-up CEA and CA 19–9 levels, recurrence and survival were obtained and analysed with respect to tumour marker levels to ascertain their prognostic and diagnostic values.

Results

A total of 4972 and 1530 patients were included to analyse preoperative and follow-up tumour marker levels, respectively. The 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 72.2% ± 0.8%, 52.5% ± 2.2%, 55.5% ± 3.2% and 32.1% ± 2.3% in the normal CEA and CA 19–9, high CEA, high CA 19–9, and high CEA and high CA 19–9 groups, respectively (all P < 0.001). Patients whose elevated CEA or CA 19–9 levels reduced to normal levels had better survival outcomes than those with postoperatively elevated levels. Elevated follow-up CA 19–9 and CEA levels were related to higher incidences of distant metastasis (CA 19–9, 14.0% vs. 23.1%, P = 0.004; CEA, 12.6% vs. 30.1%, P < 0.001) but not to local recurrence. Combined follow-up CEA and CA 19–9 increased the sensitivity for recurrence to 31.4%, with a 5% difference from the sensitivity of CEA alone. In the subgroup with high preoperative CA 19–9 levels, sensitivity increased by 18.2% overall.

Conclusion

CA 19–9 is a valuable prognostic and diagnostic marker for CRC when used adjunctively with CEA and can be a supplementary marker with CEA to improve sensitivity, especially with elevated preoperative CA 19–9.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in medullary thyroid carcinoma — CEA is not a specific biomarker and measurement is not useful in the early diagnosis of MTC, but determination of serum CEA levels is useful for evaluating disease progression in patients with clinically evident MTC and for monitoring patients following thyroidectomy. In patients with MTC, simultaneous elevations of serum CEA and Cn indicate disease progression, and some patients with progressive disease have increasing CEA with stable or declining Cn; rarely, patients with advanced MTC have normal or low serum levels of both markers, including seven (0.83%) of 839 sporadic MTC patients, with prognosis ranging from intermediate-term survival (12.5 years) to death within 1.75 years after diagnosis.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^117PSNNw]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative assessment and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colon cancer — A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level should be obtained before elective surgery for colon cancer to establish a baseline value that is prognostic for recurrence and survival and to provide a reference value for use during surveillance; routine labs should include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a chemistry panel, and physical examination should include assessment for an abdominal mass or surgical scars. A multivariate analysis of more than 130,000 patients indicated that preoperative CEA is an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with stage I to III colon cancer, and patients with an elevated CEA had a 62% increase in the hazard of death compared with patients with a normal preoperative CEA, although the optimal cutoff value is not clear. In stage IV colorectal cancer, a decrease in CEA in response to treatment with chemotherapy has been associated with improved survival.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^114HnPMW]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mutation status of RAS and BRAF, as well as serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9), are biomarkers used in clinical management of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. This study aimed to examine the prognostic role of these biomarkers in a patient population that started first-line chemotherapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the NORDIC-VII study.

Methods

CEA and CA 19–9 were measured in serum samples from 545 patients obtained before the start of chemotherapy. Four hundred and ninety-four patients had detectable levels of carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9). RAS (exons 2–4) and BRAF (V600E) mutation status were available from 440 patients. Overall survival (OS) was estimated in patient groups defined by serum CEA or CA 19–9 levels using cut-off values of 5 µg/L and 35 kU/L, respectively, in the total population and in subgroups according to RAS and BRAF mutation status.

Results

For both CEA and CA 19–9, elevated serum levels were associated with reduced OS in adjusted analyses which included RAS and BRAF mutation status, baseline World Health Organization performance status, and levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-reactive protein. The negative prognostic information provided by an elevated CA 19–9 level was particularly marked in patients with BRAF mutation (hazard ratio = 4.35, interaction P = 0.003, in an adjusted model for OS).

Conclusions

High baseline serum concentrations of CEA and CA 19–9 provide independent information of impaired prognosis in mCRC. In patients with BRAF -mutant tumours, elevated serum CA 19–9 may identify a subgroup with highly aggressive disease and could contribute to improving therapeutic decisions.

### Clinical value of carcinoembryonic antigen… [^111YP2hh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Plasma carcinoembryonic antigen in nanograms per milliliter was assayed in 149 patients with benign and 567 patients with malignant disease. Elevated CEA level was a good indicator of malignant disease but a poor screening test for cancer because of the high false-negative rate. Degree of elevation of plasma CEA level correlated with incidence of metastatic disease in patients with colorectal, gastric, and breast carcinomas, but no correlation was seen between CEA levels and status of lymph nodes in patients with localized disease. Patients with localized colorectal cancer, but elevated CEA levels before resection, had a 2. 1-fold increase in the incidence of recurrence; however, this added to the prognostic value of Dukes' staging only when the CEA level remained elevated postoperatively.

In 87% of patients with colorectal cancer, the CEA level was elevated at the time of recurrence, but a therapeutic value of reexploration for unexplained CEA level elevation was not confirmed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of serum-carcinoembryonic antigen in recurrent colorectal cancer: a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis [^117TvWGm]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Serial measurements of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are frequently used in the follow-up after colorectal cancer (CRC), but its usefulness remains debatable. Choosing the appropriate cut-off point is crucial to the diagnostic accuracy (DA) of continuous test variables. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis is the appropriate statistical method for this purpose, but has not been applied in previous studies.

Methods

One hundred ninety-four consecutive patients surgically treated with curative intent for CRC between July 1996 and June 1999 had systematic follow-up for five years. Follow-up included imaging, coloscopy and serial CEA measurements. Complete data including CEA measurements were available from 153 patients. ROC analysis of CEA was done with regard to detection of recurrent disease.

Results

Depending on the chosen cut-off value of CEA, DA varied widely within the normal range (CEA ≤ 10 U/ml). CEA > 4 U/ml provided the highest sensitivity (0.78) and specificity (0.91), compared to a sensitivity and specificity at the upper normal range (CEA = 10 U/ml) of 0.51 and 0.99, respectively. Thirty-three patients (24%) developed recurrence. Among 11 (5%) asymptomatic patients diagnosed by elevated CEA levels, only two patients (1.5%) were amenable to secondary curative surgery. A threefold increase of CEA in an individual patient had the same DA as the best cut-off value (> 4 U/ml).

Conclusions

Diagnostic accuracy of CEA in follow-up after curative surgery for CRC is influenced by the chosen cut-off value. A threefold increase of CEA may indicate recurrent disease. The value of serial measurement of CEA was limited.

### Association between the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen and the risk of dementia [^113uQ6Kh]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

There is an ongoing debate about how cancer and dementia relate to each other, and whether their relation is biologically determined or caused by surveillance and survival bias. We aimed to circumvent these biases by determining the relation between the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the risk of dementia in 6,692 participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study. We found that higher levels of CEA were associated with a higher risk of dementia (HR per standard deviation increase in CEA = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04; 1.18). This finding may indicate that cancer and dementia are positively associated, but the mechanisms underlying the relation between CEA and dementia warrant further investigation.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^113dZ2zg]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Checking prognostic factors evaluated in relation to overall survival for their significance to relative survival is a way of recognising and separating what of the patients' fate depends strictly on cancer and what depends on the large number of comorbid conditions that increasingly affect the elderly. Since the age of the population is increasing and, moreover, the incidence of colorectal cancer rises with age, it is useful to adjust the overall survival of these cancer patients according to the expected mortality from all causes of death. The datum used for this purpose is the expected mortality in the general population with exactly the same age, sex and length of observation as for the group of patients. Note that by this method, sex and age are considered prognostic factors already present in the general population, as they undoubtedly are, and can be considered prognostic factors of the disease under investigation only if the role usually exerted on the general population is significantly altered. The relative survival obtained in this way is a very good estimate of the specific survival, moreover, achieved without the well-known difficulty of defining the exact causes of death in retrospective series. This investigation was limited to patients who underwent local radical resection of a colorectal tumour and all the data analysed were collected before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy (or follow-up, if no therapy had to be administered).

### Concordance of carcinoembryonic antigen ratio and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors as prognostic surrogate indicators of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with chemotherapy [^115HbY5r]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is widely used as a tumor marker in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to evaluate the role of the degree of change in CEA levels during the treatment period and found that the degree of change highly correlated with disease survival and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in evaluating therapy response.

Methods

A total of 447 metastatic CRC patients treated with surgery of the primary tumor followed by systemic therapy at a single center from the year 2000 through 2011 were reviewed. The degree of change in CEA levels was expressed as the CEA ratio (post-CEA/pre-CEA) and classified into four groups during the treatment period for further evaluation. The imaging change of the same population was also compared with the CEA ratio during the treatment period.

Results

The CEA ratio was significantly correlated with different chemotherapy regimens (p < 0.001), pre-treatment CEA level (p < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.006), and tumor differentiation (p = 0.018). CEA ratio and imaging change according to RECIST criteria were both correlated with overall survival (p < 0.001). These two methods for evaluating treatment response were highly correlated (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

CEA ratio was found to be a reliable prognostic factor in stage IV CRC, and was highly correlated with the imaging survey according to RECIST criteria. Further prospective studies are essential to validate these findings.

### Clinical usefulness of postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases [^11722fWu]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer with liver metastasis (CLM) has high postoperative recurrence rates; therefore, optimizing perioperative treatment is imperative. Postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) can aid in detecting minimal residual disease in colon cancer following curative resection. This study aimed to identify the potential role of serum CEA following liver resection in patients with CLM.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted at the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research from 2004 to 2018 and enrolled patients with CLM who underwent complete resection of primary tumors and CLM. Associations between perioperative CEA levels and characteristics of recurrence were investigated.

Results

Recurrence was detected during a median follow-up period of 90.1 months in 343 (54.2%) out of 633 analyzed patients. Patients in the postoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml group had a significantly higher recurrence rate (75.7% versus 50.0%, p < 0.01) and shorter time until recurrence (4.4 versus 36.9 months, p < 0.01) than those in the postoperative CEA level ≤ 5 ng/ml group. Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml was an independent predictor, with hazard ratios of 2.77 (p < 0.01) for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and 3.18 (p < 0.01) for overall survival (OS). Additionally, RFS was significantly shorter among patients in the postoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml group who did not have normalized CEA levels following adjuvant chemotherapy than among those in the normalized CEA group.

Conclusions

The postoperative and post-adjuvant chemotherapy CEA levels in the CEA level > 5 ng/ml group may be predictors of RFS and OS.

### Preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level as a predictive factor of recurrence after curative resection of colorectal cancer [^115EmYDK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the prognostic value of the preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

Patients and Methods

The study group comprised 638 patients. The optimal cutoff value for the preoperative serum CEA level was determined. Predictive factors of recurrence were evaluated using multivariate analyses. The relapse-free time was investigated according to the CEA level.

Results

All patients underwent potentially curative resection for CRC without distant metastasis, classified as stage I, II, or III. The optimal cutoff value for preoperative serum CEA level was 10 ng/ml. Elevated preoperative serum CEA level was observed in 92 patients. Multivariate analysis identified tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and preoperative serum CEA level as independent predictive factors of recurrence. The relapse-free survival between CEA levels > 10 ng/ml and < 10 ng/ml significantly differed in patients with stage II and III. However, there was no significant difference in relapse-free survival between CEA levels > 10 ng/ml and < 10 ng/ml in patients with stage I.

Conclusion

Preoperative serum CEA is a reliable predictive factor of recurrence after curative surgery in CRC patients and a useful indicator of the optimal treatment after resection, particularly for cases classified as stage II or stage III.

### Serum CEA and CA 15–3 as prognostic factors in primary breast cancer [^116EZ1mV]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

In the present study, we investigated the association of the serum levels of the tumour markers carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 15–3 with disease free survival and death from disease in 1046 women with breast cancer without metastases at the time of primary diagnosis in relation to age and the established prognostic factors tumour size, lymph node status, histological grading and hormone receptor status. We found that elevated pre-operative serum marker values were correlated with early relapse (cancer antigen 15–3; P = 0.0003) and death from disease (carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 15–3; P = 0.0001 both) in univariate analyses. By comparing pre- and post-operative values we found a decline in values post-surgery. In those patients where marker levels of carcinoembryonic antigen decreased more than 33%, a significantly higher risk for relapse and death from disease (both P = 0.0001) in univariate analyses was observed. In multivariate analysis this decrease of carcinoembryonic antigen proved to be an independent prognostic factor. The results for cancer antigen 15–3 were comparable to carcinoembryonic antigen in univariate analyses but showed no significance in multivariate analysis. In this study the post-operative decrease of the serum tumour marker carcinoembryonic antigen was a strong independent prognostic factor for disease free survival and death from disease in breast cancer patients.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^115VvXoM]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical importance of CEA is clear at whatever time it is assessed along the clinical course of patients with colorectal cancer, but the demonstration of it having a prognostic role also postoperatively would be interesting for deciding treatment strategies. Besides providing a serologic indication of how radical the resection has been, in addition to the mandatory microscopic inspections by the histopathologists – it could offer further information to guide the choice of subsequent treatment. This decisional step is becoming ever more critical given the large number of available adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with selective indications and different intensities and toxicities. Since the ultimate fate of the patients with colorectal cancer is related to three main factors (initial tumour stage, radicality of the surgical resection and effectiveness of adjuvant therapy – when necessary), the postoperative evaluation of the CEA level (after 5–6 weeks), in that it allows a reliable check of the last two factors, can be at least as important as the preoperative one. Thus, we fully agree with the proposal of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, which recommends the inclusion of CEA into the TNM classification (with the following suggested notations for any stage: CX, CEA not assessed; C0, CEA not elevated; and C1, CEA elevated). We only wonder whether the measurements of CEA for such a categorisation should be more properly performed at a suitable interval after surgery (we suggest 5–6 weeks) – instead of or in addition to before surgery.

In conclusion, our study of the relative survival in a population of patients who had undergone radical resection of colorectal cancer fully confirms the adequacy of the individual clinicopathological factors, which are the basis of the current Dukes', modified Astler–Coller and TNM staging classifications. The results presented offer a possible explanation for the conflicting reports on the prognostic role of age and, finally, show the true prognostic value – strictly related to cancer – of the CEA level, with particular emphasis on its postoperative assessment.

Clinical Question

What is the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at specific carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) thresholds for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer?

Bottom Line

To detect colorectal cancer recurrence, the sensitivity of CEA ranges from 68% for a threshold of 10 µg/L to 82% for a threshold of 2.5 µg/L and the specificity ranges from 97% for a threshold of 10 µg/L to 80% for a threshold of 2.5 µg/L.

### Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen and sarcoidosis masquerading as metastatic colon cancer [^113R8xuK]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

When patients with colorectal cancer are monitored after resection of primary or metastatic disease, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is usually an indicator of recurrent disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are often used to locate the site of recurrences when computed tomography scans do not show the presence of disease. This case highlights an important cause of a falsely elevated CEA with abnormal PET imaging.

### Conditional survival and the prognostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in oldest old with colorectal cancer [^114ZTApx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the clinical value of serum CEA levels and their implications on the diagnostic value of the conventional TNM staging system in the oldest-old patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

Methods

The recruited subjects were colorectal cancer patients aged 85 and older. The cutoff value for normal CEA level is 5 ng/mL. Patients with elevated CEA levels were categorized as stage C1, and those with normal CEA levels as stage C0. A number of Cox proportional hazard regression models were established to evaluate the prognosis of different prognostic factors with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to display the disparate prognostic impact of multiple clinicopathological factors with the log-rank test.

Results

A total of 17,359 oldest-old patients diagnosed with CRC were recruited from the SEER database. The conditional survival of oldest-old patients with CRC was dismal with a 1-year conditional survival of only 11%, 18%, and 30% for patients surviving 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Patients with stage C1 exhibited a 48.5% increased risk of CRC-specific mortality compared with stage C0 (HR = 1.485, 95%CI = 1.393–1.583, using stage C0 patients as the reference, P < 0.001). All the stage C0 patients indicated lower HRs relative to the corresponding stage C1 patients.

Conclusions

Dismal conditional survival of oldest-old patients with CRC should be given additional consideration. C stage influences the prognosis of oldest-old patients with CRC.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^116ngyqB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay (Signatera; Natera) has been marketed for use in the surveillance of resected colorectal cancer despite limited data supporting such practice.

Objective

To compare a ctDNA assay with standard radiographic imaging and measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, in the surveillance of resected colorectal cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, single-center cohort study evaluated surveillance strategies of ctDNA, imaging, and measurement of CEA levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer from September 1, 2019, to November 30, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA, imaging, measurement of CEA levels, and combination of imaging plus measurement of CEA levels in detecting a confirmed recurrence of colorectal disease. A confirmed recurrence was defined asa positivectDNA finding or a finding on imaging confirmed by biopsy, CEA level elevation, or subsequent tumor radiographic dynamics.

Results

A total of 48 patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study (28 men [58.3%]; median age, 60 [IQR, 34–85] years) and underwent surveillance by ctDNA, imaging, and measurement of CEA levels. Fifteen patients had disease recurrence during surveillance. Positive ctDNA findings confirmed disease recurrence in 8 patients; imaging, in 9 patients; CEA levels, in 3 patients; and combined imaging plus CEA levels, in 11 patients. Numerically, ctDNA did not perform better than imaging in detecting recurrence, with sensitivities of 53.3% (95% CI, 27.4%-77.7%) and 60.0% (95% CI, 32.9%-82.5%), respectively (P > .99). The combination of imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (sensitivity, 73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-91.1%]) had a numerical advantage compared with ctDNA in identifying recurrence (P = 0.55). In addition, no significant difference was noted among ctDNA (median, 14.3 months), imaging (median, 15.0 months), or imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (median, 15.0 months) in the time to identify disease recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide advantages as a surveillance strategy compared with standard imaging combined with CEA levels when performed per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^1152HPBS]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to verify through relative survival (an estimate of cancer-specific survival) the true prognostic factors of colorectal cancer. The study involved 506 patients who underwent locally radical resection. All the clinical, histological and laboratory parameters were prognostically analysed for both overall and relative survival. This latter was calculated from the expected survival of the general population with identical age, sex and calendar years of observation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to the proportional hazards model. Liver metastases, age, lymph node involvement and depth of bowel wall involvement were independent prognosticators of both overall and relative survival, whereas carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was predictive only of relative survival. Increasing age was unfavourably related to overall survival, but mildly protective with regard to relative survival. Three out of the five prognostic factors identified are the cornerstones of the current staging systems, and were confirmed as adequate by the analysis of relative survival. The results regarding age explain the conflicting findings so far obtained from studies considering overall survival only and advise against the adoption of absolute age limits in therapeutic protocols. Moreover, the prechemotherapy CEA level showed a high clinical value.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^115F3jE2]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The median length of the follow-up of all patients was 54.6 months (62.8 for those alive). The range was from 3 to 144 months. Figure 1 illustrates the survival observed in our series of patients, the survival expected in a corresponding general reference population and the relative survival of our patients, computed from the data of the first two curves. The difference between the observed and relative survivals is due to the approximately 12% of deaths expected to occur from causes other than colorectal cancer (observed/expected deaths: 217/27). Since the number and distribution along time of these expected deaths may be a confounding factor in the identification of truly prognostic determinants, we verified against the relative survival the results obtained for overall survival in both the univariate and multivariate analyses.

Table 2 shows the results of the univariate evaluation of the prognostic value of all the clinical and pathological factors considered in relation to both the survival parameters. Most of the factors that are significantly related to overall survival are also related to relative survival, though with considerable differences. The analysis against relative survival seems to reveal an individual role – not emerging from the study of overall survival – for sex and neuroinvasion. Tumour size shows no prognostic value with regards to either survival parameter. The staging systems have the highest correlation with both overall and relative survival without a clear prevalence for one system over the others.

All the single factors (i.e. excluding the staging systems) that demonstrated a significant prognostic value at univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate evaluation. The final results of the stepwise selection of variables are reported in Table 3, all the other factors having been excluded step by step as not contributing significantly to the model. Three out of the five most powerful prognostic determinants are the main individual parameters, which are incorporated in the current staging classifications (depth of bowel wall involvement, number of regional lymph nodes involved and presence of liver metastases). The coefficient of the fourth factor, age, has an opposite sign according to whether overall or relative survival is considered. Indeed, age is directly correlated with overall survival and inversely with relative survival. The level of CEA is better related to survival than is the level of CA19–9, although it retains a clearly prognostic role only for relative survival (while it approaches statistical significance for overall survival).

### Conditional survival and the prognostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in oldest old with colorectal cancer [^116FszT7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) *Stat software, Version 8.3.8 (Surveillance Research Program,), patients meeting the strict criteria were screened from the SEER database. The latter was an authoritative and comprehensive population-based database containing information on virtually all patients with newly diagnosed malignant tumors, covering approximately 28% of the U.S. population.

The flow diagram of patient selection was shown in Fig. 1. Initially, CRC patients aged 85 or older were recruited from SEER 18 registries between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2015. In addition, only CRC patients with known CEA test levels were included in the present study. All cases for analyses were required to have 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM stage and positive histologic confirmation. Patients with unknown race records, non- adenocarcinoma histological profile and unknown tumor site were excluded from our analyses.

Flow diagram of patient selection

Conditional survival

Conditional survival was defined as the probability of survival and was calculated in the subset of patients who had survived a predefined period. This parameter could therefore provide insight into prognostic prediction and offer better guidance for clinical treatment. This is especially true for the oldest patients, who, due to their poor prognosis, complex functional status, and diminished ability to care for themselves, face important decisions about both their professional and personal lives. In addition, physicians could perform risk stratification based on conditional survival regarding the frequency and timing of follow-up.

C–TNM stage

The CEA level of rectal cancer was extracted from the SEER database and assessed before treatment, recorded as "CS Site-Specific Factor 1". The cutoff value for normal CEA levels is 5 ng/mL. Subsequently, patients with elevated CEA levels were categorized as stage C1, and those with normal CEA levels were categorized as stage C0. In addition each patient with the conventional AJCC TNM stage was assigned C stage, and the C-TNM stage was defined as the combination of the C and the AJCC TNM stages.

US Multi-Society Task Force — modalities within postoperative surveillance: Benefits of multimodality programs were most apparent in studies using frequent carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurements, while radiologic imaging was associated with improved overall mortality compared with no imaging in most analyses. In the FACS randomized controlled trial, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis increased surgical resections for recurrence with curative intent but did not improve survival compared with minimal follow-up; abnormal or more frequent surveillance colonoscopy has not been shown to improve survival.

### Prognostic significance of perioperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen in non-small cell lung cancer: analysis of 1, 000 consecutive resections for clinical stage I disease [^112Kscpn]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic implication of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has yet to be comprehensively analyzed since the reports available so far have comprised small patient populations. We evaluated perioperative CEA values with regard to surgical results in a large number of patients to clarify its merit.

Methods

We measured serum CEA levels before and after surgery in 1,000 consecutive patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who underwent resection of tumor. High CEA value was greater than 5.0 ng/mL.

Results

Three hundred and sixty-eight patients (36.8%) had high preoperative CEA levels. The CEA levels after surgery were normalized in 242 patients (24.2%) and persistently elevated in 126 patients (12.6%). High CEA levels were seen more frequently in patients with older age, male gender, larger size of tumor, incomplete resection, and advanced pathologic stage. Patients with a high preoperative CEA level had a poor survival. Among these patients, even worse survival was seen for those with a high postoperative CEA level. These prognostic trends were still observed for patients with pathologic stage I disease. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both preoperative and postoperative CEA levels were independent prognostic determinants (p = 0.0243 and p < 0.0001, respectively).

Conclusions

Perioperative measurement of serum CEA concentrations yields information valuable for detecting patients at high risk of poor survival. Normalization of CEA levels after surgery was a significant favorable prognostic sign in patients with an elevated CEA level before surgery. Even after apparently successful surgical therapy, patients with a high CEA level should be carefully followed up, and might represent a suitable target for neoadjuvant clinical trials.

### Prognostic value of postoperative CEA clearance in rectal cancer patients with high preoperative CEA levels [^111KTBmd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The major prognostic determinant of colorectal cancer (CRC) is the pathologic stage of the tumor. Since 1987, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) have proposed a worldwide categorization of cancer staging based on localized tumor invasion depth, nodal involvement, and the status of metastasis (TNM). However, a recent analysis has suggested that CRC is heterogeneous in survival patterns even within staging categories. Thus, there have been many efforts to determine the prognostic significance of subgroup stratification in staging patients with node-positive CRC, including molecular and biochemical markers.–However, the validity of those markers remains controversial and their clinical application is limited due to their complexity, the difficulties of standardization, and the cost of measurement. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most widely used and readily available tumor marker for the management of CRC and quantitative measurements of serum CEA can be performed easily and cost effectively. Many clinical scientists have evaluated the kinetic patterns of tumor markers as prognostic variables and have discovered that there are characteristic patterns of exponential changes in the tumor marker levels after surgical resection or tumor recurrence.

In this study, we assessed the pattern of serum CEA clearance after radical colectomy by evaluating the postoperative CEA levels to determine its potential application as a surrogate maker for predicting cancer-specific mortality.

### Serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in surgically resected clinical stage I patients with non-small cell lung cancer [^116Ytd54]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There is little general agreement concerning the effectiveness of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a prognostic indicator for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in clinical stage I patients. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the relationship between serum CEA level and survival.

Methods

We assessed 297 consecutive patients with clinical stage I NSCLC who underwent surgical resection at Toneyama National Hospital from 1985 to 1998. Serum CEA levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit with the upper limit of normal defined as 7.0 ng/mL based on the 95% specificity level for benign lung disease, in our hospital.

Results

There were 56 (19%) patients with serum CEA greater than 7.0 ng/mL. The high CEA group had a median survival time of 50 months and a 5-year survival rate of 49% compared with a 5-year survival rate of 72% (p < 0.0001) for the normal CEA group (n = 241). Patients with postoperatively high CEA levels (n = 15) had the worse prognosis (median survival time 35 months, and 5-year survival 18%) compared with patients whose levels returned to normal (n = 41, median survival time 8.8 months, and 5-year survival 68%; p = 0.01). These differences were also observed in patients with pathologic stage I or II tumors but not in those with pathologic stage III or IV tumors.

Conclusions

Serum CEA level is a useful predictor of survival for patients with clinical stage I NSCLC, and a persistently high CEA level after surgery is an especially strong indicator of a very poor prognosis.

### Preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level is a prognostic factor in women with early non-small-cell lung cancer [^114u7phE]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the markers evaluated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The significance of the preoperative serum CEA level in female patients with NSCLC is seldom discussed. In this study, we conducted a retrospective review to investigate the prognostic significance of the preoperative CEA level in female patients with stage I NSCLC.

Methods

In this study, we looked at 163 female patients with stage I NSCLC. Patient charts were reviewed to collect patient data, including the age of the patient, tumor location, tumor size, visceral pleural invasion, the stage of disease, and the preoperative serum CEA level. The cutoff value of serum CEA level was 6.0 ng/mL. The significance of preoperative CEA level in the prognosis of female patients with stage I NSCLC was evaluated.

Results

Among the 163 female patients with stage I NSCLC, 47 patients (28.8%) had abnormal preoperative serum CEA level (> 6 ng/mL). Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and bronchoalveolar carcinoma accounted for 83.4% of these 163 female patients. In-hospital mortality was encountered in 1 patient. Univariate analysis of survival in the other 162 female patients with stage I NSCLC showed that age, stage, tumor size, and preoperative CEA level were prognostic factors. Visceral pleural invasion had no impact on the prognosis of these patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size and preoperative CEA level were independent prognostic factors in female patients with stage I NSCLC.

Conclusions

Preoperative serum CEA level and tumor size are independent prognostic factors in female patients with stage I NSCLC. In contrast, visceral pleural invasion was not associated with the prognosis. Importantly, these results suggest that female patients with abnormally high preoperative CEA level and tumor size larger than 3 cm may need a thorough preoperative evaluation and careful postoperative follow-up to rule out occult metastasis of early NSCLC.

### Serum carcinoembryonic antigen trends for diagnosing colorectal cancer recurrence in the FACS randomized clinical trial [^113ee2Kt]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most guidelines recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection for primary colorectal cancer are followed up for 5 years with regular blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tests to trigger further investigation for recurrence. However, CEA may miss recurrences, or patients may have false alarms and undergo unnecessary investigation.

Methods

The diagnostic accuracy of trends in CEA measurements for recurrent colorectal cancer, taken as part of the FACS (Follow-up After Colorectal Surgery) trial (2003–2014), were analysed. Investigation to detect recurrence was triggered by clinical symptoms, scheduled CT or colonoscopy, or a CEA level of at least 7 μg/l above baseline. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CEA trends with single measurements. CEA trends were estimated using linear regression.

Results

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CEA trend was at least 0·820 across all 5 years of follow-up. In comparison, the AUCs for single measurements ranged from 0·623 to 0·749. Improvement was most marked at the end of the first year of follow-up, with the AUC increasing from 0·623 (95 per cent c.i. 0·509 to 0·736) to 0·880 (0·814 to 0·947). However, no individual trend threshold achieved a sensitivity above 70 per cent (30 per cent missed recurrences).

Conclusion

Interpreting trends in CEA measurements instead of single CEA test results improves diagnostic accuracy for recurrence, but not sufficiently to warrant it being used as a single surveillance strategy to trigger further investigation. In the absence of a more accurate biomarker, monitoring trends in CEA should be combined with clinical, endoscopic and imaging surveillance for improved accuracy.

### Elevated preoperative CEA is associated with worse survival in stage I-III rectal cancer patients [^112va1Sz]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the malignancy with the fourth highest prevalence among females and males in the Western world with a lifetime risk of 1 in 20 persons. Among colorectal cancer patients, about 30% have a cancer of the rectum. Currently, the most important prognostic factor determining treatment strategy and outcomes in rectal cancer patients is tumour stage; however, the sole use of tumour stage to predict prognosis is imperfect.

Before rectal cancer resection, the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest routine measurement of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), mainly for monitoring postoperative surveillance. However, there is persistent debate about the impact of an increased preoperative CEA as an independent predictive tumour marker in patients with rectal cancer.

Over 40 years ago, CEA was first described by Gold and Freedman and was subsequently identified as a prognostic tumour marker for colorectal cancer. Since then, postoperative measurement of CEA is an established tool in the follow-up surveillance of colorectal cancer patients. Increased early postoperative CEA levels are often a sign of remaining cancer tissue, while a later increase is suggestive for cancer recurrence. Both, early and late increased postoperative CEA levels are associated with decreased survival. However, it is unknown whether elevated preoperative CEA levels among rectal cancer patients represents an independent prognostic marker for overall survival.

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate whether an elevated preoperative CEA level represents an independent prognostic factor in a sample of exclusively rectal cancer patients. The necessity of a focused analysis on a homogenous sample of rectal cancer patients is accentuated as current curative treatment strategies substantially differ between colon and rectal cancer. To increase statistical power and to further elaborate the possible prognostic impact of CEA in a large cohort of exclusively stage I–III rectal cancer patients, both Cox proportional hazard regression analyses as well as propensity-scoring methods were applied.

### Characteristics of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules and their relationship to cancer [^114hdmFw]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM), such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the oncofetal glycoprotein family, are tumor markers. The CEACAMs consist of 12 different human CEACAMs and 5 different murine CEACAMs. The CEACAM family of proteins participates in multiple biological processes that include the immune response, angiogenesis, and cancer. CEACAMs play a significant role in cancer initiation and development. Increasing evidence suggests that family members may be new cancer biomarkers and targets in that CEACEAMs tend to be aberrantly expressed and therefore may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic importance. This review systematically summarizes the biogenesis, biological properties, and functions of CEACAMs, with a focus on their relationship with cancer and potential clinical application. As our knowledge of the relationships among CEACAMs and cancer increases, and as our understanding of the involved molecular mechanisms improves, new therapeutic strategies will evolve for cancer prevention and treatment of patients with cancer.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^113s9QGP]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Figure 2 illustrates the two different curves of the hazard rate by age drawn from the coefficients of the multivariate analysis related to either overall or relative survival. Both these curves are an expression of the individual role of age when computed multivariately, that is, after consideration of the other factors important for survival (they are not crude curves of observed hazards). It is clear that the role exerted by age on relative survival is much weaker – although still statistically significant – than that on overall survival, but shows a clear trend to decrease in the elderly, in contrast with the marked increase with respect to overall survival.

Figure 3, 4 and 5 illustrate the possible integration of CEA levels into one of the current staging systems (TNM). The survival of the 189 patients of this series presenting with TNM stage II (A+B), of the 176 with stage III (A+B+C) and of the 125 stage IV patients can be further split according to whether prechemotherapy levels of CEA were ⩾ or < 10 ng mL −1. The choice of testing the concentration of 10 ng mL −1 as a potential prognostic discriminant was made for mere illustrative purposes (the analysis of Table 3 does not indicate any distinct threshold level as most suitable for clinical use, but suggests that the prognostic value of postoperative CEA is more probably related to the whole distribution of its levels).

### Prognostic significance of postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with completely resected pathological-stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^116Pn2ge]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In many clinical practices, serum tumor markers are easily and reproducibly evaluated. Measurement of tumor markers in patients with malignancies enables us to diagnose, quantitatively assess cancer cells, predict survival, and monitor the effects of treatment.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the most commonly used tumor markers in gastrointestinal and lung cancers. Many reports have already described the significant correlation of preoperative CEA levels with prognosis in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, serum CEA levels are known to be affected by the rate of CEA elimination from circulating blood determined by renal function and smoking status.

From this perspective, postoperative CEA levels might be a more accurate prognostic factor than preoperative CEA levels, because the former is less affected by preoperative smoking status. Dent et al. initially reported high values of postoperative CEA levels. Subsequent reports demonstrated that high postoperative CEA levels predicted recurrence and prognosis in NSCLC patients. Until date, however, there are no clear recommendations for regular perioperative measurements of serum CEA levels for lung cancer in any guidelines.

We conducted a retrospective study based on a single institution to evaluate the prognostic importance of perioperative serum CEA levels in patients with completely resected pathological-stage I NSCLC.

Colon cancer — PET/CT for elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with negative, good-quality CT scans: Panel opinion was divided on the usefulness of PET/CT in this scenario. A systematic review and meta-analysis found 11 studies (510 patients), with pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting tumor recurrence of 94.1% (95% CI, 89.4–97.1) and 77.2% (95% CI, 66.4–85.9), respectively; an analysis of 88 patients under surveillance with elevated CEA and normal or equivocal conventional imaging reported PET/CT sensitivity 88% and specificity 88% for detecting recurrences. Use of PET/CT scans in this scenario is permissible within these guidelines, and the Panel does not recommend a so-called blind or CEA-directed laparotomy or laparoscopy when the workup for an increased CEA level is negative, nor does it recommend use of anti-CEA-radiolabeled scintigraphy.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111ssa1N]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Colon cancer — carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) surveillance after R0 resection: CEA follow-up is described as every 3 months until either disease is identified or CEA level stabilizes or declines. Approximately half of elevations were false positives, mostly 5 to 15 ng/mL; false-positive results > 15 ng/mL were rare, and all results > 35 ng/mL represented true positives. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of CEA at a cutoff of 10 ng/mL were 68% (95% CI, 53–79) and 97% (95% CI, 90–99), respectively. In the first 2 years post-resection, a CEA cutoff of 10 ng/mL is estimated to detect 20 recurrences, miss 10 recurrences, and result in 29 false positives.

### The significance of preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the prediction of lymph node metastasis and prognosis in locally advanced gastric cancer: a retrospective analysis [^114Yoiki]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In this study, we aimed to investigate the preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the diagnosis of positive lymph node metastasis (LNM), and to evaluated the relationship between CEA and survival in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC).

Methods

The significance of the preoperative serum CEA level for the diagnose of LAGC and prediction of LNM was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The areas under the ROC of CEA were compared with those of other tumor markers or imaging examination including CT and MRI. Logistic regression was utilized to identify the risk factors predicting positive LNM. Independent prognosis factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses.

Results

The ROC curves showed that the AUCs of CEA, CA199, and CA125 for diagnosing LAGC were 0.727, 0.594, and 0.566. When used to predict LNM, the AUC of CEA, CA199 and CA125 were 0.696, 0.531, and 0.588. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum CEA were significantly associated with positive LNM. On combining imaging examination with CEA, the sensitivity and specificity were 85.3 and 79.4%, respectively, with the AUC equal to 0.853. The combination of CEA and imaging examination preformed the highest levels of AUC and sensitivity for diagnosing LNM, which is significantly higher than using either of them alone. Although patients with abnormal CEA have a poor prognosis, two models of multivariate analysis showed that CEA was not the independent prognosis factor for survival.

Conclusions

CEA can be used to diagnose gastric cancer and determine whether it has LNM. Moreover, combined with CEA could improve the diagnostic sensitivity of imaging examination for lymph node involvement.

### Negative serum carcinoembryonic antigen has insufficient accuracy for excluding recurrence from patients with dukes C colorectal cancer: analysis with likelihood ratio and posttest probability in a follow-up study [^115rQExd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to determine the efficacy of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring for screening patients with colorectal cancer by using posttest probability of recurrence.

Methods

For this study, 348 (preoperative serum CEA level elevated: CEA+, n = 119; or normal: CEA-, n = 229) patients who had undergone potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer were enrolled. After five-year follow-up with measurements of serum CEA levels and imaging workup, posttest probabilities of recurrence were calculated.

Results

Recurrence was observed in 39 percent of CEA+ patients and 30 percent in CEA- patients, and CEA levels were elevated in 33.3 percent of CEA+ patients and 17.5 percent of CEA- patients. With obtained sensitivity (68.4 percent, CEA+; 41 percent, CEA-), specificity (83 percent, CEA+; 91 percent, CEA-) and likelihood ratio (test positive: 4.0, CEA+; 4.4, CEA-; and test negative: 0.38, CEA+; 0.66, CEA-), posttest probability given the presence of CEA elevation in the CEA+ and CEA- was 72.2 and 65.5 percent, respectively, and that given the absence of CEA elevation was 20 and 22.2 percent, respectively.

Conclusions

Whereas postoperative CEA elevation indicates recurrence with high probability, a normal postoperative CEA is not useful for excluding the probability of recurrence.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen as an independent prognostic factor of recurrence and survival in patients resected for colorectal liver metastases: a systematic review [^11335ety]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We attempted to answer the question of whether serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen provide prognostic information, in terms of survival, in patients resected for colorectal liver metastases, independently of that provided by other commonly used radioclinical and pathologic factors.

Method

We performed a systematic review, without meta-analysis, of the biomedical literature using the methodology recommended by the Committee on Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine.

Results

Despite the absence of sufficient details about the methods used to measure serum carcinoembryonic antigen in the 14 studies reviewed, strong arguments exist to include preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen measurements in future trials on the subject. In particular, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was found to be significant in the two studies with the greatest number of patients having a preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen assay, in the four studies with the most recent series of patients, in the study in which preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was used as a continuous variable, and in the study in which preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was used in terms of doubling time. Postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was found to have a prognostic significance in the only two studies that evaluated this variable.

Conclusion

Taking into account the possible reasons for disagreements regarding carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value between the 14 studies reviewed, we propose some recommendations to improve the reproducibility and the quality of future studies in this field. In particular, we stress the need for a higher degree of multidisciplinary collaboration in clinical trials.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^115KsWqi]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Carcinoembryonic antigen was first described in 1965 by Gold and Freedman, when they identified an antigen that was present in both fetal colon and colon adenocarcinoma but that was absent from the healthy adult colon, hence its name, carcinoembryonic antigen. Subsequent work showed that CEA was also present in certain healthy tissues, although concentrations in tumours were on average 60-fold higher than in the nonmalignant tissues. Now CEA gene is classified as a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family.

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the most widely used tumour marker worldwide and certainly the most frequently used marker in CRC. It could be detected and measured both in serum and in CRC tissue. The prognostic role of increased CEA level in serum and tumour tissue of CRC patients remains unknown.

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^1151kzY7]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and 40–50% of patients with CRC will develop distant metastases. Systemic therapy is the main treatment option for metastatic CRC (mCRC), and better treatment during the past decades has resulted in improved survival. However, mCRC is a heterogeneous disease, and selecting patients for optimal treatment is a challenge. Many factors determine the outcome. Development of robust and easily available biomarkers may help to individualise treatment.

Mutations in RAS (exons 2–4) and particularly BRAF (V600E) in the tumour cells are associated with impaired prognosis, – and mutation status is routinely used in the clinical management of patients with mCRC. About 50% of the patients have RAS mutations which predict lack of effect from systemic treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies. The activating BRAF (V600E) mutation is found in 5–20% of the tumours in mCRC patient cohorts.,

Assays of certain glycoproteins and carbohydrates expressed by cancer cells are used in the clinical management of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a glycoprotein belonging to a group of adhesion molecules, is produced in the epithelium of the large intestine and may be involved in malignancy.CEA has an established role as a biomarker in diagnosis, treatment and surveillance in CRC, and elevated serum levels of CEA are associated with inferior prognosis. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9), a tetrasaccharide carbohydrate also termed sialyl Lewis a, synthesised by gastrointestinal epithelium, is an established serum biomarker for monitoring treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. While there is some evidence of a relationship between elevated CA 19–9 levels and outcome in CRC, – its role in the management of patients with mCRC is so far unclear. Little is also known about the prognostic information that can be obtained from the serum levels of these two biomarkers when analysed in relation to tumour RAS and BRAF mutation status.

### Circulating tumour DNA for monitoring colorectal cancer-a prospective cohort study to assess relationship to tissue methylation, cancer characteristics and surgical resection [^115yWZ6j]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the developed world. Even though most CRC patients achieve remission with initial treatment, more than 25% will suffer recurrence. Therefore, to achieve early detection of recurrence, patients are usually entered into a follow-up regimen including regular blood testing, radiology and colonoscopy. The current blood biomarker used, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), has limited sensitivity and specificity for recurrence. Better blood markers for adequacy of initial therapy should aid identification of subjects at risk of recurrence or in need of extended initial therapy such as addition of or prolongation of chemotherapy. These markers should be present in all colorectal tumours regardless of the genetic alterations and should be absent from the blood following complete surgical resection of the tumour.

Somatic and epigenetic alterations of DNA are associated with CRC development, and a number of studies show that tumour-derived DNA can be detected in the cell-free fraction of blood (circulating tumour DNA, ctDNA). Detecting ctDNA by assaying for somatic mutations has the potential to inform response to therapy, existence of minimal residual disease and development of metastases. However, none of the common somatic mutations linked to CRC development occurs universally, and all appear with a low frequency. Furthermore, the mutation profile becomes more heterogeneous as the cancer evolves over time, whereas epigenetic markers are more stable during oncogenesis. Thus, aberrant DNA methylation, which occurs frequently in CRC might more reliably inform response to therapy and presence of residual disease.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^115pxS8H]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this prospective cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide definitive advantages as a surveillance strategy compared with standard imaging combined with measurement of CEA levels when performed per NCCN guidelines. The correlation between low-burden lung recurrence and negative ctDNA findings should be investigated further in larger prospective studies.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen-related tumor kinetics after eight weeks of chemotherapy is independently associated with overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^111JMsyt]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) best reduction after chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been reported as a prognostic factor. The study aims to evaluate whether serum CEA kinetics after 8 weeks of chemotherapy was prognostic in patients with mCRC.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients with mCRC, who received chemotherapy and for whom CEA determinations were available at baseline and after 8 weeks, was performed. A Cox model was built including all variables with a significant correlation with overall survival (OS) after bivariate analysis.

Results

Of 200 screened patients with mCRC, 83 were eligible and were enrolled for the analysis. Eighteen variables were tested in bivariate analysis with OS, and a Cox model was built up with 7 of them. Two of 5 CEA kinetics-related variables reported an independent effect on OS when included in the previous Cox model: the CEA response rate after 8 weeks (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–3.59) and the CEA-specific growth rate after 8 weeks (hazard ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–3.37).

Conclusions

After 8 weeks from the beginning of chemotherapy, CEA reduction rate of 50% and CEA-specific growth lower than -0.5%/day are effective prognostic factors among patients with high serum CEA levels and could become useful intermediate endpoints of clinical trials.

### Follow-up and surveillance of the patient with lung cancer after curative-intent therapy: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Dc8os]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for risk-stratified surveillance after curative therapy are discussed, noting uncertainty about testing intervals and that several biomarkers predict a higher risk for recurrence. In one study, postoperative serum levels of CEA ≤ 2.5 ng/mL and absence of vascular invasion predicted no recurrence of stage I lung adenocarcinoma; using a cutoff of 2.5 ng/mL, nine of 16 cases (56%) showed disease recurrence, whereas six of 120 cases (5%) showed recurrence at levels ≤ 2.5 ng/mL, suggesting less-intense surveillance for the low-CEA group. If results are replicated in additional studies, such a strategy might be recommended for selecting patients for more-intense follow-up as well as for selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.

NCCN Colon Cancer — Colorectal cancer surveillance states that surveillance recommendations can be found on COL-8, that long-term surveillance should be carefully managed with routine good medical care and monitoring, including cancer screening, routine health care, and preventive care, and that routine carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring and routine computed tomography (CT) scanning are not recommended beyond 5 years.

### Clinical importance of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels in gastric cancer [^11126P17]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Although serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 are commonly measured before surgery for gastric carcinoma, this clinical significance is not fully understood. We evaluated a total of 549 patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy. Levels of CEA and CA19–9 were measured preoperatively in all patients. We retrospectively analyzed correlations between CEA or CA19–9 and clinicopathologic features, and estimated the prognostic utility of the tumor markers by analyzing clinicopathologic characteristics of the carcinoma as a function of seropositivity or negativity of the antigens in combination or by raising the levels. The positivity rates of CEA (≥ 5 ng/mL) and CA19–9 (≥ 37 U/mL) were 19.5% and 18%, respectively. Serum CEA and CA19–9 positivity significantly correlated with depth of invasion, hepatic metastasis, and curativity. Forty-nine patients positive for both CEA and CA19–9 had significantly higher frequencies of lymph node metastasis, deeper invasion by the tumor, lower rates of curative resection (p < 0.01), and higher rates of hepatic metastasis (p < 0.05) than 377 patients with normal levels of CEA and CA19–9. Surgical outcomes of patients who were CEA- and CA19–9-positive were poorer than those of patients with normal CEA and CA19–9 levels (p < 0.01). Significant correlation was found between serum CEA and CA19–9 level (p < 0.001, r = 0.24). Doubling the threshold level of serum positivity to 10 ng/mL (CEA) and 74 U/mL (CA19–9) improved the prognostic value of these factors. However, multivariate analysis using Cox's hazards model revealed that only CEA positivity using the doubled threshold value (10 ng/mL) (p = 0.04, hazard ratio = 1.7), nodal involvement (p = 0.01, hazard ratio = 1.9), and depth of invasion (p = 0.02 hazard ratio = 1.5) significantly predicted prognosis. Carcinoembryonic antigen positivity using the doubled threshold level (10 ng/mL) was an important prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer.

### Role of carcinoembryonic antigen in the progression of colon cancer cells that express carbohydrate antigen [^112EeJSw]. Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been reported to promote the metastatic potential in some experimental tumors. Adhesion molecules are known to play an important role in the process of metastasis. Cytokines, including interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which are produced by Kupffer cells, induce endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules. As a result, the present study was designed to investigate whether the interaction between CEA and Kupffer cells accelerated the metastatic potential of tumors in the liver. Kupffer cells isolated from the liver of male BALB/c mice were cultured with CEA, either with or without the addition of a cytokine inhibitor. The levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were examined in a culture medium. An adhesion assay of colon cancer cell lines to human umbilical vein endothelial cells was also performed. When CEA was added to the Kupffer cell culture medium, cytokines were produced. Elevated levels of cytokines appeared to lead to increased rates of adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells. However, these phenomena were blocked by the addition of cytokine inhibitors. CEA stimulated Kupffer cells to produce cytokines. An elevated number of cytokines have been proven to promote the expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. These processes are therefore considered to contribute to the metastasis of malignant cells to the liver. These results suggest that cytokine inhibitors may therefore play an important role in the inhibition of hepatic metastasis.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules as surrogate markers for EGFR inhibitor sensitivity in human lung adenocarcinoma [^113isvx5]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been reported to provide therapeutic benefits to NSCLC patients associated with EGFR gene mutations and also to female and nonsmoker patients. The response rate to EGFR-TKI among EGFR gene mutation-positive NSCLC patients has been reported as > 70% and progression-free survival (PFS) as 9 to 10 months. Gefitinib did demonstrate a therapeutic effectiveness at least equivalent to docetaxel as the second-line chemotherapy in these patients with EGFR gene mutations. In addition, EGFR-TKI as the first-line therapy was reported to have extended the PFS of the EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer cases more significantly than the conventional chemotherapy. Erlotinib has also been reported to demonstrate a potential therapeutic benefit to the gefitinib-resistant EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer patients.

It has then become important to evaluate the potential surrogate markers of these EGFR-TKI agents in addition to the presence or absence of EGFR mutation(s) in order to increase the response rate to these agents. The first potential surrogate marker for primary resistance to EGFR-TKI reported in the literature was KRAS mutations in the EGFR mutations-negative cases. Acquired clinical resistance to EGFR-TKI was also documented in lung cancer patients, who had an EGFR mutation in exon 20 (T790M). In addition, the resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC cell lines was reported to be associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of these cell lines examined. Therefore, in this study, we first examined the effects of gefitinib or erlotinib on cell proliferation of the cell lines including those originated from lung adenocarcinoma (LADCA). We then evaluated gene profiles of EGFR-TKI-sensitive cells using a microarray analysis in order to further characterise the possible differential mRNA expression patterns among EGFR-TKI-sensitive cells. These results of microarray analysis led us to focus on carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a potential surrogate marker of EGFR-TKI sensitivity. However, it is also true that the biological or clinical significance of CEACAM family expression including CEA in NSCLC has not necessarily been well characterised. Therefore, we also examined the relationship between the expression of CEACAM family and clinicopathological factors including patient outcome, EGFR mutation, and EGFR-TKI response in human LADCA cases in our present study.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen interacts with TGF-β receptor and inhibits TGF-β signaling in colorectal cancers [^116ztTUu]. Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

As a tumor marker for colorectal cancers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) enhances the metastatic potential of cancer cells. CEA functions as an intercellular adhesion molecule and is upregulated in a wide variety of human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CEA mediates metastasis remain to be understood. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling regulates both tumor suppression and metastasis, and also contributes to the stimulation of CEA transcription and secretion in colorectal cancer cells. However, it remains unknown whether CEA, in turn, influences TGF-β functions and if a regulatory cross-talk exists between CEA and the TGF-β signaling pathway. Here, we report that CEA directly interacts with TGF-β receptor and inhibits TGF-β signaling. Targeting CEA with either CEA-specific antibody or siRNA rescues TGF-β response in colorectal cancer cell lines with elevated CEA, thereby restoring the inhibitory effects of TGF-β signaling on proliferation. CEA also enhances the survival of colorectal cancer cells in both local colonization and liver metastasis in animal study. Our study provides novel insights into the interaction between CEA and TGF-β signaling pathway and establishes a negative feedback loop in amplifying the progression of colon cancer cells to more invasive phenotypes. These findings offer new therapeutic opportunities to inhibit colorectal cancer cell proliferation by cotargeting CEA in promoting tumor-inhibitory action of the TGF-β pathway.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^115PgVdb]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background:

Colorectal cancer-specific biomarkers have been used as molecular targets for fluorescent intra-operative imaging, targeted PET/MRI, and selective cytotoxic drug delivery yet the selection of biomarkers used is rarely evidence-based. We evaluated sensitivities and specificites of four of the most commonly used markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumour-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), folate receptor- α (FR α) and Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Methods:

Marker expression was evaluated semi-quantitatively in matched mucosal and colorectal cancer tissues from 280 patients using immunohistochemistry (scores of 0–15). Matched positive and negative lymph nodes from 18 patients were also examined.

Results:

Markers were more highly expressed in tumour tissue than in matched normal tissue in 98.8%, 79.0%, 37.1% and 32.8% of cases for CEA, TAG-72, FR α and EGFR, respectively. Carcinoembryonic antigen showed the greatest differential expression, with tumours scoring a mean of 10.8 points higher than normal tissues (95% CI 10.31–11.21, P < 0.001). Similarly, CEA showed the greatest differential expression between positive and negative lymph nodes. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed CEA to have the best sensitivity (93.7%) and specificity (96.1%) for colorectal cancer detection.

Conclusion:

Carcinoembryonic antigen has the greatest potential to allow highly specific tumour imaging and drug delivery; future translational research should aim to exploit this.

### Conditional survival and the prognostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in oldest old with colorectal cancer [^113yLArD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide. As the average lifespan increases, the number of elderly patients (≥ 85 years old) with CRC has also increased. Patients aged 85 and above are often considered the oldest-old.

In the United States, the median age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer is 67 years, and 11.2% of new cases occur in individuals over the age of 84. The oldest-old category comprises 20.6% of the total deaths caused by CRC. The oldest-old is a specific population in CRC, characterized by multiple comorbidities with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is inadequate for accurately assessing the prognosis of CRC Therefore, there is a need for improvement of the current staging system.

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a highly glycosylated 201 kDa antigen expressed on the apical surface of colon epithelial cells and excreted through the intestinal cavity. CEA is the most widely used blood-based molecular marker for CRC and has been shown to play an important role in monitoring disease progression and predicting disease prognosis. The AJCC Colorectal Working Group recommended the inclusion of serum CEA levels (C stage) to complement and modify the anatomic TNM staging of CRC in early 2000.

The present study was a large population-based study designed to evaluate the clinical value of serum CEA levels and their impact on the diagnostic value of the conventional TNM staging system in the oldest-old patients with CRC.

### Blood CEA levels for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer [^116ZKwC6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Testing for carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in the blood is a recommended part of follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer following primary curative treatment. There is substantial clinical variation in the cut-off level applied to trigger further investigation.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic performance of different blood CEA levels in identifying people with colorectal cancer recurrence in order to inform clinical practice.

Search Methods

We conducted all searches to January 29 2014. We applied no language limits to the searches, and translated non-English manuscripts. We searched for relevant reviews in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION and DARE databases. We searched for primary studies (including conference abstracts) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Science Citation Index & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We identified ongoing studies by searching WHO ICTRP and the ASCO meeting library.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of post-resection colorectal cancer follow-up that compared CEA to a reference standard. We included studies only if we could extract 2 x 2 accuracy data. We excluded case-control studies, as the ratio of cases to controls is determined by the study design, making the data unsuitable for assessing test accuracy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (BDN, IP) assessed the quality of all articles independently, discussing any disagreements. Where we could not reach consensus, a third author (BS) acted as moderator. We assessed methodological quality against QUADAS-2 criteria. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data from all included studies as 2 x 2 tables. We conducted a bivariate meta-analysis. We used the xtmelogit command in Stata to produce the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and we also produced hierarchical summary ROC plots.

Main Results

In the 52 included studies, sensitivity ranged from 41% to 97% and specificity from 52% to 100%. In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 2.5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78% to 86%) and pooled specificity 80% (95% CI 59% to 92%). In the 23 studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 71% (95% CI 64% to 76%) and pooled specificity 88% (95% CI 84% to 92%). In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 10 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 68% (95% CI 53% to 79%) and pooled specificity 97% (95% CI 90% to 99%).

Authors' Conclusions

CEA is insufficiently sensitive to be used alone, even with a low threshold. It is therefore essential to augment CEA monitoring with another diagnostic modality in order to avoid missed cases. Trying to improve sensitivity by adopting a low threshold is a poor strategy because of the high numbers of false alarms generated. We therefore recommend monitoring for colorectal cancer recurrence with more than one diagnostic modality but applying the highest CEA cut-off assessed (10 µg/L).

### Is it reasonable to add preoperative serum level of CEA and CA19–9 to staging for colorectal cancer? [^114XYyUY]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) are the most common tumor markers for colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of adding them into the current staging system by analyzing their prognostic significance.

Materials and Methods

The study population was patients (n = 574, 67.1 ± 11.3 years old, 397 males) who received potentially curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma (stage I-III) between January 1994 and August 2002, including preoperative measurements of CEA and CA19–9. Clinicopathological characteristics and associated follow-up data were retrospectively collected by reviewing available medical charts. CEA higher or equal to 5 ng/ml was defined as abnormal (CEA+). The CA19–9 level was set at 37 U/ml (CA19–9+). Patients were further divided into four groups (1, 2, 3, 4) according to the results of these two markers (CEA/CA19–9: -/-, -/+, ±, and +/+). Survival was analyzed for AJCC staging, CEA (+) versus (-), CA19–9 (+) versus (-), and four groups.

Results

CEA and CA19–9 survival curves were not significantly different. However, the combined use of the two markers revealed a significant survival benefit (P = 0.035) of group 1 ("-" for both markers) over 4 ("+" for both) in stage II.

Conclusions

Patients with an elevated level of both CEA and CA19–9 in stage II of colorectal cancer have a significantly poorer prognosis than those with normal levels of these markers. We recommend adding both CEA and CA19–9 to the current staging system.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^114L3Zrs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is serial analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) associated with improved sensitivity and earlier detection of recurrence compared with standard imaging and evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in patients with resected colorectal cancer?

Findings

In this cohort study of 48 patients with resected colorectal cancer, 15 had confirmed disease recurrence by imaging, of whom only 8 had a concurrent positive ctDNA finding. The combination of imaging and CEA measurement had better sensitivity compared with ctDNA in identifying disease recurrence (73.3% vs 53.3%).

Meaning

The findings of this cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay provides no definitive advantage compared with standard imaging and CEA measurement in the surveillance of patients with resected colorectal cancer.

### Prognostic value of the postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level in colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis [^111jbo5F]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the commonly used preoperative biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC), but no meta-analysis has evaluated the findings of all recently published studies to determine whether its postoperative level can serve as a prognostic indicator.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search for eligible literature from the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases in October 2023. Studies that investigated the relationship between postoperative serum CEA levels and prognosis in CRC patients were included. Outcome indicators, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS), were analyzed using a fixed-effects or random-effects model. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effective values.

Results

This meta-analysis included 20 eligible studies involving 10,114 CRC patients from the East Asian and Western countries. A comprehensive analysis revealed that elevated postoperative CEA levels were associated with low OS (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.36–3.62, and p < 0.000), DFS (HR: 2.81, 95% CI: 2.01–3.94, and p < 0.000), and RFS/PFS (HR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.75–3.62, p < 0.000). A subgroup analysis by region, analysis type, distant metastasis, HR obtain method, sample size, postoperative measurement date, and study design demonstrated that the negative correlation observed between high serum CEA levels after surgery and poor prognosis was not significantly different between the subgroups.

Conclusion

When CEA levels are found to be elevated during postoperative follow-up, more active intervention measures should be implemented to further improve the patient's survival outcomes.

### A small rise in CEA is sensitive for recurrence after surgery for colorectal cancer [^113YMzMj]. Colorectal Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Rise in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) above normal limits can indicate recurrent colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a small rise in CEA, even within normal limits was a sensitive indicator of recurrence.

Method

150 patients aged 22–87 years were followed up for a mean of 27 months after colorectal surgery with CEA 3 and 6 monthly computerized tomography. We analysed whether a rise in CEA > 1 ng/ml correlated with recurrence of metastases.

Results

Forty-six of 139 patients in final analysis had recurrent disease. A rise in CEA > 1 had a predictive value of 74% for recurrence or metastases (sensitivity 80%, specificity 86%). These findings were similar whether or not the CEA was normal preoperatively.

Conclusion

If CEA is measured after surgery for colorectal cancer, a rise of > 1 in the patient's postoperative value is predictive for recurrence or metastases with an overall sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 86%. Previous studies have recognized the role of large rises in CEA in predicting recurrence but this study shows that small changes in CEA may be significant even if these levels would be traditionally within 'normal' limits.

### Transient carcinoembryonic antigen elevations during adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer reflect the burden of residual micrometastatic disease [^1175dxJM]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing is routinely used to monitor the progress of patients with advanced cancer on treatment, or else to detect relapse during follow-up, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although CEA levels have been reported to rise during adjuvant drug therapies, the mechanism of such 'surges' is not clear. This study was conducted to clarify the clinical significance of this phenomenon.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of CEA levels in 88 consecutive patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in our center: 39 patients with primary CRC and a comparison cohort of 49 patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. In the event of 2 serial CEA increases, endoscopic and/or imaging investigations were performed to exclude recurrence. Subset analyses were based on nodal status and primary tumor type.

Results

Primary resection was associated with significant CEA decline in patients with CRC but not in those with breast cancer. Forty-three patients (48.9%) experienced CEA fluctuations exceeding 0.5 ng/mL during adjuvant chemotherapy; CEA increases indicated true recurrence in 2 patients (4.7%). Adjuvant CEA surges occurred both more often and more extensively in disease associated with ≥ 4 positive nodes in patients with CRC but not in patients with breast cancer (P < .05).

Conclusion

Both the frequency and extent of CEA surges during adjuvant chemotherapy parallel the severity of preoperative nodal involvement in CRC but not in breast cancer, suggesting that such surges reflect tumorilytic effects on occult disease in patients with CRC only. However, whether these CEA surges predict survival that is inferior (ie, because of greater burden of residual disease) or superior (ie, because of greater tumorilytic efficacy) to that of stagematched 'nonsurge' patients, remains to be determined by larger, prospective CRC studies.

### Persistently high serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels after surgery indicate poor prognosis in patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer [^114rQdvL]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic significance of preoperative and postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.

Material and Methods

A retrospective review of the medical records of 257 patients with stage I lung cancer undergoing surgical resection was performed. The clinical data of each patient was collected for analysis including age, smoking habits, gender, preoperative and postoperative serum CEA levels, tumor diameter, histologic type, visceral pleural invasion, pathologic stage, and type of operation.

Results

Adenocarcinoma was more often associated with elevated preoperative CEA level compared with non-adenocarcinoma. Tumor histology, however, did not influence postoperative CEA levels. In the univariate analysis, age, serum CEA level, and pathologic stage were prognostic factors. Patients with normal preoperative serum CEA levels had better 5-y survival than patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels (71.1% versus 54.6%, P = 0.016). The patients with a persistently high serum CEA level after surgery had worst prognosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that older age (≥ 65) and persistently high serum CEA levels were independent significant prognostic factors in patients with stage I lung cancer.

Conclusions

Age (≥ 65 years) and preoperative and postoperative serum CEA levels are independent prognostic factors in patients with stage I lung cancer. Patients with a persistently high serum CEA level after surgery had worst survival, and may be good candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Association of preoperative and postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen and colon cancer outcome [^116HVHg2]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend measuring preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with colon cancer. Although persistently elevated CEA after surgery has been associated with increased risk for metastatic disease, prognostic significance of elevated preoperative CEA that normalized after resection is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether patients with elevated preoperative CEA that normalizes after colon cancer resection have a higher risk of recurrence than patients with normal preoperative CEA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted at a comprehensive cancer center. Consecutive patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon adenocarcinoma at the center from January 2007 to December 2014 were identified.

Exposures

Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts: normal preoperative CEA, elevated preoperative but normalized postoperative CEA, and elevated preoperative and postoperative CEA.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and hazard function curves over time were analyzed.

Results

A total of 1027 patients (461 [50.4%] male; median [IQR] age, 64 [53–75] years) were identified. Patients with normal preoperative CEA had 7.4% higher 3-year RFS (n = 715 [89.7%]) than the combined cohorts with elevated preoperative CEA (n = 312 [82.3%]) (P = 0.01) but had RFS similar to that of patients with normalized postoperative CEA (n = 142 [87.9%]) (P = 0.86). Patients with elevated postoperative CEA had 14.9% lower RFS (n = 57 [74.5%]) than the combined cohorts with normal postoperative CEA (n = 857 [89.4%]) (P = 0.001). The hazard function of recurrence for elevated postoperative CEA peaked earlier than for the other cohorts. Multivariate analyses confirmed that elevated postoperative CEA (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.5), but not normalized postoperative CEA (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.45–1.30), was independently associated with shorter RFS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated preoperative CEA that normalizes after resection is not an indicator of poor prognosis. Routine measurement of postoperative, rather than preoperative, CEA is warranted. Patients with elevated postoperative CEA are at increased risk for recurrence, especially within the first 12 months after surgery.
