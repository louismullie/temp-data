## Question

When should vte prophylaxis be initiated in post orthopedic surgery patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be initiated in postoperative orthopedic surgery patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and baseline VTE risk in major orthopedic surgery. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about timing, especially the ACCP 9th edition and ASH 2019. Next, I will examine the evidence comparing preoperative versus postoperative starts, including any meta-analyses. After that, I need to consider procedure-specific nuances for total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery. I should also review bleeding risk trade-offs and how they modify timing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, agent-specific recommendation and confirm the duration of prophylaxis, including extended therapy, to ensure completeness.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk. Major orthopedic surgery, including total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery, carries a high risk of symptomatic VTE without prophylaxis, on the order of roughly 4–5% over 35 days, with about 2.8% in the first 14 days and an additional 1.5% from days 15–35, which explains why both initiation and duration matter clinically [^3970bb58] [^49bd6a14].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline positions on timing. The ACCP 9th edition recommends starting pharmacologic prophylaxis either at least 12 hours preoperatively or at least 12 hours postoperatively, and explicitly advises against starting within 4 hours before or within 4 hours after surgery due to increased bleeding risk without added benefit, which is a Grade 1B recommendation for LMWH in major orthopedic surgery [^8b95ee92] [^8450bc30]. ASH 2019 suggests either early postoperative initiation within 12 hours or delayed initiation after 12 hours, acknowledging very low certainty and allowing flexibility based on bleeding risk and logistics, which aligns with a conditional recommendation rather than a strict mandate [^477d5d01] [^d378de3b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the comparative evidence on preoperative versus postoperative starts. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis across surgical populations found a nonstatistically significant trend toward fewer VTE events with preoperative initiation but a corresponding increase in bleeding, reinforcing that perioperative starts within 4 hours are unfavorable and that postoperative initiation is reasonable when bleeding risk is a concern [^d1e7c394]. Earlier indirect comparisons similarly concluded that deferring prophylaxis until after surgery does not markedly reduce efficacy, supporting the safety of postoperative starts when appropriately timed [^7fc3717c].

> I will now examine procedure-specific nuances. For total hip and knee arthroplasty, LMWH remains a preferred agent and can be started either 12+ hours preoperatively or 12+ hours postoperatively, with ACCP favoring LMWH over alternatives and suggesting the addition of mechanical prophylaxis during hospitalization, while ASH allows either early or delayed postoperative initiation based on bleeding risk and patient factors [^dfe05aea] [^477d5d01]. For hip fracture surgery, the same timing principle applies, and extended prophylaxis is particularly important given persistent risk, with ACCP recommending up to 35 days and multiple analyses supporting extended LMWH to reduce late VTE events [^22efcce8] [^5470a232].

> Wait, let me verify the bleeding risk trade-off because it directly influences timing. Starting within 4 hours before or after surgery increases major bleeding rates to about 5–7% compared with 1–3% when started at least 12 hours before or after, without improving VTE outcomes, which is why ACCP makes the strong recommendation to avoid perioperative windows [^8450bc30]. Fondaparinux started 6–8 hours after closure has been associated with more bleeding requiring reoperation versus LMWH, underscoring that earlier is not always better when bleeding risk is nontrivial [^3890dbcd].

> Let me consider agent-specific timing where labels differ. Rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily is approved to start 6–10 hours after surgery, which is earlier than the 12-hour ACCP minimum for LMWH, yet ACCP still cautions about bleeding signals with factor Xa inhibitors compared with LMWH in some trials, so I should balance this against patient-specific bleeding risk and the convenience of oral therapy [^b0db6d09] [^7aacbab7]. Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily is typically started 12–24 hours postoperatively in trials, which fits within the broader postoperative window endorsed by guidelines when bleeding risk is acceptable [^8f685106].

> I should double-check the role of mechanical prophylaxis and dual therapy. ACCP suggests adding intermittent pneumatic compression during the hospital stay when pharmacologic prophylaxis is used, and in patients at high bleeding risk, mechanical prophylaxis alone or no pharmacologic prophylaxis is reasonable, with portable, battery-powered devices and adherence targets of about 18 hours per day recommended when used [^dfe05aea] [^5f36f6e8]. This becomes especially relevant if pharmacologic prophylaxis must be delayed or held perioperatively.

> Next, I should review duration because timing without duration is incomplete. ACCP recommends a minimum of 10–14 days for all major orthopedic surgery and suggests extending prophylaxis to 35 days, particularly after total hip arthroplasty and hip fracture surgery, based on sustained post-discharge VTE risk and randomized data showing fewer symptomatic events with extended LMWH or oral agents without a clear increase in major bleeding [^22efcce8] [^5470a232]. ASH similarly supports extended pharmacologic prophylaxis after major surgery, again as a conditional recommendation given low certainty but favorable net clinical benefit in high-risk patients [^a0213384] [^9eee7eb1].

> But wait, what if the patient has very high bleeding risk or is undergoing emergent surgery with ongoing hemorrhage? In those scenarios, I should delay pharmacologic prophylaxis and rely on mechanical prophylaxis until hemostasis is secured, then initiate LMWH or an alternative agent as soon as bleeding risk becomes acceptable, ideally within 24–72 hours depending on the clinical context, while avoiding the 4-hour perioperative window when restarting [^f5e97a56] [^8b95ee92]. I need to ensure I document the rationale for delay and the plan to transition to pharmacologic prophylaxis once safe.

> Putting this together, my practical, reference-aligned approach is as follows. For most patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, start pharmacologic prophylaxis either at least 12 hours before surgery or at least 12 hours after surgery, and avoid starting within 4 hours before or after the procedure. Choose LMWH as a preferred agent when feasible, consider adding mechanical prophylaxis in the hospital, and extend prophylaxis to 35 days after total hip arthroplasty or hip fracture surgery, while individualizing the agent and timing based on bleeding risk, renal function, and patient preferences [^8b95ee92] [^dfe05aea] [^22efcce8]. If bleeding risk is high, prioritize mechanical prophylaxis and delay pharmacologic therapy until the risk is acceptable, documenting the plan to restart promptly to avoid prolonged exposure to high VTE risk [^f5e97a56].

---

Start VTE prophylaxis in post-orthopedic surgery patients **within 12–24 hours postoperatively** [^477d5d01] once hemostasis is secured, balancing thrombosis and bleeding risks [^d378de3b]. Preoperative initiation is not routinely recommended due to increased bleeding risk without added benefit [^d1e7c394] [^8450bc30]. For high VTE risk (e.g. hip fracture, multiple risk factors), **extend prophylaxis to 28–35 days** [^22efcce8] [^5470a232]; for low risk, 10–14 days is sufficient [^dfe05aea]. Use LMWH, fondaparinux, or DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) per patient-specific bleeding and renal risk [^dfe05aea] [^7aacbab7] [^8f685106]; add mechanical prophylaxis if pharmacologic therapy is delayed or contraindicated [^f5e97a56].

---

## Timing of initiation

- **Early postoperative initiation (within 12–24 hours)**: Recommended once adequate hemostasis is confirmed [^477d5d01]; this balances VTE prevention with bleeding risk [^d378de3b].

- **Preoperative initiation**: Generally not recommended due to increased bleeding risk without proven additional benefit [^d1e7c394] [^8450bc30].

- **Delayed initiation (> 24 hours)**: Consider only if bleeding risk is high or hemostasis is uncertain; otherwise, early initiation is preferred [^477d5d01].

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

- **Standard duration**: 10–14 days for most patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery (THA, TKA, HFS) [^dfe05aea].

- **Extended duration (28–35 days)**: Recommended for high-risk patients, such as those undergoing hip fracture surgery, or those with additional risk factors (e.g. obesity, malignancy, prior VTE) [^22efcce8] [^5470a232].

- **Individualized duration**: Based on patient-specific risk factors, surgical procedure, and bleeding risk [^4b986b95].

---

## Pharmacological agents

| **Agent** | **Timing** | **Dosage** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| LMWH (enoxaparin) | 12–24 h post-op | 40 mg SC daily | - First-line <br/> - Renal function <br/> - Bleeding risk [^dfe05aea] |
| Fondaparinux | 6–8 h post-op | 2.5 mg SC daily | - Bleeding risk <br/> - Renal function [^3890dbcd] |
| Apixaban | 12–24 h post-op | 2.5 mg PO BID | - Renal function <br/> - Bleeding risk [^8f685106] |
| Rivaroxaban | 6–10 h post-op | 10 mg PO daily | - Renal function <br/> - Bleeding risk [^7aacbab7] |
| Dabigatran | 1–4 h post-op | 220 mg PO daily | - Renal function <br/> - Bleeding risk [^591c0e23] |

---

## Mechanical prophylaxis

Use **intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC)** when pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed or contraindicated [^f5e97a56], and continue until pharmacologic prophylaxis is feasible [^25c58ea8]. Graduated compression stockings (GCS) may be used as adjuncts but are **less effective than IPC** [^1ddd982b].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Assess and monitor closely; adjust or delay pharmacologic prophylaxis as needed [^7438cc5c].

- **Renal impairment**: LMWH and fondaparinux require dose adjustment or alternative agents [^notfound].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, BMI, comorbidities, and mobility status influence risk and prophylaxis choice [^7438cc5c].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate prophylaxis**: Within 12–24 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is secured [^477d5d01].

- **Standard duration**: 10–14 days for most patients [^dfe05aea].

- **Extended duration**: 28–35 days for high-risk patients [^22efcce8].

- **Agent selection**: LMWH, fondaparinux, or DOACs based on patient-specific factors [^dfe05aea].

- **Mechanical prophylaxis**: Use when pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed or contraindicated [^f5e97a56].

---

VTE prophylaxis in post-orthopedic surgery patients should start **within 12–24 hours postoperatively** once hemostasis is secured, with duration individualized to risk and agent selection tailored to bleeding and renal risk.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis and extended duration — No PE was observed in the LMWH group compared with five of 1,014 in the placebo group, and symptomatic DVT was reduced by more than one-half (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26–0.82). Results failed to demonstrate or exclude an effect of LMWH on major bleeding (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.11–1.65) or on total mortality (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.08–1.95), although the only two deaths from VTE were in the placebo group. On the basis of high-quality evidence, extending thromboprophylaxis up to 35 days postoperation compared with 10 to 14 days will result in nine fewer symptomatic VTE per 1,000 without an appreciable increase in major bleeding.

### Should we follow the 9th ACCP guidelines for VTE prevention in surgical patients? [^5ff27252]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

The 9th edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines on antithrombotic therapy and prevention, includes relevant changes compared to previous versions. In the 9th ACCP, leadership of most chapters was given to methodologists who were familiar with the GRADE methodology. All topic panelists underwent a selection process paying particular attention to their financial and intellectual conflicts of interests. In the 9th ACCP guidelines, evidence has been explicitly presented in many evidence profiles and summary of evidence tables. In order to get a more balanced trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects of the alternative prevention and therapeutic interventions, there has been an increased emphasis on clinically relevant events, as opposed to previous surrogate asymptomatic outcomes. In addition, there has been a systematic review and survey on patient values and preferences for thrombotic and bleeding outcomes. As a result of the above changes, the strength of most recommendations has been downgraded compared to previous editions. The main changes regarding prevention on nonorthopedic surgical patients include the adoption of two risk assessment models. The only recommendation that has been upgraded is to extend prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for four weeks after abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery. A controversial modification in orthopedic patients is recommendation in favor of the use of aspirin after hip or knee arthroplasty. New oral anticoagulants are recommended, but LMWH are suggested as the preferred option. Extending pharmacological prophylaxis for up to 35days rather than 10-14days is now suggested for patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.

Results Of 1907 patients, VTE prophylaxis was used in 89. 3%; use was
93. 7% in each of the 3 orthopedic surgery groups and 75. 2% in the high-risk major abdominal surgery group. The percentage of patients receiving grade A therapy was highest in the hip replacement group vs the other groups. The proportion of cases that received some form of VTE prophylaxis during hospitalization was 89. 3%;
93. 7% in the orthopedic surgery groups received prophylaxis, compared with 75. 2% in the high-risk MAS group. However, the proportion of patients receiving VTE prophylaxis that met the study definition for grade A therapy varied from 45. 2% in the HFR group to
84. 3% in the THR group. In the orthopedic surgery groups, about two thirds of the patients received VTE prophylaxis when they were discharged to a skilled nursing home or rehabilitation hospital, with a higher percentage of TKR patients receiving therapies when sent to nursing homes. Of orthopedic patients sent home without health care assistance, the proportion of patients given VTE prophylactic therapy was also about two thirds for THR and TKR, but only one third for HFR. High-risk MAS patients were more often discharged to their homes without health care and without VTE prophylactic therapy, compared with the orthopedic surgery patients. In the high-risk MAS group, the percentage of patients discharged to their homes with VTE prophylaxis was 17. 2%. The percentage of high-risk MAS patients receiving VTE therapy when discharged to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility was also lower than that of orthopedic patients. Of 1907 patients who underwent 1 of these 4 surgical procedures, most received some form of VTE prophylaxis during hospitalization. The use of VTE prophylaxis in 93.

7% of the orthopedic surgery patients reflects the widespread awareness of the serious risk in these patients, but the risk appeared to be less appreciated in high-risk MAS patients, where
50. 3% received grade A VTE prophylaxis, 24. 8% received non–grade A prophylaxis, and
24. 8% received no prophylaxis at all.

Extended prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) after arthroplasty — observational data suggest that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) returns to the presurgical risk levels at about 3 months postoperation. Extending thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 to 14 days is now used often, and recent trials have included prophylaxis for > 30 days, particularly after THA. Three systematic reviews examined extended-use LMWH vs placebo from seven trials enrolling > 2,600 patients mainly after THA; one trial also included TKA patients. Most trials randomized patients at discharge (which occurred 6–14 days postoperation) to continue with LMWH vs placebo until postoperative days 27 to 35.

### Duration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after surgery [^940c85ee]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is indicated while in the hospital after major surgery. There is evidence that the prevalence of asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, detected by routine venography after major orthopedic surgery, is lower at hospital discharge in patients who have received 10 days rather than 5 days of prophylaxis. This observation supports the current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommendation for a minimum of 7 to 10 days of prophylaxis after hip and knee replacement, even if patients are discharged from the hospital within 7 days of surgery. As risk of VTE persists for up to 3 months after surgery, patients at high risk for postoperative VTE may benefit from extended prophylaxis (eg, an additional 3 weeks after the first 7 to 10 days). Extended prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduces the frequency of postdischarge VTE by approximately two thirds after hip replacement; however, the resultant absolute reduction in the frequency of fatal pulmonary embolism is small (ie, estimated at 1 per 2,500 patients). Indirect evidence suggests that, compared with LMWH, efficacy of extended prophylaxis after hip replacement is greater with fondaparinux, similar with warfarin, and less with aspirin. Extended prophylaxis is expected to be of less benefit after knee than after hip replacement. In keeping with current ACCP recommendations, at a minimum, extended prophylaxis should be used after major orthopedic surgery in patients who have additional risk factors for VTE (eg, previous VTE, cancer). If anticoagulant drug therapy is stopped after 7 to 10 days, an additional month of prophylaxis with aspirin should be considered.

### Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^3970bb58]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Major orthopedic surgery — estimated symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) risks by postoperative period and prophylaxis show that in the Initial Prophylaxis, Postoperative Days 0–14 window no prophylaxis VTE is 2.80% and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) VTE is 1.15%; in the Extended Prophylaxis, Postoperative Days 15–35 window no prophylaxis VTE is 1.50% and LMWH VTE is 0.65%; cumulatively over Postoperative Days 0–35 no prophylaxis VTE is 4.3% and LMWH VTE is 1.8%. The guideline estimated a combined 35-day untreated baseline risk for symptomatic VTE of 4.3% and characterized the immediate postoperative period as 1.5% (symptomatic deep vein thrombosis [DVT], 1%; pulmonary embolism [PE], 0.5%). Supporting out-of-hospital data include 1 of 1,107 (0.091%) symptomatic VTE up to postoperative day 39 after enoxaparin was stopped at an average of 12 days, and a pre-2003 placebo arm symptomatic VTE rate of 8/303 (2.64%).

### Timing of perioperative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis initiation and its effect on venous thromboembolism and bleeding outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d1e7c394]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative thromboprophylaxis guidelines offer conflicting recommendations on when to start thromboprophylaxis. As a result, there is considerable variation in clinical practice, which can lead to worse patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the start time of perioperative thromboprophylaxis with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding outcomes.

Study Design

Embase, Medline, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) databases were searched on October 23, 2020. Randomized controlled trials that evaluated VTE and/or bleeding among groups receiving the initial dose of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis at different times preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively were included. Only trials that randomized patients to the same medication among groups were eligible. Studies on any type of operation were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used. The review was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; CRD42019142079). The outcomes of interest were VTE and bleeding. Prespecified subgroup analyses of studies including orthopaedic and nonorthopaedic operations were performed.

Results

A total of 22 trials (n = 17,124 patients) met eligibility criteria. Pooled results showed a nonstatistically significant decrease in the rate of VTE with preoperative initiation of thromboprophylaxis compared with postoperative initiation (risk ratio 0.77; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.08; I² = 0%, n = 1,933). There was also a nonstatistically significant increase in the rate of bleeding with preoperative compared with postoperative initiation (risk ratio 1.17; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.46; I² = 35%, n = 2,752). Risk of bias was moderate. Heterogeneity between studies was low (I 2 = 0% to 35%).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis found a nonstatistically significant decrease in the rate of VTE and an increase in the rate of bleeding when thromboprophylaxis was initiated preoperatively compared with postoperatively.

ASH 2019 venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention in surgical patients — scope, risk context, and methods are outlined as follows: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are recognized postoperative complications, with surgery accounting for ∼25% of VTEs in communities and high-risk procedures including hip and knee arthroplasty, invasive neurosurgical procedures, and major vascular procedures; postoperative VTE often occurs in the days to weeks following hospital discharge, and risk assessment tools such as the Caprini score have been developed. The primary target population is patients hospitalized for major surgical procedures at risk for postoperative VTE, with target populations including surgery for cancer or noncancer-related procedures and patients hospitalized for major trauma included whether they underwent surgery or not. For prevention in the postoperative period, the panel recognized 2 major modalities — pharmacological anticoagulant prophylaxis and mechanical prophylaxis — and the panel developed and graded recommendations and assessed certainty using the GRADE approach, with patient engagement noted as Eight patient representatives participating in question prioritization and 1 participating in all remaining steps.

Values and preferences in major orthopedic surgery — both symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding are important, unwanted outcomes, and on balance the adverse consequences of a major postoperative bleeding event were approximately equal to those of symptomatic VTE; in developing recommendations, these were considered equivalent in their aversiveness or disutility.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^93da3229]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Role of low-dose LMWH as VTE prophylaxis in perioperative management — In patients who require perioperative interruption of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and are considered at high risk for post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE), the need to administer low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as VTE prophylaxis may be obviated once the VKA or DOAC is resumed. There may be circumstances when low-dose LMWH can be used in patients at high VTE risk; for example, those having abdominopelvic cancer surgery or hip or knee replacement surgery, and in such hospitalized patients, low-dose LMWH would be started, typically, 12 to 24 hours post-operatively and continued for 2 to 3 days while the VKA takes effect or until resumption of DOAC therapy. The administration of heparin bridging, particularly if only used pre-operatively, does not preclude the administration of post-operative low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily), including in patients at high risk for bleeding in whom post-operative therapeutic-dose LMWH bridging might be avoided. In patients who resume antiplatelet therapy after a surgery, the addition of low-dose LMWH can be justified in high VTE risk situations but is empiric and should consider the risk of bleeding.

LMWH versus dabigatran after THA/TKA — initial and extended prophylaxis: Four RCTs examined dabigatran in > 10,000 patients at doses of 220 and 150 mg taken orally once daily (usually started within 4 h postoperatively at half the dose) compared with enoxaparin (mainly at doses of 40 mg once daily, with one study using 30 mg bid that commenced 12 h postoperatively), with treatment durations from 10 to 15 days for TKA to 28 to 35 days for THA. The studies using the 220 mg dose failed to demonstrate or exclude a difference in symptomatic VTEs (PE: RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.52–2.85; DVT: RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.12–3.91) or major bleeding events (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.66–1.72), and point estimates of absolute differences were closely balanced to within one event per 1,000.

### Is extended-duration (post-hospital discharge) venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis safe and efficacious in high-risk surgery patients? A systematic review [^9228df75]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) persists beyond hospitalization in surgical patients, yet post-hospital discharge chemoprophylaxis regimens are not common. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the literature regarding extended-duration (post-hospital discharge) venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis and to determine whether it is warranted in high-risk surgical patients, as determined by its safety and efficacy.

Method

We searched four online databases for articles evaluating extended-duration (post-hospital discharge) VTE chemoprophylaxis regimens in surgical patients between the years January 2000 and February 2020. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used. GRADE methodology and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials were used to grade the quality of evidence and assess risk of bias.

Results

Nineteen studies with 10,544 patients were analyzed. The duration for extended-duration VTE chemoprophylaxis ranged from 7 to 42 days. In our study cohort, high-risk patients not prescribed extended-duration VTE chemoprophylaxis had a mean VTE incidence rate of 12.23%, while patients receiving 28–30 days of chemoprophylaxis had a mean VTE incidence rate of 4.37% (p = 0.006). The risk of bleeding events did not correlate with the duration of chemoprophylaxis.

Conclusion

Extended-duration VTE chemoprophylaxis in high-risk surgical patients decreased the incidence of thrombotic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding events. Further research is needed to establish guidelines for the optimal duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis in high-risk surgical patients.

Venous thromboembolism prevention after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) — LMWH vs rivaroxaban: Seven RCTs enrolling > 10,000 patients compared rivaroxaban 10 mg/d (started 6–8 h postoperatively) against enoxaparin 40 mg/d, with enoxaparin usually started the evening before surgery and continued 6 to 8 h postoperatively; two studies used 30 mg bid dosing started 12 h postoperation, and rivaroxaban was given for 10 to 15 days for TKA with one later THA trial treating patients for 31 to 39 days. Rivaroxaban reduced symptomatic DVT by > 50% (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20–0.83), with a trend toward increased major bleeding and bleeding requiring reoperation (major bleeding: RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.84–2.97; bleeding requiring reoperation: RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.86–4.83; combined: RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.94–3.17). The evidence summaries include an alternate major bleeding rate of 1.5% and state that the best estimates suggest that five fewer symptomatic DVT per 1,000 with rivaroxaban over LMWH will be offset by nine more major bleeding events; in summary, based on moderate-quality evidence, the possibility of increased major bleeding events and the availability of long-term safety data for LMWH makes LMWH more appealing than rivaroxaban.

Guideline limitations — evidence applicability and endpoints: Many studies date back decades with largely outdated means (eg, venography) to assess postoperative VTEs, while surgical practice has changed and innovations such as minimally invasive procedures, early mobilization, and regional anesthesia have emerged, yet it is uncertain whether such changes impact relative effectiveness; baseline VTE and bleeding risks were taken from contemporary large cohort studies when available. Most surgery prophylaxis studies used asymptomatic DVTs detected by sensitive screening tests as primary outcomes, symptomatic DVT reporting may have been influenced by diagnostic suspicion bias, and modeling was required to estimate symptomatic DVT rates when only asymptomatic events were reported. The panel noted most evidence on mechanical prophylaxis comes from orthopedic literature and that some questions (including urological and gynecological procedures and major trauma) had limited direct data, so benefits were estimated from related surgical settings such as general surgical procedures and hip fracture surgery.

### LMWH vs aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in orthopaedic oncology-NCI… [^12daeaa4]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

LMWH vs Aspirin for VTE Prophylaxis in Orthopaedic Oncology Aspirin and low molecular weight heparin are both commonly employed pharmacologic methods of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after orthopaedic surgery. Data comparing these two methods of VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing pelvic/lower extremity orthopaedic surgery for malignancy are lacking, however, as compared to the data and guidelines present for VTE chemoprophylaxis after joint arthroplasty and hip fracture surgery. In this clinical trial, our specific aim is to compare the post operative incidence of VTE between patients receiving aspirin and LMWH after pelvic/lower extremity orthopaedic oncology procedures. United States Massachusetts Boston Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center Lower extremity orthopaedic surgery and malignancy are both known major risk factors for venous thromboembolism.

Guidelines from high quality data exist with regards to VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, particularly joint arthroplasty. Far fewer data are available regarding the efficacy of various methods of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgery for primary or metastatic musculoskeletal malignancies as malignancy itself is known to confer a hypercoagulable state. The existing data, including published data from our institution, are almost exclusively from. patients at both high risk of VTE and hematoma formation and the need for high quality data to guide clinical decision-making in this patient population. The specific aim of this study is to compare the post operative incidence of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus between patients who receive low. complications between these methods of pharmacologic prophylaxis in the aforementioned patient population.

Our hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in the incidence rate of symptomatic DVT/PE in patients administered LMWH versus aspirin for prophylaxis; however there may exist a difference in the rate of wound complications between these prophylaxis methods.

### Timing of symptomatic venous thromboembolism after surgery: meta-analysis [^29e1260a]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The annual number of surgical procedures performed worldwide exceeds 300 million. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), represents a serious, and on occasion fatal, complication of surgery. Pharmacological prophylaxis decreases the risk of VTE in surgical patients but also increases the risk of bleeding. The decision to use pharmacological prophylaxis therefore presents a trade-off between a reduction in VTE and an increase in major bleeding.

Crucial issues when considering decisions regarding VTE prevention include the starting time and duration of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Understanding the timing of postoperative events is therefore necessary. Owing to limitations in the available data, prominent guidelineson thromboprophylaxis have been unable to provide consistent and actionable guidance on the timing of initiation and duration of thromboprophylaxis. The absence of clear guidance contributes to substantial practice variation within and between centres and countries.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysisreported a statistically non-significant decrease in the rate of any (mostly asymptomatic) VTE when thromboprophylaxis was initiated before surgery (risk ratio 0.77, 95 per cent c.i. 0.55 to 1.08). However, there were only 10 symptomatic VTEs (6 symptomatic VTEs among 938 patients (0.6 per cent) in the preoperative and 4 symptomatic VTEs among 941 patients (0.4 per cent) in the postoperative initiation group), highlighting the fragility of current estimates. A Cochrane reviewcompared the impact of extended thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin for at least 14 days with in-hospital-only prophylaxis for abdominal or pelvic surgery procedures. The seven randomized trials the authors included reported a total of only eight symptomatic VTE events. Meta-analysis suggested better VTE reduction with extended prophylaxis (1.0 per cent in the in-hospital-only group versus 0.1 per cent in patients receiving extended thromboprophylaxis; OR 0.30, 95 per cent c.i. 0.08 to 1.11). The aim of the present study was to systematically review the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism by postoperative day after surgery.

Aspirin before major orthopedic surgery — effects on venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding, and myocardial infarction: Given moderate-quality evidence, low-dose aspirin given before major orthopedic surgery and continued for 35 days will result in seven fewer symptomatic VTEs per 1,000 but at the expense of a possible three more major bleeding episodes and two additional nonfatal myocardial infarctions per 1,000. Perioperative aspirin use was associated with a trend toward more nonfatal myocardial infarctions (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.98–2.57) and more major nonfatal bleeding (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.94–1.34), with no reduction in overall mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85–1.09). In a subgroup without additional heparin, major bleeding did not differ (aspirin alone, 95 of 3,711; placebo alone, 94 of 3,789), and when considering aspirin vs anticoagulants, the impact of anticoagulants on myocardial infarction has not been studied.

Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients — major orthopedic surgery postoperative prophylaxis: In patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, we recommend the use of one of the following rather than no antithrombotic prophylaxis: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH); fondaparinux; dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban (total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty but not hip fracture surgery); low-dose unfractionated heparin; adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA); aspirin (all Grade 1B); or an intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPCD) (Grade 1C) for a minimum of 10 to 14 days. We suggest the use of low-molecular-weight heparin in preference to the other agents we have recommended as alternatives (Grade 2C/2B), and in patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis, we suggest adding an IPCD during the hospital stay (Grade 2C). We suggest extending thromboprophylaxis for up to 35 days (Grade 2B). In patients at increased bleeding risk, we suggest an IPCD or no prophylaxis (Grade 2C). In patients who decline injections, we recommend using apixaban or dabigatran (all Grade 1B).

G

Pharmacologic prophylaxis must be initiated as soon as possible and for most trauma patients may be initiated within 24 hours.

When high VTE risk trauma patients who receive enoxaparin within 24 hours of admission are compared with those who receive only mechanical prophylaxis, minor and major bleeding events do not differ. As detailed in section E, appropriate delays may occur in the initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis because of active bleeding, coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability, solid organ injury, TBI, or spinal trauma. In most cases, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be started in less than 24 hours, and in almost every case, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be started in less than 72 hours.

Pharmacologic prophylaxis is often held because of pending surgery despite the evidence that it may be initiated before most surgical procedures.– Trauma patients who require an operation are unique in that their first operation may occur within minutes of arrival or days into the hospitalization. Increasingly, pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed or skipped for pending surgery, which leads to an increased VTE rate. Preoperative dosing of pharmacologic prophylaxis is not unique to trauma. In other patient populations at high risk for VTE, the use of preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis decreased the DVT rate without increasing the complication rate. Guidelines for perioperative care in gynecologic/oncology recommend, "Prophylaxis should be initiated pre-operatively and continued post-operatively". Patients who underwent elective hip surgery who received low molecular weight heparin approximately 6 hours before surgery had a lower rate of proximal DVT without increasing major, minor, or trivial bleeding rates. This benefit was not observed when low molecular weight heparin was provided 12 hours or more preoperatively. We believe that the common and somewhat reflexive process of withholding pharmacologic prophylaxis for 12 to 24 hours before planned surgical procedures is almost always unnecessary and will result in an increased VTE risk without an accompanying decrease in the risk of bleeding events.

### Low to moderate risk non-orthopedic surgical patients Do not benefit from VTE chemoprophylaxis [^3d081609]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This retrospective cohort study analyzes venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence, morbidity, and mortality amongst postsurgical patients with and without VTE chemoprophylaxis within a quality collaborative. Postoperative thromboprophylaxis was broadly applied, yet was associated with no decrease in VTE, without affecting transfusion or mortality. Predictors of breakthrough VTE development despite evidence-based thromboprophylaxis are identified.

Objective

We hypothesized that a high rate of prescription of VTE chemoprophylaxis would be associated with decreased VTE incidence and mortality.

Summary Background Data

Recommendations for VTE prevention in surgical patients include chemoprophylaxis based upon preoperative risk stratification.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study analyzed VTE incidence, morbidity, and mortality amongst postsurgical patients with and without VTE chemoprophylaxis between April 2013 and September 2017 from 63 hospitals within the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative. A VTE risk assessment survey was distributed to providers. Bivariate and multivariate comparisons were made, as well as using propensity score matched cohorts to determine if VTE chemoprophylaxis was associated with decreased VTE events. Hospitals were compared using risk-reliability adjusted VTE prophylaxis and postoperative VTE event rates.

Results

Within the registry, 80% of practitioners reported performing formal VTE risk assessment. Amongst 32,856 operations, there were 480 (1.46%) postoperative VTE, and an overall mortality of 609 (1.85%) patients. Using a propensity matched cohort, we found that rates of VTE were similar in those receiving unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin compared to those not receiving chemoprophylaxis (1.22 vs 1.13%, P = 0.57). When stratified further by VTE risk scoring, even the highest risk patients did not have an associated lower VTE rate (3.68 vs 4.22% P = 0.092). Postoperative transfusion (8.28 vs 7.50%, P = 0.057) and mortality (2.00% vs 1.62%, P = 0.064) rates were similar amongst those receiving and those not receiving chemoprophylaxis. No correlation was found between postoperative VTE chemoprophylaxis application and hospital specific risk adjusted postoperative VTE rates.

Conclusions

In modern day postsurgical care, VTE remains a significant occurrence, despite wide adoption of VTE risk assessment. Although postoperative VTE chemoprophylaxis was broadly applied, after adjusting for confounders, no reduction in VTE was observed in at-risk surgical patients.

When is it appropriate to hold doses of VTE chemoprophylaxis?

Recommendation

Once pharmacological prophylaxis is initiated, it should only be held or stopped for significant or potentially significant bleeding events and development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Discussion

The use of chemoprophylaxis is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of VTE. Initiation early during hospitalization in patients at high risk for the development of VTE is considered standard of care. However, initiation must be balanced with risk of bleeding, and as a result should be started when the risk of bleeding is acceptable. Once initiated, continuous therapy is essential. Interruption of VTE prophylaxis for a period of 24 hours and even missing a single dose is associated with an increased risk of VTE. As a result, chemoprophylaxis once initiated should be only held under unique circumstances. Despite this, interruption is common and up to 40% of patients have chemoprophylaxis held at some point or another. Interruptions due to surgery and procedures are an even more common reason for inconsistent chemoprophylaxis administration. Debate surrounds which operations and procedures are safe to continue chemoprophylaxis without interruption. Absolute indications for holding chemoprophylaxis include active hemorrhage and recent spine or intracranial surgery. However, the optimal timing of restarting chemoprophylaxis in this patient population remains uncertain and ranges between 24 and 72 hours without clear data to guide decision making. Upcoming surgery or invasive procedures are considered relative indications for holding chemoprophylaxis. Outside of spine and intracranial surgery, little to no data exist demonstrating that continuing chemoprophylaxis without interruption leads to increased bleeding complications. In patients with a low risk of bleeding complications but high risk of VTE, chemoprophylaxis should be continued uninterrupted. If interruption in chemoprophylaxis is indicated, mechanical prophylaxis should be instituted prior to interruption and preferably continued in combination with re-initiation of pharmacological prophylaxis.

### Thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery: improving compliance with clinical practice guidelines [^2ea73d0d]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Identifying risk factors and strategies for the prevention of deep venous thromboembolism in major orthopedic surgery has allowed the development of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). Currently, there is a gap between clinical practice and the implementation of the recommendations of CPGs. The purpose of this paper is to report the impact of the implementation of improvement strategies on adherence to venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis guidelines.

Materials and Methods

We defined 3 quality indicators to assess the adequate use of thromboprophylaxis according to CPGs. We obtained a baseline measurement and identified several barriers for adherence. Six improvement strategies to promote adherence to CPGs were designed and applied. A systematic monitoring of these indicators was performed in real time and a description of the data was completed for patients undergoing primary joint replacement of the hip, knee and shoulder, during February 2012 and August 2014.

Results

Data from 773 patients were obtained. In the first trimester, the average of adherence was: 98.3% for medical order in the post-operative note, 60.3% for opportune administration and 67% for adherence to therapy at home. In the trimester, the rates of adherence were 100%, 95.7% and 100% respectively.

Conclusions

Combined strategies for improvement of adherence to VTE prophylaxis is associated with higher compliance with clinical practice guidelines.

### Benefits and harms of direct oral anticoagulation and low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^49bd6a14]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Globally, more than 200 million adults undergo major non-cardiac surgery annually. Surgery increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Antithrombotic drugs reduce the risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism but increase the risk of bleeding. Recommending drug treatment as thromboprophylaxis should depend on its expected net effect based on the expected risks of venous thromboembolism and bleeding.

Existing evidence based guidelines have separate recommendations for patients undergoing orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic surgery. Elective major orthopaedic surgery (eg, total joint arthroplasty) has been associated with a cumulative risk of developing symptomatic venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both) of about 5% in the first 35 days after surgery. Given this substantial risk, investigators have conducted several randomised controlled trials on drug treatment for thromboprophylaxis in this surgical population, where different active agents were compared with each other and with no active treatment. This evidence pool has led guideline panels to recommend, or not to question, drug treatment as prophylaxis for total joint arthroplasty in patients who do not have an increased risk of bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy practices in US hospitals in an era of practice guidelines… [^1bb558fd]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Venous thromboembolism prevention in orthopedic surgery. Mean ± SD duration of inpatient postprocedure anticoagulation therapy and patients discharged from the hospital with anticoagulation therapy for 358 patients who underwent total knee replacement, 284 who underwent total hip replacement, and 291 who underwent hip fracture repair. We established a national multicenter database for hospitals to assess the patient characteristics, risk factors, and treatment of individuals with or at risk for thrombotic disease. Primary thrombosis prevention was evaluated in patients with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and in those requiring total knee replacement, total hip replacement, or hip fracture repair. Secondary prevention was evaluated in patients diagnosed as having AMI, deep vein thrombosis, or PE. Of the 928 patients included who had undergone orthopedic surgery, 358 had TKR, 284 had THR, and 291 had hip fracture repair. Inadequate prophylaxis was administered in 134 patients: 77 received only aspirin and 57 received no prophylaxis. Despite substantial evidence that risk-modifying therapy and appropriate treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality from thrombosis, these findings indicate that there is an important opportunity for improving the primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic disease. Our results demonstrate that an unacceptable number of patients with high-risk AF, orthopedic surgery, AMI, or DVT or PE did not receive adequate prophylaxis or treatment. Almost 15% of patients who underwent orthopedic surgery received aspirin only or no prophylaxis. No prophylaxis use was most frequently observed in the hip fracture repair cohort, where the incidence was 13. 4%. Warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin provide effective prophylaxis for orthopedic surgery and are recommended in guidelines.

25, 26 However, even when administered for 7 to 10 days after surgery, the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT remains at 15% for patients with THR and 30% for. those with TKR. 27 Several studies suggest that the risk of DVT may persist for up to 2 months after THR surgery, 26–30 and prophylaxis for up to 28 to 35 days has been recommended in the THR and hip fracture surgery setting. 26 Although our data are limited in that.

Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion.

As discussed in recommendation 7, pharmacological prophylaxis may be preferred in individuals at average or low risk of bleeding. As with the previous recommendation, the decision regarding the use of a short or extended scheme may be guided by the risk of VTE. For patients with risk factors for VTE or previous VTE events, extended schemes may be appropriate; also, for patients in whom the surgery will be associated with a long period of immobilization, such immobilization or the surgery itself may lead to a significant increase of the risk of VTE (eg, orthopedic surgery). However, most patients undergoing general surgery have no significant VTE risk factors. In those patients, extended prophylaxis may increase the cost and the burden of treatment unnecessarily.

In surgical patients in whom pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is preferred, should we use delayed or early prophylaxis?

Recommendation 10

In surgical patients in whom pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is preferred, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests delayed prophylaxis (12 hours after surgery) over early administration (before surgery or within 12 hours post-surgery) (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Justification.

This recommendation changed its direction. The original guideline panel made a recommendation in favor of either alternative: delayed prophylaxis and early administration. The Latin American panel judged that for the majority of patients undergoing surgery, the risk of VTE before the procedure was very small. Also, the use of early prophylaxis might slightly increase the risk of bleeding during surgery; it adds cost, and it may be impractical for surgical teams.

Conclusion.

The decision whether to use pharmacological prophylaxis before or after surgery will largely depend on the clinical circumstances before the procedure. For bedridden patients or those who have an increased risk of VTE (eg, previous events or risk factors), the use of prophylaxis before surgery may be justified. In contrast, for patients undergoing elective procedures, those who are able to walk, or, in general, patients at low risk of VTE, the use of prophylaxis before surgery probably has little or no impact.

### Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^7f65928e]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

VTE is a serious, but decreasing complication following major orthopedic surgery. This guideline focuses on optimal prophylaxis to reduce postoperative pulmonary embolism and DVT.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

In patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, we recommend the use of one of the following rather than no antithrombotic prophylaxis: low-molecular-weight heparin; fondaparinux; dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban (total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty but not hip fracture surgery); low-dose unfractionated heparin; adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist; aspirin (all Grade 1B); or an intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPCD) (Grade 1C) for a minimum of 10 to 14 days. We suggest the use of low-molecular-weight heparin in preference to the other agents we have recommended as alternatives (Grade 2C/2B), and in patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis, we suggest adding an IPCD during the hospital stay (Grade 2C). We suggest extending thromboprophylaxis for up to 35 days (Grade 2B). In patients at increased bleeding risk, we suggest an IPCD or no prophylaxis (Grade 2C). In patients who decline injections, we recommend using apixaban or dabigatran (all Grade 1B). We suggest against using inferior vena cava filter placement for primary prevention in patients with contraindications to both pharmacologic and mechanical thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2C). We recommend against Doppler (or duplex) ultrasonography screening before hospital discharge (Grade 1B). For patients with isolated lower-extremity injuries requiring leg immobilization, we suggest no thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2B). For patients undergoing knee arthroscopy without a history of VTE, we suggest no thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2B).

Conclusions

Optimal strategies for thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery include pharmacologic and mechanical approaches.

Orthopedic surgery venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention — conclusions and key recommendations are as follows: We recommend that all patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery receive prophylaxis with a pharmacologic agent or IPCD for a minimum of 10 to 14 days, and we suggest extending prophylaxis for up to 35 days. In patients at an increased risk of bleeding, we suggest the use of an IPCD or no prophylaxis. We do not recommend the use of IVC filter placement for primary prevention, and we recommend against DUS screening. For patients with isolated lower-extremity injuries requiring immobilization and for patients undergoing knee arthroscopy without a history of VTE, we suggest no thromboprophylaxis.

### Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1848fcce]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians guideline — deriving baseline symptomatic VTE risk without prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery notes considerable effort to estimate baseline risk in the absence of prophylaxis, with randomized controlled trial data typically showing a symptomatic VTE event rate of 15% to 30% without prophylaxis prior to 1980. Because in recent years there have been no large placebo controlled trials, baseline risk was estimated by applying the observed risk of symptomatic VTE in patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and adjusting it by the relative risk reduction from prior randomized trials of LMWH vs placebo. Contemporary LMWH event rates were averaged from trials enrolling > 16,000 patients since 2003, and were compared with an observational cohort in which investigators identified 103 of 13,956 (0.7%) VTE events during the initial hospitalization for patients receiving prophylaxis (estimated prophylaxis compliance, 86%). Assuming similar LMWH effects for asymptomatic and symptomatic disease, the best evidence suggests LMWH reduces the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by 50% to 60% and pulmonary embolism (PE) by about two-thirds, yielding contemporary off-prophylaxis rates of ∼1.5% for symptomatic DVT and 1% for PE for the first 7 to 14 days.

Extended prophylaxis with rivaroxaban after THA: One trial enrolling > 2,400 patients used a control regimen of short-term LMWH for the first 12 days followed by placebo for an additional 22 days and found that rivaroxaban significantly reduced symptomatic VTE (symptomatic DVT: RR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04–0.52; PE: RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.02–2.22) with only one major bleeding event in both groups. Based on moderate-quality evidence, 12 fewer symptomatic VTE would be expected, but because of the uncertainty about the major bleeding rate it is unknown whether some of the benefit would be offset by a higher bleeding rate of rivaroxaban compared with placebo.

LMWH vs apixaban — initial and extended prophylaxis after THA/TKA: "Four RCTs enrolling close to 12,000 patients after THA and TKA examined the efficacy of apixaban 2.5 mg bid taken orally (started 12–24 h postoperatively) against enoxaparin", where enoxaparin "40-mg" was generally started the evening before surgery and two studies used "30 mg bid" started 12 h postoperatively. For TKA, apixaban was given "for 10 to 14 days", and for THA "32 to 38 days". Apixaban "reduced symptomatic DVT by 59% (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18–0.95)" with little or no effect on major nonfatal bleeding "(RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.44–1.32)" or reoperation bleeding "(RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.15–4.55)". Effects on nonfatal PE and mortality were neutral "(RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.31–3.85)" and "(RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.61–5.74)", with "only five deaths from VTE" in the apixaban group. "Seven fewer symptomatic DVT per 1,000" may be achieved vs LMWH, with major bleeding ranging "from eight fewer to five more per 1,000", and overall "apixaban is similar to LMWH" for all symptomatic VTE and major bleeding, while lack of long-term safety "leaves LMWH still the agent of choice".

Aspirin vs no prophylaxis — Initial plus extended prophylaxis period — Earlier studies used high doses of aspirin of up to 3.8 g daily and had serious methodologic limitations, leading to the PEP trial testing 160 mg of aspirin for 35 days against placebo in routine practice. The multicenter PEP trial enrolled 17,444 patients predominantly after HFS and included patients after hip arthroplasty, had considerable strengths including remote randomization, blinding of patients, caregivers, and investigators, an independent blinded adjudication committee, and achieved near-complete follow-up (99.6%). Although combined results (arthroplasty and HFS) failed to demonstrate or exclude a beneficial effect on nonfatal PE, there was a modest 25% relative risk reduction in symptomatic DVT (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53–0.96); the upper bound of the CI crosses a threshold of 10% and the CI of the absolute effect includes as few as one less DVT in 1,000, and there were 19 VTE-associated deaths in the aspirin group compared with 45 in the placebo.

Preoperative VTE prophylaxis

Rationale

Chemical venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing elective total joint replacement. Questions remain however about whether VTE prophylaxis should be initiated preoperatively (focus of this section) and for how long prophylaxis should be continued postoperatively (focus of upcoming section titled extended duration VTE prophylaxis). Intraoperative stasis may contribute to the development of VTE; therefore, preoperative prophylaxis may reduce this risk, but potentially at the expense of increased bleeding.

Evidence

The literature search identified 235 articles, of which 7 met the inclusion criteria and were specific to total joint replacement: 2 SRs and 5 RCTs. A 2002 SR showed no difference in major bleeding and VTE rates comparing preoperative and postoperative low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) strategies in patients undergoing THA. Further, while they found that patients started on therapy perioperatively (ie, within 2–4 hours before or after surgery) did have slightly lower VTE rates (10.0% vs 15.3%), they also experienced much higher rates of major bleeding (3.5% vs 0.9%). Subsequent RCTs have randomized patients to preoperative versus postoperative regimens but using different agents, rendering direct comparisons difficult. Finally, a recent large registry study found no difference in bleeding, thromboembolic events, or complications when comparing preoperative and postoperative LMWH regimens.

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines for orthopedic VTE management do not favor preoperative or postoperative initiation but do recommend that therapy be started at least 12 hours before or after surgery as opposed to < 4 hours before or after surgery.

Summary and recommendations

While chemical VTE prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing elective joint replacement, there is no convincing evidence favoring preoperative or postoperative initiation. There is evidence that immediate perioperative administration (within 2–4 hours before or after surgery) may increase bleeding disproportionately to the VTE risk reduction. Upcoming section titled extended duration will address extended duration of VTE prophylaxis.

Rivaroxaban — initiation and maintenance for venous thromboembolism prevention after hip or knee replacement — Rivaroxaban is currently approved in many countries for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery and total knee replacement surgery based on the results of four phase 3 clinical trials. For this indication, the approved dose is 10 mg once daily. Treatment should be started between 6 and 10 h after surgery, and the duration of treatment should vary from 2 weeks in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery.

ASCO venous thromboembolism (VTE) guideline — Recommendation 3.7 (extended postoperative thromboprophylaxis) states that "Patients who are candidates for extended pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after surgery may be offered prophylactic doses of LMWH (Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Alternatively, patients may be offered prophylactic doses of rivaroxaban or apixaban after an initial period of LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH) (Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: Low; Strength of recommendation: Weak)". The update notes that "Recommendation 3.7 contains new information about options that may be offered for extended postoperative thromboprophylaxis", and a qualifying statement emphasizes that "Evidence for rivaroxaban and apixaban in this setting remains limited" and that "The two available trials differed with respect to type of cancer, type of surgery, and timing of rivaroxaban or apixaban initiation after surgery".

### Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis: state of the art [^7a30f58f]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

The selection of a prophylaxis regimen to prevent symptomatic pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is a balance between efficacy and safety. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline recommended that either chemoprophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis be used after total joint arthroplasty but did not recommend specific agents. However, the latest evidence-based American College of Chest Physicians guideline recommended a variety of chemoprophylaxis and mechanical agents for a minimum of 10 to 14 days after total joint arthroplasty. Risk stratification is the key to the selection of the appropriate prophylaxis regimen for the individual patient, but the optimal risk stratification protocol still needs to be developed.

### Timing of symptomatic venous thromboembolism after surgery: meta-analysis [^bebf0582]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The results of this systematic review have important implications for the surgical practice globally. Surgical thromboprophylaxis practice, especially after discharge, varies widely both within and between countries. The timing and duration of postoperative VTE prophylaxis is a key question in daily clinical practice. Although the evidence establishes that almost half of VTE events in the first month after surgery occur during the first postoperative week, it also demonstrates that a substantial number of VTE events arise during the third, or even fourth, week after surgery. These results suggest the possible importance of extended prophylaxis, especially in patients with high risk of VTE. Although meta-analyses of the randomized trials have failed, owing to insufficient statistical power, to establish the optimal starting time and duration of thromboprophylaxis, clinicians and guideline developers can use the results of the present systematic review, together with knowledge of baseline risks of VTE and bleeding, to guide the starting time and duration of thromboprophylaxis.

These results will also prove useful for the planning and conduct of future clinical research, which should benefit from the present identification of limitations in past studies. There were limitations regarding reporting of use, starting time, and duration of thromboprophylaxis, and so data from a contemporary survey of surgeons' practices on thromboprophylaxis had to be relied on. Because of lack of direct evidence on this issue, most studies were judged as having a high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was therefore lowered from high to moderate. Future prospective studies, including use of representative patient populations, clear documentation of VTE, DVT, PE, and their follow-up times, and documentation of thromboprophylaxis used, would improve the evidence base, and consequently further rationalize the global practice of thromboprophylaxis in surgery.

### Update on venous thromboembolism in orthopaedic trauma surgery [^506d4f11]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a notable contributor to the morbidity and mortality of patients with orthopaedic trauma. Several associations have published guidelines on VTE prophylaxis, with a strong predilection toward low-molecular-weight heparin for chemoprophylaxis. However, previous recommendations may be revisited because recent high-level evidence demonstrated aspirin to be noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing serious complications of VTE. Direct oral anticoagulants are emerging as safe alternatives to injectable medication and may offer improved patient compliance. There is no consensus on postinjury duration of chemoprophylaxis as an outpatient. Mechanical prophylaxis remains an important adjunctive VTE preventive measure for inpatients with pelvis and extremity fractures. Proteomics and novel laboratory measurements may be able to predict high-risk patients and detect early thrombus formation. Despite high-quality prospective research over the past decade, we still have much to learn about patient- and injury-specific risk factors.

### Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^4fe4d1c7]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) vs no prophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and hip fracture surgery (HFS) — LMWH usually was continued for 6 to 14 days, and for THA or TKA it consistently reduces asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis by ~50% (combined risk ratio [RR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.43–0.59), with similar results seen in two HFS studies involving 218 patients. Combining results failed to demonstrate or to exclude a beneficial effect of LMWH on pulmonary embolism (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.22–1.47). On the basis of moderate-quality evidence, use of LMWH for the initial prophylaxis period (10–14 days) is expected to prevent 13 VTE per 1,000 patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, assuming a baseline risk of 1% for PE and 1.8% for symptomatic DVT. Major bleeding results failed to demonstrate or to exclude a detrimental effect (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.38–1.72); the 95% CI was nine fewer to 11 more major bleeding events per 1,000, and few deaths occurred with two VTE-associated deaths in placebo groups compared with one in the LMWH arm.

### Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^7438cc5c]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Major orthopedic surgery risk stratification and bleeding risk factors — surgery-specific risk far outweighs patient-specific factors; in a population-based case-control study of 635 patients with first-time venous thromboembolism (VTE) from 1976 to 1990, hospitalization with recent surgery resulted in an OR of 22 (95% CI, 9–50). Individual risk estimation is not sufficiently secure to formulate different recommendations for different risk strata, and bleeding risk assessments have not been sufficiently validated in the orthopedic surgery population; general risk factors for bleeding listed include: Previous major bleeding (and previous bleeding risk similar to current risk); Severe renal failure; Concomitant antiplatelet agent; and Surgical factors: history of or difficult-to-control surgical bleeding during the current operative procedure, extensive surgical dissection, and revision surgery.

### Survey of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in trauma patients: current prescribing practices and concordance with clinical practice guidelines [^7c8caa85]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Agreement across clinical practice guidelines and surgical specialties is needed to standardize VTE chemoprophylaxis in trauma patients. Despite clear guideline recommendations, disagreement among trauma and consulting providers regarding the risk of bleeding versus the risk of thrombosis can lead to deviation from practice guidelines or delays in care. In addition, while the WTA and AAST/American College of Surgeons (ACS)-Committee on Trauma (COT) guidelines share similar recommendations, they are not identical and, due to a lack of robust evidence, each set of guidelines does not address all aspects of VTE prevention, such as timing of initiation in high-risk patient populations, specifics on how and when to monitor LMWH, and recommendations for selection of agent and duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis postdischarge. Therefore, despite a large amount of cohort data describing VTE practice innovations and outcomes, there remains a paucity of high-quality data to drive standard practices for all aspects of VTE prevention. Recommendations for VTE chemoprophylaxis span multiple specialties (neurosurgery, orthopedics, ACS) and efforts need to be focused on aligning practice recommendations among surgical specialties. To promote this goal, a National Institutes of Health sponsored conference titled '2022 Consensus Conference to Implement Optimal VTE Prophylaxis in Trauma' was held in May 2022 with the initial aim of bringing together a multidisciplinary cohort of trauma experts to review the current state of the science, identify gaps in the literature, and prioritize a future research agenda.

Limitations for this study include decreased generalizability of results due to the low response rate and high percentage of respondents at level 1 and academic institutions. Additionally, display logic decreased the response rates for some items. Despite these limitations, respondents were widely distributed geographically which supports the conclusion that broad variability exists and does not change the interpretation of findings. Survey questions asked participants to describe 'standard' practices for patients; therefore, the results do not represent patient-specific recommendations. In addition, the AAST/ACS-COT clinical protocol for inpatient VTE prophylaxis was released during the survey time period with the majority of responses collected prior to the publication of the AAST/ACS-COT recommendations. Therefore, practice changes as a result of the AAST/ACS-COT clinical protocol are not reflected in this study. Finally, providers may have different definitions for 'low'-risk or 'high'-risk TBI regarding the timing of initiation in these populations.

### Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment and prophylaxis in acute orthopaedic admissions: improving compliance with national guidelines [^ab79102b]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thrombosis is when a blood clot forms within a vein. These blood clots can occur in either the deep or the superficial veins of the body. However, it is clots within the deep venous system (deep venous thrombosis-DVTs) which are most concerning due to the risk of pulmonary embolus (PE), where part of the clot breaks off and travels to the lungs, restricting gas exchange within that area. DVTs frequently occur in the deep veins of the legs, where they may be asymptomatic or may cause pain and swelling of the affected leg. Long term they can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome, which results in considerable morbidity from chronic pain and swelling of the leg. Risk factors for VTE are well recognised and include surgery (especially pelvic or orthopaedic), immobility, malignancy, hormone replacement therapy or the oral contraceptive pill, inherited thrombophilias and, obesity.

Orthopaedic patients have a particularly high risk of DVT. Without appropriate prophylaxis, 45–51% of orthopaedic patients will develop a DVT and 10–20% will develop a proximal DVT, which carries a higher risk of PE. 4–10% will develop a clinically recognised PE and in 0.2–5% of patients this will be fatal. Evidence of DVT has also been found in up to 58% of major trauma patients. Importantly, effective methods for preventing many of these DVTs and PEs do exist. These methods exist in the form of mechanical means (anti-thromboembolism stockings-TEDs and foot pumps) or pharmacological methods, (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is most common). Both the House of Commons report into VTE and the NICE guidance makes it clear that all hospital patients need to have their VTE risk assessed and appropriate prophylaxis prescribed.

### Extended thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins after hospital discharge in high-risk surgical and medical patients: a review [^eef2d97e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) is routinely administered during the hospital stay in at-risk surgical and medical patients. However, in high-risk groups, the risk of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism may persist for several weeks after discharge. The standard duration of thromboprophylaxis (6–14 days) may not provide adequate protection against such events.

Objective

This article reviews published data on the efficacy and safety profile of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis in patients at high risk for VTE, the potential cost-effectiveness of such treatment, and practical aspects of ensuring an effective transition from the inpatient to the outpatient setting.

Methods

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched through January 2009 for relevant English-language reports of clinical trials, abstracts, and case reports. The search terms included, but were not limited to, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation, thromboprophylaxis, prolonged duration, and extended duration. The reference lists of the identified articles were reviewed for additional relevant publications. Congress Web sites were also consulted. The principal criteria for inclusion of a study were that it have a prospective, randomized design and include a control group. Case series and retrospective analyses were excluded.

Results

Studies have found that extended-duration thromboprophylaxis (28–45 days) with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) can reduce the risk of VTE in high-risk patients. In separate meta-analyses, extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with LMWH was associated with significant reductions in the likelihood of symptomatic VTE compared with standard-duration thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24–0.61) or major abdominal or pelvic surgery (Peto OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06–0.80). There was large heterogeneity in the reported rates of major and minor bleeding. The occurrence of clinically relevant bleeding events was generally low (< 1%), particularly during extended prophylaxis. Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis was cost-effective compared with standard-duration thromboprophylaxis, with increased pharmacy costs offset by reductions in VTE and the associated costs of hospitalization.

Conclusions

In high-risk surgical and medical patients, the risk of VTE may extend beyond the period of hospitalization. Such patients may benefit from extended-duration thromboprophylaxis to reduce the risk of late VTE events. LMWHs were efficacious, were associated with low rates of clinically relevant bleeding complications, and were cost-effective in patients at high risk for VTE.

Data Abstraction

Two independent reviewers abstracted data and rated study quality and strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Eight randomized, controlled trials (3 good-quality and 5 fair-quality) met the inclusion criteria. High-strength evidence showed that compared with standard-duration therapy, prolonged prophylaxis resulted in fewer cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) (5 trials; odds ratio [OR], 0.14 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.47]; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 0.8%), asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (4 trials; relative risk [RR], 0.48 [CI, 0.31 to 0.75]; ARR, 5.8%), symptomatic DVT (4 trials; OR, 0.36 [CI, 0.16 to 0.81]; ARR, 1.5%), and proximal DVT (6 trials; RR, 0.29 [CI, 0.16 to 0.52]; ARR, 7.1%). Moderate-strength evidence showed fewer symptomatic objectively confirmed episodes of venous thromboembolism (4 trials; RR, 0.38 [CI, 0.19 to 0.77]; ARR, 5.7%), nonfatal PE (4 trials; OR, 0.13 [CI, 0.03 to 0.54]; ARR, 0.7%), and DVT (7 trials; RR, 0.37 [CI, 0.21 to 0.64]; ARR, 12.1%) with prolonged prophylaxis. High-strength evidence showed more minor bleeding events with prolonged prophylaxis (OR, 2.44 [CI, 1.41 to 4.20]; absolute risk increase, 6.3%), and insufficient evidence from 1 trial on hip fracture surgery suggested more surgical-site bleeding events (OR, 7.55 [CI, 1.51 to 37.64]) with prolonged prophylaxis.

Limitations

Data relevant to knee replacement or hip fracture surgery were scant and insufficient. Most trials had few events; the strength of evidence ratings that were used may not adequately capture uncertainty in such situations.

Conclusion

Prolonged prophylaxis decreases the risk for venous thromboembolism, PE, and DVT while increasing the risk for minor bleeding in patients undergoing total hip replacement.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical patients [^78cfe8e7]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of surgical procedures. The risk for VTE in surgical patients is determined by the combination of individual predisposing factors and the specific type of surgery. Prophylaxis with mechanical and pharmacological methods has been shown to be effective and safe in most types of surgery and should be routinely implemented. For patients undergoing general, gynecologic, vascular, and major urologic surgery, low-dose unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are the options of choice. For low-risk urologic surgery, early postoperative mobilization of patients is the only intervention warranted. For higher-risk patients, including those undergoing elective hip or knee replacement and surgery for hip fracture, vitamin K antagonists, LMWH, or fondaparinux are recommended. For patients undergoing neurosurgery, graduated elastic stockings are effective and safe and may be combined with LMWH to further reduce the risk of VTE. The role of prophylaxis is less defined in patients undergoing elective spine surgery, as well as laparoscopic and arthroscopic surgery. A number of issues related to prophylaxis of VTE after surgery deserve further clarification, including the role of screening for asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, the best timing for initiation of pharmacological prophylaxis, and the optimal duration of prophylaxis in high-risk patients.

### Primary and secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism with low-molecular-weight heparins: prolonged thromboprophylaxis, an alternative to vitamin K antagonists [^51a68681]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are used widely in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The LMWHs dalteparin and enoxaparin reduce the rate of VTE by at least 50% if administered for 4–5 weeks following major orthopedic surgery, compared with in-hospital prophylaxis for 7–15 days. Meta-analyses have confirmed that the size of the reduction is similar for both clinical and asymptomatic VTE. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been shown to be associated with significantly higher bleeding rates compared with LMWH when used as prolonged prophylaxis against VTE following major orthopedic surgery. Patients with cancer are a recognized group at high risk of VTE, and those undergoing major surgery for their malignancy are at particular risk. Evidence from clinical trials is amassing to show that prolonged prophylaxis with LMWH (dalteparin, enoxaparin) in these patients can significantly reduce the rate of postoperative VTE. In cancer patients with acute VTE, the traditional approach is to initiate acute treatment with unfractionated heparin or LMWH followed by long-term treatment with VKA to prevent recurrence. However, clinical trial data have confirmed that the LMWH dalteparin, when administered for 6 months, is significantly more effective than VKA in preventing recurrence, cutting the rate of VTE by 52% without increasing the risk of bleeding. A new and intriguing area of interest is whether LMWH can enhance survival in patients with cancer. Preliminary data suggest that a biological effect of LMWH may act to prolong survival in patients with cancer.

### Venous thromboprophylaxis duration and adherence to international guidelines in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery: results of the international, longitudinal, observational DEIMOS registry [^2ee71b29]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is major health problem worldwide with substantial morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess post-operative VTE prophylaxis duration and adherence to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2008 guidelines in patients having undergone major orthopaedic surgery (MOS).

Methods

This multinational, longitudinal, observational registry recruited consecutive patients (≥ 18 years of age) who underwent total hip replacement (THR), total knee replacement (TKR), and hip fracture surgery (HFS). There were 3 study visits: at admission to hospital, at discharge, and 4/6 weeks after surgery. Data on demographics, medical history, VTE risk factors, type and duration of mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, complications, and adherence to the ACCP 2008 guidelines were collected using case report forms.

Results

Between October 2009 and July 2011, 2162 eligible patients were analyzed: THR: 646, TKR: 740, HFS: 776 (mean age [SD]: 64.5 [15.0] years; female: 61.3%; and mean hospitalization duration [SD]: 9.1 [8.2] days). VTE prophylaxis was prescribed to 96.2% of patients during hospitalization and 89.7% of patients after hospital discharge. Prophylaxis was prescribed according to the ACCP 2008 guidelines in 85.7% of patients during hospitalization and 63.4% of patients after hospital discharge. The main reasons for non-adherence to guidelines were no prescription and inadequate duration of prophylaxis. The low molecular weight heparin-enoxaparin-was the most commonly prescribed prophylaxis.

Conclusion

We observed a gap between real life VTE prophylaxis and the ACCP 2008 recommendations. Improved prescription of extended thromboprophylaxis is warranted to ensure adherence to international guidelines.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dosing in orthopedic surgery — LMWH after total hip arthroplasty reduced symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with low-dose UFH (LDUH) from 16 per 1,000 to 13 per 1,000 without an increase in major bleeding, and LMWH after THA showed reduced bleeding in one subset (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34–1.01) but not across all trials (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.75–1.09); LDUH schedule comparisons found two trials of 12 h vs 8 h with meta-analyses reporting a 72% odds reduction for 8 h and 63% for 12 h with similar 65% reductions in orthopedic-only studies, and general surgery pooled DVT rates of 11.8% with 12 h vs 7.5% with 8 h, with neither meta-analysis identifying differences in major bleeding and these indirect comparisons providing only low-quality or very-low-quality evidence.

### Extended duration of thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients: optimizing therapy? [^3ee764db]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Summary. Patients who are hospitalized for an acute medical illness are at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Current evidence-based guidelines recommend prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin in acutely ill medical patients who are admitted to hospital with congestive heart failure, severe respiratory disease, or who are bedridden with an additional VTE risk factor. The need for thromboprophylaxis is therefore clear in this patient population; however, the optimal duration of prophylaxis in these patients is less clear. In patients undergoing orthopedic or cancer surgery, extended-duration prophylaxis has been shown to be superior to placebo. To date, however, no large-scale clinical trials have assessed the benefits of extended-duration prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. This review therefore focuses on the VTE risk profile of acutely ill medical patients, examines the currently available literature for evidence of a potential benefit of extended-duration prophylaxis in these patients, and provides a rationale for the testing of such a hypothesis in a randomized clinical trial.

### Starting prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism postoperatively… [^7fc3717c]. JAMA Network (1995). Excellent credibility.

A large proportion of hospitalized patients who are at high risk for venous thrombo-embolism do not receive prophylaxis. Reluctance to use VTE prophylaxis in surgical patients may be due to fear of perioperative bleeding when anticoagulants are given preoperatively. We preformed a literature review to determine whether prophylaxis for VTE is effective when it is started postoperatively and the relative efficacy of preoperatively and postoperatively initiated prophylaxis. Studies were included in the review if they were randomized trials with "blind" assessment of appropriate VTE outcomes, and if prophylaxis was started postoperatively. Randomized, controlled trials establish that pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of prophylaxis that are effective when started preoperatively are also effective when they are started postoperatively, with relative risks for VTE of 0. 16 to 0.
49.

Low rates of VTE in noncontrolled randomized trials that included postoperatively intitiated prophylactic regimens support this finding. The relative efficacy of preoperatively and postoperatively initiated VTE prophylaxis could not be determined definitively, as direct comparisons of the same regimens have not been performed. Indirect comparisons suggest that any loss of efficacy resulting from deferring VTE prophylaxis until after surgery is unlikely to be marked. Randomized trials are required to resolve this question. This comparison may be of greatest clinical importance when twice-daily, low-molecular-weight heparin is used to prevent VTE after major orthopedic surgery. Kearon C, Hirsh J. Starting Prophylaxis for Venous Thromboembolism Postoperatively. Arch Intern Med. 1995; 155: 366–372.

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^c57447f7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

L

Trauma patients with TBI, orthopedic or spine injuries, and those who undergo major surgery are at particular VTE risk and should be considered for postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis.

Pharmacologic prophylaxis after discharge for high VTE risk trauma patients is supported by evidence that demonstrates the practice is efficacious, safe, and cost-effective and may be considered for patients with TBI, orthopedic or spine injuries, and those who undergo major surgery.– The highest VTE risk occurs during the first 3 months after injury with approximately 1 year required until the VTE rate returns to that of the general population. Venous thromboembolism–related readmissions account for 1.2% of 1-year trauma readmissions at a cost of US $250 million annually.

Postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis with enoxaparin is efficacious, associated with a low rate of clinically relevant bleeding complications, and is cost-effective in patients at high VTE risk. The introduction of postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis following abdominal or pelvic surgery for malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease was associated with a decrease in VTE events. Because the optimal postdischarge dose and duration of enoxaparin after trauma are not well studied, doses more than 30 mg twice daily should be avoided, and the duration of pharmacologic prophylaxis may be considered for up to 4 weeks after the date of admission. For those who undergo major orthopedic surgery, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be extended up to 35 days from the date of surgery. Aspirin may be initiated for postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis for high VTE risk trauma patients, as it has been shown to be as effective as enoxaparin with less bleeding complications and better postdischarge adherence, and is not limited by the constraints of insurance oversight. Direct oral anticoagulants may also be considered for postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis after isolated orthopedic injury.

Necessity of anticoagulation at discharge

The CDC and ACF recommend against the routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients discharged from the hospital. However, the CDC and ACF as well as ASH and SCC-ISTH mention that FDA-approved post-discharge prophylactic anticoagulation (PDPA) regimens (rivaroxaban and betrixaban) may be considered in patients with high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding. Similarly, the ACCP mentions that PDPA can be considered in patients who are at low risk of bleeding if emerging data suggests that the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding. The ACF and SCC-ISTH both mention that enoxaparin in addition to betrixaban or rivaroxaban can be considered if PDPA is thought to be reasonable. The duration of anticoagulation recommended by ACF is based on the timing used in clinical trials which is 31–39 days for rivaroxaban, 35–42 days for betrixaban, and 6–14 days for enoxaparin. The SCC-ISTH recommends a duration of a minimum of 14 days and up to 30 days. ACC mentions that it is reasonable to consider extended prophylaxis with LMWH or DOACs for up to 45 days in patients at high risk for VTE (i.e. D-dimer > 2 times ULN, reduced mobility, active cancer) and low risk of bleeding. As an alternative, ASH mentions that aspirin can also be considered based on studies for VTE prophylaxis in low risk patients after orthopedic surgery. Aspirin is not mentioned in any of the other guidelines and recommendations with the exception of SCC-ISTH which reports that none of their respondents recommended aspirin for post-discharge thromboprophylaxis.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma / American college of surgeons committee on trauma clinical protocol for postdischarge venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after trauma [^f22f2419]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Trauma patients are at an elevated risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. In the inpatient setting, prompt pharmacologic prophylaxis is utilized to prevent VTE. For patients with lower extremity fractures or limited mobility, VTE risk does not return to baseline levels postdischarge. Currently, there are limited data to guide postdischarge VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients. The goal of these postdischarge VTE prophylaxis guidelines are to identify patients at the highest risk of developing VTE after discharge and to offer pharmacologic prophylaxis strategies to limit this risk.

### Timing of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis initiation after injury: findings from the consensus conference to implement optimal VTE prophylaxis in trauma [^df619d99]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Optimizing prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) is a critical issue in the care of injured patients. Although these patients are at significant risk of developing VTE, they also present competing concerns related to exacerbation of bleeding from existing injuries. Especially after high-risk trauma, including injuries to the abdominal solid organs, brain, and spine, trauma providers must delineate the time period in which VTE prophylaxis successfully reduces VTE rates without encouraging bleeding. Although existing data are primarily retrospective in nature and further study is required, literature supports early VTE chemoprophylaxis initiation even for severely injured patients. Early initiation is most frequently defined as < 48 hours from admission but varies from < 24 hours to 72 hours and occasionally refers to time from initial trauma. Prior to chemical VTE prophylaxis initiation in patients at risk for bleeding, an observation period is necessary during which injuries must show themselves to be hemostatic, either clinically or radiographically. In the future, prospective examination of optimal timing of VTE prophylaxis is necessary. Further study of specific subsets of trauma patients will allow for development of effective VTE mitigation strategies based upon collective risks of VTE and hemorrhage progression.

Major orthopedic surgery — predischarge duplex ultrasonography (DUS) screening: For asymptomatic patients following major orthopedic surgery, the guideline recommends against DUS screening before hospital discharge (Grade 1B). Trial evidence reported no demonstrated benefit of predischarge screening (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.17–1.9) and noted major bleeding in only two patients treated after screening‑detected asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT); designs included extended prophylaxis until day 35 and treatment of DVT detected around discharge (day 7 mean). The evidence summary states that moderate‑quality evidence indicates DUS screening before discharge does not result in fewer symptomatic postdischarge venous thromboembolism (VTE), and that screening for asymptomatic DVT appears to cause harm by leading to unnecessary anticoagulation for several months, resulting in a higher risk of major bleeding.

### Comparing consensus guidelines on thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic surgery [^b7907848]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Different guidelines exist regarding the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in orthopedic surgery.

Objectives

We aimed to compare (inter)national guidelines and analyse differences.

Methods

MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and the internet were searched for guidelines on the prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery. From these, we constructed a table comparing the different antithrombotic regimens during different orthopedic surgical and plaster cast treatments.

Results

Eleven guidelines from nine different countries and one international guideline were included. Few guidelines advise on thrombosis prophylaxis after plaster cast immobilization, (prolonged) arthroscopic surgery and isolated lower extremity trauma. Different opinions exist on the sole use of aspirin and mechanical prophylaxis and on the use of vitamin K antagonists after major hip and knee surgery.

Conclusion

Based on the same available literature, different guidelines recommend different thromboprophylactic regimens. Ideally, the grade of recommendation should be based on the same level of evidence world-wide. Whilst there is no agreement on the relevance of different endpoints (e.g. asymptomatic DVT), it is very difficult to reach a consensus. Thromboprophylaxis guidelines should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis, because the evidence is evolving rapidly.

Dabigatran etexilate — venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty is characterized by once-daily regimens of 150 mg/d or 220 mg/d beginning soon after surgery with a half-dose of 75 mg or 110 mg, compared against enoxaparin 40 mg/d started the evening before surgery or 30 mg bid started 12 to 24 h after surgery; across trials the primary effectiveness outcome was "total VTE", evaluable in 73% to 78% of patients, and the dabigatran regimens were "noninferior" to 40 mg/d enoxaparin in hip and knee arthroplasty but each was less effective than 30 mg bid after knee arthroplasty, with first dabigatran doses given 1 to 4 h postoperatively in the 40 mg/d comparisons and 12 to 24 h in the bid comparison; in a subsequent hip arthroplasty comparison, 220 mg/d dabigatran was again "noninferior" to 40 mg/d enoxaparin for "total VTE" and appeared more effective for "major VTE" (a composite of proximal DVT, nonfatal PE, and death related to VTE).

### Compliance with recommended prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism: improving the use and rate of uptake of clinical practice guidelines [^887b7845]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Although several authoritative, evidence-based, guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been published, the use of VTE prophylaxis in routine clinical practice varies markedly. Even in orthopedic surgery, the indication for which prophylaxis is used most often, a significant proportion of surgeons do not use routine prophylaxis. When prophylaxis is used, guideline recommendations are often not followed. A number of factors may contribute to the under-use of guidelines. Physician-related factors include: a lack of awareness of, or familiarity with, the guidelines; a perception that VTE is not a significant problem or that VTE prophylaxis is ineffective; and concern about potential bleeding risks. The guidelines may also be perceived to be too complicated or difficult to apply in a routine manner. In addition, a lack of facilities or resources may also present a barrier to implementation of the guidelines. A number of strategies are being investigated in an attempt to improve compliance with guidelines for VTE prophylaxis. For example, the Investigators Against Thromboembolism (INATE) initiative has developed a simplified pocket guideline on VTE prophylaxis in orthopedic and trauma surgery in order to raise awareness of the current guideline recommendations.

Low-dose aspirin (160 mg/d for 35 days) vs no prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery — PEP trial evidence shows in a blinded, placebo-controlled study of > 13,000 hip fracture and almost 4,100 elective arthroplasty patients that benefits included a 25% reduction in nonfatal symptomatic DVT (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53–0.96) and a 58% reduction in fatal PE (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25–0.72), with a possible increase in nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.98–2.57); the first dose was chewed prior to surgery. There have been no studies of low-dose aspirin in nonorthopedic surgical patients; attendees at the AT9 final conference voted that low-dose aspirin should not be an alternative for pharmacologic prophylaxis in most nonorthopedic surgical patients, and recommendations apply only when low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are contraindicated or not available.

### Risk factors for venous thromboembolism after vascular surgery and implications for chemoprophylaxis strategies [^5ab1f027]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Although our findings have confirmed the utility of the Caprini score for risk stratifying VTE risk after vascular surgery, additional patient and clinical factors not included in the model are relevant to consider. In our study, no patient with a length of stay of ≤ 2 days had developed VTE (0 of 159 patients). We additionally identified CKD-5 as a significant risk factor for VTE, also not included in the Caprini model. Although patients with CKD-5 are known to have impaired platelet function in the setting of uremia, CKD-5 is also known to cause deficiencies in fibrinolysis and natural anticoagulant pathways, which predispose patients to thrombotic complications.

To explore whether specific cutoffs for initiating prophylaxis are associated with VTE, we incorporated the time to chemoprophylaxis initiation in our multivariable models examining the risk factors for VTE. Studying the chemoprophylaxis practices used for vascular surgery patients is complicated by the near ubiquitous use of intraoperative heparin, frequent use of therapeutic postoperative anticoagulation, and high rates of antiplatelet therapy. To explore the use of both anticoagulant (prophylactic and therapeutic dose) and antiplatelet therapy, we accounted for the time to postoperative initiation of any anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, including all patients in the model with a length of stay of > 2 days. We found a significant association between the time to the initiation of any anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and those who developed VTE. Patients who had received anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy initiated early after surgery (within 24 hours) had had a significantly reduced odds of VTE compared with those who had had antithrombotic medications initiated > 4 days postoperatively, with a nonsignificant decrease compared with patients with anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy initiated between 2 and 4 days postoperatively. These findings are supported by a prior multicenter retrospective analysis that examined the association of chemoprophylaxis timing with VTE development after vascular surgery in which patients receiving VTE prophylaxis within 24 hours had a decreased incidence of postoperative VTE after lower extremity bypass. The potential role of antiplatelet therapy in mitigating the VTE risk in vascular patients is also supported by our findings of decreased VTE risk associated with coronary artery disease. That decreased risk can be explained by the greater rates of dual antiplatelet therapy among these patients. Antiplatelet therapy is known to be an effective VTE prevention strategy for orthopedic surgery patients but has not been recommended for nonorthopedic surgical populations for chemoprophylaxis except when low dose molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin are contraindicated.

Rivaroxaban — clinical use and evaluated doses: "Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and is currently approved in many countries, including the United States, for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery". Development includes "the treatment of VTE and the prevention of acute ischemic stroke in patients with AF". In phase III trials it was "more effective than the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin" for postoperative VTE prevention and "more effective than placebo" for secondary prevention after an initial "6- to 12-month" anticoagulation course. "The doses evaluated were 10 mg once daily in major orthopedic surgery and 20 mg once daily in the long-term secondary prevention of VTE".

### Enoxaparin sodium [^9c2831b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Extended Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis following Hip Replacement Surgery: In a study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, patients were treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously, initiated up to 12 hours prior to surgery for the prophylaxis of postoperative DVT. At the end of the peri-operative period, all patients underwent bilateral venography. In a double-blind design, those patients with no venous thromboembolic disease were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 40 mg (n = 90) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n = 89) for 3 weeks. A total of 179 patients were randomized in the double-blind phase of the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 47 to 87 years (mean age 69.4 years) with 57% men and 43% women. In this population of patients, the incidence of DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 19).

In a second study, patients undergoing hip replacement surgery were treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously, initiated up to 12 hours prior to surgery. All patients were examined for clinical signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. In a double-blind design, patients without clinical signs and symptoms of VTE disease were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 40 mg (n = 131) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n = 131) for 3 weeks. A total of 262 patients were randomized in the study double-blind phase and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 44 to 87 years (mean age 68.5 years) with 43.1% men and 56.9% women. Similar to the first study the incidence of DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, with a statistically significant difference in both total DVT (enoxaparin sodium 21 [16%] versus placebo 45 [34%]; p = 0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium 8 [6%] versus placebo 28 [21%]; p = < 0.001).

### Postorthopedic surgery joint replacement surgery venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [^1d4fc1aa]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Elective total hip or knee arthroplasty places patients at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). As our understanding of the pathophysiology of VTE after joint arthroplasty has increased, pharmacologic strategies have been developed to target different aspects of the coagulation cascade. Various approaches have been used as risk reduction strategies. In 2011 and 2014 the Food and Drug Administration approved rivaroxaban and apixaban as new oral antithrombotic agents. Although controversies remain with regard to the ideal VTE pharmacoprophylactic agent, this class of novel oral anticoagulants has been demonstrated to be safe and to be more effective than enoxaparin.

➤

The selection of an agent for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a balance between efficacy and safety. The goal is to prevent symptomatic VTE while limiting the risk of bleeding.

➤

The optimal agent for VTE prophylaxis has not been identified. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend that, after total hip or total knee arthroplasty, patients receive at least 10 to 14 days of 1 of the following prophylaxis agents: aspirin, adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist, apixaban, dabigatran, fondaparinux, low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose unfractionated heparin, rivaroxaban, or portable home mechanical compression.

➤

The use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis has increased in popularity over the past decade because it is effective, and it is an oral agent that does not require monitoring. The true efficacy of aspirin needs to be determined in multicenter randomized clinical trials.

➤

Validated risk stratification protocols are essential to identify the safest and most effective regimen for VTE prophylaxis for individual patients. There is no consensus regarding the optimal method for risk stratification; the selection of a prophylaxis agent should be determined by shared decision-making with the patient to balance the risk of thrombosis versus bleeding.

➤

Patients with atrial fibrillation being treated with chronic warfarin therapy or direct oral anticoagulants should stop the agent 3 to 5 days prior to surgery. Patients do not typically require bridging therapy prior to surgery.

### Surgical technical evidence review of hip fracture surgery conducted for the AHRQ safety program for improving surgical care and recovery [^17dfef64]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; eg, warfarin): A SR of 30 RCTs comparing VKA initiated prior to HFS found reduced DVT and PE incidence in the VKA groups compared to control groups without prophylaxis. A 3-armed RCT separate from the SR included 194 patients and compared warfarin (international normalized ratio 2.0–2.7), aspirin (650 mg twice daily), and no prophylaxis. This study found that when agents were continued for 21 days postoperatively, warfarin, but not aspirin, decreased the incidence of VTE. There were similar rates of clinically relevant bleeding between the groups. The study defined major bleeding as requiring transfusion of at least 2 units of blood, a decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more, or retroperitoneal or intracranial bleeding.

Timing of thromboprophylaxis: A large observational study comparing preoperative versus postoperative start of LMWH (dalteparin or enoxaparin) in patients with hip fracture found that postoperative initiation was associated with a higher risk of death and reoperation due to infection or hematoma. The NICE guidelines recommend that fondaparinux should be started 6 hours after surgical closure, and LMWH/UFH should be stopped 12 hours prior to surgery and restarted 6 to 12 hours after surgery. The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST (American College of Chest Physicians)) recommends patients receiving LMWH start either 12 hours or more preoperatively or 12 hours or more postoperatively.

Duration of thromboprophylaxis: A RCT comparing fondaparinux started on the day of surgery and continued for either 25–31 days or 6–8 days followed by placebo found that extended prophylaxis was associated with a 95.9% relative reduction in VTE.

The AAOS guidelines also recommend VTE prophylaxis based on moderate evidence (Table 3).

Summary and recommendations

Several MAs and subsequent RCTs have evaluated various pharmacological agents to protect against VTE in HFS patients. Pulmonary embolus prevention is difficult to assess due to low incidence. Aspirin, VKA, heparins, and factor Xa inhibitors reduce DVT risk, but it is unclear which agent is preferred. Although guidelines from CHEST and NICE provide recommendations, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether thromboprophylaxis should be started preoperatively or postoperatively. Depending on the agent, extended therapy for 21 to 31 days appears to be superior for the prevention of VTE.
