## Question

Is bicarbonate an electrolyte

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bicarbonate is an electrolyte. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of an electrolyte in physiology and pharmacology. Then, I should verify how authoritative sources like the FDA label sodium bicarbonate. Next, I will examine clinical contexts where bicarbonate is treated as an electrolyte, including dosing in milliequivalents and its role in acid-base balance. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent ambiguities and synthesize a clear conclusion with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: electrolytes are substances that dissociate into ions in solution, enabling electrical conductivity, and in clinical practice we routinely measure and manipulate them to maintain fluid, acid-base, and electrophysiologic homeostasis. Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates into sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3−) ions, which fits that definition, and the FDA explicitly describes sodium bicarbonate injection as an electrolyte replenisher and systemic alkalizer, which directly answers the question in the affirmative [^9c4f0b75] [^7983be48] [^3f533989].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic framing so I don't overgeneralize: multiple FDA labels consistently state that sodium bicarbonate dissociates to provide sodium and bicarbonate ions, and that bicarbonate is a normal constituent of body fluids with a typical plasma range of 24–31 mEq/L, reinforcing that bicarbonate is handled clinically as an ionic species and an electrolyte. This is further echoed in drug information summaries and clinical pharmacology sections of labeling [^3f533989] [^431eb776] [^1dfa82c2] [^6ba7b635].

> I should confirm the clinical dosing language because it reveals how clinicians treat bicarbonate: sodium bicarbonate is dosed in milliequivalents, the same unit used for electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and chloride, and the label notes that 84 mg equals 1 mEq each of Na+ and HCO3−, which is a hallmark of electrolyte dosing and replacement strategies in practice [^9c4f0b75] [^7983be48].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about its physiologic role; I need to check whether bicarbonate's acid-base function conflicts with its status as an electrolyte. The kidney tightly regulates bicarbonate reabsorption and generation to maintain acid-base balance, and bicarbonate participates in the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer system, yet this regulatory role is complementary to, not mutually exclusive with, its identity as an ion and electrolyte in plasma and dialysate solutions used for correction of acid-base disturbances [^6414a1e0] [^b407d59c] [^915c9b69].

> But wait, what if someone argues that bicarbonate is "just a buffer" rather than a true electrolyte? Let me reconsider in light of clinical usage: in critical care and nephrology, bicarbonate is manipulated as part of electrolyte management, appears in electrolyte panels and dialysate prescriptions, and is monitored alongside sodium, potassium, and chloride. This operational reality, together with its ionic dissociation and mEq-based dosing, solidifies its classification as an electrolyte in medicine, even as it also serves a buffering function [^b407d59c] [^4cfbc085] [^d0551a6a].

> I should double-check guideline language to ensure consistency: contemporary guidelines for CKD and dialysis discuss bicarbonate within electrolyte management frameworks, including targets for serum bicarbonate and dialysate buffer composition, which again reflects that bicarbonate is treated as an electrolyte in clinical decision-making and prescriptions [^871d3d13] [^4cfbc085] [^666068c0].

> In summary, yes — bicarbonate is an electrolyte. It dissociates into ions in solution, is dosed in milliequivalents, is described by regulatory labeling as an electrolyte replenisher, and is managed clinically within electrolyte-focused algorithms for acid-base and fluid-electrolyte disturbances [^9c4f0b75] [^3f533989] [^871d3d13] [^4cfbc085].

Bicarbonate is an **electrolyte** because it is a negatively charged ion (HCO3−) that dissociates in water and conducts electricity. It is a **key component of the body's acid–base balance**, with a normal serum concentration of 24–31 mEq/L [^3f533989], and is regulated by the kidneys. Clinically, bicarbonate is used to treat metabolic acidosis and is included in electrolyte panels and dialysis solutions, underscoring its role as an essential electrolyte [^b407d59c].

---

## Chemical properties of bicarbonate

Bicarbonate (HCO3−) is a **polyatomic anion** composed of one carbon, three oxygen, and one hydrogen atom. It is the conjugate base of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and is amphoteric, meaning it can act as both an acid and a base. In aqueous solution, bicarbonate dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and carbonate ions (CO32−), contributing to the buffering capacity of biological systems.

---

## Physiological role of bicarbonate

Bicarbonate plays a **critical role in maintaining acid–base homeostasis** in the human body. It is a primary component of the bicarbonate buffer system, which helps regulate blood pH by neutralizing excess acids or bases. The kidneys regulate bicarbonate levels by reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate and generating new bicarbonate through the excretion of hydrogen ions and ammonium ions [^6414a1e0]. The normal serum bicarbonate concentration in adults ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/L [^3f533989].

---

## Clinical significance of bicarbonate

Bicarbonate is **routinely measured in clinical laboratories** as part of electrolyte panels and blood gas analyses. Abnormal bicarbonate levels can indicate underlying metabolic disturbances, such as metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. Clinicians use bicarbonate measurements to diagnose and monitor conditions such as:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Characterized by low bicarbonate levels, often due to renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, or lactic acidosis [^049b8541].
- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Characterized by elevated bicarbonate levels, often due to excessive vomiting, diuretic use, or overuse of bicarbonate supplements [^bfc7c3fd].
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Patients with CKD often develop metabolic acidosis due to impaired bicarbonate regeneration, necessitating monitoring and supplementation [^d4a20ae1].

---

## Clinical use of bicarbonate

Bicarbonate is **commonly used clinically** to treat metabolic acidosis, particularly in patients with CKD or acute kidney injury (AKI). Sodium bicarbonate supplementation is recommended in CKD patients with serum bicarbonate levels below 22 mmol/L to prevent progression of kidney disease and improve metabolic outcomes [^871d3d13]. In acute settings, intravenous sodium bicarbonate is used to correct severe metabolic acidosis, especially in cases of lactic acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis [^d0551a6a].

---

## Bicarbonate in dialysis

Bicarbonate is a **critical component of dialysis solutions**, where it serves as a buffer to correct acid–base imbalances in patients with renal failure. Dialysate bicarbonate concentrations are carefully adjusted to maintain optimal acid–base balance and prevent complications such as metabolic alkalosis or acidosis [^4cfbc085].

---

## Conclusion

Bicarbonate is an **essential electrolyte** that plays a vital role in maintaining acid–base balance in the human body. Its chemical properties, physiological functions, and clinical applications underscore its importance in both health and disease.

### Assessing acid-base status: physiologic versus physicochemical approach [^c6fa127d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The physiologic approach has long been used in assessing acid-base status. This approach considers acids as hydrogen ion donors and bases as hydrogen ion acceptors and the acid-base status of the organism as reflecting the interaction of net hydrogen ion balance with body buffers. In the physiologic approach, the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer pair is used for assessing acid-base status and blood pH is determined by carbonic acid (ie, Paco 2 ) and serum bicarbonate levels. More recently, the physicochemical approach was introduced, which has gained popularity, particularly among intensivists and anesthesiologists. This approach posits that the acid-base status of body fluids is determined by changes in the dissociation of water that are driven by the interplay of 3 independent variables: the sum of strong (fully dissociated) cation concentrations minus the sum of strong anion concentrations (strong ion difference); the total concentration of weak acids; and Paco 2 . These 3 independent variables mechanistically determine both hydrogen ion concentration and bicarbonate concentration of body fluids, which are considered as dependent variables. Our experience indicates that the average practitioner is familiar with only one of these approaches and knows very little, if any, about the other approach. In the present Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case, we attempt to bridge this knowledge gap by contrasting the physiologic and physicochemical approaches to assessing acid-base status. We first outline the essential features, advantages, and limitations of each of the 2 approaches and then apply each approach to the same patient presentation. We conclude with our view about the optimal approach.

- SPL UNCLASSIFIED DESCRIPTION Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, hypertonic solution of sodium bicarbonate in water for injection for administration by the intravenous route as an electrolyte replenisher and systemic alkalizer. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only for use as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required, the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Sodium bicarbonate, 84 mg is equal to one milliequivalent each of Na+ and HCO3¯. Sodium Bicarbonate, USP is chemically designated NaHCO3, a white crystalline powder soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H2O.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium and bicarbonate ions. Sodium is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered “labile” since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion it may be converted to carbonic acid and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide excreted by the lung.

Normally a ratio of 1: 20 is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine. INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION. INGREDIENTS AND APPEARANCE SODIUM BICARBONATE sodium bicarbonate injection.

Bethesda, MD: American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, 2012 p. 2750-2754 Diabetic ketoacidosis: although the specific role of sodium bicarbonate therapy in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis has not been established, when IV sodium bicarbonate is administered, the acidosis should only partially be corrected, generally to an arterial pH of about 7. 2, in order to avoid rebound alkalosis. Stability Sodium bicarbonate is stable in dry air, but slowly decomposes into sodium carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water in moist air. When heated, sodium bicarbonate loses water and carbon dioxide and is converted into sodium carbonate. Solutions of sodium carbonate are much more alkaline than sodium bicarbonate; since sodium carbonate may be formed when the dry salt or its solutions are sterilized with heat, the pH of heat-sterilized solutions or of solutions prepared from heat-sterilized powder should be determined prior to use.

When sodium bicarbonate is combined with acids in aqueous solutions, a vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide gas occurs; the liberated carbon dioxide bubbles through the solution resulting in effervescence. In the dry state, sodium bicarbonate and acids do not react. McEvoy GK, ed. Drug Information 2012. Bethesda, MD: American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, 2012 p. 2750-2754.

### Sodium bicarbonate supplements for treating acute kidney injury [^1992f075]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, serious, but potentially treatable condition. Because AKI is often associated with acidosis, it has become common practice to recommend administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct acid imbalance.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcome measures were patients' need for renal replacement therapy; return to baseline kidney function; and overall survival.

Search Methods

In November 2011 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register using keywords relevant to this review. The register is populated using searches of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and handsearching records from renal-related journals and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of sodium bicarbonate supplements, administered by any route, for the treatment of adults with AKI were to be included. The search strategy did not restrict inclusion based on an upper age limit or publication language. We did not consider inclusion of studies that investigated use of sodium bicarbonate for AKI prevention.

Data Collection and Analysis

All authors planned to independently assess and extracted information. Information was to be collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes. Results were to be expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Although our literature search identified four studies, none of these met our predetermined selection criteria. Hence, no suitable studies were identified for inclusion in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCT evidence - supportive or otherwise - for the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. We concluded that there is an urgent need for well conducted RCTs in this area.

### A basic solution for a complex problem: does treatment of metabolic acidosis slow CKD progression? [^610a6357]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of This Review

Metabolic acidosis is frequently encountered in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with increasing prevalence as kidney function worsens. Treating electrolyte disturbances is the sine qua non of Nephrologists, and alkali therapy to normalize serum bicarbonate levels and slow progression of kidney disease has been embedded in clinical practice guidelines for decades on the basis of animal models and controversial clinical trials. This review will critically appraise the literature base for this recommendation and determine whether the available evidence supports this common practice, which is a timely endeavor considering the impending demotion of metabolic acidosis treatment from recommendation to practice point in forthcoming KDIGO guidelines.

Recent Findings

Earlier, open-label, studies supporting the utility of sodium bicarbonate therapy to slow progression of chronic kidney disease have been challenged by more recent, blinded, studies failing to show benefit on CKD progression. This was further demonstrated in the absence of concomitant sodium administration with the hydrochloric acid binder veverimer, which failed to demonstrate benefit on renal death, end stage kidney disease or 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in a large multicenter trial.

Summary

The current body of literature does not support the routine treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD and the authors agree with the forthcoming KDIGO guidelines to de-emphasize this common practice.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^81b4c8bb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### Metabolic acidosis [^afff4465]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^07012828]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in the rational use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### Current status of bicarbonate in CKD [^cda8b604]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis was one of the earliest complications to be recognized and explained pathologically in patients with CKD. Despite the accumulated evidence of deleterious effects of acidosis, treatment of acidosis has been tested very little, especially with respect to standard clinical outcomes. On the basis of fundamental research and small alkali supplementation trials, correcting metabolic acidosis has a strikingly broad array of potential benefits. This review summarizes the published evidence on the association between serum bicarbonate and clinical outcomes. We discuss the role of alkali supplementation in CKD as it relates to retarding kidney disease progression, improving metabolic and musculoskeletal complications.

---

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^c5b09699]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis remains controversial in the medical community. Review of the literature overall does not support routine use of bicarbonate, particularly in anion gap metabolic acidosis. The processes underlying pH balance in human physiology are multifaceted, and an understanding of the mechanisms at play, as well as the methods of providing sodium bicarbonate supplementation, will serve an emergency physician well. There are few data demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with sodium bicarbonate use in patients with shock states, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac arrest (except in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity or hyperkalemia), as shown in Table 2. However, it may benefit patients with NAGMA and, despite physiologic rationale, there are minimal data from RCTs to justify this.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^431eb776]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1 :20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### The choice of dialysate bicarbonate: do different concentrations make a difference? [^3effe810]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease; it is typically caused by the accumulation of sulfate, phosphorus, and organic anions. Metabolic acidosis is correlated with several adverse outcomes, such as morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. Thus, correction of metabolic acidosis is fundamental for the adequate management of many systemic complications of chronic kidney disease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, acid-base homeostasis depends on many factors including the following: net acid production, amount of alkali given by the dialysate bath, duration of the interdialytic period, and residual diuresis, if any. Recent literature data suggest that the development of metabolic alkalosis after dialysis may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Our review is focused on the potential effects of different dialysate bicarbonate concentrations on hard outcomes such as mortality. Unfortunately, no randomized studies exist about this issue. Acid-base equilibrium is a complex and vital system whose regulation is impaired in chronic kidney disease. We await further studies to assess the extent to which acid-base status is a major determinant of overall survival in patients undergoing hemodialysis. For the present, the clinician should understand that target values for predialysis serum bicarbonate concentration have been established primarily based on observational studies and expert opinion. Based on this, we should keep the predialysis serum bicarbonate level at least at 22 mmol/l. Furthermore, a specific focus should be addressed by the attending nephrologist to the clinical and nutritional status of the major outliers on both the acid and alkaline sides of the curve.

### Approach to metabolic alkalosis [^bfc7c3fd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a common disorder, accounting for half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients. It is the result of an increase in bicarbonate production, a decrease in bicarbonate excretion, or a loss of hydrogen ions. Most causes of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into 4 categories: chloride depletion alkalosis, mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, and excess alkali administration. Treatment is usually supportive and based on cause of the alkalosis.

Guideline 6: Electrolytes—acid load management and bicarbonate maintenance in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) provides the following statements. In adults with CKD 1-4, we suggest reducing net acid production (NEAP) through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) in order to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function. In adults with CKD 3-5D, we recommend reducing net acid production (NEAP) through increased bicarbonate or a citric acid/sodium citrate solution supplementation (1C) in order to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function. In adults with CKD 3-5D, we suggest that adults with CKD 3-5D maintain serum bicarbonate levels at 24-26 mmol/ L (OPINION). Eleven studies examined the association between dietary acid load/oral bicarbonate supplements on health outcomes in the CKD population.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature of bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included: “bicarbonate,” “cardiac arrest,” “lactate,” “lactic acidosis,” “diabetic ketoacidosis,” “rhabdomyolysis,” “acidosis,” and “acidemia.” Abstracts were reviewed by two authors (S.H. G.W.) for appropriateness and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author (C.T.). Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references of selected articles. We reviewed a total of 143 abstracts, of which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

Levels of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used for the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

### Bench-to-bedside review: a brief history of clinical acid-base [^7d85f840]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The history of assessing the acid-base equilibrium and associated disorders is intertwined with the evolution of the definition of an acid. In the 1950s clinical chemists combined the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid to produce the current bicarbonate ion-centred approach to metabolic acid-base disorders. Stewart repackaged pre-1950 ideas of acid-base in the late 1970s, including the Van Slyke definition of an acid. Stewart also used laws of physical chemistry to produce a new acid-base approach. This approach, using the strong ion difference (particularly the sodium chloride difference) and the concentration of weak acids (particularly albumin), pushes bicarbonate into a minor role as an acid-base indicator rather than as an important mechanism. The Stewart approach may offer new insights into acid-base disorders and therapies.

### What should define optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease? [^55a5e1a9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of metabolic acidosis is an important goal in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in this setting - various expert groups from around the world have set different goals for serum bicarbonate levels for patients with CKD. Accumulating evidence seems to indicate that achieving an arterial pH closer to the upper limit of the reference range may have even greater benefits than maintaining the arterial pH closer to the lower limit of the reference range. This benefit seems to be particularly relevant for patients with protein-energy wasting and we present a review of the evidence that supports this argument. Routine measurement of arterial pH, however, is not feasible in clinical practice; using the Henderson equation, a high-normal arterial pH is generally expected to be associated with a serum bicarbonate level of 24-30 mEq/l and should be the therapeutic goal for chronic kidney disease patients with protein-energy wasting.

### SODIUM BICARBONATE INJECTION USP, 8.4% 50 mEq / 50 mL (1 (...) [^148f5a9c]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Rx Only FOR THE CORRECTION OF METABOLIC ACIDOSIS AND OTHER CONDITIONS REQUIRING SYSTEMIC ALKALINIZATION Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, hypertonic solution of sodium bicarbonate in water for injection for administration by the intravenous route as an electrolyte replenisher and systemic alkalizer. Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium and bicarbonate ions. Sodium is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess.

Bicarbonate anion is considered “labile” since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion it may be converted to carbonic acid and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1: 20 is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine. Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2 content is crucial – e. g. , cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis. Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is contraindicated in patients who are losing chloride by vomiting or from continuous gastrointestinal suction, and in patients receiving diuretics known to produce a hypochloremic alkalosis.

Laboratory Tests The aim of all bicarbonate therapy is to produce a substantial correction of the low total CO2 content and blood pH, but the risks of overdosage and alkalosis should be avoided. Hence, repeated fractional doses and periodic monitoring by appropriate laboratory tests are recommended to minimize the possibility of overdosage.

In addition, the bicarbonate ‘setting’ on machines from different manufacturers, refers variably to the bicarbonate concentration either prior to (eg. Braun) or after (eg. Fresenius) mixing with the electrolyte concentrate. The terms ‘actual’ bicarbonate (because that is what is actually added as sodium bicarbonate) and ‘final’ bicarbonate (because that is the bicarbonate in the dialysate at the point of use) are sometimes used to separate their meaning. However, the total buffer concentration remains the same before and after this mixing, so this term has a clear unambiguous meaning (equivalent to the sum of bicarbonate and acetate concentrations in the final dialysate). In a discussion of the DOPPS study of dialysate bicarbonate, Tentori observed that when asked either for the bicarbonate or total buffer concentration, most DOPPS units returned the same figure, suggesting that clinicians generally mean ‘actual’ rather than ‘final’ bicarbonate, which is the same as total dialysate buffer.

The factors affecting pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate levels include protein intake, residual kidney function, interdialytic fluid gain, dialysate buffer concentration, dialysis adequacy, oral sodium bicarbonate and other alkaline medications such as calcium carbonate.

Observational studies of pre-dialysis levels usually show a J-shaped mortality curve, with most of the excess risk associated with high levels of bicarbonate, but this appears to be due to the close link between high bicarbonate and malnutrition. For example, in a study of 56385 between 2001 and 2003, Wu observed a progressive increase in mortality as pre-dialysis bicarbonate increased beyond 23mmol/L, but also strong associations between higher bicarbonate and worsening markers of nutrition including albumin, phosphate and protein intake. When adjusted for comorbidity and 12 parameters associated with malnutrition, most of the increased mortality appears with low bicarbonate, at levels below 18–21mmol/L. Some guideline groups have therefore increased the lower limit for optimal pre-dialysis bicarbonate to 20 or 22mmol/L.

### Bicarbonate-versus lactate-buffered solutions for acute continuous haemodiafiltration or haemofiltration [^c7bba528]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe loss of kidney function that results in patients' inability to appropriately excrete nitrogenous wastes and creatinine. Continuous haemodiafiltration (HDF) or haemofiltration (HF) are commonly used renal replacement therapies for people with AKI. Buffered dialysates and solutions used in HDF or HF have varying effects on acid-base physiology and several electrolytes. The benefits and harms of bicarbonate- versus lactate-buffered HDF or HF solutions for treating patients with AKI remain unclear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of bicarbonate- versus lactate-buffered solutions for HDF or HF for treating people with AKI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 6 January 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that reported comparisons of bicarbonate-buffered solutions with lactate-buffered solutions for AKI were selected for inclusion irrespective of publication status or language.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, and where necessary the full text of studies, to determine which satisfied our inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two authors who independently assessed studies for eligibility and quality using a standardised data extraction form. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified four studies (171 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. Overall, study quality was suboptimal. There were significant reporting omissions related to methodological issues and potential harms. Outcome measures were not defined or reported adequately. The studies were small and lacked follow-up phases.Serum lactate levels were significantly lower in patients treated with bicarbonate-buffered solutions (4 studies, 171 participants: MD -1.09 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.30 to -0.87; I(2) = 0%). There were no differences in mortality (3 studies, 163 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.15; I(2) = 0%); serum bicarbonate levels (3 studies, 163 participants: MD 0.27 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.45 to 1.99; I(2) = 78%), serum creatinine (2 studies, 137 participants: MD -22.81 µmol/L, 95% CI -129.61 to 83.99; I(2) = 73%), serum base excess (3 studies, 145 participants: MD 0.80, 95% CI -0.91 to 2.50; I(2) = 38%), serum pH (4 studies, 171 participants: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; I(2) = 70%) or carbon dioxide partial pressure (3 studies, 151 participants: MD -1.04, 95% CI -3.84 to 1.76; I(2) = 83%). A single study reported fewer cardiovascular events (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.79), higher mean arterial pressure (10.25 mm Hg, 95% CI 6.68 to 13.82) and less hypotensive events (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75) in patients receiving bicarbonate-buffered solutions. One study reported no significant difference in central venous pressure (MD 2.00 cm H2O, 95% CI -0.7 to, 4.77). Total length of hospital and ICU stay and relapse were not reported by any of the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no significant different between bicarbonate- and lactate-buffered solutions for mortality, serum bicarbonate levels, serum creatinine, serum base excess, serum pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, central venous pressure and serum electrolytes. Patients treated with bicarbonate-buffered solutions may experience fewer cardiovascular events, lower serum lactate levels, higher mean arterial pressure and less hypotensive events. With the exception of mortality, we were not able to assess the main primary outcomes of this review - length of time in ICU, total length of hospital stay and relapse.

Of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 1 new trial has been published since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains limited by a low number of outcomes, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important kidney effect of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^aa294f1f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Critically ill patients frequently present with disorders of acid–base homeostasis, making arterial blood gas interpretation a cornerstone activity in the clinical assessment of patients by intensivists. Many of us are unaware that we’ve been taught to interpret acid–base homeostasis in the “bicarbonate era”, where a focus on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for dissociation of carbon dioxide has led us to believe that bicarbonate is a major determinant of acid–base status. However, when we try to understand some of the commonly encountered acid–base abnormalities in critical illness, such as hyperchloremia, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation leaves us yearning for a better explanation.

Forty years ago, the Canadian physiologist Peter Stewart provided a better explanation. He described an approach to understanding acid–base in which bicarbonate is not the major determinant of acid–base status. Although it is referred to as the “modern” approach, Stewart’s explanation incorporated time-tested concepts of physical chemistry, such as conservation of mass, dissociation of electrolytes, and electroneutrality, some of which date back to the 18th century. Therefore, it is perhaps more accurate to refer to Stewart’s work as the physicochemical approach. Stewart applied these physicochemical principles by using simple algebra to demonstrate that plasma pH (and bicarbonate concentration) is determined by the P 2, the strong ion difference, and the concentration of weak acids (primarily albumin and phosphate).

The strong ion difference in plasma is determined by the relatively higher concentration of sodium compared with chloride, and the difference is typically about 40 mEq/L. The electroneutrality of plasma is maintained because the charge gap between these two strong ions is made up by the dissociation of weak acids into their respective anions, including the dissociation of dissolved carbon dioxide into bicarbonate. By showing that plasma proteins (weak acids) and dissolved strong ions also participate in acid–base homeostasis, the physicochemical approach provides an explanation for acid–base disorders commonly encountered in critical illness, such as hypoalbuminemia and hyperchloremia. However, although this approach is mathematically accurate, it oversimplifies some of the mechanistic insights, which is perhaps why reception has been mixed, ranging from full embracement at the bedside to outright hostility.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^bfebe132]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.2 - Selection of dialysate buffer

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate in the range 18.0-26.0mmo/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to exposure to air) when interpreting levels. [1C]

We suggest the term ‘dialysate buffer’ rather than ‘dialysate bicarbonate’ to avoid confusion arising from differences in manufacturers’ terminology. [2C]

We suggest choosing dialysate buffer below or equal to 37.0mEq/L for the majority of patients, using a standardised or individualised approach. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to abnormal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate, which may include increasing dialysis dose, oral bicarbonate, nutritional support, or individualising dialysate buffer. [2D]

Rationale

We suggest a combined approach to abnormal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate, which may include increasing dialysis dose, oral bicarbonate, nutritional support, or individualising dialysate buffer. [2D]

The literature on dialysate bicarbonate is difficult to interpret due to unclear definitions when reporting the bicarbonate and additional alkali components. Most commonly the electrolyte concentrate contains a non-bicarbonate acid, to reduce the deposition of calcium and magnesium salts – acetic acid is perhaps the most common, but citric acid and sodium diacetate may also be used.

When mixed to form the dialysate, acetate reacts with sodium bicarbonate to form sodium acetate, water and carbon dioxide:

The addition of 3mmol of acetic acid to a litre solution containing 35mmol of bicarbonate therefore reduces the bicarbonate concentration to 32mmol/L. In publications, bicarbonate concentration in this dialysate may variably be referred to as having a bicarbonate concentration of 32 or 35mmol/L, with the acetate content rarely reported.

### Posttransplant metabolic acidosis: a neglected factor in renal transplantation? [^c41b0092]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The occurrence and pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis after renal transplantation is reviewed. Posttransplant acidosis is shown to be a key mechanism for major metabolic complications in mineral and muscle metabolism, and for anemia, discussed in the context of both acidosis and renal transplantation.

Recent Findings

Continuous improvement in kidney transplant survival has shifted attention to long-term outcomes, specifically to disorders linked to cardiovascular disease, physical capacity and quality of life. Metabolic acidosis is gaining growing acceptance as a clinical entity and has occasionally come into focus in the context of renal transplantation. The possible link to metabolic disturbances resulting in impairment of musculoskeletal disorders and physical limitations, however, has not been considered specifically.

Summary

Available evidence suggests a high prevalence of (compensated) metabolic acidosis after renal transplantation, presenting as low serum bicarbonate and impaired renal acid excretion. This condition is associated with relevant disorders in mineral metabolism and muscle function. Current knowledge about the effects of acidosis on renal electrolyte handling, mineral metabolism and protein synthesis suggests that acid/base derangements contribute to the muscle and bone pathology, as well as anemia, encountered after kidney transplantation. Consequently, posttransplant acidosis may be a relevant factor in the causal pathway of impaired physical capacity observed in this patient group.

### Metabolic alkalosis treatment standard [^80ebf359]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney is poised to defend against development of metabolic alkalosis through non-adaptive mechanisms in the proximal nephron and adaptive processes in the distal nephron. Despite a prodigious capacity to excrete base, metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients. Development of this disorder requires pathophysiologic changes leading to generation of new HCO3- combined with an augmentation in the capacity of the kidney to reclaim filtered HCO3-. The initial approach to these patients is careful assessment of effective arterial blood volume focusing on the physical examination and urine electrolytes. Identifying the mechanisms by which the kidney's ability to correct alkalosis are perturbed provides an understanding of the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. While metabolic alkalosis is frequently not dangerous, in certain settings, metabolic alkalosis may contribute to mortality and should be aggressively managed.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with metabolic acidosis—adult oral sodium bicarbonate and dietary strategies are characterized as follows: The BiCARB trial contributed 33 of 152 versus 33 of 148 kidney failure outcomes to the meta-analysis in its bicarbonate versus placebo arms, respectively (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.64–1.49), and in CKD G3–G4 aged ≥60 years with sodium bicarbonate concentration <22 mmol/l found no evidence of benefit on nonkidney outcomes; allocation to oral sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher costs and lower EQ-5D-3L associated QoL over 1 year. Placebo-controlled trials have found no good evidence that correcting sodium bicarbonate levels has good effects on clinical outcomes, but the intervention is clearly effective at increasing serum bicarbonate concentration and is associated with a reduced tendency to severe acidosis with sodium bicarbonate therapy; because correction to the normal range has not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of kidney failure, lower thresholds to initiate therapy than 18 mmol/l could be considered. Dietary modifications that limit acid-rich foods and/or increase alkaline-rich foods serve as an effective additional strategy to control metabolic acidosis, and several small RCTs of alkaline-rich plant-based diets in adults with CKD demonstrate a comparable benefit to oral sodium bicarbonate in controlling metabolic acidosis.

### Base (HCO3-/ CO32-) transport properties of SLC4 proteins: new insights in acid-base kidney physiology [^8b1d9183]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

H+ or base transporters and channels in the mammalian genome play important roles in the maintenance of numerous cellular biochemical and physiologic processes throughout the body. Among the known base transporters, those within the SLC4 and SLC26 gene families are involved in cell, transepithelial, and whole organ function. Whether the functional properties of these transporters involve HCO3-, CO32-, or HCO3-/CO32- stimulated H+ (or OH-) transport has not received widespread attention in the literature. Accordingly, "bicarbonate" is the term typically used in most textbooks without greater specificity. Moreover, clinicians and physiologists have historically focused on the blood HCO3- concentration as the base term in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in the analysis of clinical acid-base abnormalities, thus, bicarbonate has been assumed to be the species reabsorbed along the nephron as required to maintain the blood [HCO3-] at approximately 25 mM. However, accumulating data in the literature suggest that carbonate, rather than bicarbonate, is the species absorbed across the proximal tubule basolateral membrane, whereas in the collecting duct, bicarbonate is indeed transported. Various experimental approaches leading to this new concept are herein reviewed.

### Bicarbonate therapy in end-stage renal disease: current practice trends and implications [^d7976759]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Management of metabolic acidosis covers the entire spectrum from oral bicarbonate therapy and dietary modifications in chronic kidney disease to delivery of high doses of bicarbonate-based dialysate during maintenance haemodialysis (MHD). Due to the gradual depletion of the body's buffers and rapid repletion during MHD, many potential problems arise as a result of our current treatment paradigms. Several studies have given rise to conflicting data about the adverse effects of our current practice patterns in MHD. In this review, we will describe the pathophysiology and consequences of metabolic acidosis and its therapy in CKD and ESRD, and discuss current evidence supporting a more individualized approach for bicarbonate therapy in MHD.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^04714d0c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO AKI—potassium and metabolic acidosis considerations explain that when therapeutic measures that promote the intracellular shift of potassium are exhausted, an excess of potassium can only be eliminated with RRT, and using intermittent dialysis after such measures reduces extracorporeal potassium removal with a more pronounced post‑treatment rebound. For acidosis, metabolic acidosis associated with AKI can usually be corrected with bicarbonate and should rarely require urgent dialysis if not accompanied by volume overload or uremia; because pH and bicarbonate values to initiate dialysis are not supported by evidence, no standard criteria for initiating dialysis for acidosis exist, while some poisonings can contribute to acid‑base problems and RRT may facilitate removal of the offending drug.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^10d02d03]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, the controversy has left many of us wondering whether it is truly important to learn the physicochemical approach. After all, intensivists really have access to only two tools for rapid manipulation of plasma pH in the setting of acidosis: 1) hyperventilation to lower P 2 and 2) administration of sodium bicarbonate. Nonetheless, our understanding of these interventions may be improved with the physicochemical approach. For example, although the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts that hyperventilation will lower pH, it doesn’t allow us to understand that hyperventilation does this by removing carbon dioxide without changing the strong ion difference, and it doesn’t predict the effect that remaining weak acids will have on the final observed pH.

Similarly, the physicochemical approach helps us understand that administration of sodium bicarbonate increases pH by increasing the concentration of plasma sodium relative to chloride, rather than simply by adding a bicarbonate buffer to the system. This is because sodium fully dissociates in solution, whereas bicarbonate exists in equilibrium with dissolved carbon dioxide (P 2) (i.e. it behaves like a weak acid). In fact, the physicochemical approach helps us understand the potential harmful effects of a rapid bolus of sodium bicarbonate, because it predicts an increase in the local P 2. This may rapidly increase intracellular P 2, worsening intracellular acidosis, because carbon dioxide rapidly diffuses across cellular membranes.

### Reply by cove and kellum to swenson [^a61b9b54]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Editorialists :

We thank Prof. Swenson for his well-articulated letter. We conceded in our editorial that the Stewart approach doesn’t provide a strong mechanistic explanation, and therefore we also agree it doesn’t eliminate a mechanistic role of bicarbonate. Rather, the Stewart approach provides a unifying explanation of the factors determining plasma pH by incorporating the role of electrolytes, plasma proteins, and carbon dioxide in all forms, including bicarbonate. Whether one considers bicarbonate to be dependent and P 2 independent, or vice versa, depends on the system under examination. Thus, we do not think this a useful classification and avoided the terms in our editorial because we’ve shown P 2 behaves like a dependent molecule under some circumstances. However, the classification does serve the purpose of drawing attention to the fact that P 2 and HCO 3 are not independent of each other. Furthermore, the Stewart approach is not at odds with our understanding of membrane ion transporters; instead, it provides a more complete understanding of their function.

In the paper by Zanella and colleagues, normal pH was restored after induction of acidosis by removing chloride to increase the strong ion difference; this also led to an increased bicarbonate level. Both of these changes can be easily understood with the Stewart approach, whereas a bicarbonate-centric approach focuses only on the bicarbonate change that occurred. Therefore, if we simply considered the information on the blood gas, we could only classify the acid–base changes in the Zanella experiments as metabolic, respiratory, or mixed, but we would be unable to describe what had caused the observed changes. Similarly, in clinical practice, a bicarbonate-centered approach allows us to identify the presence of an acid–base derangement as effectively as the Stewart approach. However, the Stewart approach provides a more precise classification of the acid–base changes, even in the studies referenced by Prof. Swenson. Such precision is important in clinical practice where, for example, the impact of choice of resuscitation fluids on acid–base status needs to be considered. We flatly reject the assertion that teaching the Stewart approach is difficult or that it leads to increased costs and blood loss. In fact, the variables needed to apply the approach are routinely measured already. The value of the approach comes from the ability to understand the relative contributing effects of simultaneous abnormalities on the final observed pH, such as elevated lactate, hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte abnormalities, in a way that bicarbonate-centric understanding cannot.

### Perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid intravenous fluid to improve outcomes following adult surgical procedures [^38179960]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative fluid strategies influence clinical outcomes following major surgery. Many intravenous fluid preparations are based on simple solutions, such as normal saline, that feature an electrolyte composition that differs from that of physiological plasma. Buffered fluids have a theoretical advantage of containing a substrate that acts to maintain the body's acid-base status - typically a bicarbonate or a bicarbonate precursor such as maleate, gluconate, lactate, or acetate. Buffered fluids also provide additional electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, more closely matching the electrolyte balance of plasma. The putative benefits of buffered fluids have been compared with those of non-buffered fluids in the context of clinical studies conducted during the perioperative period. This review was published in 2012, and was updated in 2017.

Objectives

To review effects of perioperative intravenous administration of buffered versus non-buffered fluids for plasma volume expansion or maintenance, or both, on clinical outcomes in adults undergoing all types of surgery.

Search Methods

We electronically searched the Clinicaltrials.gov major trials registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to June 2016), Embase (1980 to June 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2016). We handsearched conference abstracts and, when possible, contacted leaders in the field. We reran the search in May 2017. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate this trial into formal review findings when we prepare the review update.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials that compared buffered versus non-buffered intravenous fluids for surgical patients were eligible for inclusion. We excluded other forms of comparison such as crystalloids versus colloids and colloids versus different colloids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus, in collaboration with a third review author. We contacted trial authors to request additional information when appropriate. We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (ORs) and for continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data via Review Manager 5.3 using fixed-effect models, and when heterogeneity was high (I² > 40%), we used random-effects models.

Main Results

This review includes, in total, 19 publications of 18 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1096 participants. We incorporated five of those 19 studies (330 participants) after the June 2016 update. Outcome measures in the included studies were thematically similar, covering perioperative electrolyte status, renal function, and acid-base status; however, we found significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the included studies. We identified variable protocols for fluid administration and total volumes of fluid administered to patients intraoperatively. Trial authors variably reported outcome data at disparate time points and with heterogeneous patient groups. Consequently, many outcome measures are reported in small group sizes, reducing overall confidence in effect size, despite relatively low inherent bias in the included studies. Several studies reported orphan outcome measures. We did not include in the results of this review one large, ongoing study of saline versus Ringer's solution.We found insufficient evidence on effects of fluid therapies on mortality and postoperative organ dysfunction (defined as renal insufficiency leading to renal replacement therapy); confidence intervals were wide and included both clinically relevant benefit and harm: mortality (Peto OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 9.33; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 6 deaths, 276 participants; low-quality evidence); renal insufficiency (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.98; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 22 events, 276 participants; low-quality evidence).We noted several metabolic differences, including a difference in postoperative pH measured at end of surgery of 0.05 units - lower in the non-buffered fluid group (12 studies with a total of 720 participants; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.07; I² = 61%). However, this difference was not maintained on postoperative day one. We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate. We observed a higher postoperative serum chloride level immediately after operation, with use of non-buffered fluids reported in 10 studies with a total of 530 participants (MD 6.77 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.38 to 10.17), and this difference persisted until day one postoperatively (five studies with a total of 258 participants; MD 8.48 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.88). We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to show effects of perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid fluids on mortality and organ system function in adult patients following surgery. Benefits of buffered fluid were measurable in biochemical terms, particularly a significant reduction in postoperative hyperchloraemia and metabolic acidosis. Small effect sizes for biochemical outcomes and lack of correlated clinical follow-up data mean that robust conclusions on major morbidity and mortality associated with buffered versus non-buffered perioperative fluid choices are still lacking. Larger studies are needed to assess these relevant clinical outcomes.

### Should chronic metabolic acidosis be treated in older people with chronic kidney disease? [^025b9a58]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness, cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group of patients.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial [^b256fb0f]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study BICAR-ICU was published by Samir Jaber and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Metabolic acidosis. In the BICAR-ICU study, the trial question was: what is the role of sodium bicarbonate therapy among ICU patients with severe metabolic acidemia? In the BICAR-ICU study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BICAR-ICU study, the population was: 389 patients (151 female, 238 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients admitted to the ICU within 48 hours experiencing severe acidemia and a total SOFA score ≥ 4 or an arterial lactate concentration ≥ 2 mmol/L. The key exclusion criteria were respiratory acidosis, proven digestive or urinary tract loss of sodium bicarbonate, stage IV CKD, ketoacidosis, and sodium bicarbonate infusion within 24 h before the screening. In the BICAR-ICU study, the interventions were: n=195 bicarbonate (4.2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion) n=194 control (no sodium bicarbonate). In the BICAR-ICU study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7 (66% vs. 71%; ARD -5.5, 95% CI -15.2 to 4.2). In the BICAR-ICU study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7 in patients with AKI scores of 2-3 (70% vs. 82%; ARD -12.3, 95% CI -26 to -0.1) Significant increase in RRT-free days during ICU stay (19 days vs. 8 days; ) No significant difference in dependence on dialysis at ICU discharge (22% vs. 34%; ARD -12.5, 95% CI -34.3 to 9.3). In the BICAR-ICU study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in ICU-acquired infections. significant difference in RRT during ICU stay (35% vs. 52%). In the BICAR-ICU study, the conclusion was: in adult patients admitted to the ICU within 48 hours experiencing severe acidemia and a total SOFA score ≥ 4 or an arterial lactate concentration ≥ 2 mmol/L, bicarbonate was not superior to control with respect to death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^a883b8b6]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondly, dialysate buffer at or over 38mmol/L should generally be avoided, and the optimal dialysate buffer for the majority of patients is probably in the region of 32–35mmol/L.

Thirdly, many other factors affect pre-dialysis bicarbonate, the dominant ones being nutritional state and dialysis dose, so that abnormalities of pre-dialysis bicarbonate should not lead clinicians automatically to think of adjusting dialysate buffer. High bicarbonate in particular should prompt a nutritional thought process initially. It is not clear that adjustment of dialysate buffer is a helpful strategy for optimising pre-dialysis bicarbonate, or that such an adjustment has much impact on pre-dialysis bicarbonate levels. Specific groups however, such as patients with abnormal levels despite optimal diet and dialysis strategy, may have something to gain from dialysate buffer adjustment. Conversely, increased dialysate buffer may be more hazardous in certain circumstances, such as in combination with low potassium dialysate.

Whilst it is a very reasonable thing to do, and might prove to be beneficial in future studies, it is not currently clear that individualization of dialysate buffer is superior to standardization.

Finally, and particularly for measurements taken remote from the laboratory, the relatively high frequency of measurement errors (for example due to carbon dioxide escape) should be remembered when interpreting bicarbonate levels.

Guideline 5.3 - Supplementation of dialysate with phosphate

We suggest considering supplementation of the dialysate with phosphate in patients on augmented dialysis schedules. [2D]

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^573f5591]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, we should be cautiously enthusiastic. Modifying pH by removing chloride and manipulating the strong ion difference will not treat the underlying cause of the acid–base disorder any more than lowering P 2 or administering sodium bicarbonate does, unless of course the primary derangement is hyperchloremia, elevated P 2, or hyponatremia. Although acidosis with hyperchloremia is quite common in critical illness, preventing hyperchloremia by using the physicochemical approach to guide the choice and composition of fluids is perhaps a simpler and wiser alternative. Furthermore, hyperventilation, sodium bicarbonate administration, and chloride electrodialysis do not directly treat elevated lactate levels, the most common cause of acidosis in critical illness. However, Zanella and colleagues make no such claims. They simply use the physicochemical approach to elegantly show that increasing the strong ion difference restores pH to normal levels. It’s conceivable that the same result could be more easily obtained by conventional dialysis, where the dialysate solutions are engineered to target a given strong ion difference. Either way, the manipulation of strong ion difference to achieve specific therapeutic effects is slowly gaining traction, and similar approaches have recently been shown to enhance respiratory support. Whatever the future holds for these therapies, it behooves us to start teaching the physicochemical approach to our medical students and junior colleagues sooner rather than later.

### Acid-base homeostasis [^6414a1e0]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Acid-base homeostasis and pH regulation are critical for both normal physiology and cell metabolism and function. The importance of this regulation is evidenced by a variety of physiologic derangements that occur when plasma pH is either high or low. The kidneys have the predominant role in regulating the systemic bicarbonate concentration and hence, the metabolic component of acid-base balance. This function of the kidneys has two components: reabsorption of virtually all of the filtered HCO3(-) and production of new bicarbonate to replace that consumed by normal or pathologic acids. This production or generation of new HCO3(-) is done by net acid excretion. Under normal conditions, approximately one-third to one-half of net acid excretion by the kidneys is in the form of titratable acid. The other one-half to two-thirds is the excretion of ammonium. The capacity to excrete ammonium under conditions of acid loads is quantitatively much greater than the capacity to increase titratable acid. Multiple, often redundant pathways and processes exist to regulate these renal functions. Derangements in acid-base homeostasis, however, are common in clinical medicine and can often be related to the systems involved in acid-base transport in the kidneys.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^dd451797]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by development of hyperchloremia, as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. In addition, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency. Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 h, but this benefit was not sustained beyond 2 h. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, but increased rates of hypokalemia. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).

### Treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD [^feba6f03]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and is believed to contribute to a number of sequelae, including bone disease, altered protein metabolism, skeletal muscle wasting, and progressive glomerular filtration rate loss. Small trials in animal models and humans suggest a role for alkali therapy to lessen these complications. Recent studies support this notion, although more definitive evidence is needed on the long-term benefits of alkali therapy and the optimal serum bicarbonate level. The role of dietary modification also should be given greater consideration. In addition, potential adverse effects of alkali treatment must be taken into consideration, including sodium retention and the theoretical concern of promoting vascular calcification. This teaching case summarizes the rationale for and benefits and complications of base therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Effect of dialysate potassium and lactate on serum potassium and bicarbonate concentrations during daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow rates [^6daaeb87]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimization of dialysate composition during hemodialysis (HD) has long been sought to normalize blood electrolyte and acid-base buffer concentrations and potentially improve patient outcomes. Tailoring of dialysate concentrations controls removal (or delivery) during the treatment, thereby modifying serum concentrations; however, optimal serum and dialysate concentrations of electrolytes and acid-base buffer concentrations for patients treated by HD remain incompletely defined.

Current understanding of the relationships between serum and dialysate concentrations of potassium and bicarbonate and patient outcomes derive largely from observational studies of HD patients treated thrice weekly. For example, observational studies have shown that predialysis serum potassium concentrations within a high normal range are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality (study-dependent range: 4.6–5.3 mEq/L or 4.0–5.5 mEq/L). The importance of dialysate potassium concentration on all-cause mortality during thrice weekly HD therapy is less clear; elevated risks of all-cause mortality have been reported with high or low dialysate potassium concentrations while others have reported no difference for dialysate potassium concentrations of 2 or 3 mEq/L after co-factor adjustment. Evidence is more convincing that low dialysate potassium concentrations are associated with an elevated risk of sudden cardiac arrest, a leading cause of death in HD patients treated thrice weekly, particularly when serum potassium is low (≤5.0 mEq/L). Similarly, observational studies have shown that both high and low serum bicarbonate levels are associated with an elevated risk of mortality in HD patients treated thrice weekly ; however, the association of high bicarbonate levels with mortality is reduced after adjustment for differences in nutrition and inflammation. There are scant data regarding the effect of dialysate bicarbonate concentration on HD patient outcomes. The observational study by Tentori et al. demonstrated a positive association between dialysate bicarbonate concentration and patient mortality, possibly due to exacerbation of intradialysis and postdialysis alkalosis.

There are no published data regarding comparable patient outcome relationships for patients treated using more frequent HD treatment schedules, and the optimal dialysate concentrations of electrolytes and buffers likely depend on HD treatment frequency. Recognizing their potential clinical importance, we describe in this report associations of dialysate potassium and lactate concentrations on serum levels of potassium and bicarbonate in patients who transferred from thrice-weekly, in-center HD to daily HD at low dialysate flow rates.

### The dynamics of the metabolism of acetate and bicarbonate associated with use of hemodialysates in the ABChD trial: a phase IV, prospective, single center, single blind, randomized, cross-over, two week investigation [^be1726c7]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In end stage renal disease (ESRD), the body lacks the ability to effectively excrete its acid load, and thus hemodialysis (HD) therapy assumes an important role in regulation of acid-base homeostasis by providing base from the dialysate to neutralize acids produced from catabolism of proteins. Bicarbonate dialysates are commonly utilized to buffer acidic anions and prescriptions are recommended by Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines to be individually titrated to achieve a predialysis blood bicarbonate concentration of ≥22 mEq/L. If dialysate bicarbonate concentrations are not prescribed properly, metabolic acidosis or metabolic alkalosis may occur, which have been associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality.

In the absence of liver disease, precursors of bicarbonate (e.g. acetate, lactate, citrate) are rapidly metabolized by the liver and other tissues into bicarbonate and used for regulation of acid-base homeostasis. However, it is currently not established to what extent dialysate acid buffer concentrates that include metabolic precursors of bicarbonate contribute to the overall bicarbonate administered and subsequent blood bicarbonate concentrations. Current practice and labeling of products denote that metabolic precursors of bicarbonate should be considered to contribute to the buffer administered and are typically added to the ordered bicarbonate dose, yielding a “total buffer” prescribed.

The aims of the Acid-Base Composition with use of hemoDialysates (ABChD) trial was to use two commonly used acid dialysate buffers to: 1. study the pragmatic dynamics of the levels of acetate patients receive from the acid dialysate during HD; 2. establish the extent to which acetate is metabolized into bicarbonate, and 3. characterize the overall peridialytic dynamics of blood bicarbonate concentrations. In this study, we used two commonly used bicarbonate dialysate types containing differing levels of an acetate buffer; acetate free buffers were not investigated.

### Sodium chloride (nacellate solution 0.9%-100mL) [^dfbad24f]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP provides electrolytes and is a source of water for hydration. It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.

Sodium, the major cation of the extracellular fluid, functions primarily in the control of water distribution, fluid balance, and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid.

Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^049b8541]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na(+)] - ([HCO(3)(-)] + [Cl(-)]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Serum anion gap: its uses and limitations in clinical medicine [^49ad4b6c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap, calculated from the electrolytes measured in the chemical laboratory, is defined as the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations subtracted from the serum sodium concentration. This entity is used in the detection and analysis of acid-base disorders, assessment of quality control in the chemical laboratory, and detection of such disorders as multiple myeloma, bromide intoxication, and lithium intoxication. The normal value can vary widely, reflecting both differences in the methods that are used to measure its constituents and substantial interindividual variability. Low values most commonly indicate laboratory error or hypoalbuminemia but can denote the presence of a paraproteinemia or intoxication with lithium, bromide, or iodide. Elevated values most commonly indicate metabolic acidosis but can reflect laboratory error, metabolic alkalosis, hyperphosphatemia, or paraproteinemia. Metabolic acidosis can be divided into high anion and normal anion gap varieties, which can be present alone or concurrently. A presumed 1:1 stoichiometry between change in the serum anion gap (DeltaAG) and change in the serum bicarbonate concentration (DeltaHCO(3)(-)) has been used to uncover the concurrence of mixed metabolic acid-base disorders in patients with high anion gap acidosis. However, recent studies indicate variability in the DeltaAG/DeltaHCO(3)(-) in this disorder. This observation undercuts the ability to use this ratio alone to detect complex acid-base disorders, thus emphasizing the need to consider additional information to obtain the appropriate diagnosis. Despite these caveats, calculation of the serum anion gap remains an inexpensive and effective tool that aids detection of various acid-base disorders, hematologic malignancies, and intoxications.

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^d91a1f30]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advanced CKD impairs the ability to excrete acid loads, leading to acid retention and metabolic acidosis (MA).MA is linked with several complications, including CKD progression, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and an increased risk of mortality.

Sodium bicarbonate has emerged as a therapeutic option for MA in CKD populations, with several studies suggesting its clinical benefits in preventing kidney function deterioration. – However, some studies have not identified the benefits of sodium bicarbonate in slowing eGFR decline. Previous research indicated improved eGFR with sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD with low to normal bicarbonate levels,but its effects in patients with MA have not been specifically studied, leaving its role in CKD with concurrent MA controversial. In addition, there is currently no clear evidence regarding the effects of sodium bicarbonate on serum albumin, muscle mass, calcium and phosphate, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in CKD populations with MA.

To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide definitive evidence concerning the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate on prognostic markers and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD and MA.

Dialysate (Guidelines 5.1 – 5.4)

Guideline 5.1 -Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Guideline 5.2 - Selection of dialysate buffer

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate in the range 18.0-26.0mmo/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to exposure to air) when interpreting levels. [1C]

We suggest the term ‘dialysate buffer’ rather than ‘dialysate bicarbonate’ to avoid confusion arising from differences in manufacturers’ terminology. [2C]

We suggest choosing dialysate buffer below or equal to 37.0mEq/L for the majority of patients, using a standardised or individualised approach. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to abnormal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate, which may include increasing dialysis dose, oral bicarbonate, nutritional support, or individualising dialysate buffer. [2D]

Guideline 5.3 - Supplementation of dialysate with phosphate

We suggest considering supplementation of the dialysate with phosphate in patients on augmented dialysis schedules. [2D]

Guideline 5.4 - Paediatric dialysate considerations

We recommend individualisation of dialysate electrolyte concentrations, including potassium, buffer and calcium. [1C]

We suggest an individualised dialysate temperature, between core temperature and 0.5°C below, with monitoring of intradialytic core temperature for neonates and smaller children. [2D]

Anticoagulation

We recommend that patients without increased bleeding risk should be given unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin during dialysis to reduce clotting of the extracorporeal system. [1A]

We recommend that systemic anticoagulation should be omitted or minimised in patients with increased bleeding risk. [1C]

We recommend that patients with heparin allergies should be prescribed a non-heparin form of anticoagulation. [1A]

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are pharmacologically inactive. The electrolyte concentrations in the solutions are chosen to restore plasma levels to clinically desired concentrations or maintain plasma levels at the desired concentrations.

PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are used as replacement solution to replace water and electrolytes removed during hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. Bicarbonate (or precursor lactate) in the solution is used as an alkalinizing buffer to restore acid-base balance to a clinically desirable level.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The distribution of electrolytes, bicarbonate, and dextrose is determined by the patient's clinical condition, metabolic status, and residual renal function.

The elimination and replacement of water, electrolytes and buffer depend on the patient's electrolyte and acid-base balance, metabolic status, residual renal function and ongoing physiologic losses through intestinal, respiratory and cutaneous routes.

How we manage metabolic acidosis in the ICU

Metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients is not a single disease but a syndrome driven by various underlying conditions. As such, the basic principle is to treat the underlying cause of metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be administered if there is a concern for the suppressed cardiac function that metabolic acidosis may cause. The rationale for using sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis is that the intravenous administration of a high SID solution would increase the pH, resulting in improved cardiac function.

The evidence on the biochemical effects of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in acute metabolic acidosis has been systematically reviewed. The summary of 12 relevant studies showed that pH, serum bicarbonate, base excess, serum sodium, and PaCO2 increased during and after the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate. By contrast, serum anion gap and potassium decreased. Some concern was raised about intracellular acidosis due to the back-diffusion of CO2 and decreased ionized calcium that might impair cardiac contraction. However, there was no consistent evidence from the literature review that sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with decreased ionized calcium or decreased cardiac output.

Dialysate (Guidelines 5.1 – 5.4)

When the 2 nd edition of the RA Guidelines was published in 1997, the only recommendation relating to the composition of the dialysate was that renal units phase out the use of acetate in favour of bicarbonate buffering, since the improved efficiency of dialysis could overwhelm the capacity to metabolise acetate. The need to keep bicarbonate separate from divalent cations to prevent precipitation meant that dialysate had to be produced using two different concentrates, leading to the modern proportioning system in which sodium bicarbonate is mixed with an electrolyte concentrate (‘acid concentrate’) at the point of use, allowing independent control of most dialysate constituents. Some dialysate constituents have diversified whereas others have gradually become standardized.

Dialysate calcium was often supra-physiological in the 1990’s (around 1.75mmol/L) to prevent hypocalcaemia, but this became unnecessary with increasing use of vitamin D analogues and calcium-containing phosphate binders, so that dialysate calcium has become reasonably standardized, usually in the range 1.25-1.50mmol/L. Non-standard dialysate calcium may sometimes be helpful, for example in the context of calciphylaxis, but this is usually driven by bone-mineral considerations and is outside the scope of this guideline.

In the 1990’s, dialysate was usually glucose-free due to cost and microbiological concerns, and hypoglycaemia was often a problem for diabetic patients. Glucose containing dialysate was initially prescribed for diabetic patients, but extended to all as costs improved, so that a dialysate glucose of 5.5mmol/L is now standard in almost all UK dialysis units. The other constituent of dialysis that has become standardised is magnesium, with low (usually 0.25 or 0.375mmol/L) or high (usually 0.75mmol/L) magnesium being replaced by a dialysate magnesium of 0.5mmol/L, close to the lower end of the normal range.

Opposing these trends, there has been significant diversification in dialysate potassium, and similarly, buffer concentrations and practices vary between units and manufacturers, and are discussed below.

### Whither the bicarbonate era [^e8d32d00]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor :

For metabolic acidosis, beyond treating the underlying cause, correcting hypoxemia, and establishing good perfusion, sodium bicarbonate is often given at variable arbitrary thresholds of depressed blood pH. Recently, Zanella and colleagues employed extracorporeal removal of chloride by electrodialysis in healthy pigs made acidemic by either lactic acid infusion or hypoventilation (CO 2 retention). By physically drawing off chloride and establishing a local separation of charge, blood electroneutrality at the membrane is immediately reestablished by the hydrolysis of water to yield a hydroxyl ion that instantly combines with CO 2 to form bicarbonate. The authors show the feasibility of quantitatively increasing bicarbonate in this fashion for both forms of acidosis without the associated and unwanted hypernatremia and volume loading that can occur with intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration. The accompanying editorialists proclaim the postbicarbonate era with this study that illustrates a major tenet of the Stewart approach to acid–base chemistry and its superiority over other approaches to understanding acid–base physiology and pathophysiology. In Stewart’s paradigm, H +, OH −, HCO 3 −, and CO 3 2− are relegated to the status of dependent variables; that is, they can only be formed from the differential movements and exchanges of independent strong ions (Na +, K +, and Cl −) that disturb electroneutrality, which is immediately corrected by the hydrolysis of water and reaction with CO 2. Although the heuristics of the Stewart analysis are valid, I remain unconvinced by the claim that what the mathematics of this approach reveal demands that physiology must follow these rules and conclusions. The assumption that only strong ions and their differential movement from one space to another alters H + and HCO 3 − concentrations because the math is consistent with it goes against all we know about numerous cell-membrane transporters that use H +, HCO 3 −, or CO 3 2− as coions or counterions with Na +, K +, and Cl −. There has been no identification of a Na + /Cl − antiporter or an electrogenic Na + -Cl cotransporter that will alter local electroneutrality to create or consume the supposed dependent variables. Simply because one can electrodialyze chloride by brute force, as Zanella and colleagues report, does not mean it happens in vivo at the microscopic level. Clinical adoption of the Stewart approach has shown no superiority to conventional approaches (–), and the measurement of all the strong ions repeatedly is wasteful and costly, risks measurement errors that beget more testing, contributes to anemia in many patients, contributes to more transfusions, and is very difficult to teach to trainees and even seasoned clinicians.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^c5831378]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Urinary alkalinization with bicarbonate does not improve patient-centered outcomes in patients with rhabdomyolysis and is not recommended based on the available evidence (Level of evidence: A). It is uncertain whether patients with severe metabolic acidosis from rhabdomyolysis would benefit from a resuscitation strategy including sodium bicarbonate as a resuscitation fluid based on the available evidence.

NAGMA

NAGMA occurs by direct loss of bicarbonate in the gastrointestinal or urinary systems, direct or indirect chloride administration, or impaired ammonia excretion with chronic kidney disease. The role of bicarbonate therapy in NAGMA depends largely on the mechanism by which the acidosis occurred. Renal tubular acidosis may cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration by inadequate proton excretion in the distal tubules (type 1), inadequate bicarbonate resorption in the proximal tubules (type 2), or reduced sodium resorption in the collecting ducts (type 4), which causes hyperkalemia and hyponatremia in addition to NAGMA. Direct loss of bicarbonate in the gastrointestinal or urinary systems most often occurs through secretory diarrhea, enteric fistulae, or ureteroileostomy. Concomitant hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and volume depletion may occur. Hyponatremia and decreased extracellular fluid volume stimulate the renal retention of both Na + and Cl −. Retained Cl − replaces the lost HCO 3 −, generating a relative excess of chloride. Chloride administration may occur directly, through volume resuscitation with Cl − -rich normal saline, or indirectly, through administration of total parenteral nutrition, which contains metabolic precursors to hydrochloric acid. Importantly, mortality rates associated with NAGMA, particularly those from administration of chloride-rich solutions, are lower than those with AGMA. In addition, there are no available randomized controlled studies to direct the initiation and dosing of bicarbonate therapy in critical NAGMA. However, there is a strong physiologic rationale to replace the lost bicarbonate, which is why this is often recommended and likely why RCTs do not exist.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate supplementation is indicated in cases with severe NAGMA (Level of evidence: B).

Endocrine and Fluids Management Statements

Volume management takes into consideration the cause of arrest, hemodynamic target chosen, and underlying organ dysfunction and is individualized to each patient (100%, 23/23).
Balance the risk for cerebral edema with complications associated with hyperchloremia when choosing intravenous fluid after CA. The preferred choice in the setting of cerebral edema is normal saline, although balanced crystalloid solutions may minimize hyperchloremia and the potential for AKI when cerebral edema is not present (95.7%, 22/23).
Do not use sodium bicarbonate routinely in patients after CA who have metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be considered in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2, bicarbonate <20) and AKI stage 2 or 3 (82.6%, 19/23).
Consider RRT after CA for when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolytes, and/or acid-base balance exist and for conditions that can potentially be modified with RRT (100%, 23/23).
Do not administer empirical corticosteroids to all patients after CA, although supplemental corticosteroids may be useful to treat persistent shock in patients with proven or suspected adrenal suppression (91.3%, 21/23).
Consider treatment of hyperglycemia with glucose targets of 81 to 180 mg/dL (100%, 19/19).

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^ad1330df]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO2/HCO3(-) and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.
