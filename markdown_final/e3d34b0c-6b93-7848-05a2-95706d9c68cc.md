## Question

can clonidine cause bradycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clonidine can cause bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism by which clonidine affects heart rate. Then, I should verify what regulatory labeling says about bradycardia as an adverse effect. Next, I will review clinical trial and observational data to quantify risk across populations and doses. After that, I should examine case reports and overdose series for severity and management implications. Finally, I will consider special populations, drug interactions, and guideline recommendations to synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if I get that wrong, everything else will be shaky. Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that reduces sympathetic outflow from the brainstem, lowering heart rate via decreased sinus node automaticity and reduced AV nodal conduction; importantly, there is also direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels that contributes to bradycardia independent of alpha-2 effects, which explains why bradycardia can be seen even when central alpha-2 pathways are blocked in experimental models [^e9669c3c] [^dd5042f0].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before drawing conclusions. Multiple FDA labels consistently list bradycardia as a common adverse effect for oral, transdermal, and epidural clonidine, and they warn about dose-related decreases in heart rate and blood pressure, advising baseline and periodic monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure, with slow titration in patients at risk of hypotension or bradycardia [^e476c832] [^6a68e4a7] [^dbbcf02a] [^f09e069e] [^8ddfebe8].

> I will now examine quantitative clinical data to gauge incidence. In a randomized pediatric ADHD trial, bradycardia occurred in 17.5% with clonidine versus 3.4% without, indicating a clinically meaningful excess risk. In adults with hypertension, extended-release clonidine produced placebo-subtracted mean heart rate reductions of about 0.6–3.0 bpm depending on dose, consistent with a dose-related effect. And in a large pediatric exposure dataset, bradycardia was reported in 10.2% of clonidine cases, reinforcing that this is not a rare signal [^207979cd] [^734e3e1b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity without looking at extremes. Overdose series consistently show bradycardia as a hallmark feature, with median minimum heart rates around 48 bpm and prolonged duration of bradycardia, often 20 hours or more; case reports document severe sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythms, and high-grade AV block requiring atropine, isoproterenol, or temporary pacing, and compounding errors have produced life-threatening bradycardia and hemodynamic collapse, underscoring that while therapeutic-dose bradycardia is often mild, toxicity can be profound [^bc10ed7e] [^66ca9a46] [^e86ff1d4] [^d90b823e].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts where risk is amplified. Children appear more susceptible to CNS depression and bradycardia in overdose, and perioperative or ICU use of clonidine increases hypotension and bradycardia risk, with large perioperative trials and meta-analyses showing increased clinically significant bradycardia and hypotension without mortality benefit, leading guidelines to recommend against routine perioperative initiation. In pediatrics, premedication with clonidine can cause bradycardia, and intrathecal or epidural clonidine frequently lowers heart rate, sometimes requiring intervention [^3c156d02] [^c69806a3] [^35ebcf92] [^02c44ba1] [^de1c3899].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions that compound risk. Concomitant negative chronotropes such as beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and digoxin can produce additive sinus node suppression and AV block; labels and guidelines explicitly advise caution and close monitoring when clonidine is combined with these agents, and abrupt withdrawal of clonidine in the setting of beta-blockade can precipitate rebound hypertension, complicating hemodynamic management [^0f7da32e] [^83899c39] [^d9205cc1].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with best practice. Contemporary cardiology guidelines list clonidine among medications that can induce or exacerbate bradycardia or conduction disorders, and geriatric guidelines advise avoiding clonidine as first-line for hypertension due to bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension risks; pediatric ADHD guidance recommends cardiac screening when risk factors are present because clonidine can lower heart rate and blood pressure [^d9205cc1] [^7150c08a] [^a36428a8].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the strength of evidence. Yes, clonidine can cause bradycardia via central sympatholysis and direct HCN channel inhibition, with risk that is dose-related and amplified by patient factors and interacting drugs; therapeutic use commonly produces mild to moderate heart rate reductions, while overdose or high-dose neuraxial use can cause severe, prolonged bradycardia and conduction disturbances requiring pharmacologic therapy or pacing, so clinicians should anticipate, monitor, and titrate cautiously, especially in children, perioperative settings, and when combined with other negative chronotropes [^e9669c3c] [^f09e069e] [^bc10ed7e] [^3c156d02].

---

Clonidine can cause **bradycardia** through its central alpha-2 agonist effects that reduce sympathetic outflow and slow sinus node discharge [^e9669c3c]. Bradycardia is a **common adverse effect** [^e476c832], especially at higher doses, in overdose [^bc10ed7e], or when combined with other negative chronotropes (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin) [^0f7da32e] [^83899c39]. Clinically significant bradycardia may require dose reduction, discontinuation, or treatment with atropine [^66ca9a46]; monitor heart rate and blood pressure during therapy, and use caution in patients with preexisting conduction disease or on interacting medications [^f09e069e].

---

## Mechanism of clonidine-induced bradycardia

Clonidine acts centrally to **reduce sympathetic tone** and increase parasympathetic activity, thereby slowing sinus node discharge and AV conduction [^e9669c3c]. It also directly inhibits cardiac HCN pacemaker channels, contributing to bradycardia independent of alpha-2 effects [^e9669c3c].

---

## Clinical evidence of clonidine-induced bradycardia

Multiple sources document clonidine-associated bradycardia:

- **FDA labeling**: Bradycardia is listed as a common adverse effect for oral, transdermal, and epidural clonidine [^e476c832] [^6a68e4a7] [^dbbcf02a].

- **Clinical trials**: Pediatric ADHD trials showed higher bradycardia rates with clonidine (17.5% vs 3.4% without) [^207979cd].

- **Overdose**: Bradycardia is a hallmark of clonidine toxicity, often severe and prolonged [^bc10ed7e] [^de1c3899].

- **Case reports**: Severe bradycardia, including AV block and asystole, has been reported, especially with interacting drugs or preexisting conduction disease [^66ca9a46] [^79481ba3].

---

## Risk factors for clonidine-induced bradycardia

Several factors increase the risk of **clonidine-related bradycardia**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses increase risk of bradycardia [^f09e069e] [^8713cb51] |
| Route | Epidural and transdermal routes have higher bradycardia rates than oral [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | Preexisting bradycardia, AV block, or sinus node dysfunction increase risk [^66ca9a46] [^bcae8c09] |
| Drug interactions | Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and other negative chronotropes amplify bradycardia [^0f7da32e] [^83899c39] |
| Age | Children and elderly are more susceptible to bradycardia [^734e3e1b] [^334fb6be] |

---

## Clinical significance and management

Clonidine-induced bradycardia ranges from **mild, asymptomatic sinus slowing to severe bradycardia or AV block** requiring intervention [^66ca9a46]. Management includes:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or discontinue clonidine if bradycardia develops [^66ca9a46].

- **Atropine**: Effective for symptomatic bradycardia [^66ca9a46] [^02c44ba1].

- **Temporary pacing**: Rarely needed for severe bradycardia or AV block [^66ca9a46].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly check heart rate and blood pressure, especially during initiation and titration [^f09e069e] [^8ddfebe8].

---

## Comparison with other antihypertensive medications

Clonidine's bradycardia risk is **higher than many first-line antihypertensives** (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides) but comparable to other centrally acting agents (e.g. methyldopa) and less than dexmedetomidine, which is more selective and potent at alpha-2 receptors [^e9a636c8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines advise:

- **Monitor**: Check heart rate and blood pressure before starting, during titration, and periodically during therapy [^f09e069e] [^8ddfebe8].

- **Avoid**: Use caution or avoid in patients with preexisting bradycardia, AV block, or sinus node dysfunction [^66ca9a46] [^bcae8c09].

- **Interactions**: Avoid or monitor closely with beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin [^0f7da32e] [^83899c39].

- **Taper**: Gradually taper to avoid rebound hypertension and tachycardia [^bcae8c09] [^5b644a27].

---

Clonidine can cause **bradycardia** through central sympatholysis and direct HCN channel inhibition, with risk rising at higher doses, in overdose, and with interacting drugs. Clinicians should monitor heart rate, adjust therapy as needed, and be prepared to treat significant bradycardia.

### Clonidine compounding error: bradycardia and sedation in a pediatric patient [^e86ff1d4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clonidine is a centrally-acting α-2 agonist used in the treatment of hypertension and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, among other off-label uses. In overdose, it can cause sedation, bradycardia, and hypotension. Clonidine can be compounded as a liquid formula for patients who are unable to take pills, however, this can add to the risk of dosing errors.

Case Report

A 12-year-old boy diagnosed with autism, prescribed buspirone and clonidine, presented to the emergency department for altered mental status. His examination revealed generalized sedation, bradycardia (heart rate 30–40 beats/min), and hypotension (blood pressure 82/48 mm Hg). Resuscitation included i.v. crystalloids and multiple doses of atropine. Over the next 24 h, his vital signs and mental status normalized. He displayed no infectious symptoms or focal neurologic deficits. His parents noted that his medications had been refilled recently at the compounding pharmacy; because he was unable to take pills, his medications were in liquid formulation. Because his signs and symptoms were suspicious for a central α-2 agonist overdose, his clonidine preparation was sent to a reference laboratory for analysis. This analysis revealed the concentration was approximately eight times higher than indicated on its label. WHY SHOULD AND EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Compounding pharmacy errors can be a source of toxicity, even if there is no known history of an overdose. Recognizing the toxidrome of sedation, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and miosis will lead to appropriate treatment of the patient and should prompt an investigation of the medication error to prevent further harm.

### Clonidine (clonidine hydrochloride) [^f09e069e]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypotension/Bradycardia

Treatment with clonidine HCl extended-release can cause dose-related decreases in blood pressure and heart rate [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate clonidine HCl extended-release slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope.

5.2 Sedation and Somnolence

Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies. In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled, fixed dose pediatric monotherapy study, 31% of patients treated with 0.4 mg/day and 38% treated with 0.2 mg/day versus 4% of placebo treated patients reported somnolence as an adverse event. In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled flexible dose pediatric adjunctive to stimulants study, 19% of patients treated with clonidine HCl extended-release+stimulant versus 7% treated with placebo+stimulant reported somnolence. Before using clonidine HCl extended-release with other centrally active depressants (such as phenothiazines, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with clonidine HCl extended-release. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol.

### Clonidine hydrochloride (Onyda xr) [^8ddfebe8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypotension/Bradycardia

Treatment with ONYDA XR can cause dose-related decreases in blood pressure and heart rate [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate ONYDA XR slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.2 Sedation and Somnolence

Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies with clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled, fixed dose pediatric monotherapy study, 31% of patients treated with 0.4 mg/day and 38% treated with 0.2 mg/day versus 4% of placebo treated patients reported somnolence as an adverse reaction. In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled flexible dose pediatric adjunctive to stimulants study, 19% of patients treated with clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets plus a stimulant versus 7% treated with placebo plus a stimulant reported somnolence.

Before using ONYDA XR with other centrally active depressants (such as phenothiazines, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), consider the potential for additive sedative effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with ONYDA XR. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC guideline — drug-induced bradyarrhythmias: Bradyarrhythmias are common (and desired) pharmacological effects of digoxin, verapamil, diltiazem, and beta blockers; severe bradyarrhythmias may occur with usual doses in sensitized individuals, particularly those receiving combinations, or in suicidal or accidental overdose; marked sinus bradycardia is also common with clonidine.

### Clonidine hydrochloride (Duraclon) [^02c44ba1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

General

Cardiac Effects: Epidural clonidine frequently causes decreases in heart rate. Symptomatic bradycardia can be treated with atropine. Rarely, atrioventricular block greater than first degree has been reported. Clonidine does not alter the hemodynamic response to exercise, but may mask the increase in heart rate associated with hypovolemia.

Respiratory Depression and Sedation: Clonidine administration may result in sedation through the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the brainstem. High doses of clonidine cause sedation and ventilatory abnormalities that are usually mild. Tolerance to these effects can develop with chronic administration. These effects have been reported with bolus doses that are significantly larger than the infusion rate recommended for treating cancer pain.

Depression: Depression has been seen in a small percentage of patients treated with oral or transdermal clonidine. Depression commonly occurs in cancer patients and may be exacerbated by treatment with clonidine. Patients, especially those with a known history of affective disorders, should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of depression.

Pain of Visceral or Somatic Origin: In the clinical investigations, at doses tested, Duraclon was most effective in well-localized, "neuropathic" pain that was characterized as electrical, burning, or shooting in nature, and which was localized to a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution. Duraclon may be less effective, or possibly ineffective in the treatment of pain that is diffuse, poorly localized, or visceral in origin.

Information for Patients

Patients should be instructed about the risks of rebound hypertension and warned not to discontinue clonidine except under the supervision of a physician. Patients should notify their physician immediately if clonidine administration is inadvertently interrupted for any reason. Patients who engage in potentially hazardous activities, such as operating machinery or driving, should be advised of the potential sedative and hypotensive effects of epidural clonidine. They should also be informed that sedative effects may be increased by CNS-depressing drugs such as alcohol and barbiturates, and that hypotensive effects may be increased by opiates.

### Efficacy of clonidine for prevention of perioperative myocardial ischemia: a critical appraisal and meta-analysis of the literature [^3d6aa7da]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There is a belief that clonidine may be effective in reducing perioperative myocardial ischemic events, although the results of several trials are conflicting. The aim of the current study was to provide a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy of clonidine in this regard.

Methods

Data was collected from a MEDLINE search of English-language studies published from 1980 to 1999 and a manual search of bibliographies from retrieved articles. A total of 28 studies were assessed. According to the selection criteria (study design, population, intervention, and outcome) and a quality scoring system, seven studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. After homogeneity was established by Q value, the data were then combined using the fixed-effects model. The pooled odds ratio was calculated. A subgroup analysis based on the types of surgery and administration route was also performed to qualify the results. The results were expressed as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.

Results

Heterogeneity of outcome data was negative in the trials. The pooled odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.34–0.71). In the subgroup analysis, clonidine reduced the incidence of myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing cardiac and noncardiac surgery. Rates of bradycardia were similar in clonidine and placebo groups.

Conclusion

The meta-analysis suggests that perioperative clonidine reduces cardiac ischemic episodes in patients with known, or at risk of, coronary arterial disease without increasing the incidence of bradycardia. Therefore, these findings strongly justify planning and execution of a definitive study seeking the benefits of clonidine.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms

Clonidine overdose: hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, drowsiness, decreased or absent reflexes, weakness, irritability and miosis. The frequency of CNS depression may be higher in children than adults. Large overdoses may result in reversible cardiac conduction defects or dysrhythmias, apnea, coma and seizures. Signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within 30 minutes to two hours after exposure.

Treatment

Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for up-to-date guidance and advice.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^ae14bf0e]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Anesthesia and Analgesia

The analgesic properties described above allow clonidine to be used as an adjunct to most pain regimens, reducing the use of deliriogenic medications. When used in this manner for ICU analgesia, clonidine does not cause an increase in primary end points, such as vent time or overall length of stay, nor does it result in bradycardia or hypotension. Clonidine has also been used as monotherapy for pain– most commonly in topical preparations where anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects can also aid in wound healing. Its sympatholytic properties and effects on peripheral neurotransmission also make clonidine a reasonable topical treatment for neuropathic pain. Some studies have noted that clonidine by itself has reasonable analgesic properties.

### Clonidine for sedation in the critically ill: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab8ed0ea]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane trial registry from inception until March 2016 (Appendix 1). No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently screened all references for inclusion and a third party resolved discrepancies. We identified unpublished and ongoing trials using the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and clinicaltrials.gov databases. Conference proceedings for the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), Canadian Critical Care Society, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) were screened in duplicate for the last 2 years.

Study selection

No methodological quality restrictions were imposed. Although non-randomized prospective studies were identified in the initial search, a sufficient number of RCTs were identified such that only RCT data were subsequently analyzed and reported. Eligible studies were RCTs reporting the use of clonidine, either as a primary sedative or adjunctive agent, compared to any non-clonidine sedative regimen, in patients who required IMV. Studies that used clonidine for any indication other than sedation (e.g. opioid withdrawal) were excluded. We excluded studies enrolling only neonates and those in which clonidine was administered by a route other than enteral or intravenous (IV).

We included studies that reported any of our a priori outcomes, namely the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), all-cause mortality, duration of sedative infusion, dose of benzodiazepines or narcotics used during ICU stay, the level of sedation, incidence of withdrawal from other sedatives, incidence of delirium, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Adverse events were also captured, including clinically significant bradycardia and hypotension requiring intervention, clonidine withdrawal symptoms (rebound hypertension), the unplanned removal of support lines and unplanned extubation.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^db7022e1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

### Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists for the prevention of cardiac complications among patients undergoing surgery [^c69806a3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The surgical stress response plays an important role on the pathogenesis of perioperative cardiac complications. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists attenuate this response and may thereby prevent cardiac complications.

Objectives

This review assessed the efficacy and safety of preoperative (within 24 hours), intraoperative, and postoperative (first 48 hours) alpha-2 adrenergic agonists for preventing mortality and cardiac complications after surgery performed under either general or neuraxial anaesthesia, or both.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to August week 4 2008), EMBASE (1980 to week 36 2008), the Science Citation Index, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials that compared alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine, or mivazerol) against placebo or non-alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. Included studies had to report on mortality, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, or supraventricular tachyarrhythmia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Two authors independently performed computer entry of abstracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Adverse event data were gathered from the trials.

Main Results

We included 31 studies (4578 participants). Study quality was generally inadequate, with only six studies clearly reporting methods for blinding and allocation concealment. Overall, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists reduced mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.66; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98; P = 0.04) and myocardial ischaemia (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.81; P < 0.0001). However, their effects appeared to vary with the surgical procedure. The most encouraging data pertained to vascular surgery, where they reduced mortality (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.90; P = 0.02), cardiac mortality (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.79; P = 0.01), and myocardial infarction (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.94; P = 0.02). With regard to adverse effects, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists significantly increased perioperative hypotension (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.62; P = 0.009) and bradycardia (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.41; P = 0.008).

Authors' Conclusions

Our study provides encouraging evidence that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may reduce cardiac risk, especially during vascular surgery. Nonetheless, these data remain insufficient to make firm conclusions about their efficacy and safety. A large randomized trial of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists is therefore warranted. Additionally, future research must determine which specific alpha-2 adrenergic agonist should be used, and whether it is safe to combine them with other perioperative interventions (for example beta-adrenergic blockade).

The following serious adverse reactions are described in greater detail elsewhere in labeling:

Hypotension/bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Rebound hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of ONYDA XR for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 6 years and older is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (referred to as "clonidine hydrochloride extended-release" in this section). The safety results of these adequate and well-controlled studies of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets are presented below.

Two clonidine hydrochloride extended-release ADHD clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) evaluated 256 patients in two 8-week placebo-controlled studies.

A third clonidine hydrochloride extended-release ADHD clinical study (Study 3) evaluated 135 pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age in a 40-week placebo-controlled randomized‑withdrawal study.

Study 1: Fixed-dose clonidine hydrochloride extended-release Monotherapy

Study 1 was a short-term, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two fixed doses (0.2 mg/day or 0.4 mg/day) of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD hyperactive or combined inattentive/hyperactive subtypes.

### Incidence of bradycardia at arrival to the operating room after oral or intravenous premedication with clonidine in children [^35ebcf92]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Clonidine has been advocated as a valid alternative for premedication in children but one of the few limitations is its association with reduced heart rate (HR), which thus raises the question of the safety of clonidine as premedication in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of bradycardia in children premedicated with oral or intravenous clonidine as compared to children not receiving pharmacologic premedication.

Methods

An open, nonrandomized, observational study design was used. During the preoperative assessment visit the children were prescribed no premedication, intravenous or oral clonidine. On arrival to the operating room (OR) HR was recorded by connecting the patient to standard monitoring with pulseoximetry and/or Electrocardiogram. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients with a HR below 85% of the lower limit of the normal range (1st centile), which was defined as bradycardia that might need clinical intervention.

Results

One thousand five hundred and seven patients were included in the analysis. 600 and 85 patients did not receive any premedication (Group 0), 305 patients received iv Clonidine (Group CIV), and 517 patients were given oral Clonidine (Group CPO). One patient in Group 0 (0.15%; 95% CI: 0–0.81%), none in Group CIV (0%; 95% CI: 0.00–0.98%), and 5 patients in Group CPO (0.97%; 95% CI: 0.31–2.24%) were observed to have a HR of < 85% of the 1st centile.

Conclusion

The incidence of bradycardia following oral or intravenous premedication with clonidine in a pediatric population scheduled for anesthesia is low. Thus, it does not appear rational to refrain from using clonidine as premedication in children only due to fear of bradycardia.

### Clonidine (clonidine hydrochloride) [^bcae8c09]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.3 Rebound Hypertension

Abrupt discontinuation of clonidine HCl extended-release can cause rebound hypertension. In adults with hypertension, sudden cessation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release formulation treatment in the 0.2 to 0.6 mg/day range resulted in reports of headache, tachycardia, nausea, flushing, warm feeling, brief lightheadedness, tightness in chest, and anxiety. In adults with hypertension, sudden cessation of treatment with immediate-release clonidine has, in some cases, resulted in symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, headache, and tremor accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma.

No studies evaluating abrupt discontinuation of clonidine HCl extended-release in children with ADHD have been conducted; however, to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension, gradually reduce the dose of clonidine HCl extended-release in decrements of no more than 0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days. Patients should be instructed not to discontinue clonidine HCl extended-release therapy without consulting their physician due to the potential risk of withdrawal effects.

5.4 Allergic Reactions

In patients who have developed localized contact sensitization to clonidine transdermal system, continuation of clonidine transdermal system or substitution of oral clonidine HCl extended-release therapy may be associated with the development of a generalized skin rash.

In patients who develop an allergic reaction from clonidine transdermal system, substitution of oral clonidine HCl extended-release may also elicit an allergic reaction (including generalized rash, urticaria, or angioedema).

5.5 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities

The sympatholytic action of clonidine may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. There have been post-marketing reports of patients with conduction abnormalities and/or taking other sympatholytic drugs who developed severe bradycardia requiring IV atropine, IV isoproterenol, and temporary cardiac pacing while taking clonidine. Titrate clonidine HCl extended-release slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs.

Pediatric patients with gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting may result in missed doses of ONYDA XR, increasing the risk for rebound hypertension.

No studies evaluating abrupt discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pediatric patients with ADHD have been conducted; however, to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension, gradually reduce the dose of ONYDA XR in decrements of no more than 0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Alpha-2 receptor agonists — perioperative clonidine — For patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (NCS), initiation of low-dose clonidine perioperatively is classified as COR 3: No benefit (LOE B-R) and "is not recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk". A single large, well-designed RCT showed no benefit and raised safety concerns; in POISE-2, patients were randomized 2 to 4 hours before surgery with thresholds of SBP ≥ 105 mm Hg and heart rate ≥ 55 bpm, receiving 0.2 mg clonidine orally plus a transdermal 0.2 mg per day patch for 72 hours, and at 30 days there was no difference in the composite of death or nonfatal MI while clonidine increased nonfatal cardiac arrest and clinically significant bradycardia or hypotension. A 2018 meta-analysis including POISE-2 and 23 additional RCTs reported nonsignificant differences in mortality and MI but demonstrated significant increased risk of hypotension and bradycardia. New administration is thus not recommended; perioperative continuation of chronic therapy has not been addressed in RCTs, chronic use is reserved for severe resistant hypertension or special populations, and abrupt discontinuation can cause a norepinephrine surge with rebound hypertension; short-term interruption for surgery has not been studied.

### Adult clonidine overdose: prolonged bradycardia and central nervous system depression, but not severe toxicity [^bc10ed7e]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

There are limited reports of adult clonidine overdose. We aimed to describe the clinical effects and treatment of clonidine overdose in adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of a prospective cohort of poisoned patients who took clonidine overdoses (> 200μg). Demographic information, clinical effects, treatment, complications (central nervous system and cardiovascular effects) and length of stay (LOS) were extracted from a clinical database or medical records.

Results

From 133 admissions for clonidine poisoning (1988–2015), no medical record was available in 14 and 11 took staggered ingestions. Of 108 acute clonidine overdoses (median age 27 years; 14–65 years; 68 females), 40 were clonidine alone ingestions and 68 were clonidine with co-ingestants. Median dose taken was 2100μg (interquartile range [IQR]: 400–15,000μg). Median LOS was 21h (IQR: 14-35h) and there were no deaths. Glasgow coma score [GCS] < 15 occurred in 73/108 (68%), and more patients taking co-ingestants (8/68; 12%) had coma (GCS < 9) compared to clonidine alone (2/40; 5%). Miosis occurred in 31/108 (29%) cases. Median minimum HR was 48bpm (IQR: 40-57bpm), similar between clonidine alone and co-ingestant overdoses. There was a significant association between dose and minimum HR for clonidine alone overdoses (p = 0.02). 82/108 (76%) had bradycardia, median onset 2.5h post-ingestion (IQR: 1.7–5.5h) and median duration 20h (2.5-83h), similar for clonidine alone and co-ingestant overdoses. There were no arrhythmias. Three patients ingesting 8000–12,000μg developed early hypertension. Median minimum systolic BP was 96mmHg (IQR: 90-105mmHg) and hypotension occurred in 26/108 (24%). 12/108 patients were intubated, but only 2 were clonidine alone cases. Treatments included activated charcoal (24), atropine (8) and naloxone (23). The median total naloxone dose was 2mg (IQR: 1.2–2.4mg), but only one patient given naloxone was documented to respond with partial improvement in GCS.

Discussion

Clonidine causes persistent but not life-threatening clinical effects. Most patients develop mild central nervous system depression and bradycardia. Naloxone was not associated with improved outcomes.

### Clonidine for sedation in the critically ill: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^006e2061]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Adverse events

An increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension requiring intervention was evident in the clonidine compared to the non-clonidine group (four studies, 404 patients, RR 3.11, 95% CI = 1.64 to 5.87, I² = 0%, moderate certainty) (Fig. 4). Two studies defined clinically significant hypotension as any decrease in blood pressure requiring intervention, such as holding or lowering the dose of clonidine, or requiring administration of intravenous fluids. One study used a systolic blood pressure cutoff of 80 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure cutoff of 50 mmHg, or change in baseline blood pressure of > 30% as criteria for clinically significant hypotension. Another study defined it as a blood pressure < 60 mmHg (unclear if this is mean arterial pressure, systolic or diastolic blood pressure), or any hypotension requiring intervention with a vasopressor or inotrope.

Fig. 4
Forest plot comparing the incidence of clinically significant hypotension requiring intervention between the clonidine group and the non-clonidine group (control). Results are depicted using a random effects model with relative risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals

There was no difference in the incidence of clinically significant bradycardia requiring intervention (four studies, 404 patients, RR 1.34, 95% CI = 0.45 to 3.98, I² = 45%, low certainty) (Appendix 11) or the incidence of rebound hypertension (two studies, 195 patients, RR 5.37, 95% CI = 0.63 to 45.49, I² = 0%, low certainty) (Appendix 12). None of the included studies reported on the incidence of unplanned removal of central IV lines or unplanned extubation.

Hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, drowsiness, decreased or absent reflexes, weakness, irritability and miosis. The frequency of CNS depression may be higher in pediatric patients than adults. Large overdoses may result in reversible cardiac conduction defects or dysrhythmias, apnea, coma and seizures. Signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within 30 minutes to two hours after exposure.

### Naloxone reversal of clonidine toxicity: dose, dose, dose [^0428f1e4]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Following clonidine ingestion, naloxone is seldom administered as it is considered ineffective in reversing somnolence, bradycardia, or hypotension. However, this conclusion has been based on administration of small doses (2mg or less) of naloxone. The somnolence is frequently treated with endotracheal intubation (ETI), a procedure with significant morbidity.

Objective

We aimed to determine if naloxone administration reversed the effects of clonidine or caused any adverse effects.

Methods

We performed a retrospective descriptive cohort (IRB approved) of hospital medical records for pediatric patients (6 months-16 years) with clonidine exposure. Demographics, history, co-ingestants, clinical data, treatments, and outcome were recorded in a de-identified database.

Results

The most common clinical findings in the 52 patients were sedation (n = 51), bradycardia (n = 44), and hypotension (n = 11). Of 51 somnolent patients, naloxone administration awoke 40 patients, five of which had co-ingestants. Nine patients experienced recurrent sedation that resolved with a repeat bolus of naloxone. Twenty somnolent bradycardic patients (11 less than 3 years old) received 10mg naloxone via intravenous bolus. Thirteen awoke; bradycardia persisted in six of the awake patients. Of the remaining 31 patients, 22 awoke following 6mg or less of naloxone. Naloxone reversed hypotension in 7 of 11 hypotensive patients. Only one hypotensive patient (with a coingestion) received vasopressors for hypotension. Three awake normotensive patients received vasopressors for bradycardia. Seven patients awoke and had normal vital signs following naloxone administration, but were chemically sedated and intubated for transport. There were no adverse events following the administration of any dose of naloxone.

Conclusions

Administration of naloxone to somnolent pediatric patients with clonidine toxicity awoke the majority (40/51) and resolved bradycardia and hypotension in some. Persistent bradycardia was benign. Hypotension was rare and clinically insignificant. No adverse effects occurred in any patient including the 21 patients who received 10mg naloxone. Morbidity in this overdose may be due to ETI, a procedure that could be prevented if high-dose naloxone (10mg) were administered. Administration of high-dose naloxone should be considered in all children with clonidine toxicity.

### Clonidine versus other adjuncts added to local anesthetics for pediatric neuraxial blocks: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7a595d24]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clonidine is a common adjunct to local anesthetics for pediatric neuraxial block; however, the pros and cons between clonidine and other adjuncts remain unclear. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy and adverse effects between clonidine and other adjuncts added to local anesthetics.

Materials and Methods

The systematic search, data extraction, critical appraisal, and pooled analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Randomized controlled studies were searched in Cochrane (to present), Medline (1946 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and Biosis (1995 to present). Relative risks (RRs), standard mean difference (SMD), and associated CIs were calculated using RevMan statistical software to assess continuous and dichotomous data. Heterogeneity in studies was measured by forest plots and I 2 values. Subgroup analysis was performed for continuous and dichotomous variables, while meta-regression was applied for continuous data with high I 2 values.

Results

A total of 15 randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a longer duration of postoperative analgesia in the clonidine group than for other adjuncts (SMD = 1.54, p = 0.005, I² = 96%). The number of patients requiring rescue analgesia was lower in the clonidine group without the addition of epinephrine (RR = 0.55, p = 0.0002, I² = 0), while the RR for the comparison with epinephrine was significant (p = 0.62, I² = 95%). The duration of motor block was longer in the clonidine group (mean difference [MD] = 1.06, p < 0.00001, I² = 0). The clonidine group also had a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV; RR = 0.49, p < 0.00001, I² = 0). Postoperative bradycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention were not significantly different between clonidine and other adjuncts (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Clonidine, compared with other adjuncts, added to local anesthetics for neuraxial block, provides a longer duration of postoperative analgesia with lower incidence of PONV. However, the duration of motor block may also be prolonged by clonidine.

Background

Palpitations, presyncope and syncope are potentially debilitating symptoms that can have a significant functional impact on patients. We present an unusual case of these symptoms that were inducible with a simple deep breath, which after extensive investigation was refractory to traditional treatments. These were successfully treated with the centrally acting sympatholytic, clonidine.

Centrally acting α2‑adrenergic agonists in HF — agents such as clonidine and moxonidine decrease sympathetic outflow, lowering plasma norepinephrine and blood pressure; in small HF studies clonidine 0.15 mg twice daily decreased plasma norepinephrine concentrations by > 50% with hemodynamic improvements, but bradycardia and atrioventricular dissociation have been reported. A placebo‑controlled sustained‑release moxonidine trial in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV HF was terminated prematurely after 1934 patients were enrolled; although plasma norepinephrine decreased, mortality was higher with moxonidine (54 deaths [5.5%]) versus placebo (32 deaths [3.4%]), with LV reverse remodeling noted.

Marketing Experience with CATAPRES-TTS

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CATAPRES-TTS transdermal therapeutic system. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to CATAPRES-TTS transdermal therapeutic system.

Body as a Whole: Fever; malaise; weakness; pallor; and withdrawal syndrome.

Cardiovascular: Congestive heart failure; cerebrovascular accident; electrocardiographic abnormalities (i.e., bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome disturbances and arrhythmias); chest pain; orthostatic symptoms; syncope; increases in blood pressure; sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) block with and without the use of concomitant digitalis; Raynaud's phenomenon; tachycardia; bradycardia; and palpitations.

Central and Peripheral Nervous System/Psychiatric: Delirium; mental depression; hallucinations (including visual and auditory); localized numbness; vivid dreams or nightmares; restlessness; anxiety; agitation; irritability; other behavioral changes; and drowsiness.

### Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated pacemaker channels by clonidine [^e9669c3c]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine.

Methods and Results

To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice.

Conclusions

Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.

### Clonidine for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: II. ECG changes and adverse events analysis [^207979cd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine (n = 31), methylphenidate (n = 29), clonidine and methylphenidate (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30). Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0.6 mg/day for clonidine and 60 mg/day for methylphenidate (both with divided dosing). Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs.

Results

There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine (17.5% versus 3.4%; p = .02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine (79.4% versus 49.2%; p = .0006) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal. Drowsiness was common on clonidine, but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks.

Conclusions

Clonidine, used alone or with methylphenidate, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD. Physicians prescribing clonidine should monitor for bradycardia and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial drowsiness.

### Clonidine as an adjuvant to local anesthetics for peripheral nerve and plexus blocks: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^014fccf3]. Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

The effect of adding clonidine to local anesthetics for nerve or plexus blocks remains unclear. The authors searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials testing the impact of adding clonidine to local anesthetics for peripheral single-injection nerve or plexus blocks in adults undergoing any surgery (except eye) without general anesthesia. Twenty trials (1,054 patients, 573 received clonidine) published 1992–2006 tested plexus (14 brachial, 1 cervical) and nerve blocks (2 sciatic/femoral, 1 midhumeral, 1 ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric, 1 ankle). Clonidine doses ranged from 30 to 300 microg; most patients received 150 microg. Clonidine prolonged the duration of postoperative analgesia (weighted mean difference 122 min; 95% confidence interval [CI] 74–169), sensory block (weighted mean difference 74 min; 95% CI 37–111), and motor block (weighted mean difference 141 min; 95% CI 82–199). In a subgroup of patients receiving an axillary plexus block, these effects were independent of whether clonidine was added to an intermediate or a long-acting local anesthetic. Clonidine increased the risk of arterial hypotension (odds ratio 3.61; 95% CI 1.52–8.55; number-needed-to-harm 11), orthostatic hypotension or fainting (odds ratio 5.07; 95% CI 1.20–21.4; number-needed-to-harm 10), bradycardia (odds ratio 3.09; 95% CI 1.10–8.64; number-needed-to-harm 13), and sedation (odds ratio 2.28; 95% CI 1.15–4.51; number-needed-to-harm 5). There was a lack of evidence of dose-responsiveness for beneficial or harmful effects. Clonidine added to intermediate or long-acting local anesthetics for single-shot peripheral nerve or plexus blocks prolongs duration of analgesia and motor block by about 2 h. The increased risk of hypotension, fainting, and sedation may limit its usefulness. Dose-responsiveness remains unclear.

### Hemodynamic tolerance to IV clonidine infusion in the PICU [^5d435f8a]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clonidine is an antihypertensive drug used for analgosedation in the PICU. Lack of reliable data on its hemodynamic tolerance limits its use. This study explores the hemodynamic tolerance of IV clonidine infusion in a broad population of children with high severity of disease.

Design

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.

Setting

A tertiary and quaternary referral PICU.

Patients

Critically ill children age 0–18 years old who received an IV clonidine infusion for analgosedation of at least 1 hour.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary endpoints were the prevalences of bradycardia and hypotension. Secondary endpoints were changes in heart rate, blood pressure, Vasoactive-Inotropic Score, COMFORT Behavior score (a sedation scoring scale), and body temperature during the infusion. The association of bradycardia with other hemodynamic variables was explored, as well as potential risk factors for severe bradycardia. One-hundred eighty-six children (median age, 12.9 mo [interquartile range, 3.5–60.6 mo]) receiving a maximum median clonidine infusion of 0.7 µg/kg/hr (interquartile range, 0.3–1.5) were included. Severe bradycardia and systolic hypotension occurred in 72 patients (40.2%) and 105 patients (58%), respectively. Clonidine-associated bradycardia was hemodynamically well tolerated, as it was not related with hypotension and the need for vasoactive drugs decreased in parallel with a sedation score guided clonidine infusion rate increase. Younger age was the only identified risk factor for clonidine-associated bradycardia.

Conclusions

Although administration of clonidine is often associated with bradycardia and hypotension, these complications do not seem clinically significant in a mixed PICU population with a high degree of disease severity. Clonidine may have a vasoactive-inotropic sparing effect.

OVERDOSAGE

Hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, drowsiness, decreased or absent reflexes, weakness, irritability and miosis. The frequency of CNS depression may be higher in children than adults. Large overdoses may result in reversible cardiac conduction defects or dysrhythmias, apnea, coma and seizures. Signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within 30 minutes to two hours after exposure. As little as 0.1 mg of clonidine has produced signs of toxicity in children.

If symptoms of poisoning occur following dermal exposure, remove all Catapres-TTS® (clonidine) transdermal therapeutic systems. After their removal, the plasma clonidine levels will persist for about 8 hours, then decline slowly over a period of several days. Rare cases of CATAPRES-TTS poisoning due to accidental or deliberate mouthing or ingestion of the patch have been reported, many of them involving children.

There is no specific antidote for clonidine overdosage. Ipecac syrup-induced vomiting and gastric lavage would not be expected to remove significant amounts of clonidine following dermal exposure. If the patch is ingested, whole bowel irrigation may be considered and the administration of activated charcoal and/or cathartic may be beneficial. Supportive care may include atropine sulfate for bradycardia, intravenous fluids and/or vasopressor agents for hypotension and vasodilators for hypertension. Naloxone may be a useful adjunct for the management of clonidine-induced respiratory depression, hypotension and/or coma; blood pressure should be monitored since the administration of naloxone has occasionally resulted in paradoxical hypertension. Tolazoline administration has yielded inconsistent results and is not recommended as first-line therapy. Dialysis is not likely to significantly enhance the elimination of clonidine.

The largest overdose reported to date, involved a 28-year old male who ingested 100 mg of clonidine hydrochloride powder. This patient developed hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, apnea, hallucinations, semicoma, and premature ventricular contractions. The patient fully recovered after intensive treatment. Plasma clonidine levels were 60 ng/mL after 1 hour, 190 ng/mL after 1.5 hours, 370 ng/mL after 2 hours, and 120 ng/mL after 5.5 and 6.5 hours. In mice and rats, the oral LD50of clonidine is 206 and 465 mg/kg, respectively.

### Clonidine poisoning… [^e7625e46]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Clonidine hydrochloride poisoning in children has become more frequent with increasing availability of this drug. We report four cases of accidental clonidine poisoning that demonstrate the various signs and symptoms of clonidine poisoning. The most frequent and significant toxic effects are depression of consciousness, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression. Ventilatory support must be available if apnea occurs. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine sulfate, epinephrine chloride, dopamine hydrochloride, or tolazoline hydrochloride. Hypotension is treated with intravenous fluids and dopamine, reserving tolazoline for refractory cases. Hypothermia is common but is of minor clinical significance. Paradoxical hypertension should be treated with tolazoline. Clonidine may not be detected in body fluids by routine toxicology-screening procedures, so poisoning should be suspected on clinical grounds. Artman M, Boerth RC.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^2796c4f7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosing

Failing to 'start low and go slow': When initiating medication, typically adverse effects occur before therapeutic benefits are seen – and can lead to premature discontinuation. This can be avoided by gradual titration; 'starting low and going slow'. For example, initial syncope (due to postural hypotension) can be related to the initiation of clonidine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors) and guanfacine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors) and sedation is potentially related to all medications for tics. These adverse effects are often encountered if the initial dose is too high. However, with careful low-dose initiation and slow titration, these adverse effects are much less likely to occur. Doses of 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg guanfacine and 0.5–1 mg aripiprazole once daily are suggested as appropriate initial doses, with titrations using a weekly, fortnightly or even monthly approach according to the response. However, the initial dose and the titration speed could differ according to body weight, age and other characteristics of the patient.

Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose: When a medication has been initiated, it is important to titrate to recommended therapeutic doses. In the case of clonidine, this relates to an average daily dose of 3–5 mcg/kg, for aripiprazole around 5–10 mg daily and for guanfacine between 1 and 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents according to weight. Often young people are sub-optimally medicated to reduce potential side effects. However, it is a common pitfall to conclude that a medication is ineffective, when in fact it has been used at a sub-therapeutic dose.

Drug choice – is the drug correct?

Awareness of co-morbidities is important in determining the best drug choice. Commonly, young people with co-morbid tics and ADHD find noradrenergic agents (clonidine, guanfacine) beneficial for tic symptom control, whereas young people with anxiety disorders or OCD co-morbidities may find an approach using aripiprazole or treatment primarily targeting anxiety and/or OCD with an SSRI most beneficial in managing tic symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^a36428a8]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Nonstimulant medications — cardiovascular precautions and adverse effects are as follows: Among nonstimulants, the risk of serious cardiovascular events is extremely low, but atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine may be associated with cardiovascular parameter changes, including increased HR and BP for atomoxetine and decreased HR and BP for guanfacine and clonidine. Clinicians are recommended to not only obtain the personal and family cardiac history but also perform additional evaluation if risk factors are present before starting nonstimulants (for example, perform an electrocardiogram [ECG] and possibly refer to a pediatric cardiologist if the ECG is not normal). Atomoxetine adverse effects include initial somnolence, gastrointestinal tract symptoms if the dosage is increased too rapidly, and decreased appetite; less commonly, an increase in suicidal thoughts has been found and is noted by an FDA black box warning; extremely rarely, hepatitis has been associated. Atomoxetine has been linked to growth delays in the first 1 to 2 years of treatment, with a return to expected measurements after 2 to 3 years of treatment on average, with decreases observed among those who were taller or heavier than average before treatment. For extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine, adverse effects include somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, irritability, headache, bradycardia, hypotension, and abdominal pain, and because rebound hypertension after abrupt discontinuation has been observed, these medications should be tapered off rather than suddenly discontinued.

### Cardiac arrest in a child with cerebral palsy undergoing sevoflurane induction of anesthesia after preoperative clonidine [^064dd25c]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Clonidine is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure. We present a case of a 5-year-old child with cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, receiving clonidine for restlessness, who presented for placement of a baclofen pump. Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety. During induction of anesthesia, the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring cardiac resuscitation. There are no previous reports of clonidine-associated cardiac arrest in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.

### Influence of clonidine induced sympathicolysis on anaemia tolerance in anaesthetized pigs [^b12e9785]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Bolus clonidine administration reduced VO 2 in our model and may therefore have optimized the oxygen consumption/delivery balance. Several authors have similarly observed decreased VO 2 and energy expenditure after clonidine administration. However, this effect was limited in our model, occurring only at the initial time points following administration (BL2, 25%) where it could be attributed to severe bradycardia. Presumably, haemodynamic changes during hemodilution were too small to influence VO 2 significantly.

Underdosage of clonidine seems rather unlikely given the observed haemodynamic changes, therefore the mechanisms underlying these findings remain unknown. It is particularly unclear whether a more distinctive effect on VO 2 may have caused even more pronounced anaemia tolerance.

Despite significant haemodynamic differences between the two experimental groups, only negligible differences were observed in oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation. Even at very low Hb levels, there were no differences observed in oxygen consumption, oxygen delivery, arterial serum lactate concentration, and acid base balance between both study groups. It can therefore be surmised that the high clonidine dose did not critically restrict tissue oxygenation during acute anaemia.

Several study limitations warrant discussion. We investigated the effects of clonidine on anaemia tolerance in young, healthy pigs. Pigs are a generally accepted animal model for hemodynamic shock and multiple studies have shown that the limits of oxygen supply are comparable for anesthetized, paralyzed healthy pigs and anesthetized, paralyzed, otherwise healthy humans. However, in clinical practice, patients with concomitant cardiac risks or comorbidities are the primary population administered perioperative α 2 -adrenergic agonists. Consequently, our model may differ from clinical practice because compensatory mechanisms for acute anaemia may be different between healthy patients and those with significant cardiac disease. However, our results help to elucidate underlying mechanisms of anemia tolerance during clonidine medication.

We demonstrated that Hb crit did not differ between control and clonidine treated animals, but this does not indicate that moderate anaemia (Hb 8–10 g · dL −1) can be sustained similarly in both groups in clinical practice. Using our model we cannot rule out that in some organs oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation are restricted more severely by clonidine than others, and as a result, anaemia tolerance may differ between different organs.

### Clonidine and dexmedetomidine for controlled hypotension during functional endoscopic sinus surgery: a comparative study [^f587ce30]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Clonidine and dexmedetomidine provided good to excellent quality of the surgical field visibility to the surgeon. Blood loss and duration of surgery were comparable. Both drugs provided reduced mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Bradycardia were observed with dexmedetomidine group. Post-operative sedation was longer with dexmedetomidine compared to clonidine, which favors the choice of clonidine use over dexmedetomidine in the setting of day case surgery. However, considering the small sample of this study which could not detect small but clinically differences between both drugs, there is a need for a much larger and multicenter study to confirm these findings.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^4c542f57]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Alpha-2 Agonists

Alpha-2 agonists, such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine, produce analgesia by stimulating alpha-2 receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and reducing transmission of nociceptive signals. While these medications can be administered via multiple routes, for postoperative pain management, clonidine is often given intravenously or orally while dexmedetomidine is typically administered intravenously. Clonidine and dexmedetomidine can also be used as adjuvants in epidurals and peripheral nerve blocks to potentially improve and prolong analgesia, although data supporting these benefits is limited. Some ERPs may utilize clonidine or dexmedetomidine as an analgesic adjust for postoperative pain management as some evidence suggests that alpha-2 agonists have opioid-sparing properties. In particular, recent studies suggest postoperative dexmedetomidine infusions may reduce opioid consumption and opioid-related adverse effects. While the benefits of intraoperative use of alpha-2 agonists, particularly dexmedetomidine, are well-studied, the evidence supporting the use of alpha-2 agonists in the postoperative setting remains scarce and optimal dosing regimens have not been identified. Common adverse effects of alpha-2 agonists include sedation, hypotension, and bradycardia. These risks should be considered when including alpha-2 agonists in a postoperative analgesia regimen given the limited evidence supporting their use in the postoperative setting.

Ketamine

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that antagonizes N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain and spinal cord to reduce transmission of pain signals. Intravenous ketamine infusions at subanesthetic doses have been shown to reduce opioid consumption and improve pain control without causing major adverse effects. The addition of ketamine to an opioid regimen has also been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, ketamine may prevent the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether perioperative ketamine use reduces the risk of developing persistent postsurgical pain. The most common adverse effects associated with use of subanesthetic doses of ketamine in the postoperative setting are neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and nightmares. Poorly controlled cardiovascular disease, hepatic dysfunction, elevated intracranial and intraocular pressure, active psychosis, and pregnancy are considered relative contraindications to ketamine use. As part of an ERP, ketamine infusions can be used as an analgesic adjunct for those with moderate-to-severe pain who have failed initial treatment options. Because ketamine at subanesthetic doses does not suppress airway reflexes and preserves spontaneous respirations, it can be used to reduce opioid intake in patients at risk for respiratory depression, such as those with obstructive sleep apnea. Ketamine may also be a particularly useful analgesic adjunct in patients who are opioid tolerant.

Persistent hyperadrenergic state after initial GABAergic therapy — if the hyperadrenergic state persists despite appropriate improvement in agitation and neuromuscular hyperactivity following treatment with benzodiazepines or other GABAergic agent, clinicians can consider adjunctive treatment with a beta blocker with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (eg, carvedilol, labetalol; Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation) or an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (eg, dexmedetomidine for severe symptoms, clonidine for mild to moderate symptoms; Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Where beta blockers are contraindicated, clinicians can consider other pharmacological options such as calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators, with consideration of other clinically relevant signs and symptoms (Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation), and clinicians should be alert to potential side effects, including poor control over tachycardia or reflex tachycardia (Moderate certainty, Strong Recommendation).

### Comparision of clonidine and dexmedetomidine for attenuation of laryngoscopy and intubation response – A randomized controlled trial [^5097ab30]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Clonidine and dexmedetomidine are alpha-2 agonists with beneficial effect on the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. The present study was designed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of intravenous clonidine 1 μg/kg, and dexmedetomidine in doses of 0.5 μg/kg and 1 μg/kg, for blunting the hemodynamic changes during laryngoscopy and intubation.

Method

Adult patients of ASA physical grade I/II scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia with endotracheal tube were randomly divided into three groups using a computer generated random number table, each group receiving one of the following drugs prior to induction of anaesthesia, by a blinded anaesthesiologist in a volume of 100 mL infused intravenously over 20 minutes: clonidine 1 μg/kg, or dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg/kg, or dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg. General anaesthesia was induced using standard technique and intubations performed by same anaesthesiologist. Heart rate and mean blood pressure were recorded in pre-operative room (baseline) and again at 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes and 10 minutes after intubation. An increase in heart rate and/or mean blood pressure by > 20% above baseline values during observation period was taken to indicate a positive intubation response.

Results

The incidence of intubation response was similar in all three groups (P > .05). The number of patients developing hypotension was significantly higher in group receiving dexmedetomidine1μg/kg group (P < .005) as compared to other two groups. Both the groups receiving dexmedetomidine had higher number of patients developing bradycardia as compared to patients receiving clonidine.

Discussion & Conclusion

Dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg/kg, 1 μg/kg and clonidine 1 μg/kg attenuate the laryngoscopy and intubation response but Clonidine 1 μg/kg was associated with lesser side effects.

### Nefopam for the prevention of perioperative shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^dbc6badf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Among all the pharmacological interventions, clonidine was the most frequently reported drug. According to the previous randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis, clonidine was effective in the treatment and prevention of postanesthetic shivering. However, clonidine was associated with some side effects, for instance, sedative effect, hypotension and bradycardia. Thus, these side effects limited its use. The opioids, such as tramadol, meperidine, alfentanil were also effective in the prevention and treatment of shivering. Nonetheless, these drugs were related to the risk of respiratory depression and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). According to all of the enrolled studies, nefopam was not associated with the increase of the risk of any serious side effect, which contribute much to its safety. None of the included studies reported on any side effect of nefopam. This is inconsistent with the previous reports. This is probably because the subjects of most of the included studies were under general anaesthesia.

Use of dexmedetomidine has been associated with increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension.

OVERDOSAGE

Hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, drowsiness, decreased or absent reflexes, irritability, and miosis. With large oral overdoses, reversible cardiac conduction defects or arrhythmias, apnea, coma, and seizures have been reported. As little as 100 mcg of oral clonidine has produced signs of toxicity in pediatric patients.

There is no specific antidote for clonidine overdosage. Supportive care may include atropine sulfate for bradycardia, intravenous fluids and/or vasopressor agents for hypotension. Hypertension associated with overdosage has been treated with intravenous furosemide, diazoxide or alpha-blocking agents such as phentolamine. Naloxone may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of clonidine induced respiratory depression, hypotension, and/or coma; blood pressure should be monitored since the administration of naloxone has occasionally resulted in paradoxical hypertension. Tolazoline administration has yielded inconsistent results and is not recommended as first-line therapy. Dialysis is not likely to significantly enhance the elimination of clonidine.

The largest overdose reported to date involved a 28-year old white male who ingested 100 mg of clonidine hydrochloride powder. This patient developed hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, apnea, hallucinations, semi-coma, and premature ventricular contractions. The patient fully recovered after intensive treatment. Plasma clonidine levels were 60 ng/mL after 1 hour, 190 ng/mL after 1.5 hours, 370 ng/mL after 2 hours, and 120 ng/mL after 5.5 and 6.5 hours. In mice and rats, the oral LD50 of clonidine is 206 and 465 mg/kg, respectively.

### Analgesic outcomes in opioid use disorder patients receiving spinal anesthesia with or without intrathecal clonidine for cesarean delivery: a retrospective investigation [^897e93de]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The adverse effects of IT clonidine can be anticipated and include maternal sedation, hypotension and bradycardia. The clonidine group in the present study did in fact have greater incidence of intraoperative hypotension, higher maximum phenylephrine infusion dose and a higher percentage of patients receiving a second vasopressor medication (IV ephedrine in all cases). We observed similar incidence of hypotension with IT clonidine compared to previous published data. If IT clonidine is administered, the increased potential for hypotension should be anticipated and can be effectively managed with higher starting dose of phenylephrine infusion and proceeding to a second-line vasopressor relatively quickly if needed. The IT clonidine group in the present study also had greater incidence of hypotension in the recovery area, however these instances of hypotension were not severe and managed with IV fluid boluses only (no vasopressors were administered). It should be recognized that the slightly higher dose of IT bupivacaine may have also contributed to the greater incidence of hypotension observed in the clonidine group in this study. We observed no differences in the incidence of bradycardia or treatment for bradycardia. Lastly, sedation from IT clonidine is an important side-effect and a further limitation of this retrospective study was that we were unable to gain reliable data on patient sedation in the OR or recovery area from retrospective chart reviews. It would be beneficial to be able to ascertain incidence of intraoperative or postoperative sedation from a prospective study. We sought to determine if higher doses of IT clonidine resulted in greater incidence of side effects (Table 4), and in our sample size of 22 subjects we did not observe any difference in analgesic outcomes or side effects with higher doses of IT clonidine.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, drowsiness, decreased or absent reflexes, weakness, irritability and miosis. The frequency of CNS depression may be higher in children than adults. Large overdoses may result in reversible cardiac conduction defects or dysrhythmias, apnea, coma, and seizures. Signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within 30 minutes to two hours after exposure. As little as 0.1 mg of clonidine has produced signs of toxicity in children.

There is no specific antidote for clonidine overdosage. Clonidine overdosage may result in the rapid development of CNS depression; therefore, induction of vomiting with ipecac syrup is not recommended. Gastric lavage may be indicated following recent and/or large ingestions. Administration of activated charcoal and/or a cathartic may be beneficial. Supportive care may include atropine sulfate for bradycardia, intravenous fluids and/or vasopressor agents for hypotension and vasodilators for hypertension. Naloxone may be a useful adjunct for the management of clonidine-induced respiratory depression, hypotension and/or coma; blood pressure should be monitored since the administration of naloxone has occasionally resulted in paradoxical hypertension. Tolazoline administration has yielded inconsistent results and is not recommended as first-line therapy. Dialysis is not likely to significantly enhance the elimination of clonidine.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

No drug interaction studies have been conducted with NEXICLON XR. The following have been reported with other oral formulations of clonidine.

Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs. If a patient receiving clonidine hydrochloride is also taking tricyclic antidepressants, the hypotensive effect of clonidine may be reduced, necessitating an increase in the clonidine dose.

Monitor heart rate in patients receiving clonidine concomitantly with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction, e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers. Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concomitantly with diltiazem or verapamil.

Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

Alcohol: Based on in vitro studies, high concentration of alcohol may increase the rate of release of NEXICLON XR.

### The effect of dexmedetomidine on vasopressor requirements in patients with septic shock: a subgroup analysis of the sedation practice in intensive care evaluation [SPICE III] trial [^a2c02c9d]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In septic shock, sympathetic activation and release of endogenous catecholamines are necessary physiological mechanisms to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. However, excessive release of endogenous catecholamines in combination with exogenous catecholamines can cause sympathetic overstimulation with detrimental effects on organ function and patient outcomes. Sympathetic overstimulation may also cause downregulation and desensitization of alpha-adrenergic receptors. Such catecholamine hyposensitivity may also contribute to hemodynamic instability and poor outcomes.

In experimental animal models of sepsis, high doses of central alpha-2-agonists like clonidine and dexmedetomidine increase vasopressor responsiveness. Moreover, even in non-septic patients, alpha-2-agonists are associated with lower vasopressor requirements, increased arterial blood pressure, and enhanced baroreceptor response. However, significant hemodynamic side effects of dexmedetomidine can also occur such as hypotension and bradycardia.

In the Sedation Practice in Intensive Care Evaluation (SPICE III) Trial, critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation received early dexmedetomidine for primary sedation or usual sedation. The study design and randomization scheme provided the unique opportunity to explore the hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine in patients with septic shock. Thus, in this two-center retrospective subgroup analysis of patients with septic shock included in the SPICE III trial, we assessed the physiological effects of dexmedetomidine on vasopressor requirements and blood pressure in the first 48 h after randomization.

### Safety of intrathecal clonidine as an adjuvant to spinal anesthesia in infants and children [^1430633f]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Clonidine is an α 2 ‐adrenergic agonist originally applied clinically for the treatment of hypertension. More recently, it has been shown to be a safe and effective adjuvant for neuraxial anesthesia in adults, especially within obstetrical practice. However, there is less understanding regarding its use for neuraxial anesthesia in infants and children. Spinal anesthesia has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia (GA) for certain surgical procedures. This may be particularly beneficial in pediatric populations, as it avoids the need for airway manipulation and obviates concerns parents may have related to the perceived risks of general anesthesia. An impediment to the use of spinal anesthesia in infants is the short duration of action relative to adults. Clonidine has been shown to prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia as well as reduce the intraoperative requirements for sedation and analgesics. Regarding its safety profile, Walker et al. previously demonstrated that intrathecal clonidine did not produce signs of spinal cord toxicity in rat pups, even at super‐therapeutic dosages. While preliminary clinical studies in humans have also indicated that clonidine is safe to use as an intrathecal adjuvant in spinal anesthesia, these cohorts have generally been limited to fewer than 100 patients. Although adverse effects including bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression have been reported, the smaller cohort size may limit an accurate evaluation of the safety and adverse effect profile of clonidine.

We previously reported our experience with spinal anesthesia instead of GA in more than 1200 pediatric patients, demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of spinal anesthesia as an anesthetic technique, but we did not differentiate between patients that did or did not receive clonidine. Since that time, we have continued to successfully administer intrathecal clonidine to hundreds of infants undergoing spinal anesthesia, and we present our experience in the present manuscript.

### Clonidine as an adjunct therapy to opioids for neonatal abstinence syndrome: a randomized, controlled trial [^c061da44]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if oral clonidine would reduce the duration of opioid detoxification for neonatal abstinence syndrome.

Methods

Infants with intrauterine exposure to methadone or heroin and neonatal abstinence syndrome (2 consecutive modified Finnegan scores of ≥ 9) were enrolled at 2 hospitals during 2002–2005 and followed until final hospital discharge. All enrolled infants (80) received oral diluted tincture of opium according to a standardized algorithm and were randomly assigned to receive oral clonidine (1 microg/kg every 4 hours) (40 infants) or placebo (40 infants). Primary outcome was duration of opioid therapy. Secondary outcomes included the amount of opium required to control symptoms, number of treatment failures, and differences in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.

Results

The median length of therapy was 27% shorter in the clonidine group (11 [95% confidence interval: 8–15 days]) than in the placebo group (15 days [95% confidence interval: 12–17 days]). In the clonidine group, 7 infants required restarting opium after initial discontinuation versus none in the placebo group, with the total length of treatment/observation remaining significantly less in the clonidine group. Higher dosages of opium were required by 40% of the infants in the placebo group versus 20% in the clonidine group. Treatment failures occurred in 12.5% of the infants in the placebo group versus none in the clonidine group. Hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, or desaturations did not occur in either group. Three infants in the clonidine group died as a result of myocarditis, sudden infant death syndrome, and homicide, all after hospital discharge and before 6 months of age.

Conclusions

In this randomized, double-blind trial, adding clonidine to standard opioid therapy for detoxification from in utero exposure to methadone or heroin reduced the duration of pharmacotherapy for neonatal abstinence without causing short-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes. A larger trial is indicated to determine long-term safety.

Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Clonidine — systemic use after cesarean delivery in pregnant people with OUD: Evidence is limited; a case series of 7 patients observed hypotension in 2 of 7 with no bradycardia or sedation, and there are no data on systemic clonidine use in OUD. High serum levels with oral clonidine were found during breastfeeding although most did not have adverse effects, and single postpartum dose or infusion as an analgesic adjunct has not been studied in breastfeeding people with or without OUD. Clinical recommendations state there are no data to support or refute routine systemic clonidine use and its effectiveness is uncertain (Class IIb, Level C-EO); alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as intravenous clonidine may be proposed but must be balanced with goals of sedation avoidance, early ambulation, and newborn care (Class IIb, Level C-EO), and side effects must be closely evaluated with appropriate monitoring (Class IIb, Level C-EO).

4 Discussion

In the present manuscript, we examine the use of IT clonidine in neonates, infants, and toddlers. The cohort includes 1420 patients less than 3 years of age, and we focus specifically on the safety profile of IT clonidine. We also provide our clinical experience with the use of IT clonidine for same‐day surgery, with a large percent of our patients being discharged home. The safety profile was demonstrated as we were able to effectively collect data on readmission rates and return to the ED for perioperative concerns. Previous studies have generally focused on smaller infants with post‐surgical hospital admission.

Clonidine is an α 2 ‐adrenergic agonist that was originally released in 1966 for clinical use in the treatment of hypertension. With the development of more effective medications with improved adverse effect profiles, its use for the treatment of hypertension decreased over the ensuing decades. Despite this, other clinical applications have expanded to the treatment of ADHD, drug withdrawal, sleep and psychiatric disorders, and spasticity. It is available in several formulations for clinical use, including an oral tablet, transdermal patch, and a formulation for neuraxial administration. Clonidine exerts its physiologic effects primarily by binding to and activating α 2 ‐adrenergic receptors, resulting in sedation and analgesia. It is also known to cause potential adverse effects such as bradycardia and hypotension. Previous authors have reported the use of clonidine as an adjuvant to local anesthetic agents for spinal anesthesia; these studies are outlined in Table 5. Intrathecal clonidine has been used in spinal anesthesia for both infants as well as older children. It has primarily been described as an adjuvant that increases spinal duration, but it also can decrease overall sedation requirements. Here, we looked specifically at clonidine's safety profile in infants undergoing general or urologic surgeries.

### Clonidine and dexmedetomidine for controlled hypotension during functional endoscopic sinus surgery: a comparative study [^e9a636c8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study was a randomized controlled trial comparing clonidine to dexmedetomidine for controlled hypotension during FESS. The study identified both drugs as potential agent for controlled hypotension during anaesthesia with some dissimilarities. Age, gender and duration of surgery were similar in both groups. Our results are similar to those observed by Escamilia et al. in Spain.

MAP in both groups were comparable from baseline to the end of the surgery. The targeted MAP (55–65 mmHg) was reached and maintained in both groups during surgery, without need of additional drug to decrease blood pressure. However, HR was lower in D compared to group C but not reaching severe bradycardia from baseline to the end of the surgery. Our results are similar to the results of Suggala et al. and Bafna et al.

In fact, Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (clonidine or dexmedetomidine) induce decrease in HR and MAP secondary to inhibition of central sympathetic outflow by stimulation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors which cause decrease in norepinephrine release. Dexmedetomidine has higher selectivity to alpha-2 receptors (α2:α1 ratio of 1620:1) comparing to clonidine (α2:α1 ratio of 200:1), consequently dexmedetomidine is eight time more potent than clonidine regarding their pharmacological action on alpha-2 adrenergic receptor.

Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation cause reflex sympathetic stimulation (hypertension and tachycardia) known as pressor response. In our study, both drugs provided acceptable conditions for laryngoscopy and intubation by blunting the pressor response. Contrary to our results, Hussain et al. comparing three groups receiving either clonidine 2µg/kg in 100mL normal saline over 10 min, or dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg in 100mL of normal saline over 10 min or normal saline 100mL of over 10 min (control group) for attenuation of the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation, found that there was significant reduction in hemodynamic response in clonidine and dexmedetomidine group as compared to controls but attenuation of pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation was acceptable with dexmedetomidine than with clonidine. This difference may be explained by the use of different doses and absence of alpha-2 agonist infusion after loading dose in their studies.

### Pediatric regional anesthesia: a practical guideline for daily clinical practice [^68dc9f81]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A number of drugs are available that, used as an additive to local anesthetics, can increase the durations of nerve blockade. For caudal blocks, two α 2 -receptor agonists are eligible, clonidine being more widely used, while dexmedetomidine (the more selective agonist) is catching up in popularity. Added at the usual dose level of 1 to 2 µg/kg, either drug can extend analgesia to twice its normal duration. While clonidine has been associated with respiratory depression in (former) neonates, our in-house standard of monitoring newborns of up to and including 60 weeks of postgestational age greater than 24 h after surgery will allow these events (usually manifesting as prolonged episodes of apnea) to be detected and adequately managed. Sedation, mainly observed with dexmedetomidine at doses greater than 2 µg/kg, is a desirable side effect of α 2 -receptor agonists intraoperatively but can lead to protracted stays in the recovery room.

Lipophilic opioids also can be used as additives for pediatric caudal blockade, with fentanyl normally being added at a dose of 1 µg/kg. While offering a prolongation effect on postoperative analgesia similar to clonidine, side effects are more prevalent, including respiratory depression, vomiting, or bradycardia. Other additive drugs that have been described for caudal blockade in children, like preservative-free S(+)-ketamine, or tramadol, have never gained a foothold in daily clinical practice.

Thanks to exact research, pediatric caudal blockade has evolved into a technique that covers a broad spectrum of clinical indications in a growing number of patients. Today, we can perform blocks of this type with a safe pharmacologic profile in pediatric patients of all ages, from extreme neonates up to patients weighing 50 kg.

TABLE 5
Previous reports of intrathecal clonidine use in pediatric patients.

We based the decision to utilize intrathecal clonidine at our institution on multiple factors. Initially, clonidine seemed a more ideal choice when compared to intrathecal opioids due to its more favorable side effect profile; clonidine is not known to cause the common opioid‐related side effects such as nausea, pruritus, constipation, and respiratory depression. Further, clonidine's ability to extend the duration of single‐shot neuraxial blockade has been well established in the pediatric literature. Following the first 2 years of performing infant spinal anesthesia at our institution, we were able to publish our findings that intrathecal bupivacaine with epinephrine and clonidine, in fact, reliably produced analgesia for surgeries lasting from 60 to 100 min.

We have previously reported a high success rate and a low incidence of adverse effects with spinal anesthesia in infants, demonstrating its safety in the ambulatory setting in a retrospective study of patients receiving spinal anesthesia instead of GA. In the present study, no patient developed apnea or bradypnea that required intervention with bag‐valve‐mask ventilation; hypoxemia was easily treated with the administration of NC oxygen, and although a low HR or sBP was noted in some patients, treatment with atropine was required only once for bradycardia. Of the 57 patients who returned to the ED/UC within 7 days after their procedure, only four patients reported respiratory distress or postoperative pain as the cause of their return, with most patients primarily citing the surgical site. Of the 14 patients that experienced unplanned admissions after surgery, only two were admitted for apnea monitoring.

### Risk factors for severe bradycardia during oral clonidine therapy for hypertension… [^66ca9a46]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We identified eight hypertensive patients who developed severe bradycardia during oral clonidine hydrochloride therapy. Seven patients had sinus bradycardia, four had long sinus pauses, two had junctional bradycardia, and two had high-degree atrioventricular block. Three populations at risk for severe bradycardia during oral clonidine therapy were identified: patients with renal insufficiency, patients with clinical sinus node dysfunction, and patients who had developed bradycardia while taking other sympatholytic agents or who were currently receiving another sympatholytic drug. Clonidine effects were dissociated in two patients who were not hypotensive despite severe bradycardia. Asymptomatic patients required only dose reduction or discontinuation of clonidine therapy. Symptomatic patients responded inconsistently to intravenous atropine sulfate therapy; one responded to isoproterenol therapy, and one required temporary artificial pacing.

Awareness of the variable presentation and response of this bradycardia to medical therapy will assist patient management. The incidence of this complication is low, but attention to risk factors should make clonidineinduced bradycardia even less frequent. Byrd BF, Collins HW, Primm RK. Risk Factors for Severe Bradycardia During Oral Clonidine Therapy for Hypertension. Arch Intern Med. 1988; 148: 729–733.

General

In patients who have developed localized contact sensitization to clonidine transdermal system, continuation of clonidine transdermal system or substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride therapy may be associated with the development of a generalized skin rash.

In patients who develop an allergic reaction to clonidine transdermal system, substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride may also elicit an allergic reaction (including generalized rash, urticaria, or angioedema).

The sympatholytic action of clonidine may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. There are post-marketing reports of patients with conduction abnormalities and/or taking other sympatholytic drugs who developed severe bradycardia requiring IV atropine, IV isoproterenol and temporary cardiac pacing while taking clonidine.

In hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma, no therapeutic effect of clonidine hydrochloride tablets can be expected.

Perioperative Use

Administration of clonidine hydrochloride tablets, USP should be continued to within four hours of surgery and resumed as soon as possible thereafter. Blood pressure should be carefully monitored during surgery and additional measures to control blood pressure should be available if required.

Information for Patients

Patients should be cautioned against interruption of clonidine hydrochloride tablets therapy without their physician's advice.

Since patients may experience a possible sedative effect, dizziness, or accommodation disorder with use of clonidine, caution patients about engaging in activities such as driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery. Also, inform patients that this sedative effect may be increased by concomitant use of alcohol, barbiturates, or other sedating drugs.

Patients who wear contact lenses should be cautioned that treatment with clonidine hydrochloride tablets may cause dryness of eyes.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^13a5a66f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses is it best to go beyond treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, is it best to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine or can you cross-taper?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the order of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily, due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young people may be able to tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that the sedation has additional benefits to sleep and comorbidities. Therefore, in these children, higher doses may be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. As clonidine can also be divided into two or three doses, quite often children who are sensitive to guanfacine side effects find that a BD or TDS regime of clonidine suits them better than the once daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, whereas guanfacine appears to be more potent at post synaptic receptors, which translates into increased prefrontal activity and impulse control regulation and improvement in behaviour regulation. Therefore, in the case of comorbidities where behavioural modification is desired, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines indicate 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day suggesting that a rough equivalency is: Guanfacine 1 mg = Clonidine 100 mcg.

If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective to reduce and withdrawal clonidine first, before initiating guanfacine, this is likely to be best practise, as the side effects will be additive. Reducing clonidine by 25 mg every 3–5 days is thought to be appropriate to facilitate this reduction.

However, it may not be beneficial from a tic/sleep/behaviour perspective to reduce and withdraw clonidine completely before starting guanfacine. In these circumstances, cross-tapering is recommended by reducing clonidine to 100 mcg daily before initiating guanfacine at 1mg daily. Following on from this, all remaining clonidine doses are reduced by 25 mcg every 3 days before guanfacine is increased as necessary.

### Massive clonidine overdose in a paediatric patient due to a pharmacy compounding error and a primer on investigating suspected compounding errors [^d90b823e]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

An early childhood male (2–5 years) who was prescribed clonidine presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, bradycardia and hypertension after an accidental clonidine overdose traced to a pharmacy compounding error. The patient was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit and developed paralytic ileus, which necessitated nasogastric tube placement. An investigation by the State Board of Pharmacy revealed that the error involved the use of clonidine powder instead of tablets during the compounding process, which resulted in a 1000-fold overdose. This case highlights key historical details a clinician should elicit to assess the likelihood of a compounding error. We outline here important steps for investigation and management when such an error is suspected.

### The protocol of the oslo study of clonidine in elderly patients with delirium; LUCID: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^334fb6be]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical experience with clonidine

Clonidine has been used as an anti-hypertensive drug for decades, as well as for anesthesia-related applications, such as perioperative analgesia, sedation and anxiolysis, and for management of both acute postoperative, chronic and neuropathic pain. In one study, use of intravenous clonidine after surgical correction of acute type-A aortic dissection reduced the severity of delirium, improved the respiratory function and shortened the length of stay in the intensive care unit.

The adverse effects of clonidine include orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia and AV-block. Such effects are, however, dependent on dosage. In a previous report, low-dose treatment (75 μg) in healthy adults was associated with a reduction in heart rate from 72 beats/min to 63 beats/min, and a reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 88 mmHg to 75 mmHg. Less than 50% experienced sedation, dry mouth or dizziness, and for those who reported any of these side-effects, the severity was mild. Clonidine has been studied in outpatients with Alzheimer's dementia and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Treatment with daily doses of clonidine less than 200 mcg was well tolerated in these patients. Relative contraindications to clonidine for its licensed indications include bradyarrhythmias, polyneuropathy, renal insufficiency and evidence of reduced cerebral and/or peripheral circulation due to vessel disease

Pharmacokinetics of clonidine

Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) following oral administration occurs after 1–3 h and reduction in mean arterial pressure as well as the risk of side effects is highest at this peak. Cmax and area under the concentration-time-curve (AUC) increase proportionally with increasing doses. Clonidine traverses the blood–brain-barrier. The half-life during the elimination phase shows great inter-individual variation and is found to be between 5 and 25.5 hours. The metabolism is hepatic and the metabolites are inactive. Clonidine is mainly excreted renally (70%).

### Metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor) [^83899c39]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7. DRUG INTERACTIONS

Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. (7.1)
Patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. (7.2)
CYP2D6 Inhibitors are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. (7.3)
Concomitant use of glycosides, clonidine, and diltiazem and verapamil with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. (7.4)
Beta-blockers including metoprolol, may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. (7.4)

7.1 Catecholamine Depleting Drugs

Observe patients treated with LOPRESSOR plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Catecholamine depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents.

7.2 Epinephrine

The cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, such as metoprolol. Higher doses of epinephrine might be necessary for patients taking metoprolol.

7.3 CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Monitor patients closely when the combination use of CYP2D6 inhibitor and metoprolol cannot be avoided. Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these may also increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the beta1cardioselectivity of metoprolol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Negative Chronotropes

If clonidine and metoprolol are coadministered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because metoprolol may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine with metoprolol, delay the introduction of metoprolol for several days after clonidine discontinuation.

Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem, and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia.

### Efficacy and safety of clonidine for the treatment of impulse control disorder in Parkinson's disease: a multicenter, parallel, randomised, double-blind, phase 2b clinical trial [^375496d8]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Secondary endpoints

At 4 weeks, compared to patients in the placebo arm, patients receiving clonidine had a larger reduction of the mean total QUIP-RS score (7.9 versus 2.9 points). At 8 weeks, this difference became greater; 11.0 points under clonidine versus 3.6 under placebo (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
QUIP-RS total score at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks for placebo and clonidine group

The frequency of success in reducing QUIP-RS at 4 weeks did not differ between groups (4/20 in the placebo arm (20%) and 4/19 in the clonidine arm (21%).

In the mixed effect model, the estimated mean difference of QUIP-RS evolution between clonidine and placebo groups was – 3.8 (95%CI [– 7.2; 0.4]) (see details in supplemental data).

There was no worsening of motor or non-motor manifestations under clonidine.

The MDS UPDRS total and component scores, STAI-Y-A and B, ECMP, and the Epworth scale remained stable at 8 weeks in the ITT population. The PDQ39 score was better at 8 weeks than inclusion in the clonidine group and worse in the placebo group (Table 2).

Table 2
Secondary objectives

Adherence

Patients in the clonidine group had a good adherence monitored using capsule count; 74% of the patients received at least 75% of treatment doses for all periods between visits.

Safety

Overall, clonidine was well tolerated with no unexpected safety issues (Table 3). During the study, there were three positive orthostatic hypotension tests in the clonidine arm and two in the placebo arm. Orthostatic hypotension was not associated with any falls or other symptoms. One fall was notified in a patient of the clonidine arm but unrelated to orthostatic hypotension. One asymptomatic bradycardia was detected during follow-up in the clonidine group (between 50 and 60 bpm). Sleepiness was reported in one patient in the clonidine arm and two patients in the placebo arm.

### Clonidine (clonidine hydrochloride) [^8713cb51]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

During the taper period of the fixed-dose monotherapy study the maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in systolic blood pressure was +3.4 mmHg on clonidine HCl extended-release 0.2 mg/day and -5.6 mmHg on clonidine HCl extended-release 0.4 mg/day. The maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in diastolic blood pressure was +3.3 mmHg on clonidine HCl extended-release 0.2 mg/day and -5.4 mmHg on clonidine HCl extended-release 0.4 mg/day. The maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in heart rate was -0.6 beats per minute on clonidine HCl extended-release 0.2 mg/day and -3.0 beats per minute on clonidine HCl extended-release 0.4 mg/day.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clonidine HCl extended-release. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events exclude those already mentioned in 6.1:

Psychiatric: hallucinations

Cardiovascular: Q-T prolongation

### Effect of propranolol and clonidine after severe traumatic brain injury: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^cd0c305e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Patients were administered either both propranolol and clonidine (treatment arm), or placebo. All patients and study personnel, except for the pharmacist and biostatistician, were blinded to treatment assignment. Treatment (or placebo) delivery started within 48 h of injury but after plasma and 24-h urine catecholamine measurements were obtained. Both drugs (or double placebos) were administered at staggered times for 7 days with drug holds for hemodynamic parameters. Propranolol was administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg every 6 h, and doses were held for heart rate less than 60 bpm, mean arterial pressure less than 60 mmHg, and/or cerebral perfusion pressure less than 60 mmHg. Placebo was intravenous administration of sterile 0.9% normal saline. Clonidine was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg per tube every 12 h and was held for mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg and/or cerebral perfusion pressure < 60 mmHg. Placebo was per tube administration of microcrystalline cellulose compounded by the investigational drug service. If hemodynamic parameters were met while a patient was on vasopressors, drug delivery still occurred. We documented compliance with treatment delivery and any reasons for missed administrations.

Clinicians were allowed to use β -blockers at any point if there was a myocardial infarction or need for heart rate control refractory to calcium channel blockers and anti-arrhythmic medications. Dexmedetomidine, a prototypical α 2 -agonist, was allowed if standard sedation regimens, such as propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam, failed to achieve adequate sedation. In the case of vasopressors, phenylephrine and vasopressin were preferred agents, with additional support from inotropes dobutamine and milrinone. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine agents were avoided unless increased cardiac output was needed or further systemic vascular resistance was required beyond that produced by preferred vasopressors. We tracked the use of non-study β -blockers and α 2 -agonists. Ventilators were weaned utilizing clinical judgment by an interdisciplinary team of respiratory therapists, critical care fellows, and attending physicians, who conducted twice-daily simultaneous spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, a practice developed at our institution.

Safety monitoring

This phase II study focused on safety and efficacy. Safety parameters collected throughout the study included cardiac complications such as dysrhythmia (e.g. symptomatic bradycardia), myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and neuro-worsening. All serious, unexpected, and study-related adverse events were reported in a blinded fashion to the Data Safety Monitoring Board within 24 h.

### A comprehensive review of the use of alpha 2 agonists in spinal anesthetics [^7f1fdc96]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal Anesthesia was the first regional anesthetic technique to be performed. It was performed by Dr. August Bier, known for the Bier block, and his colleagues on August 16, 1898. Dr. Bier opted for, what he referred to at the time as "cocainization of the spinal cord" by introducing 15 mg of cocaine intrathecally prior to the operation. The surgery was largely uneventful and painless. The patient only experienced some vomiting and a headache postoperatively. Dr. Bier's use of neuraxial anesthesia aimed to directly inject local anesthetics in and around the central nervous system (CNS) for more direct control of pain and anesthesia. Local anesthetics were an important discovery in anesthesiology. However, since the advent of local anesthetics and spinal anesthesia as an alternative technique to general anesthesia, much has been learned about both the benefits and adverse effects of local anesthetics. It was quickly learned that use of local anesthetics would be limited by their potential for life-threatening toxic effects. For this reason, there was a push towards development of novel local anesthetics that had a larger therapeutic window with less likelihood of serious side effects. In addition to developing newer local anesthetics, the idea of adding adjuvants provided an opportunity to potentially limit the life-threatening events. These adjuvants would include medications such as epinephrine and alpha-2 agonists, such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine. Other adjuvants include opioids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids.

Objectives

In this review, we will delve further into the indications, contraindications, uses, mechanisms, and future of spinal anesthesia and its adjuvants.

Study Design

A literature review of recent publications in the field of alpha 2 agonists used in spinal anesthetics was carried out from 2015 to present day. Consensus opinions were formulated in various areas.

Setting

This literature review was carried out at various medical universities throughout the nation and Europe.

Limitations

As research has only just begun in this field data is limited at this time.

Conclusions

The use of spinal anesthesia provides a reliable dermatome blockade to facilitate many different surgical procedures. The combination of local anesthetics with opioid medications within the subarachnoid space has been the standard of care. Adjuvant medications like alpha 2 agonists may play a significant role in prolonging spinal blockade as well as limiting cardiovascular complications such as hypotension and bradycardia. The use of alpha 2 agonists instead of opioid medications intrathecally decreases pruritus and delayed respiratory depression. Animal models have demonstrated the synergistic effects of utilizing alpha 2 agonists with opioids in the subarachnoid space. The addition of clonidine to fentanyl and local anesthetic demonstrated a shorter time to neural blockade, but no significant change in duration of the spinal. Interestingly alpha 2 agonists with local anesthetics showed increase block duration compared to opioid with local anesthetics. Further human trials need to be undertaken to analyze the effectiveness of alpha 2 agonists in the intrathecal space, but preliminary data does indicate it is an exemplary alternative to opioids.

### Notes from the field: xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer, identified as an emerging novel substance in drug overdose deaths-Connecticut, 2019–2020 [^1a3b383a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Xylazine, a clonidine analog, is a nonopioid veterinary tranquilizer not intended for human use. Recreational drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl are often adulterated with agents such as xylazine to enhance drug effects or increase street value by increasing net weight. Xylazine is known to cause hypotension and bradycardia when used in humans. Although not a controlled substance in the United States, xylazine cannot be purchased without a veterinary license. Misuse of xylazine was reported in Puerto Rico in the early 2000s. Recreational use of xylazine can occur via oral ingestion, inhalation or sniffing, or intravenous injection; however, injection is the most common route of administration. The effects of xylazine when used contemporaneously with other illicit drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl are still not widely known. No antidote is recommended for the effects of xylazine overdose. One recent study suggests that high doses of naloxone might reverse the effects of a clonidine overdose. However, given that this finding is from a single study of a small cohort of pediatric patients, it might not be generalizable to the broader population. Furthermore, no reports specific to xylazine and naloxone exist regarding reversal of effects.

### Dexmedetomidine (Igalmi) [^95468e9c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hypotension, Orthostatic Hypotension, and Bradycardia

IGALMI causes dose-dependent hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and bradycardia. In clinical studies, 18%, 16%, and 9% of patients treated with 180 mcg of IGALMI, 120 mcg of IGALMI, and placebo, respectively, experienced orthostatic hypotension (defined as SBP decrease ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP decrease ≥ 10 mmHg after 1, 3, or 5 minutes of standing) at 2 hours post-dose. In those studies, 7%, 6%, and 1% of patients treated with 180 mcg of IGALMI, 120 mcg of IGALMI, and placebo, respectively, experienced HR ≤ 50 beats per minute within 2 hours of dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical studies with IGALMI, patients were excluded if they had treatment with alpha-1 noradrenergic blockers, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics or antipsychotic drugs four hours prior to study drug administration; had a history of syncope or syncopal attacks; SBP < 110 mmHg; DBP < 70 mmHg; HR < 55 beats per minute; or had evidence of hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension.

Reports of hypotension and bradycardia, including some resulting in fatalities, have been associated with the use of another dexmedetomidine product given intravenously (IGALMI is for sublingual or buccal use and is not approved for intravenous use). Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported after administration of this other dexmedetomidine product to young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone and when this product was given by rapid intravenous or bolus administration.

Because IGALMI decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension, and in geriatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Avoid use of IGALMI in patients with hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, advanced heart block, severe ventricular dysfunction, or history of syncope. After IGALMI administration, patients should be adequately hydrated and should sit or lie down until vital signs are within normal range. If a patient is unable to remain seated or lying down, precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of falls. Ensure that a patient is alert and not experiencing orthostatic hypotension or symptomatic hypotension prior to allowing them to resume ambulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) — alpha2-agonist management — answers that alpha2-agonist–related IWS should be treated with IV and/or or enteral alpha2-agonist replacement therapy to attenuate symptoms, irrespective of preceding dose and/or duration of alpha2-agonist exposure (good practice). The rationale notes that data regarding the optimal weaning and/or replacement strategies remain limited, and limited data suggest reduced IWS symptoms, specifically otherwise unexplained tachycardia and hypertension, with adjunct use of enteral clonidine prior to dexmedetomidine infusion weaning and/or discontinuation. Based on an international survey, 81% of respondents reported clonidine initiation in conjunction with a regimented dexmedetomidine wean to prevent withdrawal, but reported dosing was variable and the survey did not provide the rate of dexmedetomidine wean or evaluate the impact on breakthrough IWS symptoms.

### Unintentional pediatric exposures to central α-2 agonists reported to the national poison data system [^734e3e1b]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate national trends in unintentional pediatric exposures to 3 common alpha-2 agonists: clonidine, guanfacine, and tizanidine. Secondary objectives were to describe outcomes, symptoms, treatments, and death.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review from the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System from January 2000 to December 2011 for unintentional exposure to clonidine, guanfacine, and tizanidine in children ≤ 12 years of age.

Results

From 2000–2011, there was a significant increase (5.9% per year, CI 3.6, 8.2) in unintentional pediatric exposures to National Poison Data System for central alpha-2 agonists. There were 27,825 clonidine exposures (67.3% male, median age: 4 years), 6143 guanfacine exposures (69.8% male, median age: 6 years), and 856 tizanidine exposures (51.9% male, median age: 2 years). Guanfacine had the greatest proportional increase among the medications. Clonidine was associated with the most respiratory (799, 2.9%) and central nervous system symptoms (12,612, 45.3%), as well as the most episodes of bradycardia (2847, 10.2%) and hypotension (2365, 8.5%). Seven-hundred twenty-eight (2.0%) patients were intubated, and 141 patients (0.5%) were administered vasopressors. There were 7 cardiac arrests and 3 deaths from clonidine.

Conclusions

The number of unintentional pediatric exposures to alpha-2 agonists increased from 2000–2011. Clonidine exposures were the most commonly reported, more symptomatic, and associated with 3 deaths. Despite central nervous system depression, bradycardia, and hypotension being common, the need for intubation and vasopressors was rare.

### Significance of the imidazoline receptors in toxicology [^8f5c3c01]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The alpha-2 adrenergic (AA-2) receptor agonists and imidazolines are common exposures in the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) National Poison Data System (NPDS). Although the interaction between the AA-2 receptor and imidazoline receptors has been extensively studied, it largely remains unknown to health-care professionals. This review describes these interactions and mechanisms by which agonists affect physiologic responses binding to these receptors.

Methods

Papers published in English from 1960 to 2013 were retrieved from PubMed. A total of 323 original articles were identified and 173 were included. Background. The toxicity associated with clonidine (e.g., bradycardia, miosis, and hypotension) is largely assumed to be secondary to the functional overlap of the AA-2 receptors and the mu receptors. However, the effects at the AA-2 receptor could not fully account for these symptoms. Subsequently, clonidine was found to produce its pharmacologic effect in the central nervous system (CNS) by interaction not only with the AA-2 receptor but also on selective imidazoline receptors. IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTORS: Since their discovery, three distinct classes of imidazoline receptors, also known as imidazoline binding sites or imidazoline/guanidinium receptive sites, have been characterized. Imidazoline-1 (I-1) receptors are involved in the hypotensive activity of clonidine and related compounds supporting the idea that the I-1 receptors are upstream from the AA-2 receptor and work in tandem for its effect on blood pressure. Additionally, stimulation of N-type Calcium-2 channels, G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium channel, adenosine receptors, phosphatidyl-choline-specific phospholipase C, and nicotinic receptors have been implicated to be involved. Previous studies have shown that I-1 receptors may also be involved in other physiologic responses beyond cardiac function. Imidazoline-2 (I-2) receptors interact with monoamine oxidase A and monoamine oxidase B leading to research that has focused on the effect of I-2 receptors and depression and the suggestion of a possible antidepressant action of the imidazolines. I-2 receptor ligands may have substantial antinociceptive activity and work synergistically with opioids in acute pain. Imidazoline-3 (I-3) receptors are located on the pancreatic β-cells and modulate glucose homeostasis. IMIDAZOLINE LIGANDS: Four endogenous compounds have been found to bind and include clonidine-displacing substance, agmatine, harmane, and imidazole acetic acid. Significant interest in developing new agents with higher selectivity and affinity for I-1 receptors has resulted. Toxicology. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor and imidazoline receptor agonists such as clonidine and tetrahydrozoline are common ingestions reported to poison control centers. The most common toxic effects of clonidine are similar to those of the over-the-counter imidazolines and include CNS depression, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, miosis, hypothermia, and hypertension (early and transient). Based on their structure and subsequent studies, imidazoline receptors seem to be the primary binding site for these chemicals. Case reports typically illustrate rapid onset of action with serious side effects following ingestion of relatively small amounts. These agents have been reportedly used in drug-assisted sexual assaults.

Conclusion

Much of the toxicity associated with drugs such as clonidine, guanfacine, and tetrahydrozoline are due to their binding to imidazoline receptors. Knowledge of the imidazoline receptors may lead to new therapeutic agents and inform management of patients with imidazoline overdose.

### Comprehensive mechanisms and non-invasive treatment for complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review [^9ce0eadf]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Alpha-Adrenergic Modulators

Alpha-Adrenergic Agonists

Alpha(α)-adrenergic agonists reduce sympathetic activity by mimicking the inhibitory effects of norepinephrine, thereby suppressing preganglionic sympathetic neurons. These agents effectively treat CRPS-related pain, which involves heightened sympathetic nervous system activity. Clonidine, the most commonly used α-adrenergic agonist, can be administered orally, transdermally, intravenously, or epidurally. Epidural clonidine administration provides pain relief for up to six hours in severe CRPS cases, though it is associated with significant side effects, including sedation and hypotension. While clonidine is effective in alleviating pain, its systemic use is limited by centrally mediated side effects.

Alpha-Adrenergic Antagonists

Alpha(α)-adrenergic antagonists are used when an overactive sympathetic system causes pain. Phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, both α-adrenergic antagonists, are occasionally considered third-line treatments for CRPS. However, minimal clinical evidence supports their efficacy, with only a few studies available. Furthermore, their use is often limited in practice due to a high incidence of adverse effects, including hypotension, tachycardia, vomiting, dizziness, and headache.

### Dermal exposure to a compounded pain cream resulting in severely elevated clonidine concentration [^66d59c31]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clonidine is an imidazoline derivative antihypertensive medication that is also used as adjunctive therapy for neuropathic pain disorders via topical administration. Clonidine overdose can manifest both central and peripheral alpha-adrenergic agonist effects.

Case Report

A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency department with altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypertension after suspected overdose. He had rubbed a specially compounded medicinal cream over his entire body containing clonidine 0.2% (w/w), gabapentin 6%, imipramine 3%, ketamine 10%, lidocaine 2%, and mefenamic acid 1%. The patient presented with severe hypertension, bradycardia, and altered mental status. He was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage and was treated for hypertensive emergency. Toxicological analysis of initial blood samples revealed a serum clonidine concentration of 5,200 ng/ml. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had made a full recovery.

Discussion

There are limited reports of topical clonidine toxicity, and to our knowledge, this case involves the highest concentration yet reported following clonidine overdose by any route of exposure. The severely elevated serum clonidine concentration found in our patient demonstrates the possibility of toxicity resulting from inappropriate use of such a product. At high serum concentrations, the pharmacodynamic effects of clonidine appear to cause significant peripheral alpha-1 adrenergic stimulation. Toxicologists should be aware of the increasing use of topical clonidine preparations for the treatment of neuropathic pain and the potential for toxicity.

### Intrathecal clonidine and severe hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass [^11bb1a8c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

The use of intrathecal clonidine as an adjunct for the management of chronic pain, intra- and postoperative analgesia is gaining an increase in popularity. However, antinociceptive doses of intrathecal clonidine may produce pronounced hemodynamic side effects, including hypotension and bradycardia. In this report, we present a case of severe hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient with intrathecal clonidine infusion. We postulate that the intrathecally administered alpha 2-agonist clonidine reduced our patient's ability to tolerate the hemodynamic lability that is present during the separation from cardiopulmonary bypass by potentially inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity, renin-angiotensin system, or vasopressin release. The authors report a case of severe hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient receiving intrathecal clonidine infusion for chronic neuropathic pain.

### Melatonin for pre-medication in children: a systematic review [^606c9bad]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The review confirms melatonin's excellent safety profile as a pre-medication in children, with very few adverse events recorded and attributable to melatonin. Midazolam, a frequent comparator in the included studies, is a benzodiazepine and is an effective paediatric pre-operative medication. Midazolam has been associated with some adverse effects including sedation and delayed post-operative recovery. Further concerns include the potential for respiratory suppression, and unpredictable effects which may result in agitation rather than anxiolysis, particularly in children with additional needs. The NPSA 2008 rapid response document highlights the risk of overdose associated with bolus dosing of midazolam in adults, so it is reasonable to also identify alternative pre-medications for the paediatric setting. An alternative pre-medication, clonidine, has also been associated with adverse events including bradycardia, hypotension and prolonged recovery.

Limitations

Inclusion of a small number of studies overall (total 1047 patients), with large degrees of heterogeneity, preclude a network meta-analysis, therefore studies cannot be combined. The small sample sizes of included studies (max n = 148), also suggests that the available evidence may not be sufficiently powered to detect a desired magnitude of treatment effect. Examination of the sample size justifications in the studies confirmed this, with nine studies failing to provide a complete justification for the sample size used. This ranged from providing no details on the sample size calculation to failing to justify the treatment effect to be tested.

There is clinical difficulty, especially in children, to differentiate between sedation and anxiolysis. The natural sleep-inducing properties of melatonin can produce apparent sedation, enabling anaesthetic induction, without knowing whether sufficient anxiolysis has been obtained. This may have confounded findings in included studies and should be a consideration of future designs to include specifically anxious populations.

### A novel pharmacological approach to determining parasympathetic heart rate reserve in human subjects [^2cb38435]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Severe cardiac parasympathetic dysfunction can be diagnosed using bedside tests, such as a Valsalva maneuver. However, the tests that are in use are of limited value in detecting and quantifying an early impairment in cardiac parasympathetic function. We showed that α-2-adrenoreceptor stimulation with clonidine combined with pharmacological baroreceptor loading unmasks impaired parasympathetic heart rate reserve before overt changes in heart rate regulation occur. The methodology could be utilized to monitor the progression of autonomic nervous system disease in studies carried out to test neuroprotective strategies.
