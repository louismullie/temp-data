## Question

Non-sugar sweeteners for weight control

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) are effective for weight control and how to interpret the conflicting evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and definitions of NSS and the clinical question. Then, I should verify the highest-level guideline positions, especially WHO 2023. Next, I will examine randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for short- and longer-term weight outcomes. After that, I need to appraise observational cohort data and their limitations. I will then reconcile the apparent contradictions using mechanistic and methodological considerations. Finally, I should translate this into practical, population-specific counseling and highlight uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the scope and clinical question. NSS include artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame-K, saccharin, and neotame, as well as plant-derived options like stevia and monk fruit, and they are typically used to replace caloric sweeteners in foods and beverages; the clinical question is whether they improve weight control, particularly in adults with overweight or obesity and in people with diabetes, and whether water is preferable as a replacement strategy [^111kSUsH].

> Next, I should review the highest-level guidance. The WHO 2023 guideline issued a conditional recommendation against using NSS for weight control or NCD risk reduction in people without diabetes, citing low-certainty evidence and potential long-term harms observed in observational studies. Notably, it did not provide a recommendation for people with diabetes, reflecting insufficient evidence in that subgroup [^111Hvm9j] [^115VCA4z]. Wait, let me verify the rationale: WHO emphasized that while short-term RCTs show modest weight and energy intake reductions, long-term observational data link NSS with higher BMI, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular events, and the certainty of evidence was graded as low overall [^113BkJPq].

> I will now examine RCT evidence for weight outcomes. Multiple meta-analyses and sustained RCTs show that substituting NSS for sugar yields modest reductions in energy intake and body weight over weeks to months, with pooled estimates around −1 to −1.35 kg versus sugar and generally no difference versus water. For example, sustained intervention meta-analyses show lower body weight with NSS versus sugar and no consistent difference versus water, and a 52-week behavioral weight program found slightly greater weight loss with NSS beverages than water, though the difference was small and not always clinically significant [^11666fj3] [^114Fd53T] [^116wchbk] [^115aG9Kh]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric data: in children and adolescents, randomized trials suggest less BMI gain with NSS versus sugar, but high-quality, long-term RCTs versus water remain sparse, limiting firm conclusions [^112BcNp2].

> Now, I need to appraise observational cohort data. Large prospective studies frequently associate NSS use with higher BMI, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular outcomes; however, these associations are highly vulnerable to reverse causation and residual confounding, since people with obesity or metabolic risk are more likely to consume NSS, and prevalent exposure assessments fail to capture substitution dynamics over time [^113BkJPq] [^117MX9F6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought these cohorts might reflect a causal harm signal, but I should correct that inference: given the lack of randomization and the strong confounding, causality cannot be inferred from these observational associations, and more rigorous change-in-exposure and substitution analyses suggest attenuation or reversal of harm signals when substitution is properly modeled [^115jh5my].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility to reconcile the RCT–cohort divide. NSS provide sweetness without calories, which can reduce energy density and total intake if compensation is incomplete; meta-analytic estimates suggest roughly 30–40% compensation, leaving a net deficit that explains modest weight loss in RCTs, whereas observational studies cannot isolate this substitution effect and are distorted by confounding and baseline adiposity [^112knvNZ]. But wait, what if NSS increase appetite or alter metabolism? Acute studies show sucralose can stimulate hypothalamic blood flow and hunger relative to sucrose, yet sustained trials still show net energy reduction and weight loss versus sugar, suggesting incomplete compensation in real-world contexts; emerging microbiome and neuroendocrine hypotheses remain investigational in humans [^1129bm5n] [^11666fj3] [^115Cmqjr].

> I should double-check population-specific nuances. For adults with overweight or obesity, substituting NSS for sugar yields small but consistent improvements in weight and some cardiometabolic intermediates, and within structured behavioral programs, NSS beverages can perform similarly to or slightly better than water for weight maintenance. For people with diabetes, NSS can reduce calories and carbohydrates without worsening glycemia, though long-term RCTs are limited and effects on hard outcomes are uncertain [^114Fd53T] [^116wchbk] [^115BjpK8]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance: given limited long-term safety data and potential developmental effects, caution is warranted, and water remains the preferred replacement for sugar-sweetened beverages in children [^1136Sybk] [^115bsbiY].

> Next, I should review safety and regulatory context. Major regulatory bodies have established acceptable daily intakes for approved NSS, and current evidence does not show consistent increases in liver enzymes or other safety signals at typical intakes. However, WHO's caution reflects uncertainty about long-term metabolic and disease outcomes rather than acute toxicity, reinforcing the need for individualized, moderate use within dietary patterns that emphasize whole foods and reduced added sugars [^111kSUsH] [^115BjpK8] [^113kYSHH]. I need to ensure I note exceptions: individuals with phenylketonuria must avoid aspartame due to phenylalanine content, and pregnant or lactating women and young children are priority subgroups where evidence remains sparse and precaution is reasonable [^111kSUsH] [^1136Sybk].

> Translating this into practical counseling, I should confirm a hierarchical approach. First, prioritize water and unsweetened options to displace sugar-sweetened beverages. Second, if sugar reduction is otherwise unattainable, NSS can be used as a transitional or maintenance tool to reduce calories and added sugars, with attention to total diet quality and avoidance of caloric compensation. Third, tailor to context and preferences, recognizing that adherence drives outcomes and that some individuals succeed long-term with NSS beverages as part of weight maintenance strategies [^115bsbiY] [^115XPuTR] [^1132K22r]. Wait, let me verify the compensation point: counseling should explicitly address the risk of eating more elsewhere, since partial compensation can erode the energy deficit from NSS substitution [^112knvNZ].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research gaps. High-quality, longer-term RCTs comparing specific NSS types versus water and each other, in diverse populations and real-world settings, are still needed. Better exposure assessment and harmonized protocols would improve inference. And mechanistic work should clarify individual variability in metabolic and behavioral responses to different NSS, including potential microbiome-mediated effects [^113jdBDz] [^117MX9F6] [^115Cmqjr]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: until such data accrue, shared decision-making that weighs modest, short-term benefits against uncertain long-term risks, and aligns with patient goals and adherence capacity, remains the most defensible clinical stance [^117UTYF8].

> Bottom line, after weighing RCTs, observational studies, guidelines, and mechanisms, NSS can modestly aid weight control when used to replace sugar, especially in adults with overweight or obesity and within structured behavioral programs, but the evidence is low to moderate certainty and long-term safety remains uncertain. Water remains the preferred substitute for sugar-sweetened beverages, and NSS should be used judiciously, with attention to diet quality and compensation behaviors [^114Fd53T] [^11666fj3] [^115VCA4z] [^115bsbiY].

---

Non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) can produce **modest, short-term weight loss** [^115UfJUy] by lowering energy intake, but **long-term weight control benefits are uncertain** and may be offset by compensatory eating or metabolic effects [^113jdBDz] [^112qMii4]. The WHO advises against NSS for weight control [^111Hvm9j] due to limited long-term efficacy and potential harms, while the ADA notes NSS may be used in moderation for glycemic control without clear weight benefits [^117PKG8s]. Water and unsweetened options are preferred; if NSS are used, they should be part of a comprehensive weight plan with monitoring for compensation and metabolic changes [^115bsbiY] [^115BjpK8].

## Evidence on weight control

### Short-term effects

Short-term randomized trials show that NSS can **reduce energy intake** [^114d8Yc3] and produce modest weight loss (~1 kg over 6–12 months) [^11666fj3] versus sugar, mainly by displacing calories [^11666fj3]. However, **compensation** — consuming more calories later — can blunt these effects, especially outside structured programs [^112qMii4] [^112knvNZ].

---

### Long-term effects

Long-term observational studies link NSS use with **increased obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease**; these associations likely reflect reverse causation and confounding, not causality [^113jdBDz] [^113BkJPq]. Evidence for **sustained weight control** is limited and inconsistent, with no clear long-term benefit [^114JjQzT].

---

## Mechanisms influencing weight control

Several mechanisms may explain the **limited long-term weight control** effects of NSS:

- **Energy compensation**: NSS may trigger compensatory intake, reducing net calorie deficits [^112qMii4] [^112knvNZ].
- **Appetite regulation**: NSS may alter appetite and sweetness preferences, potentially increasing intake [^112qMii4] [^1129bm5n].
- **Gut microbiota**: NSS may alter the microbiome, affecting metabolism and glucose control [^115Cmqjr] [^112b5FCW].
- **Neurohormonal effects**: NSS may disrupt sweet-taste signaling and energy balance [^112b5FCW] [^1129bm5n].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| WHO (2023) | - Recommends against NSS for weight control or NCD risk reduction due to limited long-term efficacy and potential harms [^111Hvm9j] [^115Guvjy] |
| ADA (2023) | - NSS may be used in moderation for glycemic control, but weight benefits are unclear [^117PKG8s] [^115BjpK8] |
| AHA (2012) | - Insufficient evidence to recommend NSS for weight management; emphasizes overall diet quality [^1175tkiJ] |

---

## Population-specific considerations

- **Children and adolescents**: Evidence is limited; NSS may reduce sugar intake but long-term weight effects are uncertain [^112BcNp2] [^1136Sybk].
- **Pregnant and lactating women**: Limited data; caution advised due to potential developmental effects [^1136Sybk] [^117UTYF8].
- **Individuals with diabetes**: NSS can aid glycemic control, but weight benefits are unclear [^11154zxH] [^115BjpK8].

---

## Comparison with other weight control strategies

Compared with other strategies, **water and unsweetened beverages** are preferred for weight control and are associated with better long-term outcomes than NSS [^114Fd53T] [^115bsbiY]. In contrast, **lifestyle interventions** — dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral support — yield larger, sustained weight loss than NSS alone [^115XPuTR] [^114ZuW2b].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Acceptable daily intake (ADI)**: NSS are generally safe within ADI, but long-term metabolic effects remain uncertain [^113kYSHH] [^113jdBDz].
- **Potential risks**: Some studies suggest links to altered glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and microbiome changes, but evidence is inconclusive [^115Cmqjr] [^1112XJ2w].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Use in moderation**: If used, NSS should be part of a comprehensive weight plan with monitoring for compensation and metabolic effects [^115bsbiY] [^115BjpK8].
- **Emphasize overall diet**: Prioritize whole foods, reduced added sugars, and healthy eating patterns [^115XPuTR] [^115bsbiY].
- **Monitor weight and metabolic health**: Regularly assess weight, glycemic control, and metabolic markers during NSS use [^notfound].

---

NSS can produce **modest, short-term weight loss** by lowering energy intake, but **long-term weight control benefits are uncertain** and may be offset by compensatory eating or metabolic effects. Water and unsweetened options are preferred; if NSS are used, they should be part of a comprehensive weight plan with monitoring for compensation and metabolic changes.

### Liquid calories, sugar, and body weight [^111NMBg9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been linked to rising rates of obesity in the United States. The standard explanation is that energy-containing liquids are less satiating than are solid foods. However, purely physiologic mechanisms do not fully account for the proposed links between liquid sugar energy and body weight change. First, a reevaluation of published epidemiologic studies of consumption of sweetened beverages and overweight shows that most such studies either are cross-sectional or are based on passive surveillance of temporal trends and thus permit no conclusions about causal links. Second, research evidence comparing the short-term satiating power of different types of liquids and of solids remains inconclusive. Numerous clinical studies have shown that sugar-containing liquids, when consumed in place of usual meals, can lead to a significant and sustained weight loss. The principal ingredient of liquid meal replacement shakes is sugar, often high-fructose corn syrup, which is present in amounts comparable to those in soft drinks. Far from suppressing satiety, one such liquid shake is marketed on the grounds that it helps control hunger and prevents hunger longer when consumed for the purpose of weight loss. These inconsistencies raise the question whether the issue of sugars and body weight should continue to be framed purely in metabolic or physiologic terms. The effect of sugar consumption on body weight can also depend on behavioral intent, context, and the mode of use, availability, and cost of sweetened liquids.

Greater weight given to observational studies

The demonstrated improvement to body weight, BMI, and energy intake outcomes in trials reported by the WHO SRMA are consistent with the results of several other SRMAs of NSS trials that have shown similar benefits for weight loss and BMI. In addition, the WHO SRMA also showed that NSS led to reduced sugar and energy intake compared to caloric comparators. These results unequivocally demonstrated that the mechanism of NSS benefit is through a reduction in energy intake. However, results from the prospective cohort studies reported by the WHO SRMA suggested harm with NSS consumption based upon positive associations with BMI, incident obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

In the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rating the certainty of evidence in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, evidence from randomized trials start at high certainty due to its greater protection against bias. Randomization allows confounding factors to be randomly distributed, making it possible to establish a causal relationship between the intervention and the outcome. On the other hand, prospective cohort studies have less protection against bias and cannot establish causality, which is why they start at low certainty in GRADE. When evidence comes from both trials and cohort studies, trials are given precedence.

The WHO guideline disregarded the trial evidence and solely relied on the prospective cohort studies, ignoring the established hierarchy of evidence as described by GRADE. The justification for disregarding the trial evidence given was that the results were short-term and thus did not provide evidence of long-term impact. However, this claim is unjustified as the meta-analysis included trials of one-year in duration and some of six months in duration with no evidence of effect modification by study duration.

The dismissal of the trial evidence and focus on prospective cohort studies, which are prone to bias and cannot infer causality, is concerning. Such an approach is methodologically flawed as it goes against conventional understanding of nutrition research and best practices in evidence synthesis. In addition, there was no sound biological reasoning provided as to how a consistent benefit on adiposity-related outcomes demonstrated in the trials for up to one-year would develop into a long-term harm.

### Effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on the BMI of children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies [^112BcNp2]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Considering the biological variation across subgroups during periods of growth, the role of non-nutritive sweeteners in weight-related outcomes among children and adolescents is unclear. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the evidence on experimental and habitual consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners and prospective changes in BMI in paediatric populations.

Methods

We searched eligible (ie, lasting a minimum of 4 weeks) randomised controlled trials of the effect of non-nutritive sweeteners versus non-caloric or caloric comparators on BMI change and prospective cohort studies reporting multivariable-adjusted coefficients for non-nutritive sweetener intake and BMI in children (aged 2–9 years) and adolescents (aged 10–24 years). We generated pooled estimates using random effects meta-analysis and did secondary stratified analyses to explore heterogeneity by study-level and subgroup characteristics. We further evaluated the quality of the included evidence and classified industry-funded studies, or those whose authors were related to the food industry, as having potential conflicts of interest.

Findings

From 2789 results, we included five randomised controlled trials (n = 1498 participants; median follow-up 19·0 weeks [IQR 13·0–37·5]); three [60%] with potential conflicts of interest), and eight prospective cohort studies (n = 35340 participants; median follow-up 2·5 years [IQR 1·7–6·3]; two [25%] with potential conflicts of interest). Random allocation to intake of non-nutritive sweeteners (25–2400 mg/day, from food and beverages) suggested less BMI gain (standardised mean difference -0·42 kg/m 2 [95% CI -0·79 to -0·06]; I² = 89%) compared with intake of sugar from food and beverages. Stratified estimates were significant only in adolescents, participants with obesity at baseline, consumers of a mixture of non-nutritive sweeteners, longer trials, and trials not found to have potential conflicts of interest. No randomised controlled trials tested beverages containing non-nutritive sweeteners versus water. Prospective cohorts reported a non-significant association between consumption of beverages containing non-nutritive sweeteners and BMI gain (0·05 kg/m 2 [95% CI -0·02 to 0·12]; I² = 67%; per daily serving of 355 mL), which was accentuated for adolescents, boys, and cohorts with longer follow-ups. Removing studies with potential conflicts of interest attenuated the estimates. Evidence was predominantly classified as of low to moderate quality.

Interpretation

Intake of non-nutritive sweeteners versus sugar in randomised controlled trials resulted in less BMI gain in adolescents and participants with obesity. Better designed studies should contrast beverages containing non-nutritive sweeteners with water. Long-term prospective analyses with changes in repeated measures might clarify the effect of intake of non-nutritive sweeteners on BMI changes in childhood and adolescence.

Body weight

In randomised controlled trials, we saw no significant differences in change in body weight between adults receiving NSSs compared with those receiving different sugars or placebo (mean difference 1.29 kg, 95% confidence interval −2.80 to 0.21; five studies, n = 229, very low certainty of evidence; fig 3). Only one study used placebo as a comparatorwhile the other studies used caloric sweeteners as a comparator. There seemed to be no consistent difference in effect between studies using aspartame, stevia, or a combination of sweetenersas the intervention.

Fig 3
Effect of non-sugar sweetener intake on weight change (kg) in adults

Subgroup analysis by body weight status suggested that NSS use by overweight or obese individuals (that is, those not trying to lose weight, mean body weight 86.87 kg) resulted in reduced body weight of 1.99 kg (95% confidence interval −2.84 to −1.14; three studies, n = 146, duration of studies, four weeks to six months) but no change in individuals of normal weight (0.03 kg, −0.03 to 0.09; two, n = 110; fig 3). As assessed in randomised controlled trials, change in body mass index was 0.6 units lower in adults receiving NSSs than in those receiving sucrose (95% confidence interval −1.19 to −0.01; two studies, n = 174, low certainty of evidence). Otherwise, randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, and observational studies comparing NSS use with no use and with insufficient data for a meta-analysis indicated no consistent difference between the intervention and control group in relation to difference in body weight and other measures of overweight and obesity (supplementary material file 1, table 1).

### Association of low-and No-calorie sweetened beverages as a replacement for sugar-sweetened beverages with body weight and cardiometabolic risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SSmbn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This systematic review and meta-analysis has several strengths. First, the use of network meta-analysis allowed for the simultaneous assessment of the 3 prespecified substitutions (LNCSBs for SSBs, water for SSBs, and LNCSBs for water), leveraging direct and indirect comparisons with a common comparator to increase the information size. Undertaking a network meta-analysis rather than a regular pairwise meta-analysis provided 2 distinct advantages: (1) more precise estimates than single direct or indirect estimates, and (2) the ability to compare interventions that had not been compared before. Second, a comprehensive literature search that included only RCTs provided the greatest protection against bias, no evidence of serious risk of bias among the included trials, and use of the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the estimates.

### Effects of non-nutritive sweetened beverages versus water after a 12-week weight-loss program: a randomized controlled trial [^116gM6Yq]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare non-nutritive sweetened (NNS) beverages versus water for weight loss after a 12-week behavioral weight-management program.

Methods

This is an ongoing, 2-year, parallel-group, open-label, controlled equivalence trial; week-12 data are reported. Adults with BMI of 27 to 35kg/m 2 who regularly drank cold beverages were randomized 1:1 to intention-to-treat water or NNS beverages while undergoing a weekly 12-week group behavioral weight-management program. Weight change to week 12 was the primary end point (equivalence: two-sided p > 0.05); changes in waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, glycemic control markers, fasting lipid profiles, liver function tests, hunger (visual analog scale), sugar and sweetener consumption, and activity levels were secondary end points.

Results

Overall, 493 participants were randomized (water: n = 246; NNS beverages: n = 247); 24.1% were NNS beverage naïve. Weight change was equivalent with water versus NNS beverages (-5.6 vs. -5.8kg; difference [90% CI]: -0.2kg [-0.7 to 0.4]). There were no significant differences between groups for secondary end points except reductions in waist circumference (greater with NNS beverages vs. water), glycated hemoglobin, and consumption of any type of sweetener (both greater with water vs. NNS beverages).

Conclusions

Weight loss was equivalent with NNS beverages and water following a 12-week behavioral weight-management program.

### Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including meta-analyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies [^116rAdmp]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Anthropometric

Twelve studies comprising 14 comparisons with 1941 participants reported anthropometric data, in most cases only BW. This total excludes 67 intentionally misinformed participants in Reid et al. The duration of exposures was 10 days to > 3 years, and participants in all studies were adults except for those in de Ruyter et al. All except four studies, specifically recruited overweight or obese participants, and four studies, carried out the interventions in the context of a weight loss programme. Details of these studies are shown in Supplementary Table S14. The results of the meta-analyses of the 10 studies (12 comparisons) of ⩾4 weeks in duration are shown in Figure 4.

In all comparisons the LES intervention produced the smallest absolute gain or largest absolute loss of BW, compared with either sugar or water. In six comparisons with 1274 participants, anthropometric differences favoring LES were reported to be statistically significant. In eight comparisons with 667 participants the differences were not reported as statistically significant.

### Non-nutritive sweetened beverages versus water after a 52-week weight management programme: a randomised controlled trial [^116wchbk]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/objective

Sugar-sweetened beverages are a substantial source of dietary sugar that can contribute to weight gain and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Dietary guidelines recommend non-nutritive sweetened (NNS) beverages to reduce sugar consumption, however, there is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials on their use. We aimed to compare the effects of NNS beverages and water on body weight during weight loss and maintenance in a behavioural weight management programme.

Methods

In this parallel-group, open-label, controlled equivalence trial, adults with a BMI of 27–35 kg/m 2 who regularly consumed cold beverages were randomised 1:1 to water or NNS beverages. Participants underwent a group behavioural weight management programme comprising weekly (during the 12-week weight-loss phase) then monthly (during the 40-week weight-maintenance phase) meetings. The primary endpoint was weight change at week 52 (equivalence: two-sided P > 0.05). Secondary endpoints included changes in anthropometrics, cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite and activity levels.

Results

Of 493 participants randomised (water: n = 246; NNS beverages: n = 247), 24.1% were NNS-naïve. At week 52, water and NNS beverages were non-equivalent, with significantly greater weight loss in the NNS beverages group. Participants consuming water maintained a weight loss of 6.1 kg over 52 weeks versus 7.5 kg with NNS beverages (difference [90% CI]: 1.4 kg [–2.6, –0.2]; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

During a 52-week behavioural weight management programme, water and NNS beverages were non-equivalent, with weight loss maintained to a statistically greater extent with NNS beverages compared with water. However, this difference was not clinically significant.

### Metabolic effects of low-calorie sweeteners: a brief review [^1112XJ2w]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) are found in a variety of foods and beverages, yet their role in diet, weight, and obesity-related chronic disease is controversial. This article summarizes proceedings from one of four presentations during a preconference session entitled "Low-Calorie Sweeteners and Weight Management", which took place at the 2017 Obesity Society Annual Meeting in Washington, District of Columbia. The objective of this brief review is to summarize findings of observational and interventional studies of LCS effects on weight and metabolic health and to provide potential explanations for their discrepant results. Key research priorities for advancing the understanding of the role of LCS in weight and chronic disease are also discussed. The existing literature suggests that LCS consumption is consistently associated with obesity, diabetes, and related cardiometabolic conditions in observational studies. Although several plausible mechanisms have been proposed to explain these associations and have received considerable support in cellular and rodent models, the relevance of these mechanisms to humans has yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile, randomized controlled trials demonstrate that NNS may benefit weight loss and weight maintenance. This is the case particularly when LCS are administered in the context of behavioral weight loss support and are consumed knowingly by habitual LCS consumers. Although these findings suggest that LCS may be useful for weight control among those cognitively engaged in weight loss and who are aware of their LCS consumption, LCS administration in these studies does not reflect typical consumption. Furthermore, few interventional studies have assessed the role of LCS on metabolic outcomes other than body weight. Additional factors must be considered before recommending LCS for weight management and chronic disease prevention and further study of LCS effects on a variety of cardiometabolic outcomes, including visceral adiposity and glucose homeostasis is warranted.

### A systematic review on the effect of sweeteners on glycemic response and clinically relevant outcomes [^111jPko6]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted and reported according to guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We did a comprehensive search designed by a MLIS-trained librarian to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sweeteners in generally healthy, overweight/obese and/or diabetic participants. We included only trials published in English as full peer-reviewed manuscripts. MEDLINE (1950 to January 13, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to January 13, 2011), CENTRAL (January 13, 2011), and CAB (January 13, 2011) were searched. No existing systematic reviews were found. The specific strategies used are provided in Additional File 1. The citations and abstracts were screened by two reviewers to identify pertinent trials. Any study considered potentially relevant by one or both reviewers was retrieved for further consideration.

Study selection

We considered non-caloric sweeteners to include high-intensity caloric sweeteners that are functionally non-caloric simply due to extremely low doses (for example, aspartame). Each potentially relevant study was independently assessed by two reviewers for inclusion in the review using predetermined eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third party. Trials with healthy, overweight/obese, and/or diabetic adult (≥ 16 years old) participants meeting the following criteria were eligible for inclusion: parallel or crossover RCTs; weight change, energy intake, lipids, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), or insulin resistance were reported; had at least two groups comparing different sweeteners (for example, glucose, fructose, sucrose, other saccharides, sugar alcohols, non-caloric sweeteners: aspartame, saccharin, stevioside, sucralose); and where follow-up was at least one week in duration (see the Box in Additional File 1 for study selection summary). RCTs measuring 2-hour blood (serum or plasma) glucose responses in similar populations without the follow-up requirement were also reviewed. All outcomes selected for study (including weight change) are reversible and thus (providing that order was randomly assigned), a cross-over design should be appropriate. Trials with less than ten participants per group were excluded to improve the efficiency of the work without an appreciable loss of power, and with the possible elimination of some small study bias. Trials aimed at evaluating exercise performance or memory enhancement were excluded. Trials with placebo controls were also excluded as we aimed to investigate comparative effectiveness of different sweeteners, as opposed to exploring the implications of avoiding sweeteners altogether.

Data synthesis and analysis

Data were analyzed using Stata 11.1. Missing standard deviations (SDs) were imputed using the maximum value reported in any included study. Missing correlations for change from baseline and for differences between crossover trial periods were assigned a value of 0.63, the maximum reported value in the included studies. Changes from baseline means were used in place of final means in parallel randomized trials. For weight change, the baseline value prior to the immediate period was used. The mean difference (MD) was used to summarize outcomes. Due to expected diversity between studies, we decided a priori to combine results using a random effects model (Stata command: metan). Additionally we planned to examine the association between certain variables (population, dose, diet, age, gender, and bias criteria) and the effect of specific sweeteners on outcomes, and publication bias with weighted regression, however the available comparisons were too sparse to pool trials with outcomes of one week or less. For 2-hour responses, we pooled comparisons by type of sweetener and ordered the matrix tables by expected order of efficacy (that is, non-caloric sweeteners, sugar alcohols, other saccharides, fructose, sucrose, and glucose). Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the τ 2 statistic (between-study variance). Furthermore, we explored comparative effectiveness of sweeteners on 2-hour responses using network meta-analysis (specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] methods within a Bayesian framework) in WinBugs (code was obtained from Ades et al.). Network analysis extends meta-analysis from simply pooling directly compared treatments (direct evidence) to pooling data from studies not directly compared but linked via one or more common comparators (indirect evidence) by assuming consistency of the evidence. Therefore, this technique facilitates the comparison of any two sweeteners not directly compared in any one study. We used non-informative prior distributions: uniform for the between-study variance (range 0 to 20) and Gaussian for the other parameters (mean 0 and variance 10,000). All chains were run for 10,000 iterations after 1,000 burn-in iterations. Convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed using autocorrelation plots. By-population results were generated. Inconsistency in the network (disagreement between direct and mixed evidence) was measured using back-calculations. Ninety-five present Bayesian credible intervals are reported.

### Low-calorie sweeteners and body weight and composition: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies [^114nzgoB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Replacement of caloric sweeteners with lower- or no-calorie alternatives may facilitate weight loss or weight maintenance by helping to reduce energy intake; however, past research examining low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs) and body weight has produced mixed results.

Objective

The objective was to systematically review and quantitatively evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies, separately, that examined the relation between LCSs and body weight and composition.

Design

A systematic literature search identified 15 RCTs and 9 prospective cohort studies that examined LCSs from foods or beverages or LCSs consumed as tabletop sweeteners. Meta-analyses generated weighted mean differences in body weight and composition values between the LCS and control groups among RCTs and weighted mean correlations for LCS intake and these parameters among prospective cohort studies.

Results

In RCTs, LCSs modestly but significantly reduced all outcomes examined, including body weight (-0.80 kg; 95% CI: -1.17, -0.43), body mass index [BMI (in kg/m²): -0.24; 95% CI: -0.41, -0.07], fat mass (-1.10 kg; 95% CI: -1.77, -0.44), and waist circumference (-0.83 cm; 95% CI: -1.29, -0.37). Among prospective cohort studies, LCS intake was not associated with body weight or fat mass, but was significantly associated with slightly higher BMI (0.03; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06).

Conclusions

The current meta-analysis provides a rigorous evaluation of the scientific evidence on LCSs and body weight and composition. Findings from observational studies showed no association between LCS intake and body weight or fat mass and a small positive association with BMI; however, data from RCTs, which provide the highest quality of evidence for examining the potentially causal effects of LCS intake, indicate that substituting LCS options for their regular-calorie versions results in a modest weight loss and may be a useful dietary tool to improve compliance with weight loss or weight maintenance plans.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes (PDM) guideline (2014) [^115XoWNv]. AND (2014). Medium credibility.

Adults — sugar-sweetened beverages and body weight — A moderate body of epidemiologic evidence suggests that greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with increased body weight in adults. A moderate body of evidence suggests that under isocaloric controlled conditions, added sugars, including sugar-sweetened beverages, are no more likely to cause weight gain than any other source of energy.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^111CCN4H]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

In accordance with the WHO guideline development process, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses according to the methodological recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Ethical approval was not required for this research.

Inclusion criteria

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review were established prospectively and were based on their relevance for a WHO global guideline for NSS use by a generally healthy population. We included studies with a general, healthy population of adults (≥ 18 years) or children (< 18 years), including those with overweight or obesity. Studies that exclusively included overweight or obese adults or children who were specifically trying to lose weight (that is, weight loss studies) were also included and analysed separately. We excluded studies including diseased populations, in vitro and animal studies. Studies with pregnant women were also excluded.

The interventions and exposures of interest included any type of NSSs, either as an individual intervention or in combination with other NSSs. Interventions or exposures described as "diet sodas", "diet beverages", or "diet soft drinks" were included when the sweeteners used in the products were NSSs and their type was sufficiently specified. We excluded studies that did not specify the type of sweetener. Studies that applied concomitant interventions were included as long as the interventions were similar and equally balanced between the intervention and comparator groups to establish fair comparisons. We included studies that reported to use NSSs within the acceptable daily intake as established by the Joint FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, European Food Safety Authority, or the United States Food and Drug Administration (table 1), or did not report any information on dose. If the acceptable daily intake values differed between the regulatory bodies, we used the higher value as the threshold for inclusion in our review. Studies in which sweetener intake explicitly exceeded the acceptable daily intake were excluded. All studies had to have a minimum intervention duration of seven days.

### COUNTERPOINT: artificial sweeteners for obesity-better than sugary alternatives; potentially a solution [^111ju7xo]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonnutritive (NNSs) are used in place of sugars to reduce caloric and glycemic intake while providing desired sweetness, commonly replacing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with "diet" (zero-calorie) alternatives. Concern has developed due to observational data associating NNSs with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease. This counterpoint argues that, in general, NNSs used in place of added or excess sugars in the diet are likely beneficial.

Methods

A literature review was conducted on interventional trials investigating NNSs and obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Key words used in the search included artificial sweeteners, nonnutritive sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, stevia/steviol, acesulfame potassium, meal replacements, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and weight.

Results

Interventional data and indirect interventional data consistently showed beneficial effects on weight and cardiometabolic health, including glycemia, when SSBs or other energy-dense foods were replaced by artificially sweetened beverages or artificially sweetened meal replacements.

Conclusion

Although NNSs correlate with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease, those data are fraught with confounding and error. Plausibility has been suggested on the basis of preclinical research on neuroendocrine control of appetite, satiety, and cravings plus the gut microbiome. However, interventional data reveal that replacing caloric/glycemic energy intake via NNSs creates an energy deficit resulting in weight loss and improvement in disease-especially dysglycemic disease. Intensive dietary intervention using artificially sweetened meal replacements shows a marked clinical benefit without detriment from their NNSs. Furthermore, beverages sweetened with NNSs rather than SSBs have been noted to be a critical component for those succeeding in maintaining weight loss. Although individual responses to the effects of NNSs are always warranted just like in any clinical situation, patients should not be advised to avoid NNSs in the context of dietary intervention to improve quality and energy deficit.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^114JjQzT]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

This comprehensive systematic review covers a broad range of benefits and harms of NSSs in a generally healthy population of adults and children, following rigorous systematic review methods. Overall, we included 56 studies of adults and children, which assessed the associations and effects of NSSs on different health outcomes. For most outcomes, there seemed to be no statistically or clinically relevant difference between NSS intake versus no intake, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence was seen for health benefits from NSSs and potential harms could not be excluded. The certainty of the included evidence ranged from very low to moderate, and our confidence in the reported effect estimates is accordingly limited.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

In a preparatory mapping review, we identified 372 primary and secondary studies that investigated the effects of NSS intake on different health outcomes. However, the methodological and reporting quality of many publications was limited. Most studies did not contain enough information on the study design or lacked other reporting detail — that is, the sweetener used was not transparently reported, such that many the studies identified in the mapping review were not eligible for this systematic review. Studies included in this systematic review were rarely comparable with regard to their aim, design, and methods so that meaningful comparisons between them was challenging.

Although most studies reported sufficient detail for the population included, few reported sufficient information on the intervention, comparator, and outcomes. For example, comparisons of effects of different doses of sweeteners in children were not possible because most studies did not report the respective information on dose. Additionally, reported doses and outcomes measures were reported so differently that we could not assess the effect of dose on any outcome (eg, two studiesreported dose of aspartame and assessed eating behaviour, but the outcome was measured as energy intake or as a decrease in appetite). Furthermore, outcomes of relevance for this review were often only measured indirectly with intermediate markers. Lastly, most included studies had small sample sizes and their study duration was often too short to infer any meaningful results in the longer term.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^1179Akct]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Table 1
Amount of acceptable daily intake of non-sugar sweeteners (not exhaustive) as defined by regulatory bodies for the general population

JECFA = Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.

We included studies that compared the intervention against the intake of any alternative intervention, for example, any other type of caloric or non-caloric sweetener, any type of sugar, no intervention, placebo, or plain water. The outcomes of interest included body weight, oral health, incidence of diabetes, eating behaviour. Secondary outcomes were preference for sweet taste, incidence of any type of cancer, incidence of cardiovascular disease, incidence of chronic kidney disease, incidence of asthma, incidence of allergies, mood, behaviour, and neurocognition.

We included all parallel grouped or crossover (quasi-)randomised controlled trials, and cluster randomised trials. In crossover randomised controlled trials, we considered both phases of the study because the effect of NSS intake is not expected to last long enough to bias the results from the second phase of crossover trials for the outcomes evaluated in this review. Furthermore, we included non-randomised controlled trialsas well as prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross sectional studies but analysed them separately. Studies with observational design were included because the possible long term effects of NSSs — for example, on the incidence of non-communicable diseases such as cancer — are generally difficult to assess in randomised controlled trials. We included unpublished and ongoing studies.

Search methods for identification of studies

The search strategy for this review combined electronic searches and hand searching. For the electronic searches, no date or language restrictions were applied. A systematic literature search in the following databases was conducted last on 25 May 2017 (by SL): Medline, Medline in Process and Medline Daily Update, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). To identify ongoing or completed, but unpublished trials, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal) as well as ClinicalTrials.gov were searched on 23 November 2017 (by IT). Search strategies are listed in the supplementary file 1. The reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were screened manually to identify further potentially relevant citations.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^115UfJUy]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) and important health outcomes in generally healthy or overweight/obese adults and children.

Design

Systematic review following standard Cochrane review methodology.

Data Sources

Medline (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant publications.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Studies including generally healthy adults or children with or without overweight or obesity were eligible. Included study designs allowed for a direct comparison of no intake or lower intake of NSS with higher NSS intake. NSSs had to be clearly named, the dose had to be within the acceptable daily intake, and the intervention duration had to be at least seven days.

Main Outcome Measures

Body weight or body mass index, glycaemic control, oral health, eating behaviour, preference for sweet taste, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood, behaviour, neurocognition, and adverse effects.

Results

The search resulted in 13941 unique records. Of 56 individual studies that provided data for this review, 35 were observational studies. In adults, evidence of very low and low certainty from a limited number of small studies indicated a small beneficial effect of NSSs on body mass index (mean difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.19 to -0.01; two studies, n = 174) and fasting blood glucose (-0.16 mmol/L, -0.26 to -0.06; two, n = 52). Lower doses of NSSs were associated with lower weight gain (-0.09 kg, -0.13 to -0.05; one, n = 17934) compared with higher doses of NSSs (very low certainty of evidence). For all other outcomes, no differences were detected between the use and non-use of NSSs, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence of any effect of NSSs was seen on overweight or obese adults or children actively trying to lose weight (very low to moderate certainty). In children, a smaller increase in body mass index z score was observed with NSS intake compared with sugar intake (-0.15, -0.17 to -0.12; two, n = 528, moderate certainty of evidence), but no significant differences were observed in body weight (-0.60 kg, -1.33 to 0.14; two, n = 467, low certainty of evidence), or between different doses of NSSs (very low to moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Most health outcomes did not seem to have differences between the NSS exposed and unexposed groups. Of the few studies identified for each outcome, most had few participants, were of short duration, and their methodological and reporting quality was limited; therefore, confidence in the reported results is limited. Future studies should assess the effects of NSSs with an appropriate intervention duration. Detailed descriptions of interventions, comparators, and outcomes should be included in all reports.

### The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: a randomized clinical trial [^116ukzRZ]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is continued controversy regarding the potential benefit of non‐nutritive sweeteners (NNS) for body weight management 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Some observational studies have reported a positive association between NNS consumption and BMI and weight gain over time 1, 2, 8, questioning the benefit of NNS for weight management. Observational studies, however, are unable to establish cause and effect. Randomized trials comparing foods and beverages sweetened with NNS versus caloric sweeteners have generally found that risk of weight gain is reduced among subjects consuming NNS 9, 10, 11. There have been relatively few long‐term (≥ 1 year) randomized trials of NNS for weight loss and maintenance 12, 13, 14. In particular, there have been few studies comparing beverages sweetened with NNS to water 13, 15, 16, which is the recommended beverage for maintaining good health 17, 18.

Because of the relative paucity of data examining the long‐term effects of NNS consumption on body weight management, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recently concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of low‐calorie sweeteners as a strategy for long‐term weight loss and weight maintenance 17. The Committee recommended that further prospective research was needed to establish the effects of low‐calorie sweeteners on body weight and other health outcomes.

This article reports data from a year‐long trial comparing beverages sweetened with NNS to water as part of a behavioral weight management program consisting of 12 weeks of active weight loss and 40 weeks of weight maintenance. Results from the 12‐week weight loss phase of this trial were published previously and showed non‐equivalence, with the NNS group showing greater weight loss at 12 weeks than the water group 19.

### Sweeteners and health: findings from recent research and their impact on obesity and related metabolic conditions [^116UsqGn]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Few topics in nutrition engender more controversy than added sugars in general, and fructose-containing sugars in particular. Some investigators have argued that added sugars are associated with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and even sugar 'addiction'. Other investigators have questioned the scientific basis for all of these assertions. This debate has extended far beyond the scientific community into various media outlets including the internet and other non-refereed venues often with heated rhetoric and little science. Against this backdrop, a group of experts and researchers in the metabolism and health effects of added sugars presented a symposium 'Sweeteners and Health: Findings from Recent Research and their Impact on Obesity and Related Metabolic Conditions' at the European Congress on Obesity on 7 May 2015. The papers in this supplement are based on the presentations made at this meeting. The current article is intended to serve as an Introduction to this supplement.

### The effects of low-calorie sweeteners on energy intake and body weight: a systematic review and meta-analyses of sustained intervention studies [^11666fj3]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of intervention studies have come to different conclusions about effects of consumption of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) on body weight. The present review included 60 articles reporting 88 parallel-groups and cross-over studies ≥ 1 week in duration that reported either body weight (BW), BMI and/or energy intake (EI) outcomes. Studies were analysed according to whether they compared (1) LCS with sugar, (2) LCS with water or nothing, or (3) LCS capsules with placebo capsules. Results showed an effect in favour of LCS vs sugar for BW (29 parallel-groups studies, 2267 participants: BW change, -1.06kg, 95% CI -1.50 to -0.62, I² = 51%), BMI and EI. Effect on BW change increased with 'dose' of sugar replaced by LCS, whereas there were no differences in study outcome as a function of duration of the intervention or participant blinding. Overall, results showed no difference in effects of LCS vs water/nothing for BW (11 parallel-groups studies, 1068 participants: BW change, 0.10kg, 95% CI -0.87 to 1.07, I² = 82%), BMI and EI; and inconsistent effects for LCS consumed in capsules (BW change: -0.28kg, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.25, I² = 0%; BMI change: 0.20kg/m 2, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.36, I² = 0%). Occurrence of adverse events was not affected by the consumption of LCS. The studies available did not permit robust analysis of effects by LCS type. In summary, outcomes were not clearly affected when the treatments differed in sweetness, nor when LCS were consumed in capsules without tasting; however, when treatments differed in energy value (LCS vs sugar), there were consistent effects in favour of LCS. The evidence from human intervention studies supports the use of LCS in weight management, constrained primarily by the amount of added sugar that LCS can displace in the diet.

### Association between changes in carbohydrate intake and long term weight changes: prospective cohort study [^1168utDi]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Observations across cultures and over time have suggested that the refining of grains and increases in sugar consumption may contribute importantly to weight gain. Consistent with our findings, previous cohort analyses support an inverse associations between fiber intake and weight change, and added sugar intake has been positively associated with weight gain. Fiber may reduce food intake by promoting satiation or satiety, increasing fat oxidation, decreasing fat storage, or altering the microbiome. Added sugar and the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages may blunt satiety and promote energy intake. Notably, starch (mainly from refined grains and starchy vegetables) was slightly more strongly associated with weight increases than was the same amount of added sugar. We observed attenuated associations for changes in added sugar and starch after adjusting for concurrent changes in total energy intake, suggesting a partial mediating role of energy intake. Nevertheless, associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for energy, suggesting that other resultant changes (for example, changes in energy expenditure) may also lead to weight gain. Low calorie and no calorie sweetened beverages have been proposed as an alternative replacement strategy for sugar sweetened beverages in adults with overweight or obesity, to reduce extra energy intake. The latest guidelines from the World Health Organization recommend avoiding non-sugar sweeteners (low calorie and no calorie sweeteners) to control weight but also highlight the need for further research.

Abstract

Objective

To assess the association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) and important health outcomes in generally healthy or overweight/obese adults and children.

Design

Systematic review following standard Cochrane review methodology.

Data sources

Medline (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant publications.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Studies including generally healthy adults or children with or without overweight or obesity were eligible. Included study designs allowed for a direct comparison of no intake or lower intake of NSS with higher NSS intake. NSSs had to be clearly named, the dose had to be within the acceptable daily intake, and the intervention duration had to be at least seven days.

Main outcome measures

Body weight or body mass index, glycaemic control, oral health, eating behaviour, preference for sweet taste, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood, behaviour, neurocognition, and adverse effects.

Results

The search resulted in 13 941 unique records. Of 56 individual studies that provided data for this review, 35 were observational studies. In adults, evidence of very low and low certainty from a limited number of small studies indicated a small beneficial effect of NSSs on body mass index (mean difference −0.6, 95% confidence interval −1.19 to −0.01; two studies, n = 174) and fasting blood glucose (−0.16 mmol/L, −0.26 to −0.06; two, n = 52). Lower doses of NSSs were associated with lower weight gain (−0.09 kg, −0.13 to −0.05; one, n = 17 934) compared with higher doses of NSSs (very low certainty of evidence). For all other outcomes, no differences were detected between the use and non-use of NSSs, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence of any effect of NSSs was seen on overweight or obese adults or children actively trying to lose weight (very low to moderate certainty). In children, a smaller increase in body mass index z score was observed with NSS intake compared with sugar intake (−0.15, −0.17 to −0.12; two, n = 528, moderate certainty of evidence), but no significant differences were observed in body weight (−0.60 kg, −1.33 to 0.14; two, n = 467, low certainty of evidence), or between different doses of NSSs (very low to moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Most health outcomes did not seem to have differences between the NSS exposed and unexposed groups. Of the few studies identified for each outcome, most had few participants, were of short duration, and their methodological and reporting quality was limited; therefore, confidence in the reported results is limited. Future studies should assess the effects of NSSs with an appropriate intervention duration. Detailed descriptions of interventions, comparators, and outcomes should be included in all reports.

### Nonnutritive sweeteners: current use and health perspectives: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American diabetes association [^116g568z]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

A 2009 American Heart Association scientific statement titled "Dietary Sugars Intake and Cardiovascular Health" concluded that current intake of added sugars among Americans greatly exceeds discretionary calorie allowances based on the 2005 U.S. Dietary Guidelines. For this reason, the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee recommended population-wide reductions in added sugars intake. The present statement from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association addresses the potential role of nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) in helping Americans to adhere to this recommendation in the context of current usage and health perspectives.

By definition, NNS, otherwise referred to as very low-calorie sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, noncaloric sweeteners, and intense sweeteners, have a higher intensity of sweetness per gram than caloric sweeteners such as sucrose, corn syrups, and fruit juice concentrates. As a caloric sweetener replacement, they are added in smaller quantities; hence, they provide no or few calories. In our current food supply, NNS are widely used in thousands of beverages and other food products such as diet soft drinks, yogurts, desserts, and gum. Food manufacturers often use a blend of NNS or use a blend of sugar and NNS to improve the flavor acceptability of NNS. In developing this scientific statement, the writing group reviewed issues pertaining to NNS in the context of data on consumer attitudes, consumption patterns, appetite, hunger and energy intake, body weight, and components of cardiometabolic syndrome. The objective was to review the literature to determine whether there were adequate data to provide guidance for the use of NNS.

The focus of the statement is on the 6 NNS that are described in Table 1. Aspartame, acesulfame-K, neotame, saccharin, and sucralose are regulated as food additives by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and therefore had to be approved as safe before being marketed. Regarding stevia, at this time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not made a determination as to the Generally Recognized As Safe status, but has issued no objection letters for a number of Generally Recognized As Safe notifications for stevia sweeteners. Because all 6 of these NNS have current U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, issues related to safety of these compounds are not addressed. In addition, the review of the literature is primarily restricted to human studies in which noncaloric sweeteners are used as a replacement for caloric sweeteners.

### Impact of sugars and sugar taxation on body weight control: a comprehensive literature review [^111z6zaS]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a comprehensive literature review in the field of added-sugar consumption on weight gain including the effect of fructose-containing caloric sweeteners and sugar taxation.

Methods

A search of three databases was conducted in the time period from the inception of the databases to August 2015. Sensitive search strategies were used in order to retrieve systematic reviews (SR) of fructose, sucrose, or sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on weight gain and metabolic adverse effects, conducted on humans and written in English, Spanish, or French. In addition, a review about SSB taxation and weight outcomes was conducted.

Results

The search yielded 24 SRs about SSBs and obesity, 23 SRs on fructose or SSBs and metabolic adverse effects, and 24 studies about SSB taxation and weight control.

Conclusions

The majority of SRs, especially the most recent ones, with the highest quality and without any disclosed conflict of interest, suggested that the consumption of SSBs is a risk factor for obesity. The effect of fructose-containing caloric sweeteners, on weight gain is mediated by overconsumption of beverages with these sweeteners, leading to an extra provision of energy intake. The tax tool alone on added sugars appears insufficient to curb the obesity epidemic, but it needs to be included in a multicomponent structural strategy.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^117UTYF8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Is there enough evidence to make conclusive recommendations?

Additional research is needed to inform more conclusive recommendations. We further propose that recommendations should carefully consider, when possible, how individual types of non-sugar sweeteners are, or should be, used among specific population subgroups. Additionally, we argue that the precautionary principle should be applied, which emphasises caution in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence, particularly regarding use in specific populations, such as pregnant and lactating women, young children, and those with diabetes. This is particularly important because evidence of potential harm exists; and, as highlighted in the WHO guideline, non-sugar sweeteners are not essential dietary components.

There are two points of view. At one extreme are those who rely on evidence from randomised controlled trials demonstrating favourable effects of non-sugar sweeteners on energy intake and body weight, while disregarding accumulating evidence demonstrating undesirable effects of non-sugar sweeteners from observational analyses, mechanistic studies, and small trials in humans. At the other extreme are those who rely on findings of animal models, or observational analyses or small mechanistic studies in humans showing potentially adverse effects on health and posit that non-sugar sweeteners should be entirely avoided. Given that both experimental and observational studies have important limitations, we intend to offer a more nuanced approach. We propose that while non-sugar sweeteners may offer a tool for weight management and glycaemic control in some people under certain conditions of use, widespread replacement of added sugars with non-sugar sweeteners may have unintended negative consequences, especially in some subgroups. As different types of non-sugar sweeteners may have divergent impacts on health, however, caution and further research are warranted.

### The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: a randomized clinical trial [^112cTxvj]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of water versus beverages sweetened with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) on body weight in subjects enrolled in a year-long behavioral weight loss treatment program.

Methods

The study used a randomized equivalence design with NNS or water beverages as the main factor in a trial among 303 weight-stable people with overweight and obesity. All participants participated in a weight loss program plus assignment to consume 24 ounces (710 ml) of water or NNS beverages daily for 1 year.

Results

NNS and water treatments were non-equivalent, with NNS treatment showing greater weight loss at the end of 1 year. At 1 year subjects receiving water had maintained a 2.45 ± 5.59 kg weight loss while those receiving NNS beverages maintained a loss of 6.21 ± 7.65 kg (P < 0.001 for difference).

Conclusions

Water and NNS beverages were not equivalent for weight loss and maintenance during a 1-year behavioral treatment program. NNS beverages were superior for weight loss and weight maintenance in a population consisting of regular users of NNS beverages who either maintained or discontinued consumption of these beverages and consumed water during a structured weight loss program. These results suggest that NNS beverages can be an effective tool for weight loss and maintenance within the context of a weight management program.

### A systematic review on the effect of sweeteners on glycemic response and clinically relevant outcomes [^1163ms9n]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of randomized trial evidence that examines comparative sweetener effectiveness in diabetic, overweight/obese, and healthy populations. Despite tremendous interest in hypocaloric sweeteners as a potential tool to prevent obesity and its complications, we found little evidence to support their health benefits as compared to caloric alternatives. Based on analyses of two trials, we found that the inclusion of non-caloric sweeteners in the diet resulted in reduced energy intake compared to the caloric (sucrose) groups - approximately 500 kcal/day less over 10 weeks or 250 kcal/day over 4 weeks. The longer of these trials found that those in the non-caloric sweetener group also had a decrease in BMI compared to an increase in BMI in the sucrose group (-0.40 versus 0.50 kg/m 2, and -1.00 versus 1.60 kg, respectively). Given that the control group was asked to ingest supplemental calories in addition to their regular ad lib diet, a BMI reduction of approximately1 kg/m 2 over 10 weeks (or 0·1 kg/m 2 /week) may be overly optimistic. However, even a reduction in BMI of 0.05 kg/m 2 /week would be clinically relevant if sustained for a year or more. The remaining analyses comparing non-caloric and caloric sweeteners were non-significant.

Main findings

- 53 randomized controlled trials were included - all small and largely short-term (only 13 trials with ≥ 1 week durations)

- 2-hour blood glucose (mixed evidence, τ 2 = 3.66 (95% CI 1.66,7.31): fructose versus sucrose (MD -0.54 mmol/L (-1.06,-0.03)), fructose versus glucose (-0.89 mmol/L (-1.21,-0.59)), fructose versus other sugars (-0.85 mmol/L (-1.47,-0.21)) in non-diabetic participants

- 2-hour blood glucose (direct evidence): fructose versus glucose (-4·81 mmol/L (-6.34,-3.29), I² = 0%, τ 2 = 0 (0,7.47), 5 trials in 52 diabetic participants)

### The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: a randomized clinical trial [^112akfgC]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, only people with overweight and obesity who were regular NNS beverage users were studied and the effects in normal weight and NNS‐naïve subjects may be different. Second, subjects were actively trying to lose weight using a formal behavior management program and therefore may not represent effects on weight in people not enrolled in such a program.

### A systematic review on the effect of sweeteners on glycemic response and clinically relevant outcomes [^115BiWVW]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Non-caloric sweeteners have been available commercially since the late 1800s and their use in food products and as table-top sweeteners is increasing - perhaps due in part to aggressive marketing promoting their capacity to induce weight loss and weight maintenance. In 2007, non-caloric and/or high-intensity sweeteners accounted for 16% of the US sweetener market (approximately 0.5 billion USD) and projected sales of these products are expected to exceed one billion USD by 2014.

Sugar alcohols can also be used as sweetener additives and provide less calories per gram than saccharides (sugars). However because sugar alcohols cause gastrointestinal symptoms in some individuals due to incomplete absorption in the small intestine, they may be used less frequently than saccharides. A variety of different saccharides is commonly used to sweeten foods, such as sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose, isomaltulose, and fructooligosaccharide (FOS). FOS has half the calories per gram than sucrose, fructose, or glucose. Most recently, fructose (a highly commercially used sweetener used in combination with glucose as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)) has been controversially linked with hypertriglyceridemia.

The effects of different sweeteners on clinically relevant outcomes such as weight management, blood glucose and lipids have been incompletely studied. The main metabolic complications of obesity and type 2 diabetes may be prevented and managed in full or in part with dietary modification, including the use of sweeteners that provide little or no calories (hypocaloric sweeteners).

This review systematically summarizes the available randomized trial evidence to determine the comparative effectiveness of sweetener additives (non-caloric, sugar alcohols, and saccharides; Table 1) in food.

### Glycemic impact of non-nutritive sweeteners: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114i8CfT]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are zero- or low-calorie alternatives to nutritive sweeteners, such as table sugars. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to quantitatively synthesize existing scientific evidence on the glycemic impact of NNSs.

Subjects/Methods

PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched. Two authors screened the titles and abstracts of candidate publications. The third author was consulted to resolve discrepancies. Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials, with a total of 741 participants, were included and their quality assessed. NNSs under examination included aspartame, saccharin, steviosides, and sucralose. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines.

Results

Meta-analysis was performed to estimate and track the trajectory of blood glucose concentrations over time after NNS consumption, and to test differential effects by type of NNS and participants' age, weight, and disease status. In comparison with the baseline, NNS consumption was not found to increase blood glucose level, and its concentration gradually declined over the course of observation following NNS consumption. The glycemic impact of NNS consumption did not differ by type of NNS but to some extent varied by participants' age, body weight, and diabetic status.

Conclusions

NNS consumption was not found to elevate blood glucose level. Future studies are warranted to assess the health implications of frequent and chronic NNS consumption and elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.

### Low / no calorie sweetened beverage consumption in the national weight control registry [^1132K22r]. Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate prevalence of and strategies behind low/no calorie sweetened beverage (LNCSB) consumption in successful weight loss maintainers.

Methods

An online survey was administered to 434 members of the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR, individuals who have lost ≥ 13.6 kg and maintained weight loss for > 1 year).

Results

While few participants (10%) consume sugar-sweetened beverages on a regular basis, 53% regularly consume LNCSB. The top five reasons for choosing LNCSB were for taste (54%), to satisfy thirst (40%), part of routine (27%), to reduce calories (22%) and to go with meals (21%). The majority who consume LNCSB (78%) felt they helped control total calorie intake. Many participants considered changing patterns of beverage consumption to be very important in weight loss (42%) and maintenance (40%). Increasing water was by far the most common strategy, followed by reducing regular calorie beverages.

Conclusions

Regular consumption of LNCSB is common in successful weight loss maintainers for various reasons including helping individuals to limit total energy intake. Changing beverage consumption patterns was felt to be very important for weight loss and maintenance by a substantial percentage of successful weight loss maintainers in the NWCR.

### Facilitating positive health behaviors and well-being to improve health outcomes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115BjpK8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025 — nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) and water indicates that the FDA has approved many NNS for consumption by the general public, including people with diabetes; for some people with diabetes who regularly consume sugar-sweetened foods or beverages, NNS may be an acceptable substitute for nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation; NNS do not appear to have a significant effect on glycemic management and can reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake as long as individuals are not compensating with additional calories from other sources; a recent meta-analysis and systematic review of RCTs found no evidence that NNS raise liver enzymes; evidence for weight management is mixed, though a review of low- and no-calorie sweetener beverages used as substitutes for sugar-sweetened beverages reported a small improvement in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors without evidence of harm and with a direction of benefit similar to that seen with water; health care professionals should promote water as the healthiest beverage option, should encourage reductions in foods and beverages with added sugars, assuring people with diabetes that NNS have undergone extensive safety evaluation and are continually monitored can allay unnecessary concern for harm, and health care professionals can regularly assess individual NNS use based on acceptable daily intake and recommend moderation.

### Use of non-sugar sweeteners: WHO guideline [^111Hvm9j]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obesity, more specifically with respect to non-sugar sweeteners, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to avoid using non-sugar sweeteners as a means of achieving weight control or reducing the risk of noncommunicable diseases.

### WHO guideline on the use of non-sugar sweeteners: a need for reconsideration [^113x2WFL]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for the WHO guideline

To present a recommendation against the use of NSS for weight control or disease risk reduction — as presented by the WHO guideline — a strong and consistent signal of harm across all study types would be required. However, the available evidence presented by WHO guideline was contradictory, with trials showing benefits for body weight, measures of adiposity and calorie reduction and prospective cohort studies which are susceptible to bias, showing harm for cardiometabolic outcomes. In contrast, a similar assessment of evidence was carried out around the same time by the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group of the European Association for Study of Diabetes, which recommended the use of NSS to replace sugars in beverages and foods as a risk reduction strategy.

The WHO guideline also recommends natural sugars from fruit, unsweetened foods and beverages as alternatives for reducing free sugar intake, without conducting any analysis on their effectiveness compared to NSS or providing published data on the subject. It also implied that the diet quality of those who replace free sugars with NSS might may be unaffected. In fact, recent research suggests that NSS users have higher-quality diets and smoke less, but may have a higher prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, indicating that NSS consumption may be a response to high disease risk, not a cause of harm.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^1136Sybk]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Guidance is lacking for key population subgroups

Evidence to inform recommendations is particularly scarce in certain subgroups, such as those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, who widely consume non-sugar sweeteners. This is concerning because recent evidence in humans shows that non-sugar sweeteners are transferred through amniotic fluid and breast milk to fetuses and infants. While the effects of early life exposure to non-sugar sweeteners on health are not well understood, this represents an important area for future research, especially given the potential for lasting impacts on taste preferences, dietary patterns, and metabolic risk factors.

There is also a dearth of available evidence in children, who may be more susceptible to the effects of non-sugar sweeteners because of greater relative exposure in terms of intake per kilogram of body weight and the fact that they are still developing. Exposure to non-sugar sweeteners early in life is associated with increased body fat and cardiometabolic risk factors in observational studies, although consumption of non-sugar sweetened beverages resulted in less weight gain relative to beverages with added sugar among children in a randomised controlled trial. In the absence of strong scientific evidence, the American Academy of Pediatrics advocated for manufacturers to disclose amounts of non-sugar sweeteners on food packages and reinforced that more data are needed, especially related to long term intake.

### A systematic review on the effect of sweeteners on glycemic response and clinically relevant outcomes [^113GJAqX]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In theory, substituting non-caloric and lower caloric sweeteners for simple sugars should reduce energy intake and thereby the risk of obesity and its consequences. However, there are a number of reasons why increasing use of non-caloric and lower caloric sweeteners might not lead to the expected improvements in energy regulation. First, use of hypocaloric sweeteners might not induce weight loss even in the short term. For example, if reductions in calories due to sweeteners are offset by increases in caloric intake from other sources, or offset by decreases in caloric expenditure. Although our data suggest that non-caloric sweeteners may lead to clinically relevant weight loss through reduced energy consumption, this conclusion was driven by a single trial with a total of 41 participants. Unlike caloric sweeteners (which may partially compensate added calories with reduced energy intake from other sources), non-caloric sweeteners are not known to suppress appetite, and therefore would not reduce the motivation to eat. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the psychobiological signals with non-caloric sweeteners may directly influence physiological regulatory mechanisms and thus further reduce their potential for reducing net energy intake. Second, if calorie reduction is not maintained, short-term reductions in weight due to the use of hypocaloric sweeteners might not be sustained. Third, it is possible though speculative that any health benefits due to weight loss from non-caloric sweeteners might be wholly or partially offset by currently unrecognized adverse events due to their use. The lack of data on the long-term benefits of non-caloric sweeteners means that it is currently impossible to determine whether these substances will improve public health.

### A randomized trial of sugar-sweetened beverages and adolescent body weight [^116xbgXN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages may cause excessive weight gain. We aimed to assess the effect on weight gain of an intervention that included the provision of noncaloric beverages at home for overweight and obese adolescents.

Methods

We randomly assigned 224 overweight and obese adolescents who regularly consumed sugar-sweetened beverages to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received a 1-year intervention designed to decrease consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, with follow-up for an additional year without intervention. We hypothesized that the experimental group would gain weight at a slower rate than the control group.

Results

Retention rates were 97% at 1 year and 93% at 2 years. Reported consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was similar at baseline in the experimental and control groups (1.7 servings per day), declined to nearly 0 in the experimental group at 1 year, and remained lower in the experimental group than in the control group at 2 years. The primary outcome, the change in mean body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) at 2 years, did not differ significantly between the two groups (change in experimental group minus change in control group, -0.3; P = 0.46). At 1 year, however, there were significant between-group differences for changes in BMI (-0.57, P = 0.045) and weight (-1.9 kg, P = 0.04). We found evidence of effect modification according to ethnic group at 1 year (P = 0.04) and 2 years (P = 0.01). In a prespecified analysis according to ethnic group, among Hispanic participants (27 in the experimental group and 19 in the control group), there was a significant between-group difference in the change in BMI at 1 year (-1.79, P = 0.007) and 2 years (-2.35, P = 0.01), but not among non-Hispanic participants (P > 0.35 at years 1 and 2). The change in body fat as a percentage of total weight did not differ significantly between groups at 2 years (-0.5%, P = 0.40). There were no adverse events related to study participation.

Conclusions

Among overweight and obese adolescents, the increase in BMI was smaller in the experimental group than in the control group after a 1-year intervention designed to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, but not at the 2-year follow-up (the prespecified primary outcome).

### Effects of D-allulose on glucose tolerance and insulin response to a standard oral sucrose load: results of a prospective, randomized, crossover study [^11224eg2]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Although dieting is the cornerstone of weight management, the optimal mix of diet to facilitate weight loss and maximize the health benefits remains controversial. With the rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity worldwide, there is urgency in identifying an effective and safe diet for body weight reduction. While low fat diet has been the traditional cornerstone of the dietary guidelines of various national and international societies, there is increased popular attraction to low carbohydrate diets. More importantly, there is growing evidence for potential health benefits of low glycemic foods, and glycemic load is the best quantitative variable that can be correlated with clinical outcomes, including coronary artery disease, breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Notably, a substantial portion of glycemic load in western diets is attributed to added caloric sweeteners in the diet, which has been steadily increasing over the last four decades and associated with development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 DM.

Individuals in the USA consume a substantial proportion of their total energy as added sugars. Unlike most other carbohydrates, added sugars alone contribute no nutrients other than energy and are easily modifiable. The mechanism through which the dysmetabolic effects of carbohydrates occur is not completely understood. Studies suggest that these effects could be mediated by fructose, a monosaccharide comprising 50% of table sugar. Fructose has been shown to increase de novo lipogenesis in the liver, hepatic triglyceride synthesis and increase secretion of very low-density lipoproteins. Fructose also appears to decrease the peripheral clearance of lipids. These findings support the current dietary guidelines that encourage consumers to limit their intake of added sugar.

Drastic reductions in the consumption of sugar may necessitate the use of sugar substitutes. Reduced calorie sweeteners and non-nutritive sweeteners currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have limitations and have not proven to confer metabolic benefits. This underscores the need for a sugar substitute that is safe, palatable and has favorable effects on energy metabolism and overall glucose homeostasis.

### Non-caloric sweetener effects on brain appetite regulation in individuals across varying body weights [^1129bm5n]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Sucralose, a widely used non-caloric sweetener, provides sweet taste without calories. Some studies suggest that non-caloric sweeteners stimulate appetite, possibly owing to the delivery of a sweet taste without the post-ingestive metabolic signals that normally communicate with the hypothalamus to suppress hunger. In a randomized crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02945475), 75 young adults (healthy weight, overweight or with obesity) consumed a drink containing sucralose, sweetness-matched sucrose or water. We show that acute consumption of sucralose versus sucrose stimulates hypothalamic blood flow (P < 0.018) and greater hunger responses (P < 0.001). Sucralose versus water also increases hypothalamic blood flow (P < 0.019) but produces no difference in hunger ratings. Sucrose, but not sucralose, increases peripheral glucose levels, which are associated with reductions in medial hypothalamic blood flow (P < 0.007). Sucralose, compared to sucrose and water, results in increased functional connections between the hypothalamus and brain regions involved in motivation and somatosensory processing. These findings suggest that non-caloric sweeteners could affect key mechanisms in the hypothalamus responsible for appetite regulation.

### Non-nutritive sweetened beverages versus water after a 52-week weight management programme: a randomised controlled trial [^1178viXf]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is well established that sugar-sweetened beverages are a major source of added sugar in the diet which, when consumed habitually or to excess, can contribute to weight gain and a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Therefore, dietary guidelines recommend lower-calorie options such as water or non-nutritive sweetened (NNS) beverages to reduce overall sugar consumption. However, using NNS beverages as part of a long-term weight management strategy remains a much-debated topic, with controversary relating to their potential effects. While some long-term observational studies have reported a positive association between NNS beverage consumption and gains in body weight and body mass index (BMI), meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials have reported reduced overall energy intake and modest weight loss, with beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health, in participants consuming NNS beverages when compared mostly to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, many of the trials included in these reviews were of short- or medium-term duration, and there is still a paucity of data from randomised trials comparing the effects of NNS beverages with water on longer-term weight maintenance following weight loss. Additional long-term randomised controlled trials on this topic will help strengthen the evidence base for making policy recommendations for the use of NNS beverages in weight management programmes.

### Non-nutritive sweeteners for diabetes mellitus [^11154zxH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Products sweetened with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are widely available. Many people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes use NNS as a replacement for nutritive sweeteners to control their carbohydrate and energy intake. Health outcomes associated with NNS use in diabetes are unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners in people with diabetes mellitus.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Scopus, the WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search of all databases (except for Scopus) was May 2019. We last searched Scopus in January 2019. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of four weeks or more comparing any type of NNS with usual diet, no intervention, placebo, water, a different NNS, or a nutritive sweetener in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Trials with concomitant behaviour-changing interventions, such as diet, exercise, or both, were eligible for inclusion, given that the concomitant interventions were the same in the intervention and comparator groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, full texts, and records retrieved from trials registries, assessed the certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis, and calculated effect estimates as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs that randomised a total of 979 people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The intervention duration ranged from 4 to 10 months. We judged none of these trials as at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains; most of the included trials did not report the method of randomisation. Three trials compared the effects of a dietary supplement containing NNS with sugar: glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 0.4% higher in the NNS group (95% CI -0.5 to 1.2; P = 0.44; 3 trials; 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The MD in weight change was -0.1 kg (95% CI -2.7 to 2.6; P = 0.96; 3 trials; 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials with sugar as comparator reported on adverse events. Five trials compared NNS with placebo. The MD for HbA1c was 0%, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.1; P = 0.99; 4 trials; 360 participants; very low-certainty evidence. The 95% prediction interval ranged between -0.3% and 0.3%. The comparison of NNS versus placebo showed a MD in body weight of -0.2 kg, 95% CI -1 to 0.6; P = 0.64; 2 trials; 184 participants; very low-certainty evidence. Three trials reported the numbers of participants experiencing at least one non-serious adverse event: 36/113 participants (31.9%) in the NNS group versus 42/118 participants (35.6%) in the placebo group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; P = 0.48; 3 trials; 231 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One trial compared NNS with a nutritive low-calorie sweetener (tagatose). HbA1c was 0.3% higher in the NNS group (95% CI 0.1 to 0.4; P = 0.01; 1 trial; 354 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This trial did not report body weight data and adverse events. The included trials did not report data on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, all-cause mortality, or socioeconomic effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is inconclusive evidence of very low certainty regarding the effects of NNS consumption compared with either sugar, placebo, or nutritive low-calorie sweetener consumption on clinically relevant benefit or harm for HbA1c, body weight, and adverse events in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Data on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, all-cause mortality, and socioeconomic effects are lacking.

### POINT: artificial sweeteners and obesity-not the solution and potentially a problem [^112b5FCW]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) have been widely implemented as replacements for naturally occurring sugars in a wide array of foods, beverages, and non-consumables for the sake of reducing calories. The use of these products, whether naturally occurring or manufactured, have become commonplace and accepted as de facto beneficial. This point argues that rigorous analysis of the available data do not confirm benefit and indeed suggest harm.

Methods

A literature review was conducted on all the available NNS supplements that are commonly used in all types of products. There was a focus on studies that evaluated the long-term as well as neurohormonal effects of NNS products. Key words used in the search included artificial sweeteners, nonnutritive sweeteners, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame, sucralose, stevia, xylitol, and erythritol.

Results

There was a consistent trend of no to minimal benefit when NNS were used instead of calorie-containing sweeteners particularly in persons with obesity or pre-diabetes risks. There was a consistent finding of detriment to the neurohormonal regulation of satiety, weight, and energy regulation. The only studies that were neutral to positive were biased studies funded by the large food and beverage corporations or done in healthy weight individuals without any underlying health concerns and for a very short time frame.

Conclusion

Although NNS usage has become ubiquitous, there has been very little in the way of rigorous review of the neurohormonal and physiologic effects. The arguments for NNS are purely thermodynamic in nature despite the overwhelming evidence that obesity and adiposity-related diseases are not that simplistic in their pathophysiology. Given that there are differences in how individuals process nutrition signals, very few studies focus on gender or disease predisposition differences and how they affect the outcomes when NNS are used. Studies that controlled these variables showed worsening outcomes when NNS products are used in the fight against adiposity-related diseases, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Alterations in the gut microbiome towards a more inflammatory pattern of gut microbiota is a disturbing finding in acute as well as chronic users of NNS regardless of baseline weight or disease. Most importantly, there were numerous studies that found long-term damage to the neurohormonal control of satiety in chronic users of NNS. In the fight against obesity and adiposity-related diseases, we cannot afford to blindly accept their usage based on a broken paradigm of thermodynamics and false assumptions that we are all created equal biologically.

### A systematic review on the effect of sweeteners on glycemic response and clinically relevant outcomes [^1125kLP4]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The major metabolic complications of obesity and type 2 diabetes may be prevented and managed with dietary modification. The use of sweeteners that provide little or no calories may help to achieve this objective.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of the comparative effectiveness of sweetener additives using Bayesian techniques. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CAB Global were searched to January 2011. Randomized trials comparing sweeteners in obese, diabetic, and healthy populations were selected. Outcomes of interest included weight change, energy intake, lipids, glycated hemoglobin, markers of insulin resistance and glycemic response. Evidence-based items potentially indicating risk of bias were assessed.

Results

Of 3,666 citations, we identified 53 eligible randomized controlled trials with 1,126 participants. In diabetic participants, fructose reduced 2-hour blood glucose concentrations by 4.81 mmol/L (95% CI 3.29, 6.34) compared to glucose. Two-hour blood glucose concentration data comparing hypocaloric sweeteners to sucrose or high fructose corn syrup were inconclusive. Based on two ≤ 10-week trials, we found that non-caloric sweeteners reduced energy intake compared to the sucrose groups by approximately 250–500 kcal/day (95% CI 153, 806). One trial found that participants in the non-caloric sweetener group had a decrease in body mass index compared to an increase in body mass index in the sucrose group (-0.40 vs 0.50 kg/m2, and -1.00 vs 1.60 kg/m2, respectively). No randomized controlled trials showed that high fructose corn syrup or fructose increased levels of cholesterol relative to other sweeteners.

Conclusions

Considering the public health importance of obesity and its consequences; the clearly relevant role of diet in the pathogenesis and maintenance of obesity; and the billions of dollars spent on non-caloric sweeteners, little high-quality clinical research has been done. Studies are needed to determine the role of hypocaloric sweeteners in a wider population health strategy to prevent, reduce and manage obesity and its consequences.

### Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and weight gain in children and adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials [^113rt9Lb]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have been implicated in fueling the obesity epidemic.

Objectives

This study aimed to update a synthesis of the evidence on SSBs and weight gain in children and adults.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched through September 8, 2022, for prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated intake of SSBs in relation to BMI and body weight in children and adults, respectively. Eligible interventions were compared against a noncaloric control. Study-level estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis and presented as β-coefficients with 95% CIs for cohorts and weighted mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for RCTs.

Results

We identified 85 articles including 48 in children (40 cohorts, n = 91,713; 8 RCTs, n = 2783) and 37 in adults (21 cohorts, n = 448,661; 16 RCTs, n = 1343). Among cohort studies, each serving/day increase in SSB intake was associated with a 0.07-kg/m 2 (95% CI: 0.04 kg/m 2, 0.10 kg/m 2) higher BMI in children and a 0.42-kg (95% CI: 0.26 kg, 0.58 kg) higher body weight in adults. RCTs in children indicated less BMI gain with SSB reduction interventions compared with control (MD: -0.21 kg/m 2; 95% CI: -0.40 kg/m 2, -0.01 kg/m 2). In adults, randomization to addition of SSBs to the diet led to greater body weight gain (MD: 0.83 kg; 95% CI: 0.47 kg, 1.19 kg), and subtraction of SSBs led to weight loss (MD: -0.49 kg; 95% CI: -0.66 kg, -0.32 kg) compared with the control groups. A positive linear dose-response association between SSB consumption and weight gain was found in all outcomes assessed.

Conclusions

Our updated systematic review and meta-analysis expands on prior evidence to confirm that SSB consumption promotes higher BMI and body weight in both children and adults, underscoring the importance of dietary guidance and public policy strategies to limit intake. This meta-analysis was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews as CRD42020209915.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^115cC4oy]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Selection of studies

All titles and abstracts of records identified in the databases and other sources above were screened for eligibility by one researcher (DKdG, SL, or IT). Two review authors independently evaluated full texts of all potentially eligible studies for appropriateness for inclusion without prior consideration of the results (DKdG, SL, IT). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or feedback from a third author (JJM).

Data extraction and management

Two review authors independently extracted data and cross checked the extracted information on study characteristics, and included participants, interventions, and reported outcomes using a piloted, standardised data extraction form in the online software Covidence (DKdG, SL, IT). Any differences related to the data extraction were resolved by rechecking the full text of the study or by discussion. If study data were only available from figures, data were extracted by use of the validated software Plot Digitizer. When study data were ambiguous or data were not reported in a form that could be used for formal comparison, we contacted the corresponding and first author of the original publication via email.

Assessment of risk of bias

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third author (JJM). For the risk of bias assessment of randomised controlled trials, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool. For non-randomised controlled trials, we used the ROBINS-I tool (risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions). We planned to create funnel plots when data of 10 or more studies were available to assess the likelihood of dissemination bias. Since none of the meta-analyses included 10 studies or more, a thorough assessment of dissemination bias was not feasible.

Data synthesis

If not reported, we calculated the risk ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals for randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and cohort studies, as well as odds ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals for case-control studies. Mean differences or standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous outcomes. We conducted meta-analyses if comparable outcome data from two or more studies were available. In these meta-analyses, we used the random effects model. When baseline and final values were given, we computed changes from baseline. We imputed any missing standard deviation values using an imputed correlation coefficient. In this review, we used a correlation coefficient of zero. Statistical analyses were conducted by the statistical software R with the R package meta and metasens.

### Dietary sugars and body weight: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^1168krYA]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To summarise evidence on the association between intake of dietary sugars and body weight in adults and children.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies.

Data Sources

OVID Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and Web of Science (up to December 2011).

Review Methods

Eligible studies reported the intake of total sugars, intake of a component of total sugars, or intake of sugar containing foods or beverages; and at least one measure of body fatness. Minimum duration was two weeks for trials and one year for cohort studies. Trials of weight loss or confounded by additional medical or lifestyle interventions were excluded. Study selection, assessment, validity, data extraction, and analysis were undertaken as specified by the Cochrane Collaboration and the GRADE working group. For trials, we pooled data for weight change using inverse variance models with random effects. We pooled cohort study data where possible to estimate effect sizes, expressed as odds ratios for risk of obesity or β coefficients for change in adiposity per unit of intake.

Results

30 of 7895 trials and 38 of 9445 cohort studies were eligible. In trials of adults with ad libitum diets (that is, with no strict control of food intake), reduced intake of dietary sugars was associated with a decrease in body weight (0.80 kg, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 1.21; P < 0.001); increased sugars intake was associated with a comparable weight increase (0.75 kg, 0.30 to 1.19; P = 0.001). Isoenergetic exchange of dietary sugars with other carbohydrates showed no change in body weight (0.04 kg, -0.04 to 0.13). Trials in children, which involved recommendations to reduce intake of sugar sweetened foods and beverages, had low participant compliance to dietary advice; these trials showed no overall change in body weight. However, in relation to intakes of sugar sweetened beverages after one year follow-up in prospective studies, the odds ratio for being overweight or obese increased was 1.55 (1.32 to 1.82) among groups with the highest intake compared with those with the lowest intake. Despite significant heterogeneity in one meta-analysis and potential bias in some trials, sensitivity analyses showed that the trends were consistent and associations remained after these studies were excluded.

Conclusions

Among free living people involving ad libitum diets, intake of free sugars or sugar sweetened beverages is a determinant of body weight. The change in body fatness that occurs with modifying intakes seems to be mediated via changes in energy intakes, since isoenergetic exchange of sugars with other carbohydrates was not associated with weight change.

Eating behaviour

Satiety, appetite, and energy intake — In one randomised controlled trial (n = 141), children receiving NSSs versus those receiving sucrose had similar self reported satiety one minute after intake (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 1.29) and 15 minutes after intake (1.44, 0.86 to 2.40). Self reported appetite increase (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 3.29) or appetite decrease (1.08, 0.44 to 2.63) were similar between the study groups in another randomised controlled trial (n = 126). According to evidence from a third randomised controlled trial, energy intake was lower in the sucralose group than in the sucrose group (mean difference 197.60 kJ, 95% confidence interval −327.18 to 722.38; n = 190, low certainty of evidence). In one non-randomised controlled trial, mean daily energy intake was reported to be similar between the groups receiving aspartame or saccharin and significantly increased in the group that received sucrose. Energy intake was 6711, 6640, or 7728 kJ daily with aspartame, saccharin, or sucrose in the preschool group, respectively, and 8100, 8284, and 9293 kJ for school age children, respectively. In one randomised controlled trial with overweight children involved in active weight loss, researchers assessed change in appetite as self reported adverse events, which were reported to be no different between the study groups (incidence rate ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 2.49; one study, n = 55, very low certainty of evidence).

Preference for sweet taste — One crossover non-randomised controlled trial(n = 47) reported significantly lower sugar intake in children receiving aspartame or saccharin than in children receiving sucrose (not enough data for formal statistical comparison, very low certainty of evidence). The effect seemed to be strongly related to the sugar content of the experimental diets.

Needs for Further Research

Because of the paucity of well-designed human studies that address the specific, practical, public health issues, as presented above, further research is warranted in several areas.

NNS and energy compensation

The most obvious potential benefit of NNS is the substitution of energy from added sugars, thereby facilitating both energy and carbohydrate intake reductions (with potential glycemic control benefits). However, what would appear to be a potential benefit is complicated by compensation; that is, the extent to which an immediate energy and carbohydrate reduction through NNS use is followed by a subsequent increase in energy intake (regardless of macronutrient type) beyond what would have been consumed in the absence of the use of NNS. Existing data suggest that there is partial compensation with differences in intake after consuming food and beverages containing NNS. Energy intake compensation appears to be greater after consuming foods containing NNS than that for beverages containing NNS. Future work should test and compare different food and beverage vehicles of the NNS, and compare the different NNS themselves and NNS combinations as well, in an effort to maximize potential impact.

NNS mechanisms of action and pathophysiology

Research in the area of energy compensation would be facilitated and complemented by continued research into the mechanisms of potential NNS effects. This would include, but not be limited to, increasing the body of knowledge of oral, gut, and neural receptors, and hormonal responses that contribute to alterations in food preferences, appetite regulation, and satiety that are elicited by NNS. This research should inform the selection of foods, beverages, specific NNS (or combinations), and perhaps specific population subsets for studies of compensation effects.

Randomized controlled trials using NNS to impact body weight or glycemic control

Well-designed and controlled designed clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term effect of NNS on body weight regulation and glycemic control at different points in the life cycle. Weight control studies (e.g. weight loss) should be minimally 1 year in duration or longer, whereas glycemic control studies could be shorter in duration. Studies of both end points would benefit from better informed selections of the types, amounts, combinations, and vehicles of NNS delivery, as described in the previous 2 areas of suggested further research.

Assessment of NNS intake

Immediate needs include updating of current food databases with accurate data for the NNS content of foods and revision of instruments used to estimate food intake to accurately capture NNS content.

Blood pressure

Data from three randomised controlled trials showed that systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in people receiving NSSs than in those receiving sugar or placebo (systolic, mean difference −4.90 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval −9.78 to −0.03; diastolic, −3.27 mm Hg, −7.21 to 0.67; three studies, n = 202 at baseline, very low certainty of evidence). The effect seemed stronger in studies using caloric sweeteners as comparatorsthan in those that used a non-caloric comparator. In another randomised controlled trial, researchers reported narratively that there was no change in blood pressure in the study groups.

No significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reported in one randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of aspartame in overweight populations trying to lose weight. After 12 weeks, the group differences in diastolic blood pressure were 6 mm Hg less in men and 1 mm Hg more in women when the aspartame group was compared with controls (not enough data for formal statistical comparison, very low certainty of evidence).

### WHO guideline on the use of non-sugar sweeteners: a need for reconsideration [^116EGitp]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The recommendation of the latest WHO guideline on the use of non-sugar sweeteners relies solely on evidence from long-term prospective cohort studies with prevalent or baseline assessments of NSS without considering change and substitution analysis and ignoring trial data. Prospective cohort studies on this topic using prevalent analysis are subject to serious methodological limitations, and recent evidence from studies with more rigorous analytical methods, modeling change in intake and calorie replacement with NSS, shows benefits for major cardiometabolic outcomes without the evidence of harm. The consistency between trial results and analytically rigorous prospective cohort studies warrants a reconsideration of the WHO's evidence base and recommendation. In conclusion, both trial and prospective cohort studies, utilizing methods to reduce bias, support the use of NSS in clinical and public health strategies for reducing caloric intake and achieving short and long-term weight loss benefits.

### Association of low-and No-calorie sweetened beverages as a replacement for sugar-sweetened beverages with body weight and cardiometabolic risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Fd53T]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

There are concerns that low- and no-calorie sweetened beverages (LNCSBs) do not have established benefits, with major dietary guidelines recommending the use of water and not LNCSBs to replace sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Whether LNCSB as a substitute can yield similar improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors vs water in their intended substitution for SSBs is unclear.

Objective

To assess the association of LNCSBs (using 3 prespecified substitutions of LNCSBs for SSBs, water for SSBs, and LNCSBs for water) with body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with and without diabetes.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception through December 26, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with at least 2 weeks of interventions comparing LNCSBs, SSBs, and/or water were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted and risk of bias was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. A network meta-analysis was performed with data expressed as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was body weight. Secondary outcomes were other measures of adiposity, glycemic control, blood lipids, blood pressure, measures of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and uric acid.

Results

A total of 17 RCTs with 24 trial comparisons were included, involving 1733 adults (mean [SD] age, 33.1 [6.6] years; 1341 women [77.4%]) with overweight or obesity who were at risk for or had diabetes. Overall, LNCSBs were a substitute for SSBs in 12 RCTs (n = 601 participants), water was a substitute for SSBs in 3 RCTs (n = 429), and LNCSBs were a substitute for water in 9 RCTs (n = 974). Substitution of LNCSBs for SSBs was associated with reduced body weight (MD, -1.06 kg; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.41 kg), body mass index (MD, -0.32; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.07), percentage of body fat (MD, -0.60%; 95% CI, -1.03% to -0.18%), and intrahepatocellular lipid (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.70 to -0.14). Substituting water for SSBs was not associated with any outcome. There was also no association found between substituting LNCSBs for water with any outcome except glycated hemoglobin A1c (MD, 0.21%; 95% CI, 0.02% to 0.40%) and systolic blood pressure (MD, -2.63 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.71 to -0.55 mm Hg). The certainty of the evidence was moderate (substitution of LNCSBs for SSBs) and low (substitutions of water for SSBs and LNCSBs for water) for body weight and was generally moderate for all other outcomes across all substitutions.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that using LNCSBs as an intended substitute for SSBs was associated with small improvements in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors without evidence of harm and had a similar direction of benefit as water substitution. The evidence supports the use of LNCSBs as an alternative replacement strategy for SSBs over the moderate term in adults with overweight or obesity who are at risk for or have diabetes.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^115VCA4z]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Key messages

Non-sugar sweeteners are widely found in the global food supply and are commonly used to replace added sugars in the diet
Recommendations surrounding non-sugar sweetener consumption are inconclusive and conflicting, with scarce evidence on long term effects
Several factors contribute to uncertainty about the health effects of non-sugar sweetener consumption, particularly differences in study design, methods, and interpretation of findings
Additional research is needed to inform conclusive recommendations for or against the use of non-sugar sweeteners
Guidelines for non-sugar sweetener use should consider individual types of sweeteners and specific population subgroups such as children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and people with diabetes

Non-sugar sweeteners are commonly used as replacements for added sugars, both in the general population and among people with obesity and diabetes. Because of ongoing efforts to lower added sugar intake, non-sugar sweeteners have become ubiquitous in the global food supply. The global market for non-sugar sweeteners is expected to grow, with a predicted market value of more than $408bn in 2032 — a growth of 7.2% in 10 years. Although their use is widespread and increasing, there is uncertainty about their health effects, which has led to inconclusive recommendations for or against their consumption.

The challenge of developing conclusive intake recommendations for non-sugar sweeteners is particularly timely: in May 2023, the World Health Organization released a guideline for people without diabetes that recommended against using non-sugar sweeteners for weight control and prevention of non-communicable diseases. Notably, the WHO guideline did not provide recommendations for people with diabetes, who make up around 10% of the world's population and commonly use non-sugar sweeteners as a tool for maintaining glycaemic control. Because of the limitations of the available research, however, the WHO guideline is considered conditional and is based on evidence of low certainty. The limitations of the research are not specific to the WHO guideline and pervade existing recommendations. This underscores the need for additional research to inform more conclusive guidance tackling the health effects of individual types of non-sugar sweeteners, and to focus on examining their effects in specific population subgroups.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^113jdBDz]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Limitations of existing studies examining the health effects of non-sugar sweeteners leave many questions unanswered. Research examining non-sugar sweeteners as a single entity provides unclear findings related to their health effects, especially for obesity, weight management, glycaemic control, and other cardiometabolic disease risk factors. There is a need for additional long term randomised controlled trials examining impacts of individual types of non-sugar sweeteners on metabolic and health outcomes to inform more conclusive intake guidelines in the context of specific health conditions and population subgroups. In the future, a concerted effort should be made, when possible, to develop targeted guidelines for individual types of non-sugar sweeteners and specific population subgroups to provide clear and safe intake recommendations for policy makers, healthcare providers, and consumers.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^1111Z5JU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Wiebe and colleaguesreported a decrease in body mass index in people consuming foods and drinks containing non-caloric sweeteners compared with an increased body mass index in those consuming foods and drinks containing sucrose. The researchers further highlighted the lack of high quality research regarding non-caloric sweeteners. A systematic review by Azad and colleaguesfound no statistically significant effect of non-nutritive sweeteners on body mass index, body weight, fat mass, waist circumference, and HOMA-IR. Overall, published systematic reviews rarely drew firm conclusions. Main methodological concerns were limitations in the literature search and the data analyses. By contrast to our review, most meta-analyses were not planned and conducted, and the authors summarised the individual study results narratively instead.

A few large prospective cohort studieswith long term follow-up investigated the association between NSS intake and different health outcomes. However, the NSSs being investigated were not sufficiently specified to match the inclusion criteria of this review. Still, their results indicate an increased risk of higher body mass index and type 2 diabetes with higher NSS consumption, or lower risk of cardiovascular disease with intake of artificially sweetened sodas compared with sugar sweetened sodas. These results partly conflict with the ones from the findings of this systematic review. Included studies investigated long term health outcomes for a relatively short duration — for example, cardiovascular healthoutcomes or diabetesinvestigated for six months or less. Long term studies with sufficient statistical power are key to investigating long term health outcomes such as incidence of diabetes or cardiovascular health. Hence, results of large, long term cohort studies should be verified by studies that specify the type of sweeter used.

The findings of our review might be biased by the fact that only one reviewer assessed inclusion of studies in the initial title and abstract screening phase. Hence, relevant references could have inadvertently not been included in this review. However, this possibility is unlikely because only clearly irrelevant references were excluded at this stage. Furthermore, we did not seek clarification with the study authors about whether our assessment of risk of bias in the individual studies was correct. In the statistical analyses, missing standard deviations for change in outcomes were imputed, and in some cases, approximation was used for the analyses. Therefore, the reliability of analyses of changes in outcomes might have been weakened by the unavailability of data and the use of imputed values and approximation.

### WHO guideline on the use of non-sugar sweeteners: a need for reconsideration [^115jh5my]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Prospective cohort studies of NSS using prevalent analysis cannot capture the intended replacement strategy of NSS for excess calories. This results in an underestimate or biased result for the intended cardiometabolic benefit, as evidenced by the contrasting results when compared to the findings from NSS trials. Fortunately, there have been recent advances in analytical methodologies in prospective cohort studies that overcome the limitations of prevalent analyses. These new methods include sequential assessment to measure change in exposure, and substitution analysis modeling NSS as a replacement for caloric sugars. These two robust analytical methods accompanied by adjustment for baseline adiposity substantially reduce the bias associated with NSS studies by capturing the intended substitution of calories, controlling for reverse causation and residual confounding. These rigorous analytical methodologies have now been well-described and used in recent published studies.

Recently an SRMA of prospective cohort studies of NSS intake was published by Lee at al. that included studies using change analysis of sequential assessments and substitution analysis modeling NSS as a replacement for sugar-sweetened beverages and adjusted for initial adiposity. This SRMA, which included 14 prospective cohort studies with 416,830 participants, showed that an increase in NSS intake (change analysis) in studies with sequential assessments was associated with lower weight and lower waist circumference without any adverse effect on type 2 diabetes. The substitution of NSS beverages for sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with lower weight and lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease and total and cardiovascular mortality, without any adverse effect on any other cardiometabolic outcomes, including type 2 diabetes. The pooled results from the change and substitution analysis are consistent with the trial evidence on adiposity outcomes and support the understanding that NSS intake contributes to weight and cardiometabolic benefits by reducing or displacing excess calories from sugar.

Statistically significant results are bolded.

Two trials reported energy intake; both reported a significant effect of non-caloric sweeteners. The 4-week trial in generally healthy participants found a significantly reduced intake of calories in non-caloric sweetener participants (-283 kcal (-414,-153), 133 participants). The trial in overweight participants also found significantly less energy intake (over one day) in the non-caloric sweetener group after ten weeks of follow-up (-491 kcal (-806,-177), 41 participants).

Available trials found no effect of sweetener type on HbA1C (one trial: -0.02% over four weeks (-0.40,0.30), ten participants) or the HOMA index (one trial: -0.20 over ten weeks (-0.58,0.18), forty-one participants). The trial in ten type 1 diabetic participants found no effect on total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides over the course of four weeks; the other trial in forty-one overweight participants found no effect on triglycerides over the course of ten weeks.

Two trials reported change in BMI (Table 6); one comparing honey to sucrose in overweight/obese participants over 4 weeks of follow-up; the other comparing a mixture of isomaltulose and sucrose to sucrose over 12 weeks of follow-up in healthy participants. Neither found a significant difference between sweeteners. One trial compared FOS to glucose (three weeks in twenty diabetic participants) and one trial compared FOS to sucrose (four weeks in twelve healthy participants), respectively. Neither found a difference in absolute weight change. Five other trials done in varying populations (including overweight/obese or healthy populations) found no differences in change in absolute weight between sweeteners. Two trials reported energy intake (FOS compared with glucose and sucrose respectively, but neither found a significant difference.

### Association of low-and No-calorie sweetened beverages as a replacement for sugar-sweetened beverages with body weight and cardiometabolic risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1136EUZ8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The observed improvements in downstream, intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes are also in agreement with findings of previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In addition to their association with weight gain, fructose-containing sugars that provide excess calories, especially in beverage form, have been associated with increased triglycerides, glucose, insulin, uric acid, and NAFLD markers. Toews et alshowed that the use of LNCSs as a substitute for caloric sugars (sucrose) were a factor in reduced BP, and the reductions seen in IHCL would be expected through displacement of calories from SSBs.

The findings of this study can inform guidance on the role of LNCSBs in sugar-reduction strategies. There has been a particular focus on SSBs as the most important source of added or free sugars in several countries, given that the overconsumption of sugar has been associated with weight gain, diabetes, and downstream complications of hypertension and coronary heart disease. Although water is considered to be the standard-of-care substitution for SSBs by authoritative bodies, with many health organizations recommending against the use of LNCSBs, the existing evidence confirms the intended benefits of LNCSBs as a substitute for SSBs over the moderate term. For habitual consumers of SSBs with overweight or obesity, who are at risk for or have type 2 diabetes, and who are unable to switch to water, LNCSBs may provide a viable alternative. This finding is particularly important given that most people in the National Weight Control Registry who are successful at weight loss maintenance consume LNCSBs and report that LNCSBs help in controling caloric intake and weight loss maintenance.

There is a need for high-quality RCTs that focus on quantifying the outcome of LNCSBs using different LNCS blends as substitutes for SSBs compared with the outcome of water (the standard-of-care substitution). We await the results of the STOP Sugars NOW (Strategies to Oppose Sugars With Non-nutritive Sweeteners or Water) trial and other similar RCTs to help clarify the role of LNCSBs. Future research using a range of designs is warranted to confirm whether the intended benefits of using LNCSBs as a substitute for SSBs are durable and extend to hard clinical outcomes.

### The scientific basis of guideline recommendations on sugar intake: a systematic review [^113eTo2d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between sugar and health is affected by energy balance, macronutrient substitutions, and diet and lifestyle patterns. Several authoritative organizations have issued public health guidelines addressing dietary sugars.

Purpose

To systematically review guidelines on sugar intake and assess consistency of recommendations, methodological quality of guidelines, and the quality of evidence supporting each recommendation.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science (1995 to September 2016); guideline registries; and gray literature (bibliographies, Google, and experts).

Study Selection

Guidelines addressing sugar intake that reported their methods of development and were published in English between 1995 and 2016.

Data Extraction

Three reviewers independently assessed guideline quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, 2nd edition (AGREE II), instrument. To assess evidence quality, articles supporting recommendations were independently reviewed and their quality was determined by using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods.

Data Synthesis

The search identified 9 guidelines that offered 12 recommendations. Each of the reviewed guidelines indicated a suggested decrease in the consumption of foods containing nonintrinsic sugars. The guidelines scored poorly on AGREE II criteria, specifically in rigor of development, applicability, and editorial independence. Seven recommendations provided nonquantitative guidance; 5 recommended less than 25% to less than 5% of total calories from nonintrinsic sugars. The recommendations were based on various health concerns, including nutrient displacement, dental caries, and weight gain. Quality of evidence supporting recommendations was low to very low.

Limitation

The authors conducted the study independent of the funding source, which is primarily supported by the food and agriculture industry.

Conclusion

Guidelines on dietary sugar do not meet criteria for trustworthy recommendations and are based on low-quality evidence. Public health officials (when promulgating these recommendations) and their public audience (when considering dietary behavior) should be aware of these limitations.

### Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including meta-analyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies [^113yM7aB]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low-energy sweeteners (LES), such as acesulfame-K, aspartame, saccharin, stevia and sucralose are consumed throughout the world. The history of their use has been accompanied by debate and disagreements, not least about their potential nutritional impact. The use of LES to replace or partially replace added sugar in foods and beverages might well be expected to reduce energy intake (EI), yet over recent years there has been widely reported speculation that consumption of LES might increase the risk of becoming overweight and obese.

Studies covertly manipulating energy density show higher EI after consumption of a reduced-energy food or beverage, but that the degree of energy 'compensation' is variable. Crucially, energy compensation is usually lower than the difference in energy content of the comparison foods/beverages, seemingly being lowest of all for liquids. This suggests that consuming LES in place of sugar-sweetened products should reduce overall EI, and particularly so for consumption of beverages, the most popular vehicles for LES. The question also arises whether the presence of LES in beverages affects appetite and EI relative to plain water. Although the imprecise control of short-term energy balance predicts that LES consumption should help reduce EI and therefore reduce risk of overweight and obesity, it is possible that, as consumed in everyday life, other effects of LES balance or even outweigh the energy dilution effect. For example, a low calorie or 'diet' label may cause the consumer to eat a larger portion of the product or eat more of accompanying foods in the meal, or eat more later. More simply, adding sweetness to a product may increase intake owing to increased palatability. Or, by 'uncoupling' the relationship between sweetness and energy content, the consumption of LES may undermine the usefulness of sweetness as a cue in the control of energy balance.

Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) reduction interventions: An adolescent randomized controlled trial (RCT) assigned youth with BMI above the 25th percentile who regularly consumed at least one SSB/day to receive noncaloric beverages delivered to the home for 25 weeks; SSB intake fell by 82 percent in the intervention group with no change in controls. BMI increased in both groups with no significant between-group difference overall; however, among those above the 75th percentile at baseline, BMI decreased in the intervention group compared with an increase in controls. A cluster RCT in six primary schools in England reduced carbonated drinks by a 0.7 net servings/day with a modest decrease in overweight/obese children.

Energy intake compensation

Various studies that have examined energy intake as a primary or secondary outcome have used designs that contrast beverages and foods made with caloric sweeteners versus NNS. In a meta-analysis of weight loss studies that tested the effectiveness of aspartame in reducing energy intake, data from 12 studies were pooled to address energy intake compensation. The weighted average of energy intake compensation in the ∼24 hours that followed aspartame intake was 32% (i.e. 68% of the original energy deficit was uncompensated and was maintained through the subsequent period of intake). Of the 4 studies from the meta-analysis that used beverages alone, the compensation was just 15% for the subsequent 24 hours; that is, the data suggest there is less compensation in beverages than foods, resulting in a more effective net reduction in calories when replacing sweetened beverages with NNS beverages. The implication here is that anything < 100% compensation results in a net reduction in 24-hour energy intake.

One of the studies included in the meta-analysis involved 24 men and women who consumed 4 different beverages, each for 4 weeks, in a crossover design. Subsequent food intake was monitored. The beverages included a full caloric beverage (sucrose) versus an NNS beverage (aspartame), provided with either an orange or raspberry flavor. Data were collected at baseline and after 4 weeks of habituation. The investigators observed a significant lack of energy intake compensation over the course of the day among study participants when they were consuming the full caloric beverages relative to the NNS beverages. In another study, 21 overweight adults were assigned to consume 28% of their energy intake as sucrose, mostly as beverages. After 10 weeks, there was a significant increase in their energy intake, body weight, fat mass, and blood pressure. These effects were not observed in a similar group of 20 overweight adults who consumed NNS in place of the sucrose, but otherwise had a similar dietary intake composition in comparison with the other group. In a controlled feeding experiment that involved a preload snack containing sucrose (493 kcal), aspartame (290 kcal), or stevia (290 kcal), the energy intake of subsequent meals was similar; the energy intake for the combined preload snack and later meals combined was lower for the aspartame and stevia phases versus the sucrose phase (P = 0.01). All of these studies, therefore, observed a net reduction in energy intake for NNS use relative to the comparison condition with sucrose.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^115bsbiY]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations and future research directions

Targeted guidelines for specific types of non-sugar sweeteners and various population subgroups will enable clinicians to provide clear intake recommendations. Based on currently available research, people should be counselled to consume an overall healthy dietary pattern tailored to their needs. Simply switching sugar sweetened beverages for non-sugar sweetened beverages may result in lower energy intake in the short term, but the long term effects of this approach are unclear. Health professionals should caution patients about the possibility of inadvertently compensating for reduced sugar and energy content with other foods and beverages, and they should encourage unsweetened alternatives, such as water and foods with naturally occurring sugar, such as fruit.

In order to reduce heterogeneity among studies and provide guidance on optimal study duration, non-sugar sweetener dosage, and relevant health outcomes (table 2), international health organisations could convene experts to design and critique study protocols for future non-sugar sweetener research and support efforts to develop methods to better capture non-sugar sweetener intake. It is also important that policy makers are aware of the challenges this research might present and greater allocation of resources to undertake research on non-sugar sweeteners should be considered to support more robust and longer term trials. Greater alignment in messaging around non-sugar sweeteners should also be achieved between regulatory agencies, public health organisations, and clinicians to communicate the existing evidence and support consumers in making informed food and beverage choices.

Introduction

Growing concerns about health and quality of life have encouraged people to adapt healthy lifestyles and avoid the consumption of food rich in sugars, salt, or fat to prevent obesity and other non-communicable diseases. With increased consumer interest in reducing energy intake, food products containing non-sugar sweeteners (NSSs) rather than simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) have become increasingly popular. Replacement of sugars with NSSs bears promise of health benefits primarily by reducing the contribution of sugars to daily calorie intake and thus reducing the risk of unhealthy weight gain. However, evidence for health effects due to use of NSSs is conflicting. While some studies report an association between NSS use and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, overweight, and obesity (thus suggesting a benefit for general health and the management of diabetes), other studies suggest that NSS use could increase the risk of overweight, diabetes, and cancer. Further investigations are needed to clarify the benefits and harms of NSS consumption. Therefore, the objective of our review was to investigate the health effects of NSSs in adults and children.

Description of the exposure or intervention of interest

Most NSSs so far have been synthesised, but through research and development in food chemistry and processing, the number of natural NSS compounds is increasing.NSSs differ from sugars not only in their taste properties, but also in how the body metabolises themand how they in turn affect physiological processes.NSSs are generally sweeter than sucrose, but contain far fewer or no calories. Each sweetener is unique in its sweetness intensity, persistence of the sweet taste, coating of the teeth, and aftertaste effect.

The definitions and terminology for NSSs vary. In some cases, the term "artificial sweeteners" is used as a synonym for NSSs, in other cases as a subcategory. In this systematic review, we use the term "NSSs" as a category including both artificial sweeteners and naturally occurring non-caloric sweeteners (fig 1). The term "NSSs" is also used by the CODEX Alimentarius (part of the Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations/World Health Organization Food Standards Programme), and this review was conducted in support of guidelines being developed by WHO.

Adult overweight and obesity management — components advised by RDNs: RDNs or international equivalents should advise a comprehensive intervention including a nutritionally adequate diet with adjusted calories for weight loss or an energy-balanced diet for maintenance, behavioral strategies with self-monitoring, and appropriate physical activity. Supporting details note that calorie restriction was advised in most studies, most interventions encouraged or prescribed physical activity, and successful interventions included behavior‑modifying strategies (for example, menu planning and self‑monitoring). Determinants of successful weight maintenance included physical activity, self‑monitoring, portion control, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, and reducing sugar‑sweetened beverage.

### Nonnutritive sweetener consumption in humans: effects on appetite and food intake and their putative mechanisms [^112qMii4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) are ecologically novel chemosensory signaling compounds that influence ingestive processes and behavior. Only about 15% of the US population aged > 2 y ingest NNS, but the incidence is increasing. These sweeteners have the potential to moderate sugar and energy intakes while maintaining diet palatability, but their use has increased in concert with BMI in the population. This association may be coincidental or causal, and either mode of directionality is plausible. A critical review of the literature suggests that the addition of NNS to non-energy-yielding products may heighten appetite, but this is not observed under the more common condition in which NNS is ingested in conjunction with other energy sources. Substitution of NNS for a nutritive sweetener generally elicits incomplete energy compensation, but evidence of long-term efficacy for weight management is not available. The addition of NNS to diets poses no benefit for weight loss or reduced weight gain without energy restriction. There are long-standing and recent concerns that inclusion of NNS in the diet promotes energy intake and contributes to obesity. Most of the purported mechanisms by which this occurs are not supported by the available evidence, although some warrant further consideration. Resolution of this important issue will require long-term randomized controlled trials.

Consumer Attitudes and Rationale for Using or Avoiding NNS

Food and beverage industry publications provide some insights into consumers' rationale for NNS use. As expected, some of this use is tied to consumer efforts to decrease their intake of calories and caloric sweeteners. A 2012 survey of American adults by the International Food Information Council Foundation found that 51% of the respondents reported trying to limit sugar, 44% were trying to limit high-fructose corn syrup, and 29% were trying to limit low-calorie sweeteners. When asked to select ≥ 1 choices from a list of reasons for using NNS, 41% chose "are an option for people with diabetes", 41% chose "can reduce the calorie content of foods", 40% chose "can play a role in weight loss or weight management", 30% chose "can be part of an overall healthful diet", and 31% chose "don't know enough about them to provide an answer". Seventy-three percent of those consuming NNS reported doing so to reduce total calories consumed.

Although consumer demand for reduced-calorie and added-sugars products has resulted in a proliferation of new NNS products, American consumers have concerns about NNS, as well. In a Mintel survey conducted in a representative sample of Americans, the vast majority of survey respondents (81%) agreed with the statement, "Sugar-free foods do not taste as good as those made with real sugar" (a). The Mintel survey also found that 64% of respondents indicated they were concerned about the safety of "artificial" sweeteners (a). Survey data from the Hartman Group indicated that 44% of consumers reported they "deliberately avoid/reduce intake of artificial (flavors, sweeteners, colors or dyes)", but, when asked about specific NNS, the proportion drops to 39%, 33%, and 21% for saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose, respectively. The survey did not include other NNS. Consumers' concerns about taste and artificial ingredients may motivate food manufacturers to promote sucralose as being made from "real" sugar and stevia-derived NNS as being "natural" and made from the leaves of the stevia plant. Consumer education will need to stress that promotion of a certain NNS as "real" or "natural" does not necessarily indicate that such products are more efficacious or safer than other NNS.

### Current WHO recommendation to reduce free sugar intake from all sources to below 10% of daily energy intake for supporting overall health is not well supported by available evidence [^116QfoFA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

In all, we think the current guidelines on reducing free sugar intake to prevent weight gain and obesity are based on low-quality evidence that requires cautious interpretation by policy-makers and the general public. While some may argue that a high-sugar diet is usually more nutrient dilute, newer analyses suggest an extremely low–sugar diet (< 5% daily energy intake) may also have similar nutrient-diluting effects. This is likely because some sugar-rich foods and beverages are indeed a good source of nutrients, such as breakfast cereals. Indeed, sugar may improve the palatability of nutrient-rich foods, such as rolled oats, that are otherwise bland to consume on their own. It is quite possible that "high" sugar consumption at normal dietary doses (e.g. 25% of the daily energy intake), especially in the solid form, may not be uniquely obesogenic or harmful for health. Therefore, the public health emphasis should be on restricting the intakes of specific energy-dense, nutrient-poor high-sugar foods, such as cakes and biscuits, rather than limiting sugar intake from all foods. To date, many countries have implemented taxes on SSBs. While this has been effective in reducing SSB consumption, whether the tax is also effective in preventing obesity and cardiometabolic diseases is still questionable based on the major limitations in the current body of evidence. Also, although low-calorie artificial sweeteners provide significantly less energy than sugars and have been widely used in food products as an alternative to sugars, a number of studies have shown that these sugar substitutes could cause weight gain, cancers, and side effects, and more well-designed, large-scale human studies on the health effects of low-calorie artificial sweeteners are needed in the future.

### Is there an optimal diet for weight management and metabolic health? [^114ZuW2b]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Individuals can lose body weight and improve health status on a wide range of energy (calorie)-restricted dietary interventions. In this paper, we have reviewed the effectiveness of the most commonly utilized diets, including low-fat, low-carbohydrate, and Mediterranean approaches, in addition to commercial slimming programs, meal replacements, and newly popularized intermittent fasting diets. We also consider the role of artificial sweeteners in weight management. Low-fat diets tend to improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol the most, while lower-carbohydrate diets may preferentially improve triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, differences between diets are marginal. Weight loss improves almost all obesity-related co-morbidities and metabolic markers, regardless of the macronutrient composition of the diet, but individuals do vary in preferences and ability to adhere to different diets. Optimizing adherence is the most important factor for weight loss success, and this is enhanced by regular professional contact and supportive behavioral change programs. Maintaining weight losses in the long term remains the biggest challenge, and is undermined by an "obesogenic" environment and biological adaptations that accompany weight loss.

### Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including meta-analyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies [^113oekCp]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Both short-term and sustained intervention studies in humans show LES consumption reduces ad libitum EI. However, possibly for several reasons, short-term studies may underestimate the degree of energy compensation that occurs in response to energy dilution. This is consistent with the finding that BW differences observed in sustained intervention studies are often much smaller that would be the case if no compensation had occurred. Nonetheless, sustained studies repeatedly find effects in favour of LES consumption reducing BW relative to sugar consumption, showing that compensation is incomplete. Of course, the same argument and many of the same data are used in making the case that consumption of sugar-sweetened products, and particularly sugar-sweetened-beverages, increase risk of overweight and obesity.

### Nonnutritive sweeteners: current use and health perspectives: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American diabetes association [^1175tkiJ]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Recommendations

At this time, there are insufficient data to determine conclusively whether the use of NNS to displace caloric sweeteners in beverages and foods reduces added sugars or carbohydrate intakes, or benefits appetite, energy balance, body weight, or cardiometabolic risk factors. Limiting added sugars is an important strategy for supporting optimal nutrition and healthy weights, as concluded in the 2009 American Heart Association scientific statement "Dietary Sugars Intake and Cardiovascular Health". Monitoring carbohydrate intake, which includes limiting added sugars, is also a key strategy to achieve glycemic control as published in the American Diabetes Association clinical practice recommendations. There are some data to suggest that NNS may be used in a structured diet to replace sources of added sugars and that this substitution may result in modest energy intake reductions and weight loss. Successful reduction in energy intake requires that there is incomplete compensation of energy reduction from the use of NNS-containing beverages and/or foods. The impact of incorporating NNS and NNS-containing beverages and foods on overall diet quality should be included in assessing the overall balance of benefits and risks. Apparent from the available literature is the paucity of data from well-designed human trials exploring the potential role of NNS in achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight and minimizing cardiometabolic risk factors.

The evidence reviewed suggests that when used judiciously, NNS could facilitate reductions in added sugars intake, thereby resulting in decreased total energy and weight loss/weight control, and promoting beneficial effects on related metabolic parameters. However, these potential benefits will not be fully realized if there is a compensatory increase in energy intake from other sources.

### Use of artificial sweeteners and fat-modified foods in weight loss maintainers and always-normal weight individuals [^113XLYFp]. International Journal of Obesity (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the dietary strategies, and use of fat- and sugar-modified foods and beverages in a weight loss maintainer group (WLM) and an always-normal weight group (NW).

Subjects

WLM (N = 172) had maintained ≥ 10% weight loss for 11.5 years, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 22.0 kg m(-2). NW (N = 131) had a BMI of 21.3 kg m(-2) and no history of being overweight. Three, 24-h recalls on random, non-consecutive days were used to assess dietary intake.

Results

WLM reported consuming a diet that was lower in fat (28.7 vs 32.6%, P < 0.0001) and used more fat-modification strategies than NW. WLM also consumed a significantly greater percentage of modified dairy (60 vs 49%; P = 0.002) and modified dressings and sauces (55 vs 44%; P = 0.006) than NW. WLM reported consuming three times more daily servings of artificially sweetened soft drinks (0.91 vs 0.37; P = 0.003), significantly fewer daily servings of sugar-sweetened soft drinks (0.07 vs 0.16; P = 0.03) and more daily servings of water (4.72 vs 3.48; P = 0.002) than NW.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that WLM use more dietary strategies to accomplish their weight loss maintenance, including greater restriction on fat intake, use of fat- and sugar-modified foods, reduced consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and increased consumption of artificially sweetened beverages. Ways to promote the use of fat-modified foods and artificial sweeteners merits further research in both prevention- and treatment-controlled trials.

### Does low-energy sweetener consumption affect energy intake and body weight? A systematic review, including meta-analyses, of the evidence from human and animal studies [^112QeiYo]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Commentary

Although these sustained intervention studies vary in design and quality, and several were not primarily intended to test effects of consumption of LES, the results are nevertheless consistent. In all cases, the use of LES led to a relative reduction in EI, and greater loss (or reduced gain) of BW. Notably, there was no example of a sustained exposure intervention trial where LES use led to a relative increase in mean EI or BW. This was supported quantitatively by the results of the meta-analyses of BW change, indicating lower relative BWs in LES intervention arms. Furthermore, outcomes were similar in studies with children and adults, and followed a similar pattern whether participants were blinded or not blinded to the intervention. Consumption of LES-sweetened beverages also reduced BW relative to consumption of water.

In addition to the studies meeting the criteria for inclusion here, there are also studies in adults and children where LES were a component of a mixed or more complex diet or lifestyle manipulation. Although these other studies provide only indirect evidence, their results were consistent with the 'pure' LES interventions; that is, treatments that included LES were associated with reductions or no change in EI or BW. No example was found where an intervention specifically including LES led to a relative increase in EI or BW.

Taken at face value, these results show that consumption of LES compared with sugar leads to either no change or a relative reduction in EI and energy balance. More unexpectedly, however, LES also led to reductions in BW relative to water. There are, however, some possible limitations to this evidence base to consider.

### Nonsugar sweeteners-time for transparency and caution… [^115Cmqjr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Given the unfavorable health consequences of excess added sugar intake, manufacturers have responded to policies, as well as consumer demand for lower sugar products, by using NSS to replace added sugars. Difficulties in estimating NSS intake have also contributed to uncertainty and concern about their health effects among children. 1, 4, 5 Although short-term randomized clinical trials in adults suggest NSS use may lead to lower energy and sugar intake and lower body weight, 6 evidence from long-term prospective cohort studies report associations between consumption of NSS-containing beverages and obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. 7 Although findings of observational studies are limited by residual confounding and reverse causality, recent RCTs in adults provide evidence for plausible biological mechanisms and demonstrate that NSSs are not metabolically inert.

Rather, prolonged intake of NSS in adults results in glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and alterations in gut microbiota. Another consideration is that although replacing added sugar with NSSs reduces sugar and calories, the sweetness of the product is maintained. Sweetness increases product palatability, which is a well-documented driver of food purchases and energy intake. Meanwhile, products containing NSSs often also contain excessive amounts of nutrients of public health concern, such as added sugars, saturated fats, sodium and other additives. It is, therefore, unclear if natural NSSs are favorable relative to artificial NSSs such as aspartame, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium. Given that mechanisms underlying NSS-induced effects on metabolic outcomes are not fully elucidated, the term natural should not be equated with healthy.

For example, activation of sweet taste receptors throughout the body may contribute to effects of all NSSs — plant-derived or otherwise — on metabolic outcomes such as glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The conditional nature of the recent WHO guideline, and the outcomes of the IARC and JECFA reviews of aspartame, further underscore the need for more evidence surrounding the role of NSSs in diet, weight, and health and the necessity of assessing NSS exposure to inform definitive guidance. Importantly, the WHO recommendation not to consume NSSs for weight management does not imply that NSSs are necessarily harmful.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^112WSJvP]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In one cohort study, researchers assessed different levels of NSS intake and reported that weight gain was 0.09 kg lower in women consuming up to 5.8 g saccharin per day compared with women consuming more than 5.8 g saccharin per day (95% confidence interval −0.13 to −0.05; one study, outcome assessed in n = 17 934, very low certainty of evidence). Two randomised controlled trialsinvestigated the effect of NSS intake in overweight populations trying to lose weight, although they did not provide enough data to conduct meta-analysis (standard error or standard deviation not reported). One studyshowed no difference in body weight between the study groups (mean difference 0.10 kg, 95% confidence interval −0.31 to 0.11; n = 163, low certainty of evidence). The other studyshowed no significant differences between the study groups with regard to reduction in body weight, body mass index, or body fat.

Diabetes or glycaemic control

In two randomised controlled trials, levels of fasting blood glucose were 0.16 mmol/L lower in the groups receiving aspartame or a combination of NSSs than in groups receiving sugar (95% confidence interval −0.26 to −0.06; two studies, n = 52, very low certainty of evidence). However, no differences were observed in plasma insulin levels (mean difference −1.60 pmol/L, 95% confidence interval −8.39 to 5.19; two, n = 52) or in insulin resistance and β cell function as measured by the homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; −0.14, −0.38 to 0.10; two, n = 66, very low certainty of evidence). Additional markers for diabetes were reported by single studies only (supplementary material file 1, table 2).

### Non-nutritive sweetened beverages versus water after a 52-week weight management programme: a randomised controlled trial [^113BJdeD]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Sugar-sweetened beverages are a substantial source of dietary sugar that can contribute to weight gain and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Dietary guidelines recommend non-nutritive sweetened (NNS) beverages to reduce sugar consumption, however, there is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials on their use. We aimed to compare the effects of NNS beverages and water on body weight during weight loss and maintenance in a behavioural weight management programme.

Methods

In this parallel-group, open-label, controlled equivalence trial, adults with a BMI of 27–35kg/m 2 who regularly consumed cold beverages were randomised 1:1 to water or NNS beverages. Participants underwent a group behavioural weight management programme comprising weekly (during the 12-week weight-loss phase) then monthly (during the 40-week weight-maintenance phase) meetings. The primary endpoint was weight change at week 52 (equivalence: two-sided P > 0.05). Secondary endpoints included changes in anthropometrics, cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite and activity levels.

Results

Of 493 participants randomised (water: n = 246; NNS beverages: n = 247), 24.1% were NNS-naïve. At week 52, water and NNS beverages were non-equivalent, with significantly greater weight loss in the NNS beverages group. Participants consuming water maintained a weight loss of 6.1kg over 52 weeks versus 7.5kg with NNS beverages (difference [90% CI]: 1.4kg [-2.6, -0.2]; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

During a 52-week behavioural weight management programme, water and NNS beverages were non-equivalent, with weight loss maintained to a statistically greater extent with NNS beverages compared with water. However, this difference was not clinically significant.

Clinical Trial Registration

This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02591134.

### WHO warns against artificial sugars for weight loss… [^115Guvjy]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

A new guideline from the World Health Organization recommends avoiding nonsugar sweeteners, such as aspartame, sucralose, and stevia, to reduce body weight and lower the risk of diet-related diseases. There is little evidence that nonsugar sweeteners decrease body fat long-term and some proof that they are linked with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality in adults, according to results from the WHO's 2022 analysis of 283 studies.

Body weight

Two randomised controlled trialsfound a similar weight gain in children receiving sucralose and acesulfame Kor aspartameand children receiving sucrose (mean difference −0.60 kg, 95% confidence interval −1.33 to 0.14; two studies, n = 467, low certainty of evidence; fig 7). After exclusion of the oldest age group (13–21 years) from one studyin a sensitivity analysis, we saw no difference in effect (−0.50 kg, −1.43 to 0.42; two, n = 722). Two randomised controlled trialsreported a significantly smaller increase in body mass index z score in children receiving sucralose and acesulfame Kor sucralose alone, compared with children receiving sucrose (−0.15, −0.17 to −0.12; n = 528, moderate certainty of evidence).

Fig 7
Effect of non-sugar sweetener intake on weight change (kg) in children

One randomised controlled trial(n = 641) reported no group differences in body fat measured by electrical impedance (mean difference −0.83% body fat, 95% confidence interval −2.12% to 0.46%), waist circumference (−0.50 cm, −1.73 to 0.73), skinfold thickness (−1.5 mm, −4.71 to 1.71), and waist-to-height ratio (−0.50%, −1.73 to 0.73). In one randomised controlled trial including overweight or obese children involved in a weight loss programme, researchers reported a lower weight gain in children receiving aspartame than in children receiving placebo (−0.75 kg, −1.08 to −0.43; one study, n = 57, low certainty of evidence).

Dental health

In one non-randomised controlled trial, mouth rinses with chlorhexidine were more effective than stevioside in decreasing plaque volume. Plaque volume was similar in the groups using water or stevioside (low certainty of evidence).

### Intense sweeteners, energy intake and the control of body weight [^114AxSbx]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Replacing sugar with low-calorie sweeteners is a common strategy for facilitating weight control. By providing sweet taste without calories, intense sweeteners help lower energy density of beverages and some foods. Reduced dietary energy density should result in lower energy intakes — but are the energy reduction goals, in fact, achieved? The uncoupling of sweetness and energy, afforded by intense sweeteners, has been the focus of numerous studies over the past two decades. There are recurring arguments that intense sweeteners increase appetite for sweet foods, promote overeating, and may even lead to weight gain. Does reducing energy density of sweet beverages and foods have a measurable impact on appetite and energy intakes, as examined both in short-term studies and over a longer period? Can reductions in dietary energy density achieved with intense sweeteners really affect body weight control? This paper reviews evidence from laboratory, clinical and epidemiological studies in the context of current research on energy density, satiety and the control of food intake.

Kidney disease

In randomised controlled trials, no differences were observed in concentrations of creatinine (an intermediate marker for kidney disease) between NSS intake and no intake in overweight children involved in weight loss studies (mean difference 0.002 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval −0.001 to 0.005; one, n = 49, very low certainty of evidence). Similarly, no corresponding difference was seen in children of healthy weight (0.003, −0.012 to 0.018; one, n = 126 at baseline, very low certainty of evidence). However, after exclusion of the oldest age group (13–21 years) in a sensitivity analysis, creatinine decreased more strongly in the sucrose group (0.011, 0.004 to 0.018; n = 80).

Other outcomes

In one non-randomised controlled trial, we found no difference in effect between children receiving NSSs and those not receiving NSSs on self rated mood states (very low certainty of evidence), behaviour (very low certainty of evidence), and cognitive performance (low certainty of evidence). One randomised controlled trialdescribed significantly worse neurocognitional performance in tests of cognitive abilities in children receiving NSSs than in children receiving sugar (n = 386). Another randomised controlled trial reported no difference in the occurrence of adverse events between children receiving NSSs and children not receiving NSSs (risk ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.91; n = 126, low certainty of evidence). However, in one randomised controlled trial, a higher risk of adverse effects in overweight children involved in active weight loss not receiving NSSs versus those receiving NSSs was observed (incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.79; n = 55, low certainty of evidence). Overall, 103 adverse effects were noted in the intervention group and 113 in the control group. We identified no studies investigating the effect of NSS intake on incidence of asthma or allergies.

### Nonnutritive sweeteners: current use and health perspectives: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American diabetes association [^116t2eGU]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

A separate publication based on only the HPFS population focused specifically on sugar-sweetened beverage versus artificially sweetened beverage (ASB) intake and provides important insights into the opportunities and limitations of the perspective offered by prospective observational studies. Cumulative averages of intake were determined by FFQs administered every 4 years for 20 years, starting in 1986, and the main outcome of interest in this publication was incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. At the start of the study, in 1986, participants were asked to report any weight change in the preceding 5 years, between 1981 and 1986. The weight change data were presented separately for those who reported losing weight (14%–18% of the population, depending on the specific quartile of ASB intake [L. de Koning, personal communication, 2011]) and those who reported gaining weight (45%–51% of the population, depending on the specific quartile of ASB intake) in that time frame; the remainder reported no weight change. Among those who lost weight, there was a significant trend of greater weight lost for higher versus lower ASB intake quartiles (0.9 ± 0.2 versus 0.5 ± 0.5 kg, means ± SD, respectively, for the highest versus lowest quartile). Among those who gained weight, there was a significant trend of greater weight gained for higher versus lower ASB intake quartiles (2.6 ± 4.6 versus 1.8 ± 3.4 kg, respectively). This may appear contradictory; how could greater intake be associated with both greater weight loss and greater weight gain? However, this suggests there may be importantly different subsets of the population: one that successfully uses ASB for weight control and another that does not. On the other hand, the different time frames of the weight change data versus ASB intake data must also be considered; the 1981 to 1986 weight change preceded the 1986 to 2006 cumulative average ASB intake reported in the article; from a chronological perspective it is the weight change that is predicting ASB consumption, rather than vice versa (i.e. weight gain may predict subsequent increased ASB consumption). Three additional findings presented in this study further highlight the complexities involved: the following trends for baseline characteristics for the full study population, regardless of 1981 to 1986 weight change, were all statistically significantly related to ASB intake; diet quality as assessed by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index was higher, total energy intake was lower, and BMI was higher for those consuming greater amounts of ASB. Overall, the data from this study suggest there may be important subsets of the population that incorporate NNS products into their diet with different objectives or with differential success, and that there is likely substantial confounding in these types of analyses given the many dietary and health variables that correlate with NNS intake.

### Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^112jaw2n]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Sugar intake and sweet preference — The pooled effect from three randomised controlled trialsshowed that daily sugar intake was 89.71 g lower in adults receiving NSSs than in those receiving sugar (95% confidence interval −127.63 to −51.80; three studies, n = 135, very low certainty of evidence; fig 5). All three studies included overweight or obese participants. Both studies by Reidmeasured sugar intake by including the sucrose from the control intervention in their outcome measure. Data from two non-randomised controlled trialsand one cross sectional studyshowed no differences in sugar intake between the intervention and control groups.

Effect of non-sugar sweetener intake on daily sugar intake (g) in adults

Two randomised controlled trialsinvestigated the effect of NSSs on preference for sweet taste or sugar intake in overweight populations trying to lose weight. The preference for sweet taste, as assessed by desire for sweets (measured on a 0–10 scale with higher values indicating increased desire), was slightly lower in the group receiving NSSs than in the group not receiving NSSs (mean difference −0.2, 95% confidence interval −0.34 to −0.06; one study, n = 186, moderate certainty of evidence). Sugar intake was similar between the groups after three years of follow-up (−0.00 g, −0.18 to 0.18; one, n = 186).

By reducing energy density, low-energy sweeteners (LES) might be expected to reduce energy intake (EI) and body weight (BW). To assess the totality of the evidence testing the null hypothesis that LES exposure (versus sugars or unsweetened alternatives) has no effect on EI or BW, we conducted a systematic review of relevant studies in animals and humans consuming LES with ad libitum access to food energy. In 62 of 90 animal studies exposure to LES did not affect or decreased BW. Of 28 reporting increased BW, 19 compared LES with glucose exposure using a specific 'learning' paradigm. Twelve prospective cohort studies in humans reported inconsistent associations between LES use and body mass index (−0.002 kg m − 2 per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.009 to 0.005). Meta-analysis of short-term randomized controlled trials (129 comparisons) showed reduced total EI for LES versus sugar-sweetened food or beverage consumption before an ad libitum meal (−94 kcal, 95% CI −122 to −66), with no difference versus water (−2 kcal, 95% CI −30 to 26). This was consistent with EI results from sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (10 comparisons). Meta-analysis of sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (4 weeks to 40 months) showed that consumption of LES versus sugar led to relatively reduced BW (nine comparisons; −1.35 kg, 95% CI –2.28 to −0.42), and a similar relative reduction in BW versus water (three comparisons; −1.24 kg, 95% CI –2.22 to −0.26). Most animal studies did not mimic LES consumption by humans, and reverse causation may influence the results of prospective cohort studies. The preponderance of evidence from all human randomized controlled trials indicates that LES do not increase EI or BW, whether compared with caloric or non-caloric (for example, water) control conditions. Overall, the balance of evidence indicates that use of LES in place of sugar, in children and adults, leads to reduced EI and BW, and possibly also when compared with water.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^117MX9F6]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Challenges of research into sweeteners

Uncertainty regarding the health effects of non-sugar sweeteners in the general population is attributable to several aspects. Key factors include grouping non-sugar sweeteners as a single entity rather than individual chemical compounds or using low calorie soft drinks as a proxy for non-sugar sweetener intake; limited experimental research conducted in humans; discrepancies in the outcomes and findings of observational and randomised controlled trials; differences in the type, dose, and routes of non-sugar sweetener intake; inherent limitations of observational studies; and the use of study designs that are unable to attribute findings specifically to non-sugar sweetener intake (table 1).

Table 1
Limitations of current non-sugar sweetener research methodology and interpretation

Specific to study designs, there are notable differences in observational and randomised controlled trials on non-sugar sweeteners.

Observational studies are useful as they may include many subpopulation groups, have large sample sizes, include free living participants or real world settings, and have the ability to have long term follow-up. Observational research on non-sugar sweeteners comes with unique challenges, however, such as difficulty ascertaining accurate data on non-sugar sweetener intake; non-sugar sweeteners being typically assessed as a group rather than examined as individual compounds; use of inconsistent methods of identifying and classifying consumers of non-sugar sweeteners; challenges determining causality, with the possibility of reverse causality and residual confounding; and reverse causality occurring because people with obesity tend to consume non-sugar sweeteners and are disposed to an increased risk of developing metabolic disorders.

Randomised controlled trials and interventions, when compared with observational research, are able to isolate effects of non-sugar sweetener intake while controlling for confounding factors, they can determine causality, and they have the ability to examine the impact of specific types of non-sugar sweeteners on various health outcomes. Challenges of randomised controlled trials include small sample sizes; relatively short term follow-up; ability to examine only specific populations; ethical challenges of conducting non-sugar sweetener research in some populations, such as pregnant and lactating women and young children; varying study designs causing difficulty with interpreting findings and developing conclusive recommendations; and the potential for contamination of control groups, increased attrition rate with longer studies, residual effects between interventions with crossover designs, and the high costs of conducting adequately powered, well designed studies.

### Effect of replacing sucrose in beverages with nonnutritive sweetener sucralose on cardiometabolic risk factors among Asian Indian adults with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week randomized controlled trial [^116zu4x2]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present short-term study, in Asian Indian adults with T2D, replacing added sucrose in coffee and tea with NNS sucralose showed no change in the primary outcome — HbA1c. However, small decreases were observed in body weight, BMI, and waist circumference. The small reduction in calories derived from refined carbohydrates (about 60 kcal) helped to reduce daily total calorie and carbohydrate intake which supports the recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendation. The results are consistent with previous RCTs which had demonstrated that sucralose consumption had no impact on glycemic parameters including plasma glucose levels, HbA1c, plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), or gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) levels. A meta-analysis of 29 RCTs, including a total of 741 participants, examined the glycemic impact of four NNSs, namely saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, and stevia, of which sucralose and aspartame emerged as two of the most extensively used NNSs. That study also reported that the consumption of NNSs did not result in a change in blood glucose.

Our study shows a small improvement in body weight, waist circumference, and BMI over 12 weeks of study. It has been shown that even a subtle imbalance of energy intake and energy expenditure of 1–2% (25–50 kcal) per day could lead to considerable weight gain of 1.3–2.7 kg per year. This underscores that small but consistent efforts in reducing sugar intake can have a cumulative and positive impact on body weight over time, albeit small. This supports the model proposed by Hall et al. that, for an overweight adult, an average reduction of approximately 24 kcal per day will result in an approximate 0.5 kg weight loss in about 1 year. Most RCTs on NNS and weight loss have been reported among overweight/obese individuals and our study is one of the first to show similar weight loss in adults with T2D. The present study highlights the importance of even such small reductions in daily calories derived from sugar. The changes in anthropometric measures in our study were admittedly small, and therefore is hypothesis-generating. Sustaining the intervention over a longer time might provide more meaningful healthy clinical outcomes like sustained weight loss or, at the very least, prevent weight gain over time by eliminating empty calories from sugars.

Sustained (> 1 day) intervention studies/RCTs

Study selection and data extraction and analysis

All studies with a LES exposure period of > 1 day were classified as 'sustained' interventions. Studies were included only if (1) there was an explicit instruction or requirement to consume LES-sweetened foods or beverages as an alternative to or substitute for consumption of sugar-sweetened products, water or habitual diet (the comparison treatment); (2) participants had ad libitum access to (other) dietary energy sources; and (3) reported end points included EI and/or anthropometric measures. Studies furthermore had to have a parallel or balanced-ordered cross-over design with healthy participants (regardless of BW), who were either uninformed or correctly informed of the manipulation (not deceived). A study duration of ⩾4 weeks was applied as a further criterion for inclusion in a meta-analysis of LES effects on BW. As BW is the more reliable indicator of sustained effects on energy balance, no meta-analysis was undertaken for EI. Assessments of risk of bias and methodological quality were also undertaken for these studies.

Results

Energy intake

There were nine studies comprising 10 comparisons and 1102 participants that reported EI results. In all except one studythe participants were adults, and all but four of the studies, specifically recruited overweight or obese participants. In two studies, the research was undertaken in the context of a weight loss programme. The duration of exposures was 10 days to > 1 year. For all treatment comparisons (LES vs directly relevant controls) in all studies, the LES group had the lowest absolute values for total or change in EI, compared with either sugar or water (Supplementary Table S14). The magnitude of the difference in intakes reported for LES vs non-LES interventions ranged from −75 to −514 kcal per day for comparisons with sugar, and −126 kcal per day in the single comparison with water.

In three comparisons with 318 participants, the difference in total EI was reported or determined to be statistically significant. In three comparisons with 293 participants the difference was not reported as statistically significant. In the remaining comparisons a direct test of statistical significance was not reported and could not be determined.

Uncertainty because of limited research pervades recommendations

Uncertainty surrounding the role of non-sugar sweeteners in weight management and chronic disease is also highlighted in other recommendations. For example, the dietary guidelines for Americans (DGA) 2020–2025 suggest using non-sugar sweeteners to replace caloric sweeteners, but state that long term use is discouraged, despite minimal research to support this recommendation. The 2020 scientific report of the DGA committee, which informs DGA, included only one study that examined specific types of non-sugar sweeteners. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2023 standards of care in diabetes state that products with non-sugar sweeteners may be an acceptable alternative to sugar sweetened products when consumed in moderation, and indicate that non-sugar sweeteners do not seem to significantly affect glycaemic control, although their impact on weight management is unclear. The ADA recommendations are, however, also based on research that did not examine all types of non-sugar sweeteners (for example, there were no studies on acesulfame potassium, which is widely found in foods and beverages).

The American Heart Association and ADA 2012 joint statement said that there is no clear conclusion regarding the effects of non-sugar sweeteners on appetite, energy intake, body weight, cardiometabolic risk factors, or the reduction of added sugars, and highlights the need for research that examines individual types of non-sugar sweeteners and specific population groups. Finally, while the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics practice guidelines for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (2017) tackled individual types of non-sugar sweeteners for managing glycaemia in adults with diabetes, a stated limitation was the minimal number of long term studies to inform findings. The report concluded that adults with diabetes should be informed that intake of aspartame, sucralose, and steviol glycosides, within the ADI levels, will not have a significant influence on glycaemic control; yet, no studies were included that examined saccharin, acesulfame potassium, and neotame intake on glycaemic outcomes in this population.

Sugar-sweetened beverage reduction — adolescent RCT and school-based cluster RCT — assigned adolescents with BMI above the 25th percentile who consumed at least one sugar-sweetened beverage per day to receive noncaloric beverages free of charge for 25 weeks, reducing intake by 82 percent in the intervention group with no change in controls; BMI increased in both groups overall, but among those above the 75th percentile at baseline there was a significant decrease in BMI compared with an increase in controls. In six primary schools in England, carbonated drinks were reduced by a 0.7 net servings/day with a modest decrease in overweight/obese children.

Eating behaviour

Energy intake and appetite — Pooled data from four randomised controlled trials(n = 318 at baseline) showed that mean daily energy intake was 1064.73 kJ lower in people receiving NSSs than in those receiving sugar (95% confidence interval −1867.03 to −262.44; four studies, n = 278, very low certainty of evidence; fig 4). Subgroup analysis by study duration and type of sweetener used as the intervention indicated that this result was largely being driven by one study that lasted for 10 weeks and used a combination of aspartame, cyclamate, acesulfame K, and saccharin (mean difference −2597.00, 95% confidence interval −3125.35 to −2068.65; n = 42). Studies of short duration (lasting four weeks) using aspartame as the intervention did not show a significant reduction (−598.94, 95% confidence interval −1445.24 to 247.36; three studies, n = 276). In one randomised controlled trial, researchers reported narratively (that is, without numerical data) that there were no significant differences in energy intake between the stevia and placebo groups. Data from two non-randomised controlled trials(n = 22) suggested no difference between the intervention and control groups for energy intake.

Effect of non-sugar sweetener intake on daily energy intake (kJ) by study duration (4 or 10 weeks)

One randomised controlled trialinvestigated the effect of NSSs on energy intake in overweight populations trying to lose weight. In this study, mean daily energy intake was reported to be 548 kJ lower in the group receiving NSSs than in the group avoiding NSSs (95% confidence interval −692.73 to −403.27; n = 128). In addition, no significant differences were observed for self control with respect to eating (mean difference −0.20, 95% confidence interval −1.03 to 0.63; n = 186, low certainty of evidence) or feelings of hunger (−0.20, −1.03 to 0.63; n = 186, low certainty of evidence). In another randomised controlled trial, researchers reported narratively that self reported appetite remained the same in groups receiving NSSs as well as those receiving no intervention over the study period of 12 weeks.

Considerations for interpreting the WHO guideline

While the guideline took a cautious approach in recommending against non-sugar sweeteners because of the overall contradictory evidence and possible long term unfavourable health effects of their consumption, it acknowledges that shorter term randomised controlled trials showed improvements in body weight and reductions in energy intake with non-sugar sweetener consumption. Meanwhile, observational studies demonstrated long term detrimental impacts of consuming non-sugar sweeteners, including increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. The guideline relies largely on observational studies rather than randomised controlled trials — however, while observational studies provide information on long term health outcomes they are inherently limited by reverse causality and residual confounding and cannot be used to infer causality.

A stated limitation of the WHO guideline was the inability to assess health impacts of different types of non-sugar sweeteners because of a lack of available research. Because non-sugar sweeteners are heterogeneous compounds (for example, sucralose, aspartame, or saccharin) that may affect different metabolic pathways and have diverse impacts on health (fig 1), it is important to consider individual types and specific combinations of sweeteners (such as sucralose and acesulfame potassium together) when developing recommendations. This is not currently feasible, however, because few studies have examined and compared effects of individual types of non-sugar sweeteners. For example, only four randomised controlled trials included in the WHO report examined individual types of non-sugar sweeteners, and subgroup analyses for different types of sweeteners were not conducted for glycaemic control or lipid outcomes. In subgroup analyses for other health outcomes (such as body weight, body mass index, and energy intake) no significant differences were observed across types of non-sugar sweeteners. Studies that compared all types of non-sugar sweeteners were, however, not available. The WHO guideline noted that although non-sugar sweeteners are different chemical entities, they could have similar impacts on health because of their high intensity sweetness and activation of sweet taste receptors. However, other mechanisms of affecting health could vary.

Types of sweeteners of interest in context

The range of NSSs approved in different countries varies. In the United States, for example, the Food and Drug Administration has approved six NSSs for consumption, whereas the range of currently approved NSSs in the European Union is wider (eg, including cyclamate). In general, current evidence supports the safety of several NSSs to be used in foods. Recognised regulatory bodies have established acceptable daily intakes based on various safety studies. Other NSSs are currently declared as unsafe or have not yet been assessed.

Although many of the NSSs currently being used in foods have been declared safe for consumption at levels below the respective acceptable daily intakes, less is known regarding potential benefits and harms of NSSs within this range of intake, beacuse evidence from studies and reviews is often limited and conflicting. WHO is developing guidance on the use of NSSs by adults and children based on the evidence generated by this systematic review. Following the guidance of the WHO Nutrition Guidance Expert Advisory Group Subgroup on Diet and Health, this review seeks to comprehensively assess the association between commonly consumed NSSs and health by looking at the following research questions:

In a general adult population, what are the effects of NSS consumption versus no consumption on relevant health outcomes?
In a general adult population, what are the effects of higher versus lower NSS doses and more frequent versus less frequent NSS consumption on relevant health outcomes?
In an overweight or obese adult population with explicit intentional weight loss, what are the effects of NSS consumption versus no consumption on relevant health outcomes?
In a general child population, what are the effects of NSS consumption versus no consumption on relevant outcomes?
In a general child population, what are the effects of higher versus lower NSS doses and more frequent versus less frequent NSSs consumption on relevant here outcomes?
In a population of overweight and obese children with explicit intentional weight loss, what are the effects of NSS consumption versus no consumption on relevant outcomes?

### A systematic review on the effect of sweeteners on glycemic response and clinically relevant outcomes [^114ojnjF]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Although the identified trials were numerous, they were very small and largely short-term. We found 13 trials with participant follow-up longer than 1 week and group sizes ≥ 10: 3 that compared non-caloric sweeteners to sucrose, and 10 that were head-to-head comparisons of saccharides. Ten of 13 trials had a Jadad score of 1 and none adequately concealed treatment assignment prior to assignment. Although blinding the participants would have been impossible in many of the trials due to taste differences between sweeteners, the reporting of important design descriptors were largely absent, indicating a substantial risk for bias. The longest trial was only 10 weeks - not long enough to determine whether substituting a non-caloric sweetener for a caloric sweetener is sustainable in daily practice. To detect an important reduction in weight over at least one year such as 2.5 kg/m 2 (less than 0.05 kg/m 2 /week) in a RCT would require a minimum of 85 participants (assumptions: 25% loss-to-follow-up, α = 0.05, power = 90%, SD = 3 kg/m 2).

Our network meta-analysis had several limitations: 1) the sugar alcohol and other sugar categories contained multiple sweeteners that are likely to have different blood glucose profiles thereby inducing heterogeneity, 2) power to detect inconsistency is limited by the number of trials included in each test, and 3) the back-calculation method used to detect inconsistency involved multiple tests thereby increasing the false-positive rate. However, we did not detect any inconsistency.

Another limitation was that only three studies restricted the total energy consumed by each participant. Therefore, participants may have supplemented energy lost with non-caloric sweeteners with other food products - sweetened or otherwise. However, it may be argued that this is a strength of the trials - in that they reflect what happens in real world self-management diet practices. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, all studies were small, thereby underestimating standard deviation and as a result underestimating confidence interval widths and increasing the likelihood of false-positive findings. Despite this, the confidence intervals for many analyses were wide and did not exclude a minimally important difference. Small study bias (or publication bias) may also play a role in our findings concerning longer-term outcomes.

### Sweeteners approved as food… [^111kSUsH]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Whether it's to cut down on the number of calories they consume or any of a variety of other reasons, some people choose sweeteners other than sugar. Sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and stevia-derived substances, for example, are widely used ingredients in foods and beverages marketed as "sugar-free" or "diet. " Some of the products also are available for use at home for baking or cooking or to sweeten coffee, tea, or other beverages. You may have heard these sweeteners called sugar substitutes. Some sweeteners are made to be many times sweeter than sugar, so you don't need to use much. That means sweeteners, unlike sugar, honey, or molasses, add few or no calories to the foods and beverages they flavor. Also, sweeteners generally do not raise blood sugar levels. Foods containing aspartame must include a statement to inform people with PKU that the product contains phenylalanine. For more information, please see, Aspartame and Other Sweeteners in Food.
- Certain steviol glycosides from the stevia plant. Brand names are Truvia®, PureVia®, Enliten®.
- Extracts from monk fruit. Brand names are Nectresse®, Monk Fruit in the Raw®, PureLo®.
- Thaumatin, proteins isolated from the West African Katemfe fruit. Brand name is Talin®. Sugar Alcohols Sugar alcohols are another type of sweetener. Sugar alcohols are as sweet, or less sweet, than sugar and are slightly lower in calories. Sugar alcohols are carbohydrates that are like sugar and alcohol. Sugar alcohols do not promote tooth decay or cause a sudden increase in blood glucose. They are used primarily in sugar-free candies, cookies, and chewing gums. Examples include sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, erythritol, and maltitol.

Sugars That Are Metabolized Differently Than Traditional Sugars Other ingredients you may find on the food label are sugars that are metabolized differently than traditional sugars like sucrose. While these sugars meet the chemical definition of a sugar, they are used by the body differently than traditional sugars. D-allulose, D-tagatose, and isomaltulose are generally recognized as safe.
