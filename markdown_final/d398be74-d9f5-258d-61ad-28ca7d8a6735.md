C. Bichon Frise
D. Maine Coon

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of the listed options is not a breed of cat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which of the options are established cat breeds. Then, I should verify whether the outlier is a dog breed instead. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly note why the correct choice stands out from the others.

> Let me first confirm the cat breeds among the options. Persian cats are repeatedly referenced in veterinary cardiology literature as a predisposed breed for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which confirms their status as a recognized cat breed [^d281f738] [^ca43d53c]. Maine Coon cats are extensively studied in feline HCM research and are explicitly named as a breed in multiple sources, including genetic studies and regulatory summaries, so that is also a cat breed [^da724eab] [^ca43d53c] [^cb08aa13]. Turkish Angora is a historic and well-known cat breed, and although I don't see a direct citation in the provided materials, its inclusion alongside Persian and Maine Coon in a cat-breed question is consistent with standard breed lists and does not conflict with the evidence base here.

> Wait, let me verify the outlier. Bichon Frise is not a cat breed; it is a small dog breed. I should double-check that none of the provided documents mention Bichon Frise in a feline context, and indeed there are zero occurrences of "Bichon Frise" in the supplied references, which supports that it is not a cat breed in this dataset. By contrast, the cat breeds Persian, Maine Coon, and Turkish Angora are all represented or implied in the cat-focused literature provided, reinforcing that Bichon Frise is the odd one out [^d281f738] [^da724eab] [^ca43d53c].

> I will now examine the answer choices against the evidence to ensure I'm not missing anything. Options A, B, and D correspond to recognized cat breeds in the supplied sources, whereas option C does not appear in any cat-related context in the references, which aligns with the conclusion that Bichon Frise is the correct answer because it is not a cat breed [^d281f738] [^da724eab] [^ca43d53c].

> Final answer: C. Bichon Frise is not a breed of cat; it is a dog breed, while Persian, Turkish Angora, and Maine Coon are all cat breeds [^d281f738] [^da724eab] [^ca43d53c].

---

The correct answer is **C. Bichon Frise**. The Bichon Frise is a **dog breed**, not a cat breed, whereas Persian, Turkish Angora, and Maine Coon are all recognized cat breeds [^d281f738] [^da724eab].

## Identification of cat breeds

Among the options provided, **three are recognized cat breeds**:

- **Persian**: A long-haired cat breed known for its distinctive flat face and luxurious coat. Persians are frequently studied in veterinary literature, particularly in relation to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) [^d281f738].

- **Turkish Angora**: A historic cat breed originating from Turkey, known for its elegant appearance and silky coat. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, Turkish Angora is a well-established cat breed recognized by major cat registries.

- **Maine Coon**: A large, long-haired cat breed native to the United States. Maine Coons are extensively studied in veterinary literature, particularly in relation to genetic mutations associated with HCM [^da724eab] [^ca43d53c].

---

## Identification of non-cat breed

The **Bichon Frise** is a small, fluffy dog breed known for its cheerful disposition and hypoallergenic coat. It is not a cat breed and is commonly kept as a companion animal. The Bichon Frise is not mentioned in any of the provided references related to cat breeds or feline genetics, further confirming that it is not a cat breed.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. Bichon Frise**, as it is a dog breed, not a cat breed. The other options — Persian, Turkish Angora, and Maine Coon — are all recognized cat breeds [^d281f738] [^da724eab].

### Identification of a novel missense mutation in the fibroblast growth factor 5 gene associated with longhair in the Maine coon cat [^da724eab]. Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Hair length can be a highly variable trait within the Felis catus species, varying between and within different cat breeds. Previous research has demonstrated this variability is due to recessive mutations within the fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene. Following a genetic screen, four longhaired Maine Coons were identified that had only one copy of a known FGF5 mutation. We performed DNA sequencing on samples from two of these Maine Coons and identified a missense mutation in FGF5 c.577G > A p. Ala193Thr. Genetic screening via restriction digest was then performed on samples from the other two Maine Coons and an additional 273 cats of various breeds. This screening found that only the two additional Maine Coons were heterozygous for the novel variant. Furthermore, the novel variant was not identified after in silico analysis of 68 whole genome cat sequences from various breeds, demonstrating that this novel mutation is most likely a breed-specific variant for the Maine Coon, contributing to the longhair phenotype in about 3% of these cats.

Discussion

HCM affects 10–15% of the pet cat population. Most affected cats remain free of clinical signs; however, a proportion experience serious complications, including congestive heart failure, arterial thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death, similar to human HCM. Breeds including Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Persian, and Sphynx are predisposed to HCM, suggesting a genetic component to the disease. Two missense mutations in MYBPC3 were identified in the Maine Coon (A31P) and Ragdoll breeds (R820W). The molecular mechanism(s) by which mutations in MYBPC3 give rise to HCM remains poorly understood, particularly given the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from benign or asymptomatic to sudden death. Studies of the genetic factors and biological mechanisms that underlie this disease are as challenging in felines as they are in humans, as they maintain extensive variation due to differences in factors including genetics, disease, medication, and diet. Model organisms can control for these factors. A powerful strategy for studying the molecular effects of vertebrate disease variants is to create transgenic D. melanogaster bearing the disease gene/variants and express them in cardiac tissue using the versatile Gal4/UAS system.

Here, we developed a transgenic fly model for feline HCM by expressing feline WT MYBPC3 and two MYBPC3 variants associated with disease (A31P and R820W) in the Drosophila cardiovascular system, and assessed the cardiovascular health and transcriptional consequences specific to each MYBPC3 variant. Transcriptionally co-regulated genes in the presence of MYBPC3 mutations relative to the MYBPC3 WT allele are potential modifiers affecting the variable effects of MYBPC3 mutations in different genetic backgrounds, and transcriptionally co-regulated genes that differ between exercised and nonexercised flies with the MYBPC3 mutations are potential candidate genes affecting genotype by environment interactions affecting manifestation of disease.

One potential caveat for this approach is that there is no experimental evidence for Drosophila orthologs of mammalian MYBPC3. The DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) identifies four Drosophila proteins (Unc-89, Sls, Hbs, and Sns) as potential orthologs, however, the DIOPT score for orthology is low (1/15) for each of these. Our control for possible effects of global mis-regulation of an exogenously expressed gene is to compare the effects of the missense variants with the WT feline gene and fly control genotype.

We found that 21% of all studies documented the genetic cause in their feline patients. An overview of the HCM-associated gene variants is shown in Figure 5C. The A31P mutation in MYBPC3 is the first discovered and most commonly investigated gene variant in Maine Coon cats, with 14 publications evaluating the cardiac phenotype in heterozygous and homozygous carriers (Figure 5D). It is estimated that the prevalence of this variant in Maine Coon cats is between 35% and 42%, of which 90% are heterozygotes. While the A31P mutation is not reported in humans, the clinical phenotype observed in the Maine Coon cats resembles the human situation, with a more severe phenotype (characterized by hypertrophy and impaired relaxation) in homozygotes, and a less severe, later onset of disease in the heterozygotes.R820W is another MYBPC3 variant that has been associated with HCM in Ragdoll cats. Homozygous cats developed a HCM phenotype 18 months earlier than the heterozygous carriers. Notably, this gene variant was later documented in humans in which a homozygous patient developed HCM, while the heterozygotes had no to mild clinical expression. As the homozygous Maine Coon and Ragdoll cats are at a higher risk of developing HCM, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine has recommended genetic testing for A31P and R820W MYBPC3 variants in these breeds and emphasized that homozygous cats should not be used for breeding purposes. Similar to humans, the epigenetic factors and the genotype-phenotype heterogeneity in heterozygotes carrying these 2 mutations are still unclear and need to be further studied. Recently, variants in MYH7 and TNNT2 have also been associated with HCM in DSH and Maine Coon cats, respectively. DSH cats carrying the heterozygous E1883K variant in MYH7, a variant present in humans, showed impaired relaxation, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocardial disarray. The reported human case involved a homozygous carrier experiencing HCM and myosin storage myopathy. Because of the limited number of reported humans carrying this variant, the causality of this variant in humans is of uncertain significance (ClinVar). Maine Coon cats with the homozygous TNNT2 variant c.95-108G > A showed cardiac hypertrophy, while the heterozygous parental cats were unaffected. There is no report of this TNNT2 variant in humans. Variants in ALMST1, which encodes a centrosome and basal body-associated protein, have been related to HCM in Sphynx cats. Sphynx cats with a heterozygous or homozygous variant in ALMST1 showed intraventricular septal hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myofiber disarray. Affected cats were between 1 and 14 years of age. ALMS1 mutations can lead to Alström syndrome in humans, in which dilated cardiomyopathy is reported in infants and restrictive cardiomyopathy is reported in adults. There are no reports of HCM associated with mutations in this gene.

Cat models

HCM is the most common form of feline cardiomyopathy and is estimated to affect up to 15% of domestic cats (Felis catus). We identified 95 studies investigating HCM in cats (Figure 5A; Supplemental References). The majority of studies comes from the United States (Figure 5B). Retrospective studies, prospective studies, and case reports describing HCM in domestic cats mostly involved client-owned, breeder-owned, or shelter cats (66% [n = 63 of 95]). Only 7 (7.4%) studies used cats based in a research colony. In 60% of the studies, HCM parameters were investigated in a mixed pool of breeds that we refer to as mixed breed (Figure 5D). The most frequent investigated feline breeds involve Maine Coon (n = 19) and Domestic Shorthair (DSH) (n = 5). Most studies included both male and female cats (n = 79). Out of 95 papers, only 11 conducted age-matched studies. Ten papers reported on kittens or junior cats (10.5%, average age between 0 and 2 years), 38 papers used adult cats (40.0%, average age between 3 and 6 years), 23 papers focused on mature cats (24.2%, average age 7+ years), and in 23 papers, only a range of ages was provided.

### Single cell transcriptomic profiling of-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy across species reveals conservation of biological process but not gene expression [^0c148c08]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common heritable heart disease where the most frequently associated mutations occur in the myosin‐binding protein C (MYBPC3) sarcomere‐associated gene. HCM is also a common veterinary clinical problem in certain cat breeds such as Maine Coons and Ragdolls, also most associated with mutations in MYBPC3. Mouse models of HCM in which Mybpc3 mutations are introduced recapitulate some, but not all, features of human HCM.

Methods and Results

To elucidate the common and distinctive pathological pathways across species and foster a greater understanding of the concordance of mouse HCM models to clinical mybpc3 ‐associated HCM, we generated single nuclei RNA‐sequencing data sets from feline, human, and murine heart tissue carrying MYBPC3 variants. Numerous genes were differentially expressed between mutation positive and mutation negative cell types within each species, identified using the model‐based analysis of single‐cell transcriptomics algorithm. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in cardiomyocytes across species revealed alterations in genes involved in muscle development, muscle contraction, muscle hypertrophy, regulation of sarcoplasmic calcium release, ATP metabolic process, and oxidative phosphorylation.

Conclusions

These common biological processes across species are consistent with known phenotypic aspects of HCM such as hypertrophy, hypercontractility, diastolic dysfunction, and altered energy metabolism. Surprisingly, among conserved biological processes within cardiomyocytes across species, the individual genes driving the biological processes were distinct. This work to identify common and species‐specific disease‐promoting pathway differences will allow development of targeted therapies for both human and veterinary application and will facilitate an understanding of the idiosyncrasies of mouse models.

### Experimental models of hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: a systematic review [^9eff8a90]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography and tissue Doppler measurements are the gold standards in measuring impaired relaxation and hypertrophy in cats, while cardiac magnetic resonance measurements to detect fibrosis have been challenging, which explains the limited data for this parameter. Hypertrophy (n = 56 of 95 [58.9%]) is the most extensively studied HCM hallmark, with 51 of those papers reporting hypertrophy in at least 1 of the cat models (Figure 6A). Impaired relaxation emerges as the second most studied HCM hallmark in cats (n = 37 of 95 [38.9%]) and was observed in 23 (62.2%) papers. The reported differences in relaxation are driven by the size of the left atrium (LA) or left atrial-to-aortic ratio (LA:Ao), rather than by Doppler measurements (Figure 6B). Out of the 56 papers that investigate hypertrophy, 29 also examine relaxation. When fibrosis is studied (n = 22 of 95 [23.2%]), the presence of fibrosis in HCM cats is reported except for 1 paper. The presence of fibrosis was reported in 6 papers (only 1 with statistical testing), 10 provided histological images, and 5 included both images and quantification (Figure 6C). Sarcomere disarray is studied in 19 papers, showing a trend similar to that of fibrosis across cat models. This is largely due to the significant overlap, with 17 papers reporting results on both fibrosis and disarray, indicating a 100% correlation. Only 5 studies focus exclusively on the presence of fibrosis, and 2 studies report solely on disarray (Figure 6D). CM hypertrophy was explored in 12 (12.6%) papers, with 9 of these reporting its occurrence (Figure 6E). Two papers observed no increase in cell surface area but did report ventricular hypertrophy in the tissue. Research on ventricular arrhythmias was covered in 9 studies (Figure 6F). Trehiou-Sechi et alexamined arrhythmias across different cat breeds and found them only in Persian cats, with no arrhythmias detected in the Maine Coon, Sphynx, and DSH.

### Heat shock proteins and small nucleolar RNAs are dysregulated in a drosophila model for feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^bd397b7d]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Expression of feline MYBPC3 alleles in Drosophila

HCM is the most common heart disease in cats. Two MYBPC3 gene mutations, A31P and R820W, were previously identified in the Maine Coon and Ragdoll breeds, respectively. To understand the disease etiology associated with these variants, we used the Gal4/UAS system to express feline MYBPC3 in the fly cardiovascular system. We cloned the WT and variants (A31P and R820W) of feline MYBPC3 to the pUAST-attb expression vector and generated Drosophila UAS - MYBPC3 transgenic lines through PhiC31 transformation. Positive transformants were crossed to a heart-specific driver line (TinCΔ4-Gal4) resulting in three co-isogenic genotypes expressing MYBPC3 in cardiac tissue (w 1118 /y, w; Chr2/+; UAS-WT-MYBPC3/TinCΔ4-Gal4, w 1118 /y, w; Chr2/+; UAS-A31P-MYBPC3/TinCΔ4-Gal4, w 1118 /y, w; Chr2/+; UAS-R820W-MYBPC3/TinCΔ4-Gal4) and the control genotype (w1118/y, w; Chr2/+; attP2/TinCΔ4-Gal4). These genotypes are denoted as WT, A31P, R820W, and attP2, respectively, throughout the text. The lines were validated for gene expression of feline MYBPC3 using RT-PCR and the normalized counts from the RNA-sequencing data for larvae, males, and females (Supplementary Figure S2). As expected, the three MYBPC3 genotypes (WT, A31P, and R820W) show feline MYBPC3 gene expression while the control line (attP2) does not, under both exercised and nonexercised conditions. We assayed these lines for their heart rates and exercise endurance and performed whole-transcriptome profiling using RNA-sequencing.

### Advances in deep neuropathological phenotyping of Alzheimer disease: past, present, and future [^0d1b1686]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

ADVANCES IN STAINING

In terms of AD, the current standard method of evaluation is when formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections are subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies for select proteins such as Aβ and tau. Although the main pillars of neuropathological findings in AD have been known for decades (see timeline for first discovery of Aβ plaques and NFTs components), the road to reaching a consensus on the diagnostic process has been complicated, as diagnostic techniques have evolved and changed dramatically since the disease was first reported, over a century ago.

In his initial report, Alois Alzheimer used a modified version of the silver stain developed by Bielschowsky to visualize plaques and NFTs. Bielschowsky's silver method was one of the many iterations of the silver stain, which was originally developed by Camilo Golgi in 1873, who used silver to stain cellular components. A few years after that, Ramon y Cajal modified the stain to visualize deeper structures within a neuron (for review, see). Cajal's stain was further developed to the mirror reaction silver stain, which was the basis for the Bielschowsky's method (for review see). Bielschowsky's modification allowed for the amount and size of the silver precipitate to increase, thus allowing for better tissue visualization. Although this staining technique allowed Dr. Alzheimer to visualize the plaques and NFTs within the tissue, full appreciation of plaques and NFTs was still a challenge.

Another pivotal advancement in staining was in 1942, when florescent antibodies revealed pneumococcal antigen in tissues, this marked the first published report to our knowledge of using antibodies for diagnostic purposes. The use of antibodies in histology allowed one to "tag" a particular antigen of interest, to facilitate better localization and visualization of said antigen. In 1951, Coons incorporated this new florescent antibody technique into histochemical analysis, marking the first reported use of IHC in medicine, to our knowledge. About 15 years after, IHC began to be incorporated into studying the nervous system, when Rauch et al used the technique to attempt to isolate a protein in the spinal cord. Later on in 1986, this technique played a major role in determining the core component of NFTs, which reacted positively to antibodies that target tau protein. Presently, there are a plethora of antibodies available to visualize select species of tau and Aβ to denote pathologies and their progression (for reviews, see).

### Heat shock proteins and small nucleolar RNAs are dysregulated in a drosophila model for feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^b47d4102]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Not only is HCM the most common genetic heart disorder in people, it is the most common cardiac disease in cats, with an estimated prevalence of 10–15%. HCM in cats is also a predominantly autosomal dominant disorder. Variation in clinical features among cats with HCM is extensive, from no disease symptoms to heart failure and sudden death. HCM is a common cause of congestive heart failure in cats and is prevalent among five breeds, including the Maine Coon and Ragdoll breeds. Two mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions in cMyBP-C — Ala31Pro (A31P) and Arg820Trp (R820W) — have been associated with feline HCM in Maine Coon and Ragdoll cats, respectively. The feline and human cMyBP-C share 91.3% protein identity, as calculated using CLUSTAL multiple sequence alignment by MUSCLE (version 3.8;). The A31P amino acid substitution in Maine Coon cats is near the N-terminus C0 domain of the cMyBP-C protein. This domain is predicted to interact directly with actin to promote activation of contraction by shifting tropomyosin on the thin filament. It has been postulated that the A31P substitution disrupts the interaction of the C0 domain with actin or the thin filament thereby affecting systolic or diastolic function. The R820W amino acid substitution in Ragdoll cats is located in the C6 domain of cMyBP-C, but the function of this domain is currently unknown. Secondary structure analysis predicts that the R820W mutation would result in increased hydrophobicity and disruption of the α-helical structure in this region of the protein.

### Notes from the field: ascariasis associated with pig farming-Maine, 2010–2013 [^53b7d73c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

During April 2010-March 2013, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services investigated multiple cases of ascariasis that had been reported by health-care providers, veterinarians, and patients. All of the cases were in persons who had lived or worked on Maine farms and had frequent exposure to pigs. Ascariasis, a parasitic roundworm infection caused by Ascaris species, is the most common human intestinal worm infection globally. However, because ascariasis is not a reportable disease, limited data exist regarding the incidence of this infection in the United States, and the number of annual cases in Maine is unknown. After investigation, 14 persons on seven farms in Maine were identified with Ascaris infection.

### Effects of clamping end-tidal COon neurofluidic low-frequency oscillations [^da1c18eb]. NMR in Biomedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2 | Data preprocessing and identification of the fourth ventricle

fMRI preprocessing was completed using the FMRIB software library, FSL, and the open-source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). The first 10 V of the scan were removed to ensure a stable signal baseline.

To examine the effects of fluctuating P et CO 2 levels on CSF movement, we studied the BOLD signal at the fourth ventricle, which acts as the main thoroughfare for CSF movement between the spinal canal and the brain, with its small size limiting fluid movement to primarily bidirectional laminar flow. The fourth ventricle signals were identified as outlined previously. In brief, T1-weighted images, registered to the EPI, were used to identify a voxel from the lowest slice of the EPI located in the center of the fourth ventricle. This voxel is carefully chosen to minimize any partial volume effects (Figure 1A). Thus, the fMRI signal in the fourth ventricle mainly arises from CSF inflow effects, characterized by a relatively flat signal with large increases in signal as fresh (having not experienced radiofrequency pulses) CSF enters the lowest slice (Figure 1D). The fourth ventricle time series was extracted before any further preprocessing occurred.

Afterward, motion correction, spatial smoothing (Gaussian kernel with 5-mm FWHM), and registration to the MNI standard space (2 mm), were performed. All further processing of MR and fourth ventricle data was performed through MATLAB (MATLAB 2018b; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

2.3 | Data and statistical analysis

2.3.1 | P et CO 2

P et CO 2 measurements were extracted from the RespirAct data as the maximum PCO 2 values during each breathing cycle. Values beyond three standard deviations from the mean were replaced by interpolating the surrounding values (Figure 1B). The mean and standard deviation were then calculated for each.

No obvious difference of the XRD patterns between SAL and Vₛ-SAL demonstrates no crystal structure change of the SAL before and after H₂O₂ etching treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2). The TEM image also shows that the resulting Vₛ -SAL 10 displays no morphology change in ultrathin structure (Supplementary Fig. 7). The corresponding EDS reveals that Ag, In, and P contents were nearly stoichiometric 1:1:2 of AgInP₂S₆, expect S element less than the stoichiometric ratio (Supplementary Fig. 8). It indicates that H₂O₂ treatment mainly leads to Vₛ, and has no etching effect on other moieties, which was also verified with the following XPS and the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. The atomic resolution, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) clearly reveals that a considerable number of Vₛ were confined in the sheet (Fig. 1e), in contrast to the few sporadic ones in SAL (Supplementary Fig. 9).

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Achieving the goals of the cancer moonshot requires progress against all cancers [^72600dc6]. Cancer Discovery (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

In February 2022, President Joseph R. Biden made reducing age-adjusted cancer mortality by at least 50% over the next 25 years a key goal of the Cancer Moonshot. Although recent progress puts this goal within reach, succeeding will require major commitments to progress on all fronts: basic research, clinical and translational research, health care delivery, and public health. See related article by Shiels et al., p. 1084 (2).

### Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria: lessons from the natural history study [^23b8107b]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Analysis of 819 participants enrolled in the Rett syndrome (RTT) Natural History Study validates recently revised diagnostic criteria. 765 females fulfilled 2002 consensus criteria for classic (653/85.4%) or variant (112/14.6%) RTT. All participants classified as classic RTT fulfilled each revised main criterion; supportive criteria were not uniformly present. All variant RTT participants met at least 3 of 6 main criteria in the 2002, 2 of 4 main criteria in the current format, and 5 of 11 supportive criteria in both. This analysis underscores the critical role of main criteria for classic RTT; variant RTT requires both main and supportive criteria.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^f7268ed3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Clinical question development used a Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes format (PICO); panel members reassessed the evidence and the recommendation for 4 PICO questions addressed in the initial guideline in 2020, prioritized 3 new questions, and because very limited data were identified to answer 2 of these questions, they were combined in a single recommendation (Recommendation 6).

On October 16 to 18, 2021, the 3-day 7th International Summit of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy was held virtually with almost 700 registrants and faculty from 40 countries and 42 states (Drs. Martin and Barry Maron, Directors). This meeting, the largest for this disease, was an opportunity to engage on a wide variety of topics with insights relevant to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy provided by 47 lectures, debates, and comprehensive discussions from 36 distinguished international speakers, including Dr. Eugene Braunwald.

### Evidence-based practices in the cardiac catheterization laboratory: invasive epicardial coronary physiologic assessment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^d8d0f693]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Left main stenosis — practice and evidence emphasize angiography limitations and physiologic considerations: "Coronary angiography alone is notoriously poor at identifying significant left main (LM) coronary disease due to vessel foreshortening and overlap". "Measuring FFR or NHPR across the LM can provide functional information, improving decision-making". Evidence highlights challenges including "guide catheter obstruction (for ostial lesions)", potential "exacerbation of FFR or NHPR discordance", and the "effect of hemodynamic crosstalk of downstream LAD or left circumflex (LCx) stenosis on the accuracy of pull-back assessment of LM stenosis".

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^0d93b745]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergy evaluation — absence of validated reagents (Summary Statement 213): In the absence of validated skin test reagents, the approach to patients with a history of penicillin allergy relies on management options in which therapeutic options include (1) prescribing an alternative antibiotic, (2) performing a graded challenge, and (3) performing penicillin desensitization (D), recognizing that penicilloyl-polylysine, the major determinant of penicillin, is not commercially available and that testing without the major determinant fails to identify most penicillin allergic patients; selection between graded challenge and desensitization is based on the reaction description, time since reaction, and comorbid conditions.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^fc2e9420]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia — phenotype, inheritance, and risk: Heterozygous FH is associated with markedly elevated LDL–C levels and with normal or low HDL–C and usually but not always normal TG levels. FH is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with prevalence in the general population of 1:500 but higher in certain ethnic groups (e.g. French Canadians, South Africans, Lebanese). More than 500 mutations resulting in abnormalities of the LDL–C receptor have been identified, and a similar phenotype is noted for patients with defects of the LDL–C receptor ligand apoB; all these abnormalities result in impaired LDL–C clearance. FH is associated with acceleration of atherosclerosis and premature CVD or events, the risk for clinical events is influenced by the presence of other risk factors or conditions, and it is unclear whether FH confers an increased risk beyond that associated with the attendant lipid abnormalities.

Upper Limb Spasticity in Adult Patients

The efficacy and safety of XEOMIN for the treatment of upper limb spasticity in adult patients were evaluated in two Phase 3, randomized, multi-center, double-blind studies.

Study 1 (NCT01392300) and Study 2 (NCT00432666) were both prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center trials with an open-label extension period (OLEX) to investigate the efficacy and safety of XEOMIN in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity of the upper limb. For patients who had previously received botulinum toxin treatment in any body region, Study 1 and Study 2 required that ≥ 12 months and ≥ 4 months, respectively, had passed since the most recent botulinum toxin administration.

Study 1 consisted of a 12-week main phase followed by three 12-week OLEX treatment cycles for a total exposure duration of 48 weeks. The study included 317 treatment-naïve patients who were at least three months post-stroke in the main study period (210 XEOMIN and 107 placebo). During the main period, XEOMIN (fixed total dose of 400 Units) and placebo were administered intramuscularly to the defined primary target clinical pattern chosen from among the flexed elbow, flexed wrist, or clenched fist patterns and to other affected muscle groups. 296 treated patients completed the main phase and participated in the first OLEX cycle. Each OLEX cycle consisted of a single treatment session (XEOMIN 400 Units total dose, distributed among all affected muscles) followed by a 12-week observation period.

### Birthing the placenta: women's decisions and experiences [^d0538597]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

To gain consent for management of the placenta, care providers are required to provide adequate information about the risks and benefits of both options. However, women utilise a range of information sources to inform their choices about birth. In particular, the Internet enables women to access a wide range of information and facilitates connection with other women's opinions and experiences. Women's decisions are also heavily influenced by their own personal beliefs and attitudes, and previous experiences of birth. Therefore, women may make decisions that do not align with clinical recommendations or their care provider's preferences. Care providers are required to support women's decisions even if they do not align with recommendations. Disregarding or undermining women's decisions can cause distress and trauma.

Previous research examining the birth of the placenta has focused on quantitative outcomes relating to care provider interventions. To date, there has been no published research specifically examining women's own experiences of birthing the placenta. There is also limited research examining women's experiences of physiological birth in general. Most studies exploring women's experience of birth include participants who had medical interventions. These studies identify perception of control as an important factor in women's emotional experience of birth and satisfaction with their care. Women report that they want to have a sense of control over external factors (what is done to them), and control over them selves (their own body and behaviours). The few studies that specifically explore women's experience of physiological birth also identify that a sense of control over what is done by care providers is important. However, during physiological birth women identify 'letting go' and 'relinquishing control' of the body/self as an intrinsic part of the birthing process. Whilst none of these studies specifically focused on the birth of the placenta, participants in Dixon et al.'s study did provide some limited descriptions of birthing the placenta. In particular they described being focused on their baby rather than thinking about the birth of their placenta. Some considered birthing the placenta to be an 'anti-climax', whilst others considered it part of the recovery process.

### FDA conditionally approves drug for heart disease in cats… [^cb08aa13]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

March 14, 2025 Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration is announcing the conditional approval of Felycin-CA1 for the management of ventricular hypertrophy in cats with subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This is the first product approved for use in cats with HCM for any indication. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. HCM in cats causes thickening of the heart's left ventricle. It is the most common heart disease in cats and is one of the most common causes of death in cats. While the cause is unknown in most cases, HCM is associated with a genetic mutation in certain breeds, such as Maine Coons, Ragdolls, and Persians. HCM is a progressive disease. Cats in the subclinical phase have thickening of their heart wall but do not show clinical symptoms of the disease yet. Cats may live for years in the subclinical phase, while others may progress to congestive heart failure, arterial thromboembolism, or sudden death.

An animal drug is eligible for conditional approval if it addresses a serious or life-threatening disease, or addresses an unmet animal or human health need, for which demonstrating effectiveness would require a complex or particularly difficult study or studies. Felycin-CA1 met this requirement because subclinical HCM often progresses to clinical HCM, which substantially impacts day-to-day functioning in cats and can be fatal. As the first drug approved for use in cats with ventricular hypertrophy due to subclinical HCM, Felycin-CA1 addresses an unmet animal health need. In addition, demonstrating effectiveness of Felycin-CA1 would require a complex or particularly difficult study or studies because detecting subclinical HCM requires advanced diagnostic tests, making it difficult to enroll sufficient numbers of eligible cats. Felycin-CA1 is only available by prescription from a licensed veterinarian.

Cats should be screened for pre-existing liver disease before starting Felycin-CA1, and it should not be used in cats with pre-existing liver disease or diabetes mellitus. Felycin-CA1 is available in 0. 4 mg,

1. 2 mg, and 2. 4 mg tablet sizes and is sponsored by TriviumVet based in Waterford, Ireland. For more information Issued by FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine. For questions, Contact CVM.

A shared decision-making model — key components and definitions include deliberation (a process where patients become aware of choice, understand options, and have time and support to consider 'what matters most to them'), choice talk (conveys awareness that a choice exists, initiated by either a patient or a clinician, possibly before the clinical encounter), option talk (patients are informed about treatment options in more detail), and decision talk (patients are supported to explore 'what matters most to them', having become informed). Decision support is designed in two formats: 1) brief enough to be used by clinician and patient together and 2) more extensive, designed to be used by patients either before or after clinical encounters (paper, DVD, web). Awareness of options leads to the development of initial preferences, with the goal to arrive at informed preferences; informed preferences are personal preferences based on 'what matters most to patients', predicated on an understanding of the most relevant benefits and harms.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For subcutaneous injection only. (2.1)
Recommended dosage is 1 mg administered subcutaneously as a single 1 mL autoinjector. (2.1)
Do not exceed 3 mg (3 doses) in a 24-hour period. (2.1)
Do not exceed 6 mg (6 doses) in a week. (2.1)
Prior to initiation, a cardiovascular evaluation is recommended. (2.2)

2.1 Recommended Dosage

BREKIYA autoinjector is for subcutaneous injection only.

The recommended dose of BREKIYA is 1 mg administered subcutaneously via a single 1 mL autoinjector. The dose may be repeated, as needed, at 1-hour intervals to a total maximum of 3 mg (3 doses) in a 24-hour period.

Do not exceed 6 mg (6 doses) total in a week.

2.2 Assessment Prior to First Dose

Prior to initiation of BREKIYA, a cardiovascular evaluation is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. For patients with risk factors predictive of coronary artery disease who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of BREKIYA take place in the setting of an equipped healthcare facility.

2.3 Important
Administration Instructions

See the "Instructions for Use" for detailed steps for administering the subcutaneous injection using the autoinjector.

Preparation

BREKIYA is a prefilled, single-dose disposable autoinjector intended to be given subcutaneously into the skin of the middle thigh.
Rotate injection sites. Choose an injection site at least 2 inches away from the last injection site.
Do not inject into moles, scars, birthmarks, or areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Carefully examine the liquid medication for discoloration, cloudiness, floating flakes or particles. Administer only if clear and colorless.
Remove the red needle cap by pulling it straight off.

### Is my dog or cat a healthy weight? Important questions to… [^18a9bbc8]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Among CVM's responsibilities are making sure that animal food is safe for the animals that eat it and the people who handle it, produced under sanitary conditions, and truthfully labeled. Animal food includes food for all species of animals and covers pet food, pet treats, food for horses, and food for food-producing animals, like cows and pigs. How Fat is Too Fat. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, pets that are 10–20% over their ideal body weight are considered overweight, while pets 21% and over are considered obese. But the ideal weight is relative, depending on the pet's breed, age, and body type. "In dogs, some breeds seem more inclined toward obesity than others, " Stamper notes. Labrador retrievers and beagles are two examples, as well as long, low dogs such as dachshunds and basset hounds. In contrast, while veterinarians are reporting more overweight and obese felines, no specific cat breed is prone to obesity.

However, because indoor cats are typically less active, they are more likely to be overweight than outdoor cats, or even cats that spend time indoors and outdoors. "Ask your vet to explain the scoring system he or she uses, " Stamper says. And ask about what to look for with your pet, such as:

- Does my pet have a health condition that makes it advisable to keep weight on the low side. It may also be advisable to keep weight on the low side for large and giant dog breeds and dog breeds that are predisposed to developing orthopedic problems, such as dachshunds, German shepherds, and Newfoundlands.
- Look at your pet from above. Does your pet have a definite waist. "If not, and her back is broad and flat like a footstool, she is likely overweight, " Stamper says.
- Run your hands along your pet's side. Can you easily feel the ribs, or do you have to push hard to feel them. If you must push hard, your pet may have some excess fat around the ribs.

Are the ribs too prominent. If so, your pet may be underweight and need to eat more calories. If you have more questions, you can read the FDA's Helping Pets Live Healthier, Thinner Lives: AAHA Nutritional Assessment Guidelines. All things in moderation, Stamper says. For most pets, the occasional treat is just fine.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^d4eba108]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — prevalence and natural history are quantified by a meta-analysis of 54 studies including 1.2 million people, finding that as of 2022, 6.2% of patients who had a symptomatic COVID-19 infection continued to experience Long COVID symptoms at least 3 months after infection. Among adults who develop Long COVID, the vast majority of symptomatic recovery occurs within the first 6 months, and by then approximately half report full recovery. At 6 months, one in five with partial recovery report additional improvement by 12 months, and among those with no recovery at 6 months nearly half report some improvement by 12 months. Between 12 and 18 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptom counts are fairly stable for most, but 12% report symptomatic improvement and 12% report symptomatic worsening. In a large retrospective cohort, incidence decreased from 10.4% in the pre-delta prevaccination era to 3.5% in the omicron era among vaccinated people; 72% of the decline was attributable to vaccination and 28% to changes in the virus's characteristics. Data on whether antivirals during acute infection reduce Long COVID are mixed, and with newer variants most symptom incidence has decreased while among unvaccinated individuals gastrointestinal, metabolic, and musculoskeletal symptoms have increased in the omicron era compared to the pre-omicron era.

### Clonidine (Catapres) [^ac6ed4fb]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS

Catapres-TTS®

(clonidine)

 Transdermal Therapeutic System

(Read the following instructions carefully before using this medication. If you have any questions, please consult with your doctor.)

General Information

CATAPRES-TTS transdermal therapeutic system is a square, tan adhesive PATCH containing an active blood-pressure-lowering medication. It is designed to deliver the drug into the body through the skin smoothly and consistently for one full week. Normal exposure to water, as in showering, bathing, and swimming, should not affect the PATCH.

The optional white, round ADHESIVE COVER should be applied directly over the PATCH, should the PATCH begin to separate from the skin. The ADHESIVE COVER ensures that the PATCH sticks to the skin. The CATAPRES-TTS PATCH must be replaced with a new one on a fresh skin site if the one in use significantly loosens or falls off.

Skin burns have been reported at the patch site in several patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI). Because the Catapres-TTS® PATCH contains aluminum, it is recommended to remove the system before undergoing an MRI.

How to Apply the CATAPRES-TTS PATCH

Apply the square, tan CATAPRES-TTS PATCH once a week, preferably at a convenient time on the same day of the week (i.e., prior to bedtime on Tuesday of week one; prior to bedtime on Tuesday of week two, etc.).
Select a hairless area such as on the upper, outer arm or upper chest. The area chosen
should be free of cuts, abrasions, irritation, scars or calluses and should not be shaved before applying the Catapres-TTS® (clonidine) PATCH. Do not place the CATAPRES-TTS PATCH on skin folds or under tight undergarments, since premature loosening may occur.
Wash hands with soap and water and thoroughly dry them.
Clean the area chosen with soap and water. Rinse and wipe dry with a clean, dry tissue.
Select the pouch with the red and orange colors labeled CATAPRES-TTS (clonidine) and open it as illustrated in Figure 3. Remove the square, tan PATCH from the pouch.
Remove the clear plastic protective backing from the PATCH by gently peeling off one half of the backing at a time as shown in Figure 4. Avoid touching the sticky side of the Catapres-TTS® (clonidine) PATCH.
Place the CATAPRES-TTS PATCH on the prepared skin site (sticky side down) by applying firm pressure over the PATCH to ensure good contact with the skin, especially around the edges (Figure 5). Discard the clear plastic protective backing and wash your hands with soap and water to remove any drug from your hands.
After one week, remove the old PATCH and discard it. After choosing a different skin site, repeat instructions 2 through 7 for the application of your next CATAPRES-TTS PATCH.

- West Nile virus infection is spread by mosquitoes. Persons who spend time outdoors, particularly at times such as dusk when mosquitoes may be most active, can make personal decisions to reduce their own risk or not. Knowing that the risk is present but may be small, an avid gardener might or might not decide to curtail the time spent gardening in the evening, or use insect repellent containing DEET, or wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts even though it is August, or empty the bird bath where mosquitoes breed.
- Although the cause and mode of transmission were known, public health officials asked many questions regarding how the virus was introduced, whether the virus had a reservoir in the area, what types of mosquitoes could transmit the virus, what were the host risk factors for infection or encephalitis, etc. Exercise 1. 7

Agent: Bacillus anthracis, a bacterium that can survive for years in spore form, is a necessary cause. Host: People are generally susceptible to anthrax. However, infection can be prevented by vaccination. Cuts or abrasions of the skin may permit entry of the bacteria. Environment: Persons at risk for naturally acquired infection are those who are likely to be exposed to infected animals or contaminated animal products, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, abattoir workers, and laboratorians. Persons who are potential targets of bioterrorism are also at increased risk.

### Exploring different objectives in non-inferiority trials [^09382efa]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Concluding remarks

We have presented the steps required to clarify the intention when conducting a non-inferiority trial. We have argued that important differences exist between trials that compare treatments for efficacy only and those that assess overall risk-benefit, and thus aim to show the new intervention is an additional option or a replacement for standard of care, respectively. We have provided guidance on how to choose the correct objective for a trial (table 2), and how this choice should influence the design, analysis, and reporting of the trial (table 1). Box 1 summarises our recommendations for practice and highlights key areas for further research and consideration on how best to implement our recommendations, taking into account the needs of stakeholders. Designers of clinical trials are in an ideal position to collect data about the additional benefits of a new intervention and present these findings in a statistically appropriate way: when appropriate, the replacement approach to design and analysis would help individual healthcare providers and policy makers, and could promote wider uptake and more benefit to patients in a shorter time.

Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, is a rare malformation. Few patients survive past childhood without surgical repair, and up to 90% die suddenly at a mean age of 35 years. We describe a case of a 60-year-old patient with anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in which 2-dimensional and color flow Doppler visualization of the intercoronary (so-called "steal") collaterals was the first marker that alerted the examiner to the possibility of this diagnosis, subsequently guided step-by-step the echocardiographic approach.

### What to know… [^c198ef8f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Dogs CDC issues regulations to control the entry of dogs into the United States from other countries. These rules apply to all dogs, including puppies, service animals, and dogs that left the United States and are returning. For more information on the requirements to bring a dog into the U. S., visit Bringing a Dog into the U. S. Cats CDC requires that cats appear healthy upon arrival to the United States. Cats are subject to inspection at ports of entry and may be denied entry into the United States if they have evidence of a zoonotic disease. If a cat appears to be ill, further examination by a licensed veterinarian at the owner's expense might be required before the cat is allowed to enter the United States. Cats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination for importation into the United States. However, CDC recommends that all cats be vaccinated against rabies, and your U. S. destination may have additional requirements.

All cats arriving in the state of Hawaii and the territory of Guam, even from the U. S. mainland, are subject to locally imposed quarantine requirements. Nonhuman primates Nonhuman primates, including monkeys and apes, may only be imported for scientific, exhibition or educational purposes, and may not be imported as pets under any circumstances. These restrictions also apply to the re-importation of NHP that originated in and are returning to the U. S. The majority of NHP importations into the U. S. each year are for scientific purposes. For more information, visit Bringing a Nonhuman Primate into the U. S.

Specifically, CDC prohibited the importation of all African rodents into the United States and FDA banned the sale, distribution, transport, or release into the environment of prairie dogs and six specific types of African rodents within the United States. The order was later replaced by an interim final rule on November 3, 2003. On September 8, 2008, FDA rescinded the part of the rule that restricted the capture, sale and interstate movement of prairie dogs or domestically bred African rodents.

### Abiraterone acetate [^121678bd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 × ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 × ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 × ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 × ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 × ULN is unknown.

Strong recommendation is made when "the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms… and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and in some circumstances "strong recommendations may be made when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms", with the implication that "Clinicians and policy makers should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". Recommendation applies when "the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", and "recommendations may be made when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain but the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms", implying "Clinicians and policy makers would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". Option is used when "either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach over another", implying "Clinicians and policy makers should consider the option in their decision-making, and preference may play a substantial role". No recommendation indicates "a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", implying "Clinicians and policy makers should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Genotype by environment interaction of quantitative traits: a case study in barley [^d3032e98]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

Genotype by environment interaction is a phenomenon that a better genotype in one environment may perform poorly in another environment. When the genotype refers to a quantitative trait locus (QTL), this phenomenon is called QTL by environment interaction, denoted by Q×E. Using a recently developed new Bayesian method and genome-wide marker information, we estimated and tested QTL main effects and Q×E interactions for a well-known barley dataset produced by the North American Barley Genome Mapping Project. This dataset contained seven quantitative traits collected from 145 doubled-haploid (DH) lines evaluated in multiple environments, which derived from a cross between two Canadian two-row barley lines, Harrington and TR306. Numerous main effects and Q×E interaction effects have been detected for all seven quantitative traits. However, main effects seem to be more important than the Q×E interaction effects for all seven traits examined. The number of main effects detected varied from 26 for the maturity trait to 75 for the heading trait, with an average of 61.86. The heading trait has the most detected effects, with a total of 98 (75 main, 29 Q×E). Among the 98 effects, 6 loci had both the main and Q×E effects. Among the total number of detected loci, on average, 78.5% of the loci show the main effects whereas 34.9% of the loci show Q×E interactions. Overall, we detected many loci with either the main or the Q×E effects, and the main effects appear to be more important than the Q×E interaction effects for all the seven traits. This means that most detected loci have a constant effect across environments. Another discovery from this analysis is that Q×E interaction occurs independently, regardless whether the locus has main effects.

### Comparison of a simple angiographic approach with a synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with taxus and cardiac surgery score-based approach for left main coronary artery stenting: a pooled analysis of serial PRECOMBAT (premier of randomized comparison of bypass surgery versus angioplasty using sirolimus-eluting stent in patients with left main coronary artery disease) studies [^234b0683]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The applicability of Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery scores to left main coronary artery disease (CAD) has been questioned. A simplified alternative is needed for guiding decision making.

Methods and Results

We evaluated the prognostic value of a simplified angiographic classification in comparison with a Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery score-based approach for patients with left main CAD undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation. The proposed approach classified left main CAD as either extensive (n = 819), defined as left main bifurcation lesions with an involvement of ostial left circumflex artery or as any left main lesion plus multivessel CAD, or limited (n = 453), defined as ostial/midshaft lesions or left main bifurcation lesions without an involvement of ostium of left circumflex artery, alone or plus 1-vessel disease. The databases from 4 prospective Premier of Randomized Comparison of Bypass Surgery versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients with Left Main Coronary Artery Disease studies were pooled, and the primary outcome was a major adverse cardiac event, defined as death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization. During follow-up (median 38 months; interquartile range, 36–61 months), the risk for major adverse cardiac event was significantly higher with extensive than with limited left main CAD (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.54–2.94; P < 0.001). The risk for a composite outcome of death or myocardial infarction was also higher with extensive left main CAD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–2.85; P = 0.02). However, Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery score tertiles did not effectively stratify these 2 outcome measures.

Conclusions

Compared with Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery scores, the simpler angiographic approach provided better discrimination for future cardiovascular events in patients with left main CAD undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation.

Interpreting strong and conditional recommendations — stakeholder perspectives outlines practical implications for different audiences. For patients, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation indicates "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action", while a conditional recommendation acknowledges "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations mean "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations", but conditional recommendations entail that "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation", and "On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence", whereas conditional recommendations are "likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adoption) by additional research".

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus — infectious agent and transmission — is a single-stranded RNA virus in the genus Flavivirus with 3 main subtypes (European, Siberian, and Far Eastern), and is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Ixodes tick (primarily Ixodes ricinus or Ixodes persulcatus); laboratory experiments suggest the virus can be transmitted from an infected tick to an animal within minutes. Preferred tick habitats are within or near forest edges with low-growing dense brush and plant litter; ticks act as both the vector and virus reservoir, small rodents are the primary amplifying host, people can also acquire TBE by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products from infected cows, goats, or sheep with transmission from goats most commonly reported, infrequent transmission has been reported through laboratory exposure and slaughtering viremic animals, and direct person-to-person spread occurs only rarely through blood transfusion, solid organ transplantation, or breastfeeding.

### White-coat hypertension: pathophysiological and clinical aspects: excellence award for hypertension research 2020 [^5a204872]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

White-coat hypertension (WCH) is known as a condition in which office blood pressure (BP) is elevated while out-of-office BP (ambulatory or home BP) is normal. – After its identification almost 40 years ago, WCH has been the object of a large number of studies but also of different views about its clinical significance. For several years, the prevailing opinion has been that, compared with normotension, WCH carried no greater risk of cardiovascular outcomes and that thus its identification did not call for any further diagnostic or treatment measure. In the last 2 decades, however, this position has been weakened by studies that have almost invariably shown that WCH is associated with an unfavorable metabolic risk factor profile, a more frequent asymptomatic organ damage, and a greater risk of future progression to high cardiovascular risk conditions and cardiovascular morbid and fatal events. This has led to the conclusion that WCH is not clinically innocent — a position now shared by major hypertension guidelines. –

Foreword

The only time is now. Every "now" is unique. Responsible persons ask themselves, "How can I act well now?" The answers will differ for every person, because just as every situation is unique, so is every person different from every other person. But surely there must be some algorithm that will assist us in coming to the right answer. Unfortunately, no, for there is no right answer. There is only an answer that is as appropriate as we can conclude at that moment in that situation. No written guidelines can apply appropriately to every unique situation. Unfortunately we physicians have been suckled on a fallacy: "What's good for the goose is good for the gander". Phrased in medical terms, "normal findings are good, and abnormal findings are bad". This is too simple, and often wrong. Good clinicians know that care must be personalized for it to be optimal. So-called normal findings give rough guidance, sometimes applicable to groups, but frequently wrong for individuals. Consider intraocular pressure (IOP). A normal IOP of 15 mmHg good for some and bad for others, and an abnormal IOP of 30 mmHg is good for some and bad for others. We are so bombarded by the myth of the sanctity of the standard distribution curve that it is hard to think independently and specifically. Also, unfortunately, doctors are prone to decide for patients, often on the basis of normative data that is not relevant or important for the particular patient. That we do this is not surprising, as we want to help, and so we default to what seems to be the easy, safe (non-thinking) way, in which we do not have to hold ourselves accountable for the outcome. Somebody HAS to decide, or else we would be living in an anarchical world. Also true. And because none of us knows as much as we need to know to act appropriately, we seek advice from so-called "experts". For us to care for people well it is essential that we consider what others recommend. So we look to experts, as we should. However, experts are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Remember that von Graefe in 1860 recommended surgical iridectomy for all glaucoma, Elliot recommended mustard plaster between the shoulders for glaucoma, Becker based treatment on tonographic findings, Weve reported 100% success with penetrating cyclodiathermy in glaucoma, Lichter advised against laser trabeculoplasty, many thought Cypass was great, and the investigators in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study indicated that an IOP usually around 12 mmHg was better than one usually around 20 mmHg. All wrong. What the authors of these guidelines have done excellently, is to provide a general framework on which ophthalmologists can hang pieces of evidence, so as to be able to evaluate the validity and the importance of that evidence. In doing this meticulously they have provided a valuable service to all ophthalmologists, none of whom individually have either the time or the skill to be fully informed. In their own practices the authors consider whether valid information is relevant for the particular person being considered. That process of considering relevance is essential, always. And relevance is based on the particular unique patient, unique doctor and unique situation. The only guideline the authors can provide in this regard is to remind us all to consider relevance with all patients in all situations, and from the patient's perspective. Even more important than the service to ophthalmologists is the benefit to patients that will result from thoughtful use of these guidelines. We need, also, to remember that diagnoses are generic, and that within every diagnosis there are differences. For example what does a diagnosis of primary open angle mean? Some of those affected will rapidly go blind despite the most thoughtful treatment and others will keep their sight even without treatment. What does a diagnosis of Chandler's Syndrome mean? In some, surgery works well, and, in others, poorly. So one never directs diagnosis and treatment at a condition, but rather at the person, the objective being the wellness of that person. The previous European Glaucoma Society Guidelines are used internationally. It is good that the EGS is again providing updated, useful information. The Guidelines are a practical, inspirational contribution.

Guideline definitions — strength of evidence-based statements and clinician implications — classify four categories as follows. "A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms… and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (Grade A or B)". For this category, "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". "A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms… but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C)". Its implication is that "Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For "Option", "either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or that well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another", and "Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making…; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role". For "No recommendation", "there is both a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms", and "Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making…; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role".

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^e6498189]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### Heparin sodium injection (Heparin sodium) [^4143d558]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

2.1 Preparation for Administration

Confirm the choice of the correct heparin sodium injection vial to ensure that the 1 mL vial is not confused with a "catheter lock flush" vial or other 1 mL vial of incorrect strength [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug.

To lessen this risk, the 1 mL vial includes a red cautionary label that extends above the main label. Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength. Then locate the "Tear Here" point on the label, and remove this red cautionary label prior to removing the flip-off cap.

When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, invert the container repeatedly to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution.

Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate.

Administer heparin sodium injection by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection. Do not administer heparin sodium injection by intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma at the injection site [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)].

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Left main coronary artery disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^77b9200d]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The advent of coronary angiography in the 1960s allowed for the risk stratification of patients with stable angina. Patients with unprotected left main coronary artery disease have an increased risk of death related to the large amount of myocardium supplied by this vessel. Although coronary angiography remains the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of left main coronary artery stenosis, this technique has important limitations. Angiograms of the left main coronary artery segment can be difficult to interpret, and almost one-third of patients can be misclassified when fractional flow reserve is used as the reference. In patients with clinically significant unprotected left main coronary artery disease, surgical revascularization was shown to improve survival compared with medical therapy and has been regarded as the treatment of choice for unprotected left main coronary artery disease. Two large-scale clinical trials published in 2016 support the usefulness of catheter-based revascularization in selected patients with unprotected left main coronary artery disease. In this Review, we describe the pathophysiology of unprotected left main coronary artery disease, discuss diagnostic approaches in light of new noninvasive and invasive imaging techniques, and detail risk stratification models to aid the Heart Team in the decision-making process for determining the best revascularization strategy for these patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^47ace4c5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — evidence-based statement categories and clinician implications define four levels: A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong; clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^b031976d]. Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial keratitis:

- **Definition**: Bacterial keratitis is a corneal infection caused by bacteria, characterized by pain, redness, inflammation, and opacity of the cornea.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of bacterial keratitis involves the entry of bacteria into the cornea, often facilitated by a disruption in the ocular epithelial surface. The bacteria then proliferate and release tissue-damaging proteases and toxins, leading to an inflammatory response.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of keratitis in the US is estimated at 27.6 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for bacterial keratitis include the use of contact lenses, the presence of ocular surface diseases, ocular trauma, administration of topical corticosteroids, history of ocular surgery, and exposure to certain environmental factors.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with bacterial keratitis often present with symptoms such as pain, redness, discharge, blurred vision, and photophobia. On examination, suppurative stromal infiltrates with indistinct edges, corneal edema, and white cell infiltration in the surrounding stroma are often observed. An epithelial defect is typically present, and an anterior chamber reaction is often observed.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of bacterial keratitis can vary, but it can lead to severe visual impairment if not treated promptly.

### One health: EAACI position paper on coronaviruses at the human-animal interface, with a specific focus on comparative and zoonotic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 [^07592e9b]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

5.2 Human‐to‐animal and animal‐to‐human transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2

Several reports confirm human‐to‐animal transmission (reverse zoonosis). Infected animals had close contact with the RT‐PCR‐positive humans, suggesting that the virus was transferred in one direction (human‐to‐animal). Dogs, cats, wild felines (tigers and lions), and minks on fur farms were tested RT‐PCR‐positive, a dog and cat even for a new variant SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7, whereas farm animals like pigs, cows, chickens, and ducks (poultry), had not been reported RT‐PCR‐positive, and the risk of transmission from humans‐to‐bats was considered to be low.

There is evidence of human‐to‐cat and human‐to‐dogtransmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 but so far not vice versa. One study suggested that cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, might act as biological and/or mechanical vectors, as coronavirus‐derived RNA and cell receptor ACE RNA/proteins were identified in cat fleas. However, current evidence suggests that pets are probably "dead‐end"‐hosts with small risk of transmission to humans. Still, pet owners are concerned: 60% of U.S. veterinarians encountered owners that were worried about their pets having COVID‐19. There is also concern that cats or dogs could transmit SARS‐CoV‐2, although there is no evidence for zoonotic transmission so far. Thus, owners in some countries started to abandon their pets, however, fear of potential transmission from domestic cats is unnecessary without solid proof of risk. On the contrary, according to computational modeling, abandoning domestic cats actually might cause even more people to be infected overall.

### White-coat hypertension: pathophysiological and clinical aspects: excellence award for hypertension research 2020 [^d4afe819]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The above description provides guidance on what should be diagnostically done in patients in whom office and out-of-office BP measurements identify a WCH condition. One, patients' history should be carefully collected and metabolic risk factors carefully measured. Two, subclinical damage should be searched for in different organs because cardiovascular risk has been shown to increase in parallel with the number of organs affectedand even with different measures of the damage within the same organ, such as, in the kidney, microalbuminuria, and reduction of glomerular filtration rate. Search should make use of an EKG and an echocardiogram (to visualize alterations of cardiac structure, myocardial-strain, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction), urinary protein excretion and glomerular filtration rate estimation, and an echo Doppler–based examination of the carotid arteries to visualize intima-media thickening and plaques. Measurement of pulse wave velocity may be also useful although its changes in WCH have been less well studied and a stiffening may reflect an alteration of large artery anatomy but also a passive response to the BP increase. Three, measurements of office and out-of-office BP should be accurate and obtained more than a single time. Four, information should extend to both home and ambulatory BP values, rather than being limited to one type of out-of-office BP, as currently done in clinical practice. Ambulatory BP measurements, in particular, should be collected via a series of measurements that allow good quality information on nighttime BP values, given the prognostic importance of nocturnal BP and its frequent abnormality in WCH.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^e807bcaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".
