## Question

torbutalin syrup for management of asthma in a 1 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether terbutaline syrup is appropriate for managing asthma in a 1-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indications for terbutaline syrup. Then, I should verify what major pediatric asthma guidelines recommend for children under 5 years, especially under 1 year. Next, I will review the pharmacologic rationale for inhaled versus oral beta-agonists in infants. After that, I need to check safety considerations unique to toddlers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and confirm any exceptions or escalation pathways if inhaled therapy is not feasible.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status. The FDA labeling for terbutaline sulfate states that oral terbutaline is not recommended for use in children under 12 years, and the pediatric dose provided is for ages 12–15 years, which means there is no approved pediatric oral dose for a 1-year-old, and use would be off-label without supportive evidence or dosing guidance in this age group [^112BG2qk].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations for children under 5 years. GINA emphasizes that inhaled short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) are the reliever therapy of choice for wheezing episodes in young children, and explicitly notes that oral bronchodilators are not recommended due to slower onset and higher rates of side effects compared with inhaled SABA; this applies broadly to children 5 years and younger, with particular caution in infants under 1 year where evidence and response are limited [^114iKnji] [^114sHVA1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the pharmacologic rationale. Oral beta-agonists like terbutaline have delayed onset, less predictable pulmonary bioavailability, and a higher systemic exposure profile, which increases adverse effects such as tremor and tachycardia; in contrast, inhaled SABA delivered by pMDI with spacer achieves faster bronchodilation with lower systemic exposure, which is especially important in infants with immature hepatic metabolism and narrow therapeutic margins [^114iKnji] [^111K7GSj].

> I need to check safety considerations specific to a 1-year-old. Systemic beta-agonist effects including hypokalemia, tachycardia, and tremor are well described with IV terbutaline in older children, and although those data are from parenteral use, they underscore class toxicity that is more concerning with oral or parenteral routes than with inhaled therapy; additionally, there are no pediatric oral terbutaline safety or pharmacokinetic data in infants to support dosing or risk assessment in this age group [^112Yp2YQ].

> Let me consider what to do instead. For a 1-year-old with suspected asthma or recurrent wheeze, the appropriate reliever is inhaled salbutamol/albuterol via pMDI with spacer and face mask, typically 2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour during exacerbations, with urgent escalation if there is no response; if symptoms persist beyond 24 hours or SABA is needed more frequently than every 3 hours, seek same-day medical care and consider systemic corticosteroids if the exacerbation is moderate to severe, using weight-based dosing and short courses [^113NEWTr] [^116GRwc5] [^117Wv1Bs].

> But wait, what if inhaled therapy is not feasible due to severe distress or lack of access? I should double-check the escalation pathway. In severe, refractory cases in older children, IV SABA such as terbutaline may be considered as adjuncts in critical care settings, but this is not applicable to routine outpatient management in a 1-year-old and remains off-label with limited and low-certainty evidence even in older pediatric cohorts; thus, the correct course is urgent transport to a facility capable of inhaled and systemic acute care rather than attempting oral terbutaline at home [^114AV5Sf] [^113oU8bQ].

> I will now examine controller therapy implications briefly, since frequent reliever use signals poor control. In preschool children with recurrent wheeze or persistent symptoms, GINA supports a trial of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids after confirming technique and adherence, with reassessment of response and careful growth monitoring; this is distinct from reliever choice and reinforces that the reliever should remain inhaled SABA rather than any oral beta-agonist in this age group [^116PLN6T] [^114sHVA1].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should confirm the bottom line. Terbutaline syrup is not appropriate for managing asthma in a 1-year-old because it lacks regulatory approval or evidence-based dosing in this age group, oral beta-agonists are discouraged by pediatric asthma guidelines due to inferior pharmacokinetics and higher adverse effect risk, and the evidence-based reliever of choice is inhaled salbutamol/albuterol with spacer; if symptoms are not controlled with inhaled therapy, follow acute care pathways and consider systemic corticosteroids and specialist input rather than resorting to oral terbutaline [^112BG2qk] [^114iKnji] [^113NEWTr].

---

Terbutaline syrup is **not recommended** for asthma management in a 1-year-old because of its **lack of pediatric approval** and absence of dosing guidance for children under 12 years [^112BG2qk]. It is not included in pediatric asthma guidelines, and oral beta-agonists are discouraged due to **slower onset, lower efficacy, and higher adverse effects** compared with inhaled therapy [^114iKnji]. For infants, **inhaled short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)** via spacer with face mask are preferred for acute relief, and oral corticosteroids are used for moderate-to-severe exacerbations. If terbutaline is considered, it should only be in a monitored inpatient setting, not as outpatient syrup therapy.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

- **Mechanism of action**: Terbutaline is a selective beta2-adrenergic agonist causing bronchodilation via smooth muscle relaxation.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Oral terbutaline undergoes first-pass metabolism, resulting in slower onset and lower bioavailability than inhaled SABA.

- **Adverse effects**: Systemic beta-agonist effects (tremor, tachycardia, hypokalemia) are more common with oral or IV routes, especially in young children [^114iKnji] [^112Yp2YQ].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Lack of pediatric approval**: The FDA label states terbutaline is not recommended for children under 12 years, with no pediatric dosing provided [^112BG2qk].

- **Absence from pediatric guidelines**: GINA and AAP do not recommend oral terbutaline for asthma in children under 5 years; inhaled SABA is preferred for acute relief [^114iKnji] [^116mWAML].

- **Oral beta-agonists discouraged**: Guidelines note slower onset, lower efficacy, and higher adverse effects with oral SABA compared with inhaled therapy in young children [^114iKnji].

## Recommended pediatric asthma management

### Acute management

For acute management, **inhaled SABA** (salbutamol/albuterol) via spacer with face mask is first-line for rapid relief [^114sHVA1]; typical dosing is 2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour, then reassess [^116mWAML]. Systemic corticosteroids are indicated for moderate-to-severe exacerbations — for example, prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (max 20 mg) for 3–5 days [^116mWAML] [^117Wv1Bs].

---

### Chronic management

For chronic management, **low-dose ICS** is first-line controller therapy for persistent symptoms in children under 5 years [^116PLN6T]. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast) are an alternative when ICS is not tolerated or adherence is a concern, though they are generally less effective than ICS [^111ssVcH].

---

## Safety concerns and adverse effects

- **Systemic adverse effects**: Oral terbutaline can cause tremor, tachycardia, palpitations, and hypokalemia, which are concerning in infants [^112Yp2YQ].

- **Lack of safety data**: There are no adequate pediatric safety studies for oral terbutaline in children under 12 years [^1123fGXN].

- **Overdose risk**: Case reports describe significant toxicity with IV terbutaline overdose, underscoring class risks in young children [^notfound].

---

## Alternative bronchodilators

Alternative bronchodilators include **inhaled SABA** (salbutamol/albuterol), the preferred first-line reliever with established safety and efficacy in infants [^114iKnji], and **inhaled LABA**, which are not used as relievers in children under 4 years due to insufficient safety and efficacy data [^111ssVcH].

---

## Clinical scenarios for terbutaline use

If considered at all, **terbutaline is reserved for severe, refractory cases in inpatient settings** as an IV adjunct when inhaled therapy fails, not as outpatient syrup therapy [^114AV5Sf] [^117JcTf9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Terbutaline syrup is **not recommended** for asthma management in a 1-year-old due to lack of approval, absence of dosing guidance, and unfavorable risk–benefit profile compared with inhaled therapy. Use inhaled SABA for acute relief and systemic corticosteroids for exacerbations; reserve terbutaline, if at all, for monitored inpatient use in severe cases.

## References

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116mWAML]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 12–4 — Initial emergency department management of asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger outlines immediate therapies and dosing. Supplemental oxygen is delivered by face nasal prongs or mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98%. Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if > 10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children < 2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^112BG2qk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults

The usual oral dose of terbutaline sulfate for adults is 5 mg administered at approximately six-hour intervals, three times daily, during the hours the patient is usually awake. If side effects are particularly disturbing, the dose may be reduced to 2.5 mg three times daily, and still provide a clinically significant improvement in pulmonary function. The total dose within 24 hours should not exceed 15 mg.

Children

Terbutaline sulfate is not recommended for use in children below the age of 12 years. A dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily is recommended for children 12–15 years of age. The total dose within 24 hours should not exceed 7.5 mg.

If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of seriously worsening asthma that would require reassessment of therapy.

### A randomized, comparative study of formoterol and terbutaline dry powder inhalers in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in the pediatric acute care setting [^115qPna7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Formoterol is a fast-acting, long-acting beta-agonist. Its on-demand use by outpatients has been beneficial in controlling asthma.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of formoterol as rescue medication for pediatric asthma exacerbation.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind study was conducted on parallel groups involving 79 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 9.92 [2.5] years) with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. They were treated with up to 3 doses of formoterol aerolizer, 12 microg, or terbutaline Turbuhaler, 0.5 mg (dry powder inhalers). Respiratory rate, clinical score, pulse oximetry, and spirometry were analyzed at baseline and 15 minutes after administration of each bronchodilator dose. All the patients received oral prednisolone, 1 mg/kg, at study entry, followed by a single daily dose for 4 days. Forty-one patients were treated with formoterol and 38 with terbutaline. The groups were comparable in age and in severity of asthma exacerbation.

Results

Both treatments resulted in similar clinical and functional improvement; 37 patients (47%) required 1 bronchodilator dose. Increases of 19.5% and 15.3% occurred in forced expiratory volume in 1 second in the formoterol and terbutaline groups, respectively. Therapeutic failures occurred in 2 patients. No adverse effects were observed. At 1-week follow-up, patients were stable, with pulmonary function close to normal.

Conclusion

Formoterol therapy was at least as effective as terbutaline therapy in children and adolescents with mild and moderate asthma exacerbations.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1151a5X8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma management in children and adolescents — In preschool-aged children with intermittent wheezing at high risk to develop asthma, daily ICS and intermittent high-dose ICS were associated with decreased symptoms and exacerbations. In preschool-aged children with mild persistent asthma with markers of T2 inflammation such as aeroallergen sensitization or a blood eosinophil count of > 300 cells/μl, a differential response favored daily ICS compared with LTRAs or ICS taken whenever albuterol was used for symptoms. In adolescents aged 12–17 years with mild asthma, as-needed budesonide–formoterol was superior to as-needed terbutaline for severe exacerbation reduction, with similar efficacy to budesonide maintenance. The text notes that adherence to controller medication is key to asthma control and that an as-needed controller approach may improve adherence when it is most needed, during a period of increased symptoms. A recent meta-analysis of nonpharmacological approaches for children and adults found that patient education programs, multifaceted interventions, renovating homes to reduce environmental exposures, and air filtration systems significantly improved asthma control, and the psychosocial environment is recognized as a significant contributor to asthma morbidity.

### The impact of terbutaline as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of severe asthma in the pediatric emergency department [^1175WLuE]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients were identified using a retrospective cohort analysis from a single, tertiary care, urban children's hospital. Patients presenting directly to our emergency department aged 2 to 18 years were included if they had a diagnosis of severe asthma exacerbation, defined by an initial Respiratory Clinical Score (RCS) of 9 or higher. A total of 787 patients were identified during the study timeframe (December 16, 2017, to December 31, 2018), and of those, 651 patients met study criteria and were included in the analysis. The χ2 test was used to establish P values for categorical variables. For normally distributed variables, a t test was used. For nonnormally distributed variables, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. A P value of 0.05 or less was interpreted as statistically significant.

Results

Patients who received terbutaline had an increased risk of admission to the PICU (P < 0.001). This association was lost after controlling for age, sex, continuous albuterol use, and intramuscular epinephrine use (P = 0.362). Patients receiving terbutaline in the emergency department also had a higher risk of admission to the hospital (odds ratio, 1.55; confidence interval, 1.08–2.22; P = 0.020) as compared with their nonterbutaline counterparts. Overall, patients in the terbutaline group had a higher initial RCS at presentation. Upon further analysis, patients with the same RCS at presentation were more likely to be admitted if they received terbutaline than those who did not. There was no statistically significant difference in length of stay (P = 0.298) and BiPAP/CPAP use (P = 0.107). The patients on terbutaline were relatively more likely to require oxygen (P = 0.003) and intramuscular epinephrine (P = 0.010) than the patients not on terbutaline.

Conclusions

Terbutaline administration given to pediatric patients experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation was not associated with decreased PICU or general hospital floor admission. The study is limited given that it was a retrospective analysis. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the role of terbutaline in severe acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients.

### Safety of terbutaline for treatment of acute severe pediatric asthma [^112Yp2YQ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of continuous intravenous terbutaline treatment in severe asthma attacks has been hampered by the lack of well-powered clinical trials where effects of such treatment are described in detail. Here, we aimed to provide a descriptive report on the largest cohort of severe pediatric asthma patients treated with terbutaline.

Methods

The study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit in a large metropolitan tertiary care university hospital on 124 patients receiving terbutaline infusion. To stratify the effect of, and determine any age-related differences of, terbutaline, the patients were divided into 3 age groups (0–6 years, 7–12 years, and 13–18 years). Clinical response and the potential harmful effects of terbutaline infusion were determined.

Results

There were significant reductions in systolic (varying between 86% and 93% of the baseline) and diastolic blood pressures (varying between 74% and 86% of the baseline level). However, the values returned to baseline level shortly after discontinuation of infusion. Terbutaline increased heart rates in all groups shortly after initiation (9%-13% above baseline), which returned to below baseline levels 1 hour after discontinuation. Serum potassium levels were also reduced in all patients compared to their baseline values after initiation of terbutaline infusion. However, none of the subjects required potassium replacement.

Conclusions

The results indicate that overall, terbutaline infusion was well tolerated without irreversible adverse effects of the treatment. Although hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances occurred, these were clinically easily managed and posed little risk in emergency department or pediatric intensive care unit.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115qmiYJ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol — evidence and key findings for mild asthma (Steps 1–2): Use for symptom relief in adults and adolescents is supported by four randomized controlled trials and by systematic review and meta-analysis; the two largest studies were double-blind and two were pragmatic open-label. A large double-blind study found a 64% reduction in severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) compared with SABA-only treatment, and a Cochrane meta-analysis reported reductions of 55% for severe exacerbations requiring OCS and 65% for emergency department visits or hospitalizations versus SABA alone. Two large double-blind studies showed as-needed budesonide-formoterol was non-inferior for severe exacerbations compared with regular ICS, and two open-label randomized controlled trials found it was superior to maintenance ICS in reducing severe exacerbations. Additional findings were that in all four studies the strategy was associated with a substantially lower average ICS dose than maintenance low-dose ICS, clinical outcomes were similar in adolescents as in adults, a post hoc analysis showed that a day with > 2 doses reduced the short-term (21 day) risk versus as needed terbutaline alone, and no new safety signals were seen.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1138uS9L]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

New Approaches to Using Approved Medications for Treatment of Mild Pediatric Asthma

There are several ICS-based strategies endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement using approved medications in children with mild persistent asthma. Low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children with asthma. In the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year. Furthermore, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use, with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually. Low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 44%. Severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week, prebronchodilator lung function was higher, and symptom-free days were more frequent Similar results have been observed in persistent versus intermittent asthma.

In preschool-aged children with intermittent wheezing at high risk to develop asthma, the use of daily ICS and intermittent high-dose ICS was associated with decreased symptoms and exacerbations. Moreover, preschool-aged children with mild persistent asthma with markers of T2 inflammation, such as aeroallergen sensitization or a blood eosinophil count of > 300 cells/μl, showed a differential response favoring daily ICS compared with LTRAs or ICS taken whenever albuterol was used for symptoms.

In adolescents aged 12–17 years with mild asthma, as-needed budesonide–formoterol was superior to as-needed terbutaline for severe exacerbation reduction, with similar efficacy to budesonide maintenance. Adherence to controller medication is key to asthma control, and the as-needed controller approach may improve adherence when it is most needed, during a period of increased symptoms.

### Theophylline versus terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial [^1139uysX]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of theophylline, terbutaline, or theophylline combined with terbutaline treatment in critically ill children with status asthmaticus who are already receiving continuous nebulized albuterol and intravenous corticosteroids.

Design

Randomized, prospective, controlled, double-blind trial.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care children's medical center.

Patients

Forty critically ill children between the ages of 3 and 15 yrs with impending respiratory failure secondary to status asthmaticus.

Interventions

All patients received intravenous methylprednisolone and continuous nebulized albuterol. The three study groups received theophylline plus placebo (group 1), terbutaline plus placebo (group 2), or theophylline and terbutaline together (group 3).

Measurements and Main Results

Differences in baseline characteristics, change in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, and incidence of adverse events were determined. The three study groups were similar in age, gender, race, asthma severity, and treatment. There were no differences in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, or incidence of adverse events between the three groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of nausea in children in group 3. The median hospital cost of medication and theophylline blood levels was significantly lower in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 (280 US dollars vs. 3,908 US dollars vs. 4,045 US dollars, respectively, p < .0001).

Conclusions

Theophylline, when added to continuous nebulized albuterol therapy and intravenous corticosteroids, is as effective as terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus. The addition of theophylline to baseline therapy is more cost-effective when compared with terbutaline alone or terbutaline and theophylline together. Theophylline should be considered for use early in the management of critically ill asthmatic children.

### Intravenous salbutamol for childhood asthma: evidence-based medicine? [^116yeP4C]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Intravenous salbutamol is commonly used to treat children with severe asthma unresponsive to inhaled β2-agonist therapy. However, in this setting, there is little clinical trial data demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, there are significant concerns that intravenous salbutamol-dosing recommendations for children with acute asthma are excessive, and unnecessarily raise the potential for adverse reactions, such as lactic acidosis and tachycardia which, by increasing respiratory workload, exacerbate respiratory failure. Here, we review salbutamol clinical pharmacology and toxicology, evidence relating to its use in acute asthma and highlight gaps in the evidence base.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111K7GSj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Short-acting inhaled beta2 agonist bronchodilators (SABA) — e.g., salbutamol (albuterol), terbutaline — are administered by pMDI, DPI or, rarely, as solution for nebulization or injection. Inhaled SABAs provide quick relief of asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction and are used for pre-treatment before exercise; SABAs should be used only as-needed (not regularly) and at the lowest dose and frequency required, and SABA-only treatment is not recommended because of the risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related death. Currently, inhaled SABAs are the most commonly used bronchodilator for acute exacerbations requiring urgent primary care visit or ED presentation. Adverse effects include tremor and tachycardia with initial use; tolerance develops rapidly with even 1–2 weeks of regular use, with increased airway hyperresponsiveness, reduced bronchodilator effect, and increased airway inflammation. Excess use or poor response indicate poor asthma control and risk of exacerbations, and dispensing of 3 or more 200-dose canisters per year is associated with increased risk of exacerbations, while dispensing of 12 or more canisters per year is associated with markedly increased risk of death.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113NEWTr]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessment of response and additional bronchodilator treatment — severe exacerbation in children: Children with a severe asthma exacerbation must be observed for at least 1 hour after initiation of treatment; if symptoms persist after initial bronchodilator, a further 2–6 puffs of salbutamol may be given 20 minutes after the first dose and repeated at 20-minute intervals for an hour, consider adding 1–2 puffs of ipratropium, and failure to respond at 1 hour or earlier deterioration should prompt admission to hospital with addition of nebulized ipratropium and a short course of oral corticosteroids. If symptoms have improved by 1 hour but recur within 3–4 hours, the child may be given more frequent doses of bronchodilator (2–3 puffs each hour) and oral corticosteroids should be given, and children who fail to respond to 10 puffs of inhaled SABA within a 3–4 hour period should be referred immediately to hospital. If symptoms resolve rapidly after initial bronchodilator and do not recur for 1–2 hours, no further treatment may be required; further SABA may be given as needed up to every 3–4 hours (up to a total of 10 puffs/24 hours), and if symptoms persist beyond 1 day, inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids are indicated.

### Comparison of intravenous terbutaline versus normal saline in pediatric patients on continuous high-dose nebulized albuterol for status asthmaticus [^114fLQpS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if the addition of intravenous terbutaline provides any clinical benefit to children with acute severe asthma already on continuous high-dose nebulized albuterol.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial on pediatric patients with acute severe asthma presenting to a large inner city tertiary children's emergency department. Consecutive patients between 2 and 17 years of age who failed acute asthma management and needed intensive care unit admission underwent informed consent and were enrolled into the study. Patients not requiring intubation were randomized to receive either intravenous terbutaline or intravenous normal saline while on continuous high-dose nebulized albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and systemic corticosteroids. Outcome measures included a clinical asthma severity score, hours on continuous nebulized albuterol, and duration of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. In addition, electrocardiograms, electrolytes, lactic acid, and troponin I levels were obtained at routine intervals during the first 24 hours after admission. Patients who significantly worsened while enrolled in the study received intravenous aminophylline according to protocol.

Results

Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study. Patients on terbutaline had a mean improvement in the clinical asthma severity score over the first 24 hours of 6.5 points compared with 4.8 points in the placebo group (P = 0.073). Patients on terbutaline spent 38.19 hours on continuous nebulized albuterol compared with their placebo counterparts who spent 51.93 hours (P = 0.25). The length of stay in the PICU was on average 12.95 hours longer for those patients in the placebo group as compared with the terbutaline group (P = 0.345). One patient was removed from the study for a significant cardiac dysrhythmia. This patient was in the terbutaline group and recovered without complications. Troponin I values at 12 hours and 24 hours were elevated in 3 patients each, all within the terbutaline group.

Conclusions

No outcome measures demonstrated statistical significance. Outcome measures revealed a trend toward improvement in the terbutaline group. Before recommending routine use of intravenous terbutaline for acute severe asthma, further study to determine safety and efficacy is necessary.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1156B71r]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial home management of asthma exacerbations — an action plan should enable the child's family members and carers to recognize worsening asthma and initiate treatment, recognize when it is severe, identify when urgent hospital treatment is necessary, and provide recommendations for follow up (Evidence D), and should include specific information about medications and dosages and when and how to access medical care. Parents/caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention immediately if the child is acutely distressed, the child's symptoms are not relieved promptly by inhaled bronchodilator, the period of relief after doses of SABA becomes progressively shorter, or a child younger than 1 year requires repeated inhaled SABA over several hours. For initial treatment at home, the parent/caregiver should initiate treatment with two puffs of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) (200 mcg salbutamol [albuterol] or equivalent), given one puff at a time via a spacer device with or without a facemask (Evidence D). This may be repeated a further two times at 20-minute intervals, if needed, and the child should be observed by the family/carer and, if improving, maintained in a restful and reassuring atmosphere for an hour or more. Medical attention should be sought urgently if any of the features listed above apply; or on the same day if more than 6 puffs of inhaled SABA are required for symptom relief within the first 2 hours, or if the child has not recovered after 24 hours.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^114AV5Sf]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric critical asthma — intravenous short-acting beta agonist (SABA) infusion — We suggest the use of an IV SABA infusion as an adjunct therapy in children treated for critical asthma (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Agents described include IV albuterol (salbutamol), isoproterenol, epinephrine, and terbutaline. Evidence identified 4 RCTs and 1 observational study; salbutamol was evaluated in 3 studies and terbutaline in 2, with settings including 1 PICU, 3 non-ICU wards, and 1 ED. In one study, no subjects were intubated in the IV SABA arm compared with a 12–19% rate in the other arms (no statistical analysis). Ventilation measures in 2 RCTs showed statistically significant improvement in pH, PaCO2, and breathing frequency in 1 study and no difference in a second. Other outcomes reported no difference for NRS use, PICU stay, and hospital stay, while an observational study found higher unadjusted PICU admission in the IV SABA group that was not different after correction; acute asthma severity scores showed no benefit in 1 RCT and a trend toward improvement in another. Adverse events included one study with no increased hypotension in the IV SABA group and another showing a not statistically significant increase in troponin I elevation at 12 and 24 h with IV SABA; overall, the evidence continues to be of low quality and quantity.

Asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger — home management in a written action plan should include: "Give a written asthma action plan" to caregivers; "Initial treatment at home is with inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA), with review after 1 hour or earlier"; "Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care" if acutely distressed, lethargic, failing to respond, or worsening, "especially in children < 1 year of age"; same-day care if SABA is needed "more often than 3-hourly or for more than 24 hours"; and "There is no compelling evidence to support parent/caregiver-initiated oral corticosteroids".

### Early administration of terbutaline in severe pediatric asthma may reduce incidence of acute respiratory failure [^117TET3F]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Severe pediatric asthma, if not immediately and aggressively treated, may progress to acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Intravenous (IV) terbutaline, a β2 agonist, is dispensed when the initial treatment does not improve the clinical condition.

Objective

To investigate the influence of early initiation of IV terbutaline on the incidence of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in severe pediatric asthma.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of 120 subjects (35 patients from an outside hospital emergency department [ED] with late start of terbutaline and 85 patients from the authors' hospital ED with early initiation of IV terbutaline) admitted to the PICU with severe asthma treated with continuous IV terbutaline. Responses to terbutaline treatment and outcomes were evaluated.

Results

Patients transported from outlying hospital EDs had shorter pre-PICU mean durations of IV terbutaline than those transferred from the authors' ED (0.69 ± 1.38 and 2.91 ± 2.47 hours, respectively, P = .001). Twenty-one of 35 patients (60%) from outlying EDs required mechanical ventilation compared with 14 of 85 patients (16%) from the authors' ED (P = .001). Durations of pre-PICU terbutaline infusion for patients requiring mechanical ventilation were significantly shorter than those with no such requirement (P = .015).

Conclusion

The results of the present study, conducted in the largest number of subjects to date, suggest that early administration of continuous terbutaline in the ED may decrease acute respiratory failure and the need for mechanical respiratory (invasive and noninvasive) support in severe pediatric asthma.

SECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF LAMAs FOR ASTHMA

Background

LAMAs comprise a pharmacologic class of long-acting bronchodilators. The role of LAMAs in the management of asthma was not addressed in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. Since that report's publication in 2007, several trials have investigated LAMAs as controller therapy for individuals with asthma.

The Expert Panel examined the harms and benefits of LAMAs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma and addressed three key questions. The Expert Panel did not examine the role of LAMA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years because the key questions and systematic reviews did not address this age group. With the exception of one study that examined the LAMA umeclidinium, the RCTs reviewed by the Expert Panel used tiotropium bromide as the LAMA. At the time this report was written, tiotropium bromide (Respimat) was the only formulation of LAMA with US FDA approval for asthma treatment. The majority of LAMA studies used a comparative efficacy design, and not an effectiveness design, but the key questions were about effectiveness. Therefore, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood. Table V provides an overview of the key questions and recommendations on LAMAs.

Definitions of terms used in this section

In this section, "controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The term "ICS-LABA" indicates therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually (and preferably) in a single inhaler.

Question 5.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA compared with other controller therapy as add-on therapy to ICSs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Question 5.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy to ICS controller therapy compared with placebo or increased ICS dose in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Recommendation 14: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against adding LAMA to ICS compared to adding LABA to ICS.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

Recommendation 15: If LABA is not used, in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS controller therapy compared to continuing the same dose of ICS alone.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114sHVA1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessment and management of asthma in children 5 years and younger — key points include that wheezing episodes in young children should be treated initially with inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA), regardless of whether the diagnosis of asthma has been made, but for initial episodes of wheeze in children < 1 year in the setting of infectious bronchiolitis, SABAs are generally ineffective. A trial of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment should be given if the symptom pattern suggests asthma, alternative diagnoses have been excluded and respiratory symptoms are uncontrolled and/or wheezing episodes are frequent or severe. Response to treatment should be reviewed before deciding whether to continue it, and if the response is absent or incomplete, reconsider alternative diagnoses. The choice of inhaler device should be based on the child's age and capability; the preferred device is a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and spacer, with face mask for < 3 years and mouthpiece for most children aged 3–5 years, and children should be switched from a face mask to mouthpiece as soon as they are able to demonstrate good technique. Review the need for asthma treatment frequently, as asthma-like symptoms remit in many young children, and advise parents/caregivers that asthma symptoms will often return later in life.

### Role of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists in asthma management based on updated asthma guidelines [^1111e22D]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the role of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists in the management of asthma, particularly focusing on recommendations in the newly revised Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma guidelines.

Recent Findings

GINA guidelines recommend increasing inhaled corticosteroid doses in all children with asthma not controlled on low-dose inhaled corticosteroids before adding a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, whereas NHLBI guidelines have different age-based recommendations for children. In patients younger than 5 years, NHLBI guidelines recommend increasing the inhaled corticosteroid dose before adding a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist; in children aged 5–11 years, equal weight is given to increasing the inhaled corticosteroid dose or including add-on therapy to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. In adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, GINA recommends adding long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids over increasing the inhaled corticosteroid dose. NHLBI guidelines give equal weight to these choices, with alternative, although not preferred, therapies including the addition of theophylline, zileuton, or leukotriene receptor antagonists to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids.

Summary

In the recently updated GINA and NHLBI asthma guidelines, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists are an important class of agents for the management of persistent asthma in patients whose asthma is not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy.

### Acute asthma intervention: insights from the STAY study [^111ehXU3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

In some patients, asthma control is improved by combining inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting beta(2)-agonists. However, fluctuating asthma control and exacerbations can still occur. The STAY study evaluated whether, in patients with moderate to severe asthma, replacing a short-acting beta(2)-agonist reliever with the combination of budesonide/formoterol as reliever would both provide rapid symptom relief and reduce asthma exacerbations. The study evaluated 2760 patients with asthma (4–80 years) randomized to budesonide 400 microg twice daily (bid) and terbutaline as reliever, budesonide/formoterol 100/6 microg bid and terbutaline as reliever, or budesonide/formoterol 100/6 microg bid both as maintenance and reliever. Children (age 4–11 years) used a once-daily maintenance dose. Budesonide/formoterol as maintenance and reliever significantly reduced severe exacerbation risk by 45% to 47% compared with the other 2 treatments and improved symptoms, awakenings, and lung function. The benefit was seen in patients of all ages. Subsequent studies have revealed that this beneficial effect of budesonide/formoterol as maintenance and reliever requires both components of the combination.

### Formoterol versus short-acting β-agonists as relief medication for adults and children with asthma [^115iQfky]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Formoterol is a long-acting beta(2)-agonist but because it has a fast onset of action it can also be used as a relief medication.

Objectives

To asses the efficacy and safety of formoterol as reliever therapy in comparison to short-acting beta(2)-agonists in adults and children with asthma.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and websites of clinical trial registers (for unpublished trial data), and we checked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol. The date of the most recent search was February 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, parallel-arm trials of at least 12 weeks duration in patients of any age and severity of asthma. Studies randomised patients to any dose of as-needed formoterol versus short-acting beta(2)-agonist. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids or other maintenance medication was allowed, as long as this was not part of the randomised treatment regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. Outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by the second author. We sought unpublished data on primary outcomes.

Main Results

This review includes eight studies conducted in 22,604 participants (mostly adults). Six studies compared formoterol as-needed to terbutaline whilst two studies compared formoterol with salbutamol as-needed. Background maintenance therapy varied across the trials. Asthma exacerbations and serious adverse events showed a direction of treatment effect favouring formoterol, of which one outcome reached statistical significance (exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids). In patients on short-acting beta(2)-agonists, 117 people out of 1000 had exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids over 30 weeks, compared to 101 (95% CI 93 to 108) out of 1000 for patients on formoterol as-needed. In patients on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids there were also significantly fewer exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids on formoterol as-needed (Peto OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91). There was one death per 1000 people on formoterol or on short-acting beta(2)-agonists.

Authors' Conclusions

In adults, formoterol was similar to short-acting beta(2)-agonists when used as a reliever, and showed a reduction in the number of exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids. Clinicians should weigh the relatively modest benefits of formoterol as-needed against the benefits of single inhaler therapy and the potential danger of long-term use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists in some patients. We did not find evidence to recommend changes to guidelines that suggest that long-acting beta(2)-agonists should be given only to patients already taking inhaled corticosteroids. There was insufficient information reported from children in the included trials to come to any conclusion on the safety or efficacy of formoterol as relief medication for children with asthma.

### Protocol-based titration of intravenous terbutaline decreases length of stay in pediatric status asthmaticus [^113aKm99]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2006). Low credibility.

Although frequently used to treat status asthmaticus in children, intravenous (IV) terbutaline has not been shown to decrease hospital length of stay (LOS). We theorized that this lack of demonstrable benefit resulted from variations in dosing and titration, rather than the drug per se, and that intensive care unit (ICU) LOS would be shortened by the administration of terbutaline according to a protocol incorporating a quantitative assessment of severity of illness. We prospectively treated 20 consecutive children with status asthmaticus with IV terbutaline according to a protocol that titrated the dose based on a clinical asthma score, the Modified Pulmonary Index Score (MPIS). Data were compared to a historic cohort of the previous 20 consecutive ICU patients with status asthmaticus who were treated with IV terbutaline prior to initiation of the protocol. Patients who received terbutaline by standardized protocol had significantly shorter ICU LOS (3.5 ± 1.1 vs. 5.0 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.01), shorter hospital LOS (5.5 ± 1.3 vs. 8.3 ± 2.7 days, P < 0.01), and reduced hospital charges ($19,298 ± $10,516 vs. $26,528 ± $12,328, P = 0.04). The method of administration of IV terbutaline significantly influenced ICU length of stay and hospital charges.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114iKnji]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children aged 5 years and younger — Step 1 initial treatment: As-needed inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) should be provided to all children who experience wheezing episodes for relief of symptoms, although it is not effective in all children. Use of SABA for the relief of symptoms on average more than twice a week over a 1-month period indicates the need for a trial of low-dose ICS. Initial episodes of wheezing in children < 1 year with infectious bronchiolitis should be managed according to local bronchiolitis guidelines and SABAs are generally ineffective for bronchiolitis. Oral bronchodilator therapy is not recommended due to its slower onset of action and higher rate of side-effects compared with inhaled SABA. For children with intermittent viral-induced wheeze and no interval symptoms, particularly those with underlying atopy (positive for modified API) when inhaled SABA is not sufficient, intermittent high-dose ICS may be considered, but because of the risk of side-effects, this should only be considered if the physician is confident that the treatment will be used appropriately.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116PLN6T]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children 5 years and younger — indications to start controller therapy and manage diagnostic uncertainty: If history and symptoms suggest asthma with uncontrolled respiratory symptoms and/or frequent wheezing, and wheezing episodes are frequent (e.g., three or more episodes in a season), regular controller treatment (usually maintenance low-dose inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]) should be initiated and the response evaluated. Regular ICS treatment may also be indicated for less frequent but more severe viral-induced wheeze. If the diagnosis is in doubt and inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy or antibiotics are needed more than every 6–8 weeks, a trial of regular ICS treatment should be considered and referral for specialist opinion should also be considered. Regarding growth, effects of ICS on growth velocity are seen in the first 1–2 years of treatment, are not progressive or cumulative, and one long-term study showed a difference of only 0.7% in adult height.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for > 24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate > 40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation < 92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^117JcTf9]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous short-acting β2 agonists (IV SABA) in pediatric critical asthma — In balance given this evidence, our panel suggests the use of IV SABA in pediatric critical asthma refractory to standard therapies. Implementation details note that Salbutamol, which is only available in IV formulation in some regions, is the most commonly used agent in the studies reviewed; isoproterenol presents another appealing option for IV SABA therapy because of its short half-life and rapid treatment effect; and a more widely utilized IV SABA agent, terbutaline, presents an advantage in its availability but can also result in a profound IV volume load for patients receiving treatment as well as operational hurdles with infusion preparation (limited vial sizes). Additionally, terbutaline and salbutamol have prolonged half-lives compared with the other agents mentioned, requiring bolus dosing for attainment of steady state within infusion as well as with dose escalations, and safety outcomes for all these therapies are not well described, with the incidence and, more importantly, clinical importance of lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, and tachyarrhythmias with all IV SABA treatment remaining an area of ambiguity, especially at low and moderate dosing.

### Role of budesonide as maintenance therapy for children with asthma [^113zw4iz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are recognized as the preferred long-term control medication for persistent asthma based on their anti-inflammatory properties and significant evidence of efficacy. Inhaled budesonide is the most carefully characterized inhaled corticosteroid for childhood asthma. It is available for administration in children down to six months of age and to date has an excellent safety profile.

Ages 5–11 years quick-relief medications — Use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms; the intensity of treatment depends on severity of symptoms, up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. In Steps 3 and 4, the preferred option includes ICS-formoterol 1 to 2 puffs as needed up to a maximum total daily maintenance and rescue dose of 8 puffs (36 mcg). Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment.

Asthma Treatment Steps for Children 5 Years and Younger

Step 1

Provide inhaled SABA for relief of wheezing episodes. A need for SABA more than twice a week on average over 1 month indicates the need for a trial of controller medication.

Step 2

The preferred option is regular, daily, low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, given for at least 3 months (see Box 6–6 in Referencefor ICS doses). Regular montelukast is less effective than low-dose ICS, and parents/caregivers should be counseled about potential neurobehavioral adverse effects, as in a boxed warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Step 3

Before considering step-up to double the "low" ICS dose, check for concomitant or alternative diagnoses, check and correct inhaler technique and adherence, and ask about risk factors such as exposure to allergens or tobacco smoke. ICS–LABA is not recommended in children < 4 years old, as there are insufficient data about efficacy and safety.

Step 4

Refer the child for expert advice if symptoms and/or flare-ups persist, or at any time if side effects of treatment are observed or suspected, or if there are doubts about diagnosis. See Chapter 6 in Referencefor details about other therapeutic options.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^116z7jSc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing — intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) started at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection have evidence of benefit with important growth considerations. Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence compared short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief, with a 33% relative risk reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids; growth effects were mixed, with a 5% lower gain with intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily for up to 10 days) in one trial and no effect with budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in another. Clinicians should inform caregivers that this treatment could affect growth, should carefully monitor growth, and should reconsider implementing this recommended treatment if any evidence shows a reduced growth rate that cannot be attributed to other factors; although one study comparing short ICS courses with regular daily ICS showed differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison, and no studies produced robust data comparing intermittent ICS with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112Dc1ov]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessing future risk of adverse outcomes in young children with asthma, GINA notes that the relationship between symptom control and future risk has not been sufficiently studied; exacerbations may occur in children after months of apparently good symptom control, but the risk is greater if current symptom control is poor; preschool children at high risk of asthma treated with daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) experienced fewer days with asthma symptoms and a reduced risk of exacerbations than those receiving placebo; the future risk of harm due to excessive doses of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids must also be avoided and can be minimized by ensuring that treatment is appropriate and reduced to the lowest dose that maintains satisfactory symptom control and minimizes exacerbations; the child's height should be measured and recorded at least yearly, as growth velocity may be lower in the first 1–2 years of ICS treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1123fGXN]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Not recommended options and cautions in children 6–11 years — SABA-only treatment is not recommended in children 6–11 years, as for adults and adolescents; children whose asthma is treated with SABA alone (compared with ICS) are at increased risk of asthma-related death (Evidence A) and urgent asthma-related health care (Evidence A), even if they have good symptom control, and in children, dispensing of three or more SABA inhalers in a year is associated with a doubling of risk of emergency department presentation. Oral SABA and theophylline are not recommended because of the higher risk of side-effects and lower efficacy, and no long-term safety studies have been performed to assess the risk of severe exacerbations associated with oral SABA or theophylline use in children not also taking ICS. The rapid-onset LABA, formoterol, is as effective as SABA as a reliever medication in children as well as in adults and reduces the risk of severe exacerbations by 15–45% compared with as-needed SABA, but use of regular or frequent LABA without ICS is strongly discouraged because of the risk of exacerbations (Evidence A).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aZEEc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

Ages 0–4 years asthma quick-relief medications — use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms, with intensity based on severity and up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed; caution that increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [EIB]) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment; consider short course of oral systemic corticosteroid if exacerbation is severe or individual has history of previous severe exacerbations.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol in individuals aged 4 years and older:
No patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma.
The studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations (see below) enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year. The results suggest that such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment.
ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily (depending on age, asthma severity, and ICS dose in the ICS formoterol preparation) and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms. The maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma or their caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that in studies, this intervention consistently reduced asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids. In addition, this intervention improved asthma control and quality of life in some studies. No differences have been documented in harms between this type of therapy and the comparators (ICS or ICS-LABA) in individuals aged 12 years and older. The reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. In children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals with asthma for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance. However, the additional cost of the medication may be offset by the decrease in exacerbations and the associated improvement in quality of life and reduction in costs to both the patient and the payer. A 1-month supply of ICS-formoterol medication that is sufficient for maintenance therapy may not last a month if the inhaler is used for reliever therapy as well. Providers, individuals with asthma, pharmacists, and payers need to be aware of this possibility and prescribe, plan, dispense, or provide coverage accordingly.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma exacerbations and asthma medication side effects are well‐described. However, they rarely cause death or near death in children. Asthma guidelines represent a comprehensive encyclopedia of information for asthma diagnosis and treatment and recommendations that, if followed, are expected to prevent mortality. We describe two illustrative cases in children and explore the possibility that care driven by recommendations in asthma guidelines and FDA package labels would have prevented such outcomes.

Asthma guideline — Recommendation 12 (ICS-formoterol single-inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy) recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy for individuals aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, compared to either a higher-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as daily controller therapy and short-acting beta agonist (SABA) for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS–long-acting beta agonist (LABA) as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy; this is a strong recommendation with high certainty of evidence for ages 12 years and above and moderate certainty of evidence for ages 4 to 11 years.

Immediate transfer to hospital — children ≤ 5 years with asthma is indicated when any of the following are present: at assessment, child unable to speak or drink, cyanosis, "Respiratory rate > 40 per minute", "Oxygen saturation < 92% when breathing room air", or silent chest on auscultation; lack of response to initial bronchodilator treatment including "Lack of response to 6 puffs of inhaled salbutamol [albuterol] (2 separate puffs, repeated 3 times) over 1–2 hours" or "Persisting tachypnea* despite three administrations of inhaled SABA, even if the child shows other clinical signs of improvement"; or a "Social environment that limits delivery of acute treatment, or parent/caregiver unable to manage acute asthma at home". Additionally, "Children with features of a severe exacerbation that fail to resolve within 1–2 hours despite repeated dosing with inhaled SABA must be referred to hospital", other indications include "recurrence of signs of a severe exacerbation within 48 hours", and early attention should be sought for those "aged less than 2 years". During transfer, continue care with "inhaled SABA, oxygen (if available) to maintain saturation 94–98%, and give systemic corticosteroids".

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### The role of ICS-containing rescue therapy versus SABA alone in asthma management today [^114q5MNC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends that short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) monotherapy should no longer be prescribed, and that as-needed combination inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol is the preferred reliever therapy in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. These recommendations are based on the risks of SABA monotherapy, the evidence that ICS-formoterol reliever therapy markedly decreases the occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations compared with SABA reliever therapy alone, and because ICS-formoterol reliever therapy has a favorable risk/benefit profile compared with maintenance ICS plus SABA reliever therapy. Data supporting the use of combination ICS-albuterol reliever therapy in mild asthma are more limited, but there are studies that inform its use in this population. In this review, we compare, using a pros and cons format, the (1) long-term safety and efficacy of ICS-formoterol reliever therapy versus SABA reliever therapy alone, (2) long-term safety and efficacy of ICS-albuterol reliever therapy versus SABA reliever therapy alone, (3) immediate bronchodilator effects of ICS-formoterol versus SABA alone, and (4) clinical and regulatory factors that may inform reliever therapy prescription decisions. By presenting the evidence of these reliever inhaler options, we hope to inform the reader while also calling for necessary future effectiveness and implementation research.

### Minimal effects after a massive intravenous terbutaline overdose in a child [^1118cTPs]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A 22-kg female in early childhood with a history of reactive airway disease presented to a paediatric emergency department with acute shortness of breath, tachypnoea and wheezing. Despite treatment with albuterol and corticosteroids, her bronchospasm persisted, prompting the administration of terbutaline. The patient received 220 mcg (10 mcg/kg) terbutaline intravenously, followed immediately by an inadvertent supratherapeutic intravenous dose of 10000 mcg (454.5 mcg/kg). The patient's laboratory results obtained minutes after the medication error were notable for: potassium, 3.1mmol/L, lactate, 2.6mmol/L and troponin I, 0.30ng/mL (normal < 0.03ng/mL). Over the next 48 hours, serial serum troponin values decreased. The patient was discharged home approximately 72 hours after the initial presentation and she remained well based on follow-up calls over the next several months. Given the timing and trend of troponin concentrations, we do not believe the terbutaline overdose to be responsible for the myocardial injury.

### Addition of intravenous beta (2)-agonists to inhaled beta (2)-agonists for acute asthma [^113oU8bQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled beta-agonist therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. This review evaluates the benefit of an additional use of intravenous beta(2)-agonist agents.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of adding intravenous (IV) beta(2)-agonists to inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy for acute asthma treated in the emergency department.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL as well as handsearching of 20 respiratory journals. Bibliographies from included studies and known reviews were also searched. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. The search was performed in September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented to the emergency department with acute asthma and were treated with IV beta(2)-agonists with inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy and existing standard treatments versus inhaled beta(2)-agonists and existing standard treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and confirmed their findings with corresponding authors of trials. We obtained missing data from authors or calculated from data present in the papers. We used fixed-effect model for odds ratios (OR) and for mean differences (MD) we used both fixed-effect and random-effects models and reported 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

From 109 potentially relevant studies only three (104 patients) met our inclusion criteria: Bogie 2007 (46 children), Browne 1997 (29 children) and Nowak 2010 (29 adults). Bogie 2007 investigated the addition of intravenous terbutaline to high dose nebulised albuterol in children with acute severe asthma, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Browne 1997 investigated the benefit of adding intravenous salbutamol to inhaled salbutamol in children with acute severe asthma in the emergency department. Nowak 2010 investigated addition of IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids) among adults, and was reported as a conference abstract only. There was no significant advantage (OR 0.29; 95%CI 0.06 to 1.38, one trial, 29 adults) for adding IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids) with regard to hospitalisation rates. Various outcome indicators for the length of stay were reported among the trials. Browne 1997 reported a significantly shorter recovery time (in terms of cessation of 30 minute salbutamol) for children in the IV salbutamol with inhaled salbutamol group (four hours) versus the 11.1 hours for the inhaled salbutamol group (P = 0.03). Time to cessation of hourly nebuliser was also significantly shorter (P = 0.02) for the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group (11.5 hours versus 21.2 hours), and they were ready for emergency patient discharge on average 9.7 hours earlier than the inhaled salbutamol group (P < 0.05). In a paediatric ICU study Bogie 2007 reported no significant advantage in length of paediatric ICU admission (hours) for adding IV terbutaline to nebulised albuterol (MD -12.95, 95% CI: -38.74, 12.84). Browne 1997 reported there were only six out of 14 children with a pulmonary index score above six in the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group at two hours compared with 14 of the 15 in the inhaled salbutamol group (P = 0.02)In Browne 1997 there was a higher proportion of tremor in the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group than in the inhaled salbutamol group (P < 0.02). Nowak 2010 did not report any statistically significant adverse effects associated with adding IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids). Troponin levels were elevated in three children in the IV terbutaline + nebulised albuterol group at 12 and 24 hours in Bogie 2007

Authors' Conclusions

There is very limited evidence from one study (Browne 1997) to support the use of IV beta(2)-agonists in children with severe acute asthma with respect to shorter recovery time, and similarly there is limited evidence (again from one study Browne 1997) suggesting benefit with regard to pulmonary index scores; however this advantage needs to be considered carefully in relation to the increased side effects associated with IV beta(2)-agonists. We identified no significant benefits for adults with severe acute asthma. Until more, adequately powered, high quality clinical trials in this area are conducted it is not possible to form a robust evaluation of the addition of IV beta(2)-agonists in children or adults with severe acute asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114hLwH7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

Montelukast for intermittent pediatric wheezing/asthma — trial results: "Three studies have examined the potential role of intermittent montelukast therapy in young children, with modest overall results". In children "2 to 14 years of age with intermittent asthma", montelukast started "at the onset of an upper RTI or asthma symptoms and continued for at least 7 days resulted in modest decreases in health care usage and symptom severity but no effect on OCS use, episode duration, or SABA use". Starting montelukast with albuterol in children "1 to 5 years of age with severe intermittent wheezing also did not decrease OCS use but did lessen symptom severity… compared with use of albuterol alone". In children "6 months to 5 years of age with episodic wheezing", daily and episodic montelukast vs placebo showed "no difference… in the number of episodes culminating in an asthma attack over the 1-year study".

Ages 5–11 years terminology and monitoring — The terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler, and where formoterol is specified in the steps, it is because the evidence is based on studies specific to formoterol. In individuals ages 5–11 years with persistent allergic asthma in which there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement is conditionally recommended as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessment.

### Bronchodilatory effect of inhaled budesonide / formoterol and budesonide / salbutamol in acute asthma: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^115GLJMA]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchial asthma is one of the commonest chronic respiratory illnesses encountered in clinical practice in both adults and children. Asthma therapeutics can be broadly divided into long-term controllers and short-term reliever medications. Among inhaled bronchodilators, short acting beta agonists (SABA) like salbutamol and terbutaline are preferred in acute asthma exacerbations while inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay for long term treatment of asthma. In moderate to severe persistent asthma, long acting beta agonists (LABA) like salmeterol and formoterol are added to ICS. Efficacy and safety of LABA has been demonstrated in both adult and young asthmatics.

It is desirable to have a single inhaled medication that can be used as both reliever and controller; formoterol is likely to be one such agent as it has both rapid onset and long lasting action. This will facilitate use of a single formulation (ICS + Formoterol) in children with persistent asthma. Few studies performed in adults with acute asthma exacerbation have demonstrated that formoterol was as efficacious and well tolerated as salbutamol. Rodrigo et al. identified nine randomized controlled trials (576 patients; 3 trials included children) comparing formoterol with SABAs in acute exacerbation; no significant difference was detected between formoterol and salbutamol in clinical and spirometric parameters.

Individuals ages 12+ years — Use SABA as needed for symptoms. The intensity of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms; up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. In steps 3 and 4, the preferred option includes the use of ICS-formoterol 1 to 2 puffs as needed up to a maximum total daily maintenance and rescue dose of 12 puffs (54 mcg). Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 10 can be found in EtD Table XIV in Appendix B.

The studies showed no differences in asthma control, quality of life, or use of rescue therapy with the two types of intermittent ICS therapy (ICS paired with albuterol in two studies and ICS for worsening asthma symptoms in one study) and daily ICS treatment in three studies with high certainty of evidence in individuals aged 12 years and older. The three studies also showed no differences in numbers of exacerbations between groups, but the strength of evidence on exacerbations was low. However, none of these studies was powered as an equivalence study, so the Expert Panel issued a conditional recommendation.

The Expert Panel made no recommendation for children aged 4 to 11 years because only low certainty of evidence was available from one small study by Martinez et althat addressed this question in this age group (EtD Table XV). Although the systematic review reportincluded one study in children aged 5 to 10 years, this study was not included in the EtD tables. In that study, all children received regular ICS treatment for 6 months. For the next 12 months, children were randomized to receive either intermittent ICS treatment or continued daily low-dose ICS treatment. Children in the continuous ICS group experienced significantly fewer exacerbations per individual (0.97) than those in the intermittent group (1.69; p = 0.008). However, the intermittent group had a greater increase in height after 6 months than the group that maintained regular therapy during months 6 to 18. The Expert Panel concluded that the use of regular ICS therapy for 6 months before intermittent therapy made this study's results difficult to interpret in the context of the key question.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel identified the following topics that would benefit from additional research:
Differences by race and ethnicity in benefits and risks of the ICS recommendations
Cost-effectiveness of the ICS recommendations
Effects on growth of short ICS courses starting at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection in children aged 0 to 4 years who have recurrent wheezing triggered only by such infections
Optimal short-course ICS regimen to use — on the basis of efficacy, effectiveness, and safety — at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection in children aged 0 to 4 years whose recurrent wheezing is triggered by respiratory tract infections
Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of a short ICS course starting at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection compared with daily ICS treatment in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections
Daily low-dose ICS treatment with SABA for quick relief versus as-needed ICS plus SABA administered concomitantly in children aged 4 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma
Optimal dose of albuterol and ICS used for as-needed concomitant therapy in individuals with mild persistent asthma
Effectiveness and safety of other rapid-onset LABAs in combination medications used for both daily controller and quick-relief therapy
Combination ICS-formoterol as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared with higher-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy in children aged 4 to 11 years

Other recommended types of research included the following:
Confirmation of the efficacy data supporting the ICS recommendations using additional real-world effectiveness studies in clearly defined populations using clearly defined treatment regimens
Additional studies powered as equivalence studies to confirm the finding that daily low-dose ICS therapy with SABA for quick relief and concomitant as-needed ICS therapy plus SABA lead to similar outcomes in individuals with mild persistent asthma
Real-world studies that monitor growth in children and adherence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of quadrupling the ICS dose in individuals with mild to moderate persistent asthma taking daily ICS controller therapy who experience early signs of loss of asthma control

### Intravenous bronchodilators in pediatric critical asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114jZgmS]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Pediatric critical asthma is one of the most common pediatric illnesses in children admitted to the pediatric ward and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Adjunct intravenous (IV) bronchodilators are often used when initial management with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled short‐acting beta agonists (SABA) fail to provide improvement in a patient's clinical condition. While the recent guidelines gave recommendations for the use of different IV bronchodilators compared to placebo, it did not include ranking on which one should be used as first‐line or second‐line agent. The aim of this network meta‐analysis is to determine the effect of IV bronchodilators on patient‐centered outcomes and rank medications based on their effectiveness in these outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using three databases MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to identify randomized control trials examining the use of IV magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4), IV methylxanthines (aminophylline or theophylline), IV SABA (salbutamol, terbutaline) in pediatric critical asthma patients. Bayesian network metanalytic framework was used to compare the interventions. Results are reported as odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% Credible Interval (CrI).

Results

Twelve trials (n = 852) were included in the network meta‐analysis. Largest reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS), PICU admission, and PICU LOS were noted with IV MgSO 4; (MD: −3.1 days, 95% CrI: −6.9 days to 0.13 days), (OR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.02, 1.3), and (MD: −4.0 days, 95% CrI: −7.1 days to −1.2 days) respectively. IV MgSO 4 was ranked first in three outcomes of interest with Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA) of 0.884 for hospital LOS, 0.919 for PICU admission, and 0.957 for PICU LOS. For preventing intubation, IV SABA was ranked the highest (SUCRA 0.995), but the only study with IV SABA had zero intubation events. In a sensitivity analysis that excluded studies with zero events, the intubation rate was lowest with IV MgSO 4 (OR 0.10; 95% CrI 0.003, 0.88) and it was ranked the best treatment (SUCRA 0.921).

Conclusions

In this network meta‐analysis comparing different IV adjunct bronchodilators, IV MgSO 4 was ranked first followed by IV SABA, and then IV methylxanthines. Given these findings and the favorable safety profile, ease of use, and low cost, IV MgSO 4 appears most promising the first adjunct IV bronchodilator, however, further large high‐quality trials are still needed before it can be endorsed as routine first‐line agent.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Chronic inhaled corticosteroids do not affect the course of acute severe asthma exacerbations in children [^114DJ4AH]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) suppresses airway inflammation and increases airway responsiveness to beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists. We hypothesized that the chronic use of ICS would be associated with shorter duration of hospitalization in severely ill children with status asthmaticus. An 8-year retrospective chart review was conducted of all children admitted to the ICU with status asthmaticus. During the study period, 241 children were admitted, and 44% reported the use of chronic ICS. ICS use was associated with increased baseline asthma severity, previous hospitalization for asthma, and public insurance status. However, ICS use had no effect on hospital or ICU length of stay, type, and duration of treatments received, or the rate of recovery determined by a standard severity of illness scoring system. In the subsets of patients including children with persistent asthma and those who received intravenous terbutaline, there was also no improvement in outcomes with the use of chronic ICS showing that the chronic use of ICS did not improve response to beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists in severely ill children with status asthmaticus. Although useful as a preventive therapy, the chronic use of ICS does not appear to affect the course of severe acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients once hospitalized.

Emergency treatment and initial pharmacotherapy — oxygen directs clinicians to treat hypoxemia urgently with oxygen by face mask to achieve and maintain percutaneous oxygen saturation 94–98% (Evidence A). The text notes the potential for overestimation of oxygen saturation in people with dark skin color. To avoid hypoxemia during changes in treatment, acutely distressed children should be treated immediately with oxygen and SABA, using 2.5 mg of salbutamol or equivalent diluted in 3 mL of sterile normal saline delivered by an oxygen-driven nebulizer, and this treatment should not be delayed and may be given before full assessment is completed; transient hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch may occur during treatment with SABAs.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 9 is in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence, compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk (RR) reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects on this outcome. Ducharme et alfound a 5% lower gain in height and weight in study participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) than in participants receiving a placebo. The authors noted a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et aldid not find an effect on linear growth of budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in comparison with placebo in children with an "identified respiratory tract illness". Whether these differences in growth effects were due to differences in drugs, doses, duration of treatment, or other factors is not clear.

Rationale and discussion

The main comparator for which data are available is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation for this therapy starting at the on set of an apparent respiratory tract infection for children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing. Although one study that compared short ICS courses with regular daily ICS treatment showed no differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids with moderate certainty of evidence, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison because this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate equivalence. No studies produced robust data on comparisons of intermittent ICS use with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

Question 4.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to ICS controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 10: In individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends either daily low-dose ICS and as needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### Slow-responders to IV beta2-adrenergic agonist therapy: defining a novel phenotype in pediatric asthma [^1129rNY7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

While aerosolized administration of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) agonists is the mainstay of treatment for pediatric asthma exacerbations, the efficacy of intravenous (IV) delivery is controversial. Failure to demonstrate improved outcomes with IV beta(2)-AR agonists may be due to phenotypic differences within this patient population. Our hypothesis is that children who respond more slowly to IV beta(2)-AR agonist therapy comprise a distinct phenotype.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all children admitted to the ICU for status asthmaticus who were treated with IV terbutaline between December 2002 and September 2006.

Results

Seventy-eight children were treated with IV terbutaline according to guidelines that adjusted the dose by clinical asthma score. After examining the histogram of duration of terbutaline infusions, a 48-hr cutoff was chosen to define responsiveness. Thirty-eight (49%) children were slow-responders by this definition. There were no significant differences in baseline asthma severity or severity on admission between the slow-responders and responders. Slow-responders required significantly higher total doses of IV terbutaline, higher maximum administration rates, and had longer ICU and hospital length of stay.

Conclusion

There were significant differences in outcomes between the responders and slow-responders without differences in acute or chronic illness severity. Other factors may have lead to slower response to IV beta(2)-agonist therapy.

### Description of the protocol for the PRACTICAL study: a randomised controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of ICS / LABA reliever therapy in asthma [^112GJDqZ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In adult asthma, combination inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/fast-onset long-acting beta agonist (LABA) used solely as reliever therapy may represent an effective and safe alternative to ICS maintenance and short-acting beta agonist (SABA) reliever therapy.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of ICS/fast-onset LABA reliever therapy with ICS maintenance and SABA reliever therapy in adults with asthma.

Methods and analysis

A 52-week, open-label, parallel group, multicentre, phase III randomised controlled trial with 1:1 randomisation to either budesonide/formoterol Turbuhaler 200/6 µg, one actuation as required for symptom relief, or budesonide Turbuhaler 200 µg, one actuation twice daily and terbutaline Turbuhaler 250 µg, two actuations as required for symptom relief. 890 adults aged 18–75 years with asthma for whom maintenance ICS and SABA reliever therapy is indicated by current guidelines will be recruited in New Zealand. The primary outcome variable is the rate of severe exacerbations per patient per year. This study will investigate a novel treatment regimen that might lead to a paradigm shift in asthma management for adults for whom guidelines currently recommend maintenance ICS and SABA reliever therapy.

Ethics and dissemination

Ethical approval has been granted (15/NTB/178). Study findings will be published according to Iinternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors' recommendations.

Future research opportunities — The Expert Panel identified topics that would benefit from additional research. Priorities include differences by race and ethnicity in benefits and risks of the ICS recommendations and the cost-effectiveness of the ICS recommendations. Additional comparative work includes daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief versus as-needed ICS plus SABA administered concomitantly in children aged 4 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma and additional studies powered as equivalence studies to confirm whether daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief and concomitant as-needed ICS plus SABA lead to similar outcomes in individuals with mild persistent asthma. Real-world studies that monitor growth in children and adherence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of quadrupling the ICS dose in individuals with mild to moderate persistent asthma taking daily ICS controller therapy who experience early signs of loss of asthma control are also identified.

Asthma — SMART in milder asthma and in children aged 4 to 11 years — was assessed in post hoc analyses showing that among 1239 participants aged 12 years and older with milder asthma (daily maintenance ICS dose equal to 400 μg or less budesonide equivalent), SMART reduced exacerbations overall, but in those with the mildest asthma at enrollment (rescue SABA use of ≤ 1 inhalation/d) benefit was marginal and statistically nonsignificant; in a pediatric analysis of 224 children aged 4 to 11 years on medium to high ICS doses (200–500 μg daily), SMART used budesonide-formoterol 80/4.5 μg once daily with up to seven additional rescue puffs (total daily dose of 36 μg formoterol) versus budesonide 320 μg daily with SABA, yielding a 57% drop in the RR for a composite exacerbation measure, significantly fewer nighttime awakenings, lower daily ICS dose (average 123 vs 320 μg), and improved growth rates (adjusted mean difference of 1 cm compared with fixed-dose budesonide).

Intermittent inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dosing — operational definitions for this section are as follows: Intermittent ICS dosing includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), and does not refer to a single regimen with its definition specified in each recommendation; controller therapy refers to medications taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma; the terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler; quick-relief therapy refers to medications such as an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations, and in this section as-needed dosing is intermittent and based on the patient's decision; the definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICS are based on EPR-3; a puff refers to a single actuation and inhalation; and recurrent wheezing is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

Children 6–11 years Step 3 — preferred options, after checking inhaler technique and adherence and treating modifiable risk factors, are: increase ICS to medium dose plus as-needed SABA reliever (Evidence A); change to combination low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA reliever (Evidence A); or switch to maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with a very low dose of ICS-formoterol (Evidence B). Evidence cited includes a large study of children aged 4–11 years in which combination ICS-LABA was non-inferior to the same dose of ICS alone for severe exacerbations with no difference in symptom control or reliever use, and a single study of MART with very low-dose budesonide-formoterol (100/6 metered dose, 80/4.5 mcg delivered dose for both maintenance and reliever) that showed a large reduction in exacerbations compared with the same dose of budesonide-formoterol plus SABA reliever or compared with higher-dose ICS; because individual children's responses vary, clinicians are advised to "try the other controller options above before considering Step 4 treatment".

### A comparison of tiotropium, long-acting β-agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists on lung function and exacerbations in paediatric patients with asthma [^113WWnpg]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Lay summary

It can be difficult for doctors to decide which treatment is best to prescribe to children and adolescents with asthma to help reduce their symptoms. In this review, we weigh up the available evidence on three asthma treatments that work in different ways. We looked at two types of inhalers and one type of medicine that is either swallowed as a tablet or granules. The two inhalers helped to improve lung function more than the oral medication, which may be due to their different modes of action. All three treatments were found to be as safe as a placebo.

20 recommend a stepwise approach to pharmacologic treatment starting with the most aggressive therapy necessary to achieve control, followed by a "step down" to the minimal therapy that will maintain control. The goals of pharmacologic therapy are to minimize daytime and nocturnal symptoms, the number of asthma episodes and the use of short-acting beta agonists, to improve PEF to 80 percent or more of personal best and to allow the child to maintain normal activities without producing adverse medication side effects. acute symptoms and before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. 26 Oral corticosteroids have broad anti-inflammatory effects and may be used in a limited, short course to gain initial control of the asthma and speed resolution of moderate-persistent or severe-persistent exacerbations. 26 The anticholinergic drug ipratropium is not approved by the U. S.

Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma in children 12 years or younger. However, it has been prescribed for off-label use in children with asthma and may be helpful in those rare children who do not tolerate inhaled beta. 26 They are not a substitute for anti-inflammatory medications and should not be used to treat patients with acute symptoms or exacerbations. The FDA approved a long-acting beta 2 agonist, salmeterol, for treatment of asthma in children 12 years and older. It may provide 24-hour bronchodilation with twice-daily dosing and may reduce nocturnal asthma symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Theophylline produces mild-to-moderate bronchodilation and may be used as add-on therapy with anti-inflammatory medications. 26 However, theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, variable clearance rates, drug interactions and serious side effects; therefore, monitoring of blood levels is required.

Theophylline is reserved for the treatment of patients with severe asthma, when polypharmacy is necessary. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are first-line, daily anti-inflammatory inhaled agents that inhibit early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction, with virtually no serious side effects and no known drug interactions. 26 These medications are available in MDI and nebulizer formulations; however, frequent administration is required, which may discourage compliance. 24 Furthermore, these agents are less effective than corticosteroids in many patients. Nedocromil's bitter taste may discourage compliance in some children.
