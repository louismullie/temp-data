## Question

What is the recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy is after PCI with DES, individualized by clinical presentation, stent type, and competing ischemic versus bleeding risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical categories: ACS versus CCS. Then, I should verify how stent generation modifies risk. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations and their evidentiary basis. After that, I need to check risk stratification tools like the DAPT score and bleeding scores. Then, I will examine scenario-based options for ACS and CCS, including very short DAPT and extended DAPT. I should also confirm how device iteration and complex PCI features influence duration. Finally, I will synthesize a personalized recommendation and outline implementation and follow-up with attention to de-escalation strategies such as P2Y12 monotherapy and perioperative or anticoagulation considerations [^1119qHzu] [^111k3qxU] [^1148NiUZ].

> Let me first confirm the key clinical buckets and baseline evidence signals that frame duration choices, because if I misclassify the patient or the stent, the downstream recommendations will be off. Patients present either with ACS (STEMI/NSTEMI/unstable angina) or CCS, and second‑generation DES generally carry lower late stent thrombosis risk than first‑generation devices, permitting consideration of shorter DAPT in appropriately selected patients, which is supported by meta-analytic data showing less bleeding and no clear ischemic harm with shorter courses in many settings, albeit with nuances I will revisit shortly [^112jQNoJ]. Hold on, I should verify real‑world longitudinal signals: in a large VA cohort treated exclusively with second‑generation DES, early discontinuation before 9 months was uncommon and associated with higher mortality, whereas stopping after 9 months associated with lower death, MI, and major bleeding, suggesting that beyond the early hazard window, prolonged DAPT may confer diminishing returns or even tradeoffs in broader populations [^111wq3G4] [^112bFgXL].

> Next, I should review guideline foundations and make sure I am not overgeneralizing across ACS and CCS. Historically, ACS has carried a Class I recommendation for 12 months of DAPT, largely extrapolated from CURE-era comparisons of DAPT versus no DAPT rather than head‑to‑head duration trials, and this convention persists as a default in many pathways even as evidence evolves [^1148NiUZ]. For CCS with DES, 6 months has been the traditional minimum, though multiple RCTs and network meta-analyses have challenged the necessity of 12 months in stable presentations and support shorter courses in selected patients to mitigate bleeding without excess ischemia, while acknowledging signal variability for MI in some subgroups and analyses [^111k3qxU]. Wait, let me verify a contemporary European stance specific to CCS: ESC 2024 CCS guidance explicitly recommends considering cessation of DAPT at 1–3 months after PCI in patients who are not at high bleeding or ischemic risk and who do not require oral anticoagulation, which is important but should not be indiscriminately applied to ACS by mistake [^1119qHzu].

> I will now examine risk stratification, because duration should be individualized rather than "one‑size‑fits‑all". The DAPT score consistently separates ischemic and bleeding propensity in opposite directions; patients with DAPT score ≥ 2 tend to derive greater benefit from prolonged therapy on net adverse clinical events than those with lower scores, though the effect modification is imperfect and warrants shared decision‑making [^113pHuq4]. Let me check for prospective integration: the PARTHENOPE trial operationalizes a personalized strategy where DAPT score < 2 steers to 3 or 6 months (CCS or ACS, respectively) and DAPT score ≥ 2 to 24 months, directly testing score‑guided versus standard 12‑month DAPT in an all‑comers cohort, which is precisely the framework many clinicians seek to implement [^1176JxFe]. I should confirm bleeding risk tools' performance: meta‑analytic assessments of bleeding scores show only modest discrimination, so while PRECISE‑DAPT or ARC‑HBR criteria can guide caution, they should not supersede clinical judgment when signals conflict [^115ky6q3].

> Now, let me consider ACS with second‑generation DES as the common, high‑stakes scenario. The conventional default remains 12 months, but I need to be careful not to conflate composition with duration: many trials optimized the P2Y12 agent rather than duration per se, and modern data allow some tailoring [^1148NiUZ]. Wait, I should double‑check abbreviated strategies: a meta‑analysis of RCTs comparing 3 versus 12 months in ACS showed significantly less major bleeding with 3 months and no increase in MACE, MI, or definite stent thrombosis overall, but heterogeneity exists and patient selection matters, especially regarding potency of the P2Y12 inhibitor and early hazard periods [^1159xhBy]. Hold on, SMART‑DATE flagged an increased MI risk with 6‑month DAPT versus ≥ 12 months in an Asian cohort largely on clopidogrel, a cautionary signal for too‑aggressive shortening in certain populations or with less potent P2Y12 therapy [^11172mxj]. Let me verify the broader network view: a 2024 network meta‑analysis in ACS suggests short DAPT followed by P2Y12 monotherapy can maintain ischemic protection while reducing bleeding, particularly when potent inhibitors are used, but I should emphasize these results depend on adherence and careful early management [^114PKmPg].

> For CCS with second‑generation DES, I should confirm how far we can reasonably shorten. Traditional guidance sets 6 months as a baseline, yet multiple RCTs and network meta‑analyses support shorter DAPT in stable presentations with newer‑generation DES, reducing bleeding without clear ischemic penalty at a population level, though some analyses note a small MI signal favoring longer courses that must be weighed against bleeding harm [^111k3qxU]. Hmm, wait a minute, shorter DAPT in second‑generation DES meta‑analysis did show an MI disadvantage alongside less major bleeding, underscoring the need to individualize rather than default to ultra‑short therapy for everyone [^111Yb4ps]. Still, ESC 2024 CCS guidance allows 1–3 months DAPT in low‑risk patients with no OAC needs, which I should apply only when both ischemic and bleeding risk are favorable, and when stent and procedural factors are straightforward [^1119qHzu].

> I need to ensure device iteration is fully integrated because stent generation materially changes late risk. First‑generation DES carry higher late and very late stent thrombosis risk from delayed healing and hypersensitivity, such that extended DAPT may be reasonable if bleeding risk is acceptable, whereas second‑generation DES generally allow consideration of shorter DAPT in many patients without compromising safety, especially beyond the early months when endothelialization is more complete [^114mDUzw] [^116gRPar]. But wait, I should verify mortality tradeoffs with long DAPT in modern DES: a comprehensive network meta‑analysis found that long‑term DAPT (> 12 months) increased major bleeding and non‑cardiac death compared with short‑term courses, with a concerning signal for higher all‑cause mortality in newer‑generation DES recipients, which argues against indiscriminate extension beyond a year in unselected second‑generation DES populations [^112jQNoJ].

> Let me consider who might benefit from extended DAPT despite these tradeoffs. Complex PCI characteristics such as multiple vessels treated, ≥ 3 stents, ≥ 3 lesions, bifurcations with 2 stents, total stent length > 60 mm, or CTO have been associated with higher ischemic risk and observationally greater MACE reduction with longer DAPT, though I should acknowledge variability and the limitations of pooled patient‑level analyses for duration inference [^113jNuoZ]. I should also review high‑risk clinical phenotypes: prior MI cohorts like those in PEGASUS‑TIMI 54 showed reduced ischemic events with prolonged potent therapy but at the expense of more bleeding, reinforcing the need to match extension to ischemic risk tolerance and bleeding susceptibility rather than extending by default [^11172mxj] [^114Wneuq]. Diabetes often portends higher residual ischemic risk and may tilt the balance toward longer therapy in carefully selected patients, but I must be cautious because supportive datasets are heterogeneous and bleeding concerns remain paramount [^116GXUhy].

> I will now examine the emerging strategy of aspirin discontinuation with P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after a short DAPT lead‑in, because this is increasingly relevant to bleeding mitigation. Several contemporary RCTs and pooled analyses indicate that transitioning to P2Y12 inhibitor–based single antiplatelet therapy after 1–3 months of DAPT reduces major bleeding without increasing major adverse ischemic outcomes with newer‑generation DES, particularly when ticagrelor is used, though clopidogrel strategies exist and require attention to CYP2C19 loss‑of‑function prevalence and adherence [^112h6Knx]. Wait, let me verify pooled clinical trial safety of early aspirin withdrawal: meta‑analytic data support dropping aspirin around 3 months and continuing a P2Y12 inhibitor to lower bleeding while maintaining ischemic protection, but call for guideline alignment and individualized decision‑making as practice evolves [^111KY7Sa].

> Implementation and monitoring must be deliberate, so I should map out how to apply this at the point of care. First, I should double‑check DAPT and bleeding risk scores at index PCI and early follow‑up, recognizing that bleeding scores have only modest discrimination and should complement — not replace — clinical judgment, documentation, and shared decision‑making around values and risk tolerance [^115ky6q3]. Next, I need to ensure early hazards are covered: even in patients requiring oral anticoagulation, dual therapy with OAC plus clopidogrel typically follows a very short period of triple therapy — about the length of stay up to 1 week — because the early post‑PCI window is the most thrombotic and merits careful protection before de‑escalation to reduce bleeding risk [^11172mxj]. Finally, I should verify adherence and reassess at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, because observational VA data suggest that very early DAPT cessation may reflect confounding by frailty and social determinants with high near‑term mortality, whereas cessation after about 9 months in second‑generation DES has associated with lower subsequent death, MI, and bleeding, a pattern that supports thoughtful de‑escalation after the early hazard period when risk permits [^114kqwYy] [^112bFgXL].

> Synthesis and practical recommendations require reconciling seemingly conflicting findings, so let me lay out a clinically coherent approach. Default durations remain 12 months for ACS and 6 months for CCS after newer‑generation DES when risks are balanced, recognizing that these historical standards were not born from duration trials and can be flexed in modern practice when individualized assessment supports it [^1148NiUZ] [^111k3qxU]. For low‑risk CCS with second‑generation DES, consider 1–3 months DAPT then P2Y12 monotherapy if anatomy is straightforward and neither bleeding nor ischemic risk is high, in line with ESC 2024 CCS guidance, while monitoring closely for adherence and early events [^1119qHzu] [^112h6Knx]. For ACS, maintain 12 months in most patients, but in high bleeding risk or when guided by validated scores and potent P2Y12 therapy, consider 3–6 months followed by P2Y12 monotherapy, acknowledging SMART‑DATE's MI signal with 6 months of mostly clopidogrel and the Bayesian network evidence supporting short DAPT plus P2Y12 monotherapy in selected cohorts; conversely, in very high ischemic risk — prior MI, complex PCI, diabetes, multivessel disease — consider extending beyond 12 months if bleeding risk is low and the patient values greater ischemic protection despite bleeding tradeoffs, revisiting the plan at regular intervals [^11172mxj] [^1159xhBy] [^114PKmPg] [^113jNuoZ] [^114Wneuq] [^113pHuq4]. But wait, I should reiterate one correction I nearly glossed over: the ESC 2024 1–3 month cessation recommendation applies to CCS, not universally to ACS, so I must avoid overextending that advice to ACS without careful risk‑based justification and evidence alignment [^1119qHzu] [^111k3qxU] [^1148NiUZ].

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration should be **individualized** based on clinical context and risk [^112jQNoJ]. For **ACS** treated with PCI, **12 months** of DAPT is standard [^1148NiUZ], with extension to 30 months for high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk [^114Wneuq], and shortening to 6 months if bleeding risk is high [^113pHuq4]. For stable CAD with PCI, **6 months** is typical [^116gRPar], shortened to 3 months if bleeding risk is high [^111k3qxU], and extended to 12 months for complex PCI [^113jNuoZ] or high ischemic risk [^113pHuq4]. After CABG, 12 months is recommended; for medically managed ACS, 12 months [^115kBR6X]; and for TIA/stroke, 21–90 days. Use **DAPT** [^113pHuq4] and **PRECISE-DAPT scores** [^115ky6q3] to guide duration, and reassess regularly.

---

## General principles guiding DAPT duration

- **Balance of risks**: DAPT reduces ischemic events [^1148NiUZ] but increases bleeding [^112jQNoJ]; duration should balance these risks [^114PKmPg].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Clinical presentation, stent type [^112Zs4yi], procedural complexity [^113pHuq4], and bleeding risk determine duration.

- **Risk scores**: DAPT [^113pHuq4] and PRECISE-DAPT scores [^115ky6q3] help tailor duration to individual risk profiles.

---

## Recommended DAPT duration by clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended DAPT duration** | **Rationale and evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| ACS treated with PCI | 12 months (standard) [^1148NiUZ] | - Reduces ischemic events <br/> - Extend to 30 months if high ischemic/low bleeding risk [^114Wneuq] <br/> - Shorten to 6 months if high bleeding risk [^111k3qxU] [^113pHuq4] |
| Stable CAD treated with PCI | 6 months (standard) [^116gRPar] | - Shorten to 3 months if high bleeding risk <br/> - Extend to 12 months for complex PCI [^113jNuoZ] or high ischemic risk [^113pHuq4] |
| CABG | 12 months | Reduces graft thrombosis and ischemic events |
| Medically managed ACS | 12 months | Reduces recurrent ischemic events [^115kBR6X] |
| TIA or minor ischemic stroke | 21–90 days | Reduces recurrent stroke without excess bleeding |

## Factors influencing DAPT duration

### Patient-specific factors

- **Ischemic risk**: Prior MI, diabetes, complex PCI [^111X1Hq9], multivessel disease [^113pHuq4], and ACS favor longer DAPT.

- **Bleeding risk**: Age, prior bleeding, renal dysfunction [^113pHuq4], and anticoagulation favor shorter DAPT.

- **Risk scores**: DAPT score ≥ 2 supports prolonged DAPT [^113pHuq4]; PRECISE-DAPT ≥ 25 supports shorter DAPT [^115ky6q3].

---

### Procedural factors

Procedural factors influencing DAPT duration include stent type [^113pHuq4]; **newer-generation DES** permit shorter courses [^116gRPar], whereas first-generation DES may warrant longer therapy [^114mDUzw]. Greater procedural complexity — such as multiple stents, long lesions, bifurcations [^113jNuoZ], or CTOs — favors **longer DAPT**.

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged versus shortened DAPT

Prolonged DAPT (> 12 months) **reduces myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis** [^111X1Hq9] but **increases major bleeding** [^112jQNoJ], with net benefit mainly in patients at high ischemic and low bleeding risk [^1148NiUZ]. Shortened DAPT (< 6 months) **lowers bleeding** [^111k3qxU] without increasing ischemic events [^116gRPar] in patients with low ischemic and high bleeding risk [^113pHuq4].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

- **ACS with PCI**: 12 months standard [^1148NiUZ]; extend to 30 months if high ischemic/low bleeding risk [^114Wneuq]; shorten to 6 months if high bleeding risk [^111k3qxU].

- **Stable CAD with PCI**: 6 months standard [^116gRPar]; shorten to 3 months if high bleeding risk; extend to 12 months for complex PCI [^113jNuoZ] or high ischemic risk [^113pHuq4].

- **CABG**: 12 months recommended.

- **Medically managed ACS**: 12 months recommended [^115kBR6X].

- **TIA or minor ischemic stroke**: 21–90 days recommended.

---

## Emerging evidence and ongoing research

Emerging evidence supports **shorter DAPT (1–3 months)** [^1119qHzu] followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy in selected patients [^112h6Knx] [^111KY7Sa]. Ongoing trials, including PARTHENOPE, are evaluating personalized, risk score–guided DAPT durations [^1176JxFe].

---

## Practical clinical approach

A practical approach is to first **assess ischemic and bleeding risk** using the DAPT [^113pHuq4] and PRECISE-DAPT scores [^115ky6q3], then set a baseline duration of **12 months for ACS and 6 months for stable CAD** [^112jQNoJ]. **Adjust the duration** — extend for high ischemic/low bleeding risk [^114Wneuq], shorten for high bleeding risk [^111k3qxU] — and **reassess regularly** as clinical status evolves.

---

DAPT duration should be **individualized** to balance ischemic and bleeding risks, with 12 months for ACS and 6 months for stable CAD as defaults, then adjusted by risk scores and clinical factors [^116gRPar].

### Efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy after complex PCI [^113jNuoZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Optimal upfront dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) remains unclear. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of long-term (≥ 12 months) versus short-term (3 or 6 months) DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel according to PCI complexity.

- **Methods**: The authors pooled patient-level data from 6 randomized controlled trials investigating DAPT durations after PCI. Complex PCI was defined as having at least one of the following features: three vessels treated, three or more stents implanted, three or more lesions treated, bifurcation with two stents implanted, total stent length greater than 60 mm, or chronic total occlusion. The primary efficacy endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis. The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Intention-to-treat was the primary analytic approach.

- **Results**: Of 9,577 patients included in the pooled dataset for whom procedural variables were available, 1,680 (17.5%) underwent complex PCI. Overall, 85% of patients received new-generation DES. At a median follow-up time of 392 days (interquartile range: 366 to 710 days), patients who underwent complex PCI had a higher risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 2.60; p < 0.0001). Compared with short-term DAPT, long-term DAPT yielded significant reductions in MACE in the complex PCI group (adjusted HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.89) versus the noncomplex PCI group (adjusted HR: 1.01; 95% CI).

### Utility of the dual antiplatelet therapy score to guide antiplatelet therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pHuq4]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). High credibility.

The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) score, one of the first prediction tools to attempt to uncouple bleeding and ischemic risk following percutaneous coronary intervention, can help guide antiplatelet duration after coronary intervention. Evaluating the generalizability of the score is important to understand its utility in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that validated the DAPT score. A random effect meta-analysis was performed of ischemic and bleeding risk based on the DAPT score. A secondary analysis assessed the risk of longer versus shorter P2Y12 inhibitor duration on ischemic and bleeding risk in randomized controlled trials of DAPT duration.

- **Results**: We identified 10 patient cohorts involving 88,563 patients. Compared with a low DAPT score, a high DAPT score was associated with increased ischemic risk (RR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.41–1.87) and reduced bleeding risk (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.92). In three randomized trials of DAPT duration that contained information on the DAPT score, the relative risk of net adverse clinical events (combined ischemic and bleeding events) with a longer duration of DAPT was 1.56 (95% CI: 0.77–3.19) for low DAPT score patients, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.61–1.21) for high DAPT score patients (p interaction = .14).

- **Conclusions**: In this large meta-analysis, the DAPT score consistently stratified bleeding and ischemic risk in opposing directions across several different study populations. More evaluation is needed to understand if the effect of longer DAPT duration on net adverse clinical events is modified by these findings.

### Demystifying the contemporary role of 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndrome [^1148NiUZ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

For almost two decades, 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been the only class I recommendation on DAPT in American and European guidelines, which has resulted in 12-month durations of DAPT therapy being the most frequently implemented in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) across the globe. Twelve-month DAPT was initially grounded in the results of the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent ReEvents) trial, which, by design, studied DAPT versus no DAPT rather than the optimal DAPT duration. The average DAPT duration in this study was 9 months, not 12 months.

Subsequent ACS studies, which were not designed to assess DAPT duration, but rather its composition (aspirin with prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel), were further interpreted as supportive evidence for the 12-month DAPT duration. In these studies, the median DAPT duration was 9 or 15 months for ticagrelor and prasugrel, respectively. Several subsequent studies questioned the 12-month regimen and suggested that DAPT duration should either be fewer than 12 months in patients at high bleeding risk or more than 12 months in patients at high ischemic risk who can safely tolerate the treatment.

Bleeding, rather than ischemic risk assessment, has emerged as a treatment modifier for maximizing the net clinical benefit of DAPT, due to excessive bleeding and no clear benefit of prolonged treatment regimens in high bleeding risk patients. Multiple DAPT de-escalation treatment strategies, including switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor, have been proposed to address these challenges.

### Rationale and design of the dual antiplatelet therapy study, a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of 12 versus 30 months of dual antiplatelet therapy in subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with either drug-eluting stent or bare-metal stent placement for the treatment of coronary artery lesions [^114s8rq5]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and thienopyridines (clopidogrel or prasugrel) is required after the placement of coronary stents to prevent thrombotic complications. Although clinical practice guidelines recommend 12-month treatment after drug-eluting stent placement, even longer durations may prevent thrombotic events.

- **Study design**: The Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) Study is comparing the benefits and risks of 12 versus 30 months of dual antiplatelet therapy in preventing stent thrombosis or major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of coronary artery obstructive lesions. The DAPT Study is a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will enroll 15,245 subjects treated with drug-eluting stents (DES) and 5,400 subjects treated with bare-metal stents (BMS). All subjects will receive 12 months of open-label thienopyridine treatment in addition to aspirin. After 12 months, subjects who are free from death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (MACCE), repeat revascularization, and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) moderate or severe bleeding events will be randomized to receive either 18 additional months of thienopyridine (clopidogrel or prasugrel) (30-month DAPT arm) or placebo (12-month DAPT arm) plus aspirin. Coprimary endpoints are MACCE and stent thrombosis. The primary safety endpoint is GUSTO moderate or severe bleeding.

### Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy in diabetic patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome treated with a new-generation drug-eluting stent [^1127Ho6m]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The REDUCE trial was the first study conducted in ACS patients comparing short versus conventional duration of DAPT. The trial showed no differences in clinical outcomes comparing 3 versus 12 months of DAPT. This prespecified sub-analysis focused on diabetic patients admitted with ACS undergoing PCI using the COMBO stent and revealed similar clinical outcomes in patients treated with short-term DAPT compared to those with conventional 12 months DAPT.

Diabetes is a known major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and it is estimated that up to 30% of patients undergoing coronary revascularization are diabetic. Moreover, diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with less favorable outcomes in ACS patients in terms of coronary revascularization, illustrated by higher rates of in-hospital MACE and target lesion revascularization. This is confirmed by a recent systematic review by Yuan and Xu, in which the authors concluded that late ST, defined as more than 30 days following PCI, was more common in diabetic patients. Definite ST is estimated to occur in 2.1% of patients undergoing PCI in the following 3 years, with a peak incidence in the first 30 days. Until now, only a few studies focused on new-generation DES and the duration of DAPT, including, and in particular focusing on ACS patients treated with the new adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists Prasugrel and Ticagrelor. In second-generation DES, the incidence of ST has been shown to vary and depend on the stent type, among other factors. For example, the SPIRIT IV study compared the everolimus-eluting stent with the paclitaxel-eluting stent.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: How long is too long [^113mFbCh]? Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Certain high-risk conditions, such as ACS presentation, complex coronary anatomical features, diabetes mellitus, or renal failure, can influence the rate of future events. The PEGASUS trial involved only patients who experienced a prior ACS event 1 to 3 years before enrollment and had an additional high-risk feature (aged > 65 years, diabetes mellitus, a second MI, multivessel disease, or chronic renal dysfunction). This key difference, along with its larger enrollment and power, could potentially explain the more significant decrease in the primary efficacy endpoint compared with other trials involving patients at a lower risk for ischemic events. It is not surprising that the event rates in the PEGASUS trial are much higher than those in the other three trials.

The other three trials have a few key similar limitations. Notably, only patients who were adherent to medications and event-free in the prior 12 months, without major bleeding or major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, were eligible to continue into the extended DAPT arm. This study design likely selects those at lower risk for late adverse events and bleeding. Additionally, these trials included a variable proportion of patients receiving PCI for an ACS event compared to those receiving PCI without ACS.

Patients receiving first-generation DESs are at higher risk for in-stent thrombosis because of delayed endothelialization, incomplete healing, and hypersensitivity. Although DAPT reduces this risk, first-generation DESs had late and very high risk.

### Long-term outcomes and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: The Veterans Affairs Extended DAPT Study [^111wq3G4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

From 2006 to 2016, 70,635 unique patients underwent PCI in the VA Healthcare System. Of these patients, 40,882 had PCI with a second-generation drug-eluting stent, survived at least 14 days after their PCI, and had at least one outpatient prescription in the first month after PCI (Figure 1). Follow-up ended in February 2020, with a median duration of follow-up of 4.3 years (interquartile range, 2.4–6.5 years).

- **Findings on dual antiplatelet therapy discontinuation**: Figure 2 illustrates the number and percentage of patients discontinuing DAPT at each of the four time periods following the index PCI. A small proportion of patients (5%–6%) discontinued DAPT in each of the first two time periods; however, this increased over time, with nearly half of the subjects stopping DAPT after one year. Table 1 outlines the baseline characteristics of subjects for each of the four time periods, categorized by whether they discontinued or continued DAPT within that timeframe. The mean age at the index PCI was 65 to 66 years, with patients experiencing ACS more likely to discontinue DAPT in later periods. Other comorbidities and medical treatments remained similar between groups, with high usage of statins (> 90%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (48%–65%), and angiotensin receptor blockers (12%–17%). Aspirin prescription by the VA Healthcare System was high shortly after discharge in the initial time period but decreased to approximately half in later periods, likely reflecting the prevalent use of over-the-counter aspirin by veterans during the study period.

### Single or dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI [^112SWAFm]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The optimal duration and type of antiplatelet therapy after implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES) remain uncertain. At the time of the first-in-man implantation of the sirolimus DES in 1999, the protocol-defined dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration was only two months. Subsequently, DAPT duration was extended to one year based on anecdotal historical data, and this practice was incorporated into clinical guidelines.

For more than a decade, trialists have sought to compare the safety and efficacy of abbreviated (12 months) DAPT regimens. However, the body of evidence is limited by the heterogeneity of endpoints, time of randomization, and bleeding criteria used in each trial.

Pharmaceutical advances led to the introduction of new ADP-receptor antagonists, which are thought to be more effective than clopidogrel. The focus shifted from the optimal duration of DAPT to the potential efficacy of single antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation. In this review, we summarize the evidence on the duration of DAPT and the risk of bleeding and adverse cardiac events after DES implantation, and describe the pitfalls of trial interpretation. The ongoing, prospective trials to test single antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation are also discussed.

### Patient-tailored antithrombotic therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention [^112Zs4yi]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, prevents stent-related and non-stent-related coronary and cerebrovascular thrombotic events and remains the standard of care following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Inevitably, DAPT increases bleeding complications, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, when determining the duration and composition of an antithrombotic regimen, physicians must carefully balance the advantages and drawbacks associated with this therapy.

Historically, DAPT was recommended for at least 12 months after first-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation because of concerns over late and very late stent thrombosis. However, the rates of late and very late stent thrombosis have decreased considerably with the advent of new generation DES. In addition, some, but not all, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown a reduction in bleeding complications without a signal of increased ischemic events with a short course of DAPT (3–6 months) compared to 12 months DAPT in patients at relatively low risk of thrombotic events. On the other hand, extending DAPT up to 3 years has been associated with a reduction in ischemic events, with a similar increase in bleeding events, compared to 12 months DAPT in patients treated with DES or in patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, the field of antithrombotic therapy is rapidly evolving with novel antithrombotic developments.

### Dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: How short is too short [^11172mxj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Unfortunately, patients with death within 14 days after PCI were excluded from the study to focus on the long-term outcome of DAPT duration. However, as we learned from the AUGUSTUS (Open-Label, 2×2 Factorial, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban versus Vitamin K Antagonist and Aspirin versus Aspirin Placebo in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial, this early phase after PCI is the crucial key for avoiding severe ischemic complications with DAPT, even in addition to long-term anticoagulation. This led to the recommendation to add DAPT to oral anticoagulation at least for the length of hospital stay or 1 week before changing the regimen to oral anticoagulation plus clopidogrel.

There is an effort to investigate newer regimens with shorter DAPT to reduce the risk of bleeding without increasing the risk of ischemia. For patients with acute coronary syndrome, SMART-DATE (6-Month Versus 12-Month or Longer Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome) revealed an increase in myocardial infarction for patients with 6 months of DAPT in comparison to 12 months. However, this trial was performed in an Asian cohort, and about 80% of all patients received clopidogrel as P2Y12 inhibitor. PEGASUS-TIMI 54 and the DAPT study even revealed benefits on ischemic end points for a prolonged DAPT over 1 year. However, bleeding risk increased as expected. Furthermore, short DAPT duration with following ticagrelor monotherapy is an emerging area of interest.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111k3qxU]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), with aspirin and a P2Y12-receptor inhibitor, forms the basis for the care of patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The recommended duration of DAPT for patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is ≥ 12 months for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and six months for patients with stable coronary artery disease. Despite these recommendations, the optimal timing of switching from DAPT to a single antiplatelet therapy continues to be a matter of debate owing to refinements in DES technologies and the advent of potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors.

The recommendation for ≥ 12 months of DAPT after PCI with DES has received scrutiny by several randomized controlled trials, which proved non-superiority compared with three to six months of DAPT. Furthermore, shorter durations, as opposed to longer durations of DAPT, were associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality due to reduced bleeding-related deaths. Nevertheless, the wide non-inferiority margins of up to six months of DAPT from single randomized controlled trials have prevented researchers from concluding that short-term DAPT could replace the conventional standard duration. Additionally, a recent individual patient data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials suggested that three months of DAPT was associated with an increased risk of ischemia in patients with ACS.

### Rationale and design of the PARTHENOPE trial: A two-by-two factorial comparison of polymer-free vs biodegradable-polymer drug-eluting stents and personalized vs standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in all-comers undergoing PCI [^1176JxFe]. American Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Over the past few decades, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has undergone significant advancements as a result of the combination of device-based and drug-based therapies. These iterations have led to the development of polymer-free drug-eluting stents. However, there is a scarcity of data regarding their clinical performance. Furthermore, while various risk scores have been proposed to determine the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), none of them have undergone prospective validation within the context of randomized trials.

- **Design**: The PARTHENOPE trial is a phase IV, prospective, randomized, multicenter, investigator-initiated, assessor-blind study being conducted at 14 centers in Italy (NCT04135989). It includes 2,107 all-comers patients with minimal exclusion criteria, randomly assigned in a 2-by-2 design to receive either the Cre8 amphilimus-eluting stent or the SYNERGY everolimus-eluting stent, along with either a personalized or standard duration of DAPT. Personalized DAPT duration is determined by the DAPT score, which accounts for both bleeding and ischemic risks. Patients with a DAPT score < 2 (indicating higher bleeding than ischemic risk) receive DAPT for 3 or 6 months for chronic or acute coronary syndrome, respectively, while patients with a DAPT score ≥ 2 (indicating higher ischemic than bleeding risk) receive DAPT for 24 months. Patients in the standard DAPT group receive DAPT for 12 months. The trial aims to establish the noninferiority between stents with respect to a device-oriented composite endpoint of cardiovascular outcomes.

### Duration of dual anti-platelet therapy post-percutaneous intervention: Is there a correct amount of time [^114mDUzw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is effective in preventing in-stent thrombosis (IST) after the placement of drug-eluting coronary stents (DES) and in reducing the risk of atherothrombotic events, primarily myocardial infarction, among patients with advanced coronary atherosclerosis. However, all studies of DAPT demonstrate an increased risk of moderate or severe bleeding for the duration of therapy. The extent of benefit and risk with various periods of DAPT after DES placement has been evaluated in multiple observational studies and randomized clinical trials. Most studies indicate little or no significant reduction of ischemic events but significant increases in bleeding with prolonged treatment.

The Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Study was the only randomized trial sufficiently powered to assess IST as an individual endpoint. This study found that continuing DAPT from 12 to 30 months after DES placement provided important reductions in IST and a composite of adverse ischemic events. When all data are considered, a compelling argument can be made for using just 3 to 6 months of DAPT in patients treated with contemporary second-generation DES when the goal of treatment is to avoid IST. Longer therapy should be recommended for patients treated with first-generation DES, for whom a persistent signal of IST risk is apparent, and for patients with low risk for bleeding who wish to minimize their risk of atherothrombotic events, both related and unrelated to DES.

### Short term versus long term dual antiplatelet therapy after implantation of drug eluting stent in patients with or without diabetes: Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials [^1118EPNM]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) represents the evidence-based standard of care among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The treatment aims to reduce the risk of stent thrombosis after implantation of a coronary stent and prevent coronary atherothrombotic events at sites outside the stented segment. The optimal duration of DAPT after stent implantation in general, and particularly after the implantation of a drug-eluting stent, remains a matter of controversy. Currently, a minimum duration of six months has been advocated in professional guideline documents and adopted worldwide for the management of patients receiving drug-eluting stents, irrespective of type.

Diabetes mellitus is a widely recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis, disease progression, and restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Although new-generation drug-eluting stents have also been shown to provide improved safety and efficacy compared with balloon angioplasty, bare-metal stents, and early-generation drug-eluting stents among patients with diabetes, such patients, particularly those requiring insulin treatment, have a high ischaemic risk. Increased platelet and thrombin reactivity and decreased response to therapeutic agents, including aspirin and clopidogrel, have been described in patients with diabetes.

Whether diabetes should be taken into consideration in the selection of the most appropriate duration of DAPT remains unclear. Recently, it was proposed that the presence of diabetes can identify patients who benefit from prolonged DAPT because of the i

### P2Y inhibitor-based single antiplatelet therapy versus conventional dual antiplatelet therapy after newer-generation drug-eluting stent implantation in chronic and acute coronary syndromes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112h6Knx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitors is the cornerstone of antithrombotic pharmacotherapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug‐eluting stents (DES) to prevent stent‐related thrombotic complications. After DES implantation, guidelines recommend DAPT for 6 and 12 months in patients presenting with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS), respectively. However, DAPT is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, which in turn, has been shown to increase all‐cause mortality after PCI.

Modern iterations of DES designs with reduced thrombogenicity have prompted the introduction of novel antiplatelet strategies aimed at mitigating the risk of major bleeding while maintaining antithrombotic efficacy. Initially, the common approach to reducing DAPT intensity was to shorten the duration of DAPT by discontinuing the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor and transitioning to aspirin monotherapy. Recently, P2Y12 inhibitor‐based single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) has emerged as an attractive alternative strategy to limit the need for DAPT after DES implantation. Recent evidence from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that aspirin discontinuation at the time of transition from a short DAPT regimen to P2Y12 inhibitor‐based SAPT reduces major bleeding without increasing the risk of major adverse ischemic outcomes compared with prolonged DAPT after newer‐generation DES implantation.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: How long is too long [^114Wneuq]? Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

What does the future hold for extended‐duration DAPT? It is likely that adverse thrombotic and cardiac events will continue to decrease with the continuously improving polymer and stent technology, including the development of ultrathin struts. Trials such as HOST‐IDEA (Harmonizing Optimal Strategy for Treatment of Coronary Artery Stenosis - Coronary Intervention With Next Generation Drug‐Eluting Stent Platforms and Abbreviated Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Trial) (identifier NCT02601157), are recruiting patients to compare two ultrathin biodegradable and polymer‐free stents with varying DAPT durations. Even in ACS, the trend is towards shorter DAPT durations. A recent randomized trial assessing the safety of interruption of DAPT before 12 months in patients with ST‐segment–elevation MI treated with DES reported the noninferiority of a shorter 6‐month DAPT regimen compared with the standard treatment.

A meta‐analysis by Udell et al. showed that extended DAPT beyond one year among stabilized high-risk patients with previous MI decreased the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events but at the cost of an increased risk of major bleeding. Given that patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events are often also at higher risk of fatal bleeding events, determining which patients will benefit from extended DAPT can be challenging. Several clinical scores have been devised to aid clinicians in deciding whether to continue or discontinue DAPT. Although not perfect, the DAPT score is a validated risk score designed to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from extended therapy.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: How long is too long [^115eYUqy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DESs) provide a class I recommendation to continue DAPT for at least 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and at least 6 months after revascularization in the setting of stable ischemic heart disease. These guidelines also provide a class IIb recommendation for continuing DAPT beyond 6 and 12 months in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and ACS, respectively, if these patients have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding event and are at low risk for future bleeding. However, they do not offer specific guidance regarding the total duration for continuing DAPT, leaving it to the clinician to evaluate risks versus benefits with the patient and to individualize antiplatelet therapy.

In clinical practice, it is common to find patients on DAPT several years following a PCI as they are frequently instructed by their providers not to discontinue it. Given the emphasis on the importance of taking DAPT in the early period after PCI, patients at times express discomfort with stopping the second antiplatelet agent at any point. The absence of a clear recommendation is not surprising, despite multiple recent randomized controlled trials evaluating different durations of extended DAPT, considering various evolving factors and the overall risk/benefit profile of DAPT.

Guidelines that address DAPT duration have largely included trials using clopidogrel and early-generation drug eluting technology, which further complicates the decision-making process.

### Pooled analysis of bleeding, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in clinical trials of time-constrained dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention [^111KY7Sa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The results of our analysis lend support to a strategy of discontinuing aspirin from three months post‐PCI and continuing P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. Aspirin has been a long‐established, first‐line treatment for secondary prevention of coronary atherosclerosis, and a shift to prescribing P2Y12 monotherapy is a new concept for clinicians. Recommendations from practice guideline committees will be important if clinical practice is to evolve in line with the evidence from these trials. The results are also relevant to the safety of participants in ongoing clinical trials comparing DAPT regimens.

Clinicians should still implement individualized therapy decisions for their patients as would normally occur in daily practice. Currently, global prescribing practices for the type of P2Y12 inhibitor are influenced by several factors including access, absolute cost, clinical effectiveness, and practice guidelines.

- **Limitations**: The risks and benefits of aspirin monotherapy versus P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy from one-third to 12 months following an ACS and/or PCI are not well established. In the future, a large clinical trial will be needed to address this evidence gap.

When analyses were conducted comparing "more experienced" with "experienced" operators, no significant effect emerged on clinical outcomes at 30-day or 2-year intervals, and no interaction was noted with respect to randomized dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration or stent type. Figures and tables referenced (e.g. Tables S1 through S4; Figures S4 and S5) were used to support these findings.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stents: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116gRPar]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Drug eluting stents have consistently improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention as compared with bare metal stents. While drug eluting stents have reduced in-stent restenosis, uncertainty has arisen regarding the risk of associated late and very late stent thrombosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy, consisting of aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, is recommended after drug eluting stent implantation for at least 12 months by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and for six to 12 months by European guidelines, followed by aspirin monotherapy. However, recommendations are based largely on observational data with few randomised controlled trials.

The most recent trials and meta-analyses have suggested comparable efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy versus therapy of at least 12 months, especially with newer generation drug eluting stents. However, these studies are underpowered to draw definitive conclusions. On the other hand, very late stent thrombosis still occurs with drug eluting stents, especially after first-generation devices, raising the question of whether prolongation of dual antiplatelet therapy offers clinical benefit. One randomised controlled trial recently showed a significant reduction of stent thrombosis with dual antiplatelet therapy extended beyond 12 months at the price of increased bleeding. Thus, the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy is debated, with short-term and extended protocols not yet compared to standard 12-month treatment within the same trial.

### Balancing the risks of bleeding and stent thrombosis: a decision analytic model to compare durations of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stents [^113RouxX]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

After coronary stent placement, whether dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration should be extended to prevent late stent thrombosis (ST) or adverse cardiovascular events is uncertain.

- **Methods**: To define the reduction in ischemic events required to outweigh increased bleeding with longer-duration DAPT, we developed a decision-analytic Markov model comparing DAPT durations of 6, 12, and 30 months after drug-eluting stents (DES). Separate models were developed for patients presenting with and without an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We used sensitivity analyses to identify the incremental benefit of longer-duration DAPT on either ST or the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke (major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events [MACCEs]) required to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding associated with longer DAPT. The outcome from each strategy was quantified in terms of quality-adjusted life years.

- **Results**: In the non-ACS population, in order for 30 months of DAPT to be preferred over 12 months of therapy, DAPT would have to result in a 78% reduction in the risk of ST (relative risk [RR] 0.22, 3.1 fewer events per 1000) and only a 5% reduction in MACCE (RR 0.95, 2.2 fewer events per 1000) compared with aspirin alone. For the ACS population, DAPT would have to result in a 44% reduction in the risk of ST (RR 0.56, 3.4 fewer events per 1000) but only a 2% reduction in MACCE (RR 0.98, 2.3 fewer events per 1000) as compared with aspirin alone, for 30 months of DAPT to be preferred over 12 months.

### Stent and dual antiplatelet therapy duration comparisons in the setting of a multicenter randomized controlled trial: Can the operator experience affect the study results [^112GL5Xv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Operator experience influences outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention, but this association in the controlled setting of a randomized clinical trial is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: We investigated operator-related outcomes (30-day and 2-year efficacy and safety endpoints) among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and randomized to different dual antiplatelet therapy durations and stent types. A total of 2003 patients were analyzed, and 7 operator groups were compared. The majority of pre-procedural and post-procedural characteristics were imbalanced. The primary endpoint of the study, the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accidents, did not differ among operators at 30 days or 2 years. There were no significant differences for all other individual and composite endpoints analyzed at 30 days and 2 years, except for 2-year stent thrombosis (P = 0.048) and bleeding events (P = 0.022 for Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5). Adjusted comparisons for the main endpoints showed slight differences among operators at 30 days, but not at 2 years. There was no interaction of the operator with dual antiplatelet therapy duration (P = 0.112) or stent type (P = 0.300). Results remained entirely consistent when operators were stratified by their experience.

- **Conclusions**: There was a weak signal of heterogeneity across study operators for the 30-day, but not the 2-year, main study outcomes. No clear effect of operator or operator experience was observed for the comparative efficacy and safety profiles.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation [^1177Vkax]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet pharmacotherapy reduces ischemic events at the cost of excess bleeding in patients who underwent coronary stenting. The currently recommended treatment period is based on trials held some 20 years ago and is not relevant to clinical practice. In recent years, numerous clinical trials have attempted to answer the question of what is the optimal duration of therapy to maximize clinical benefit. These trials showed two seemingly conflicting answers: on one hand, shorter treatment duration seems to be safer in reducing bleeding while not increasing ischemic events; on the other hand, longer duration is superior in terms of preventing ischemic events, albeit at the cost of increased bleeding rates.

In this review, we summarize the evidence favoring each approach, highlight the limitations of the various pivotal clinical trials in this field, review future directions of research, and discuss changes in practice that may influence the duration of antiplatelet therapy. We also attempt to propose a personalized approach to achieve maximal benefit for the individual patient.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for coronary artery disease, specifically in relation to postprocedural antithrombotic therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy 1–3 months after PCI-stenting in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding or ischemic events and who do not have an indication for oral anticoagulation.

### Risk-benefit of 1-year DAPT after DES implantation in patients stratified by bleeding and ischemic risk [^116pTXWJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Although a 1-year duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is used in many patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, the evidence supporting this duration is uncertain.

- **Objectives**: The authors investigated the risk-benefit profile of 1-year versus ≤ 6-month DAPT after DES using two novel scores to risk stratify bleeding and ischemic events.

- **Methods**: Ischemic and bleeding risk scores were generated from ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents), a multicenter, international, "all-comers" registry that enrolled 8,665 patients treated with DES. The risk-benefit profile of 1-year versus ≤ 6-month DAPT was then investigated across risk strata from an individual patient data pooled dataset of seven randomized trials that enrolled 15,083 patients treated with DES.

- **Results**: In the derivation cohort, the ischemic score and the bleeding score had c-indexes of 0.76 and 0.66, respectively, and both were well calibrated. In the pooled dataset, no significant difference was apparent in any ischemic endpoint between 1-year and ≤ 6-month DAPT, regardless of the risk strata. In the overall dataset, there was no significant difference in the risk of clinically relevant bleeding between 1-year and ≤ 6-month DAPT. However, among 2,508 patients at increased risk of bleeding, 1-year compared with ≤ 6-month DAPT was associated with greater bleeding (HR: 2.80; 95% CI: 1.12–7.13) without a reduced risk of ischemic events in any risk strata, including those with acute coronary syndromes. These results were consistent in a network meta-analysis.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112jQNoJ]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of standard term (12 months) or long term (> 12 months) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus short term (< 6 months) DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES).

- **Design**: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.
- **Data sources**: Relevant studies published between June 1983 and April 2018 from Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library for clinical trials, PubMed, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Clinicaltrialsregister.eu.
- **Review methods**: Randomised controlled trials comparing two of the three durations of DAPT (short term, standard term, and long term) after PCI with DES were included. The primary study outcomes were cardiac or non-cardiac death, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and all bleeding events.
- **Results**: Seventeen studies (n = 46,864) were included. Compared with short term DAPT, network meta-analysis showed that long term DAPT resulted in higher rates of major bleeding (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.49) and non-cardiac death (1.63, 1.03 to 2.59); standard term DAPT was associated with higher rates of any bleeding (1.39, 1.01 to 1.92). No noticeable difference was observed in other primary endpoints. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the risks of non-cardiac death and bleeding were further increased for ≥ 18 months of DAPT compared with short term or standard term DAPT. In the subgroup analysis, long term DAPT led to higher all-cause mortality than short term DAPT in patients implanted with newer-generation DES (1.99, 1.04 to 3.81).

### Dual-antiplatelet treatment beyond 1 year after drug-eluting stent implantation (ARCTIC-Interruption): A randomised trial [^115yzqcT]. Lancet (2014). High credibility.

Optimum duration of dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) after coronary stenting remains uncertain, with an unknown efficacy to safety ratio of extended treatment leading to discrepancies between international guidelines and clinical practice. We assessed whether DAPT continuation beyond 1 year after coronary stenting is beneficial.

- **Methods**: This analysis was a planned extension of the previously published ARCTIC-Monitoring trial, in which we randomly allocated 2,440 patients to a strategy of platelet function testing with antiplatelet treatment adjustment or a conventional strategy after coronary stenting with drug-eluting stent (DES). We recruited patients (aged 18 years or older) scheduled for planned DES implantation at 38 centres in France. After 1 year of follow-up, patients without contraindication to interruption of DAPT were eligible for a second randomisation to this second phase of the study (ARCTIC-Interruption). Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence (1:1; stratified by centre), we allocated patients to a strategy of interruption of DAPT where the thienopyridine was interrupted and single aspirin antiplatelet treatment was maintained (interruption group) or a strategy of DAPT continuation for 6–18 months (continuation group). The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularisation, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00827411.

### Long-term outcomes and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: The Veterans Affairs Extended DAPT Study [^112u56NW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Studies using older stent designs show that extending dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for more than 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) lowers the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) but increases the risk of major bleeding. Studies with second-generation drug-eluting stents suggest shorter-duration DAPT may offer a more favorable benefit/risk ratio in patients with a lower risk of ischemic events or higher risks of bleeding. Randomized trials and meta-analyses of DAPT duration show that DAPT duration of 6 versus 12 months in selected groups offers similar ischemic risk with a lower bleeding risk.

As a result, guidelines suggest a minimum of 6 months DAPT after PCI for stable coronary syndromes and 12 months for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). In patients at high bleeding risk, more recent studies suggest that 1- to 3-month versus 12-month DAPT may lower the risk of major bleeding after PCI.

Many of the studies supporting the guidelines examined outcomes up to 1 to 2 years after PCI, but the balance of cardiovascular, noncardiovascular, and bleeding outcomes may change over longer follow-up. It is uncertain if the guidelines avoiding long DAPT duration reflect optimal risk over a longer follow-up in a wider population than the clinical trials. The study sought to describe the relationships of death, cause-specific death, MI, and major bleeding after PCI with second-generation drug-eluting stents and relate these to DAPT duration in all patients in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System over a time frame that preceded the current guidelines.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

- **Aim**: Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

- **Methods**: We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are more than 1 year past an MI?

- **Results**: We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33,051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer:
	- A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis.
	- A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.1.

### Long-term outcomes and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: The Veterans Affairs Extended DAPT Study [^112bFgXL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Recent guidelines on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) balance the subsequent risks of major bleeding with ischemic events. While generally favoring shorter DAPT duration with second-generation drug-eluting stents, the effects on long-term outcomes in the wider population are uncertain.

Methods and results: We tracked all patients undergoing PCI with second-generation drug-eluting stents in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System between 2006 and 2016 for occurrences of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and major bleeding up to 13 years. We compared these outcomes with four DAPT durations: 1 to 5 months, 6 to 9 months, 10 to 12 months, and 13 to 18 months after the index PCI, using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazards models adjusted by inverse probability weighting.

A total of 40,882 subjects with PCI were followed up for a median of 4.3 years (25%-75%: 2.4–6.5 years). DAPT discontinuation was rare early after PCI (5.8% at 1–5 months and 6.3% at 6–9 months) but increased to 19% and 44% for periods longer than 9 months. The risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular death was higher (HR, 2.03–3.41) with DAPT discontinuation before 9 months, likely reflecting premature cessation due to factors related to early death. However, DAPT discontinuation after 9 months following PCI was associated with lower risks of death (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88–0.99]), cardiac death (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.70–0.90]), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69–0.82]), and major bleeding (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74–0.91]). Results were similar when PCI was performed for an acute coronary syndrome.

This study differs from our earlier reports by examining late in addition to early outcomes after PCI and exclusively with second‐generation drug‐eluting stents. In this VA cohort, the proportion of patients discontinuing DAPT in the first 1 to 5 and 6 to 9 months was small, at 6% in each time period. This reflects the PCI guidelines over most of the study period, which recommended a minimum of 6 to 12 months DAPT after PCI, and possibly high adherence by ex‐military patients in a relatively low‐cost health care system. Nonveteran populations may show different behaviors in the months shortly after PCI.

In the small number of patients who did discontinue DAPT at 1 to 5 and 6 to 9 months, all‐cause death was higher. However, the increased risk of noncardiovascular death as well as cardiac and vascular death occurred early in these time periods and did not affect MI, suggesting a lack of specificity for coronary events that would be expected if early discontinuation of DAPT caused death from stent thrombosis or MI. Thus, it is more likely that the high early death rate, even after adjustment for confounders, was a consequence of factors related to increased risk of death from any cause that drove DAPT cessation. Our prior analysis of an earlier cohort of veterans after PCI, and other short‐term studies, shows that patients who prematurely discontinued DAPT have greater frailty, lower use of statins, less education, avoidance of health care, and other social factors related to increased risk of adverse outcomes.

More recently, randomized trials assessing de-escalation of therapy have provided additional insights.

### International patterns of dual antiplatelet therapy duration after acute coronary syndromes [^113ztDTc]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

The patterns found in our registry are more surprising in light of the later evidence, coming mostly from the results of two large randomized trials. These trials compared either 12 months versus 30 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel or prasugrel in patients who had received a coronary stent (DAPT trial), or aspirin versus aspirin plus ticagrelor starting between 12 and 36 months following a prior myocardial infarction (either continuing DAPT at 12 months or restarting DAPT later) (PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial).

Both trials showed a reduction in ischemic events (myocardial infarction in DAPT, and myocardial infarction and stroke in PEGASUS-TIMI 54) with a significant and clinically relevant increase in major bleeding and diverging but non-significant trends for mortality. Together with a number of smaller trials testing different durations of DAPT, mostly in patients treated with stents, several meta-analyses have confirmed that prolongation of DAPT beyond the first 12 months is a trade-off between reducing non-fatal ischemic events and non-fatal major bleeding events, with unclear results on all-cause mortality, which may differ according to the reason for DAPT indication (myocardial infarction vs. percutaneous intervention).

For this reason, the 2015 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST segment elevation state that P2Y12 inhibitor administration in addition to aspirin beyond 1 year may be considered after careful assessment of the ischemic and bleeding risks of the patient (indication class IIb; level of evidence A).

### Stent thrombosis and restenosis: What have we learned and where are we going? The Andreas Grüntzig Lecture ESC 2014 [^1165B7Sd]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Key to the prevention of stent thrombosis (ST) is the prescription of an appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Randomized clinical trials in the 1990s conclusively demonstrated that DAPT was superior to anticoagulation for the prevention of complications after bare metal stenting. Early randomized clinical trials with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation included a recommendation for 3–6 months of DAPT after PCI, though concerns soon emerged about a possible increase in late ST after DES implantation.

- **Consequences**: Two important consequences arose from these concerns. First, guideline authorities, on the basis of expert opinion, recommended a more prolonged duration of DAPT, typically at least 12 months. Second, a number of large-scale clinical trials were initiated to precisely define the optimal duration of DAPT after DES implantation. Data from all of these studies have now been reported, permitting a reappraisal of recommendations relating to DAPT duration.

### Long-term outcomes and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: The Veterans Affairs extended DAPT study [^1114kwqK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Recent guidelines on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) aim to balance the subsequent risks of major bleeding with ischemic events. Although they generally favor shorter DAPT duration with second-generation drug-eluting stents, the effects on long-term outcomes in the wider population are uncertain.

- **Methods and results**: We tracked all patients having PCI with second-generation drug-eluting stents in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System between 2006 and 2016 for death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and major bleeding for up to 13 years. We compared these outcomes with four DAPT durations of 1 to 5, 6 to 9, 10 to 12, and 13 to 18 months after the index PCI using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazards models adjusted by inverse probability weighting. A total of 40,882 subjects with PCI were followed up for a median of 4.3 years (25%–75%: 2.4–6.5 years).

	- DAPT discontinuation was rare early after PCI (5.8% at 1–5 months and 6.3% at 6–9 months) but increased (19% and 44%) after more than 9 months. The risk of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death was higher (HR, 2.03–3.41) with DAPT discontinuation before 9 months, likely reflecting premature cessation from factors related to early death. DAPT discontinuation after 9 months following PCI was associated with lower risks of death (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88–0.99]), cardiac death (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.70–0.90]), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69–0.82]), and major bleeding (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74–0.91]). Results were similar for index PCI for an acute coronary syndrome.

### Benefits and risks of prolonged duration dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) after percutaneous coronary intervention in high-risk patients with diabetes mellitus [^116GXUhy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of prolonged (> 1-year) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration in high-risk patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain unknown. All patients undergoing PCI at Fuwai Hospital between January 2013 and December 2013 were prospectively enrolled in the Fuwai PCI registry. A total of 3,696 high-risk diabetic patients with at least one additional atherothrombotic risk factor were screened for inclusion. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The median follow-up duration was 887 days.

Notably, 69.8% of DM patients were on DAPT at 1 year without discontinuation. Based on a multivariate Cox regression model and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis, long-term (> 1-year) DAPT reduced the risk of the primary efficacy outcome (1.7% vs. 4.1%; adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR]: 0.382, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.252 to 0.577; IPTW-HR: 0.362 [0.241 to 0.542]), as well as cardiovascular death and definite/probable stent thrombosis, compared with short-course (≤ 1-year) DAPT. The risk of the safety endpoint of clinically relevant bleeding (adjHR: 0.920 [0.467 to 1.816]; IPTW-HR: 0.969 [0.486 to 1.932]) was comparable between longer DAPT and shorter DAPT.

A lower number of net clinical benefit adverse outcomes was observed with > 1-year DAPT versus ≤ 1-year DAPT (adjHR: 0.471 [0.331 to 0.671]; IPTW-HR: 0.462 [0.327 to 0.652]), which appeared increasingly favorable in those with multiple atherothrombotic risk characteristics.

### Meta-analysis of bleeding risk prediction scores in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention on dual antiplatelet therapy [^115ky6q3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The duration and type of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prescribed to patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involves carefully balancing reduced ischemia and increased bleeding risk for individual patients. Whereas multiple bleeding risk scores exist, the performance of these models to predict long-term bleeding in the setting of DAPT across different settings and populations is unclear. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the performance of bleeding risk prediction scores for predicting major long-term bleeding events in patients on DAPT post-PCI.

Based on a search of MEDLINE (January 1, 1946, to March 3, 2017) and EMBASE (January 1, 1974, to March 3, 2017) for studies published in the English language, we identified 10 published studies of 11 unique risk prediction models across a wide variety of settings. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure discrimination when available. Our findings reveal that the prediction models created at the time of writing demonstrate only modest accuracy, with the reported AUCs ranging from 0.54 to 0.89; aggregated AUC 0.68 (95% confidence intervals 0.65 to 0.72). Although only 5 studies (50%) reported measures of calibration, the reported models were reasonably well-calibrated. Only 3 models (33%) were externally validated.

Meta-regression demonstrated a lack of influence by age (p = 0.99) or length of follow-up (p = 0.42). Sensitivity analysis did not significantly change the results. Novel prediction models are warranted to aid in maximizing the benefits of therapy while minimizing associated risks.

### Long-term outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes related to prolonging dual antiplatelet therapy more than 12 months after coronary stenting [^117K5Rsq]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of stent type on the risk of death or myocardial infarction (MI) related to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) more than 12 months (prolonged DAPT) versus 12 or fewer months after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), we evaluated clinical outcomes post-PCI for ACS with a median follow-up of 26 months for drug-eluting stents (DES) and 46 months for bare-metal stents (BMS) in 18,484 patients within the Veterans Affairs system. Landmark analyses starting 1 year after the index PCI assessed the risk of prolonged DAPT on the primary endpoint of death or MI, with multivariable and propensity models adjusting for confounding.

- **Background**: The recent DAPT study reported lower ischemic events from prolonged DAPT in patients treated with PCI for an ACS but was underpowered to determine the impact of stent type.

- **Results**: There was a significant interaction between stent type and prolonged DAPT for death and MI (P = 0.0036), death (P = 0.054), and major bleeding (P = 0.0013). Patients treated with prolonged DAPT exhibited lower risks of death or MI (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.61, 0.82) and death (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62, 0.89) with DES but not BMS, and higher risks of major bleeding, particularly with BMS (HR = 1.67, P < 0.001) than DES (HR = 1.24, P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Prolonging DAPT more than 12 months after PCI for ACS is associated with a lower risk of ischemic events 1–4 years after PCI in those receiving first-generation DES. Stent type may influence the benefit of prolonged DAPT.

### Stent and dual antiplatelet therapy duration comparisons in the setting of a multicenter randomized controlled trial: Can the operator experience affect the study results [^114U9o3j]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Operator experience influences outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention, but this association in the controlled setting of a randomized, clinical trial is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: We investigated operator-related outcomes (30-day and 2-year efficacy and safety endpoints) among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and randomized to different dual antiplatelet therapy durations and stent types. A total of 2003 patients were analyzed, and 7 operator groups were compared. The majority of preprocedural and postprocedural characteristics were imbalanced. The primary endpoint of the study, the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accidents, did not differ among operators at 30 days or 2 years. There were no significant differences also for all other individual and composite endpoints analyzed at 30 days and 2 years, except for 2-year stent thrombosis (P = 0.048) and bleeding events (P = 0.022 for Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5). Adjusted comparisons for the main endpoints showed slight differences among operators at 30 days, but not at 2 years. There was no interaction of operator with dual antiplatelet therapy duration (P = 0.112) or stent type (P = 0.300). Results remained entirely consistent when operators were stratified by their experience.

- **Conclusions**: There was a weak signal of heterogeneity across study operators for the 30-day, but not the 2-year, main study outcomes. No clear effect of operator or operator experience was observed for the comparative efficacy and safety profile.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114McJcd]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

The detailed protocol, which followed the template of a Cochrane review for multiple interventions, is available in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42018099519). This systematic review was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the PRISMA extension statement for network meta-analysis.

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: We conducted a systematic search of the literature in April 2018. The databases included Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library for clinical trials, PubMed, and Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and Clinicaltrialsregister.eu. The MeSH search terms included the following: drug-eluting stents, percutaneous coronary intervention, platelet aggregation inhibitors, antiplatelet therapy, and aspirin. Our search strategy was tailored to each database (see appendix 1).

We included randomized controlled trials that met the following criteria:

- Participants were adults (aged ≥ 18) who received DAPT after PCI with DES
- The interventions were candidate durations of DAPT (short-term (≤ 6 months), standard-term (12 months), and long-term (> 12 months) DAPT)
- Comparisons with another candidate duration were made
- Outcomes included death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding

We excluded studies that met the following criteria: ≤ 1 month of DAPT, analyses of non-randomized trials, cross-sectional studies, case reports or case series, ongoing trials, or insufficient data from original studies.

The prespecified efficacy endpoints included all-cause mortality and cardiac death.

### Predicting individual treatment effects to determine duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after stent implantation [^115YXSWG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the cornerstone of maintenance therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. DAPT uses both aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor to suppress the risks of ischemic events. However, this benefit is inevitably counterbalanced by the higher bleeding risk induced by the prolonged duration of DAPT. Given the double-edged sword nature of DAPT, determining the optimal duration of DAPT after PCI is crucial and remains under debate.

Numerous attempts have been made to identify the optimal DAPT duration by stratifying patients according to their baseline risk of ischemia or bleeding events after PCI. The proposed scoring systems were developed based on patients treated with clopidogrel after PCI for ACS or stable coronary disease, thus limiting their applicability in contemporary clinical practice. Moreover, estimating the complex individual treatment effects can be challenging, and concerns regarding the scoring system's accuracy have not been fully addressed. In this context, machine learning (ML) approaches overcome the limitations of the analytical approaches by estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) and capturing high-dimensional, nonlinear relationships between clinical features to establish personalized treatment strategies.

This study aimed to develop an individualized DAPT (iDAPT) score and an ML model to classify the benefits of abbreviated DAPT on clinical outcomes after PCI in patients with ACS.

### International patterns of dual antiplatelet therapy duration after acute coronary syndromes [^111iC27b]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

International patterns of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration do not necessarily align with guideline recommendations. Despite contemporary evidence, patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) remained on DAPT for longer than 12 months, irrespective of clinical characteristics and ischemic risk. The country of treatment was the most significant determinant of DAPT duration. This emphasizes the importance of postmarketing surveillance to monitor prescription patterns, patient selection, and clinical events related to long-term DAPT duration.

### Three versus 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy duration in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1159xhBy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). High credibility.

The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) recommend at least 12 months of a P2Y12 inhibitor and low-dose aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with a stent. Since that recommendation, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have studied an abbreviated duration of DAPT in ACS. Therefore, we sought to perform a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing 3- versus 12-month DAPT in patients presenting with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched until July 31, 2022, for RCTs comparing 3- versus 12-month DAPT in patients with ACS undergoing PCI. Outcomes assessed were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis (ST), and bleeding. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: We included five trials comprising 16,781 patients with ACS who underwent PCI. There was no significant difference in MACE (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.76–1.11), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.38–4.17), or all-cause mortality (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.48–1.77) between the two groups. In addition, there was no difference in rates of MI (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.74–1.30) or ST (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.55–3.05) between 3- and 12-month DAPT. However, compared with 12-month DAPT, 3-month DAPT significantly reduced the risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.43–0.64).

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stents: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111X1Hq9]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The meta-analysis compares the efficacy and safety of three different durations of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. To our knowledge, this unique design is the first report focusing on outcomes with either short-term or extended (beyond 12 months) duration of dual antiplatelet therapy versus a 12-month therapy. By incorporating the most recent evidence from randomised controlled trials, this report forms the largest database on the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy ever analysed (n = 32,287).

There were two main findings:

- **Short-term therapy**: When compared to 12-month therapy, short-term dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a similar rate of stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction, with a reduced risk of major bleeding.

- **Extended therapy**: Compared with a 12-month regimen, extended therapy reduced the odds of definite/probable stent thrombosis, very late stent thrombosis, and myocardial infarction, but increased the odds of major bleeding.

While all-cause mortality also increased in the extended versus 12-month regimen comparison, driven by non-cardiovascular events, this study finding is mitigated by the inclusion of the landmark analysis at 12 months of patients enrolled in the PRODIGY trial. Nevertheless, given the potential profound implications of this observation, further studies are needed to validate or refute this preliminary finding.

Coronary drug-eluting stents, by inhibiting in-stent neointimal proliferation, have effectively reduced the need for repeat revascularization procedures.

### Long-term outcomes and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: The Veterans Affairs extended DAPT study [^112CRFgH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

This cohort was more likely to provide informative data on the value of extending dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) beyond 6 to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with second-generation drug-eluting stents. Compared with subjects who continued DAPT, those who discontinued DAPT after 9 months following PCI had lower rates of all-cause death and cardiac death, but not vascular or noncardiovascular death. This pattern of lower cardiac death but no relationship to noncardiac causes of death suggests that the effect of DAPT discontinuation after this time period is specific to cardiac events and is relatively safe. Discontinuation of DAPT after 9 months was also associated with lower rates of major bleeding and myocardial infarction (MI). These relationships were stronger in analyses that restricted outcomes to a shorter 2-year time frame, supporting a more direct effect of DAPT discontinuation on reducing the risk of adverse events. Our results were similar in clinically important subgroups of patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and those on anticoagulants at a time when single antiplatelet therapy was not widely embraced.

Our findings are more consistent with smaller randomized trials and observational studies assessing the value of ≥ 12 months of DAPT after PCI. Randomized trials comparing 6 versus 12 months of DAPT after PCI generally show similar risks of MI and ischemic endpoints with 6 months of DAPT, with one study indicating higher rates of MI and less major bleeding. We found a significantly lower risk of cardiac death and MI with stopping DAPT after 9 months, which could reflect the effect of unknown confounders related to lower MI risk and DAPT discontinuation.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for stented patients: An update for the clinician [^111FkS5w]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Determining the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention is a complex decision. Randomized controlled trials have shown that while shorter durations of DAPT may lower the risk of bleeding, longer durations can reduce the risk of late stent thrombosis and ischemia-related events. In this review article, we will discuss the guidelines, review contemporary trial data that have evaluated short and extended durations of DAPT, and address common clinical questions. Ultimately, the determination of the optimal duration of DAPT is an individualized decision that requires clinicians to assess each patient's risk for bleeding and re-ischemic events.

### Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stenting in patients with acute coronary syndromes: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114PKmPg]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains under debate.

- **Objectives**: To analyze the efficacy and safety of DAPT strategies in patients with ACS using a Bayesian network meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and LILACS databases were searched from inception to April 8, 2024.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing DAPT duration strategies in patients with ACS undergoing PCI were selected. Short-term strategies (1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors, 3 months of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors, 3 months of DAPT followed by aspirin, and 6 months of DAPT followed by aspirin) were compared with conventional 12 months of DAPT.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: This systematic review and network meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The risk ratio (RR) with a 95% credible interval (CrI) was calculated within a Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis. Treatments were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary efficacy end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE); the primary safety end point was major bleeding.

A total of 15 RCTs randomizing 35,326 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [11.1] years; 26,954 male [76.3%]; 11,339 STEMI [32.1%]) with ACS were included. A total of 24,797 patients (70.2%) received potent P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor).

### Dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: How short is too short [^1179Lx5L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients presenting with chronic coronary syndrome as well as acute coronary syndrome. However, the optimal duration of DAPT is a matter of debate. On the one hand, ischemic risk, especially early after PCI, is high and should be reduced by DAPT. On the other hand, DAPT aligns with an enhanced risk for bleeding events, particularly in patients with additional comorbidities or at an advanced age where bleeding risk is substantially increased.

For a long time, the reduction of ischemic events was the main focus of DAPT. This focus has changed substantially as bleeding is now recognized as a relevant factor impacting hard outcome endpoints, such as death. The relevance of bleeding is underlined by recent randomized controlled trials. In the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial, for example, a DAPT regimen with ticagrelor led to no reduction of all-cause death, although the rate of myocardial infarction was reduced. In contrast, the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial revealed a reduction in death from any cause without a significant decrease in myocardial infarction.

Preventing ischemic events, like myocardial infarction, remains the primary purpose of DAPT. However, reducing bleeding events, which also contribute to hard endpoints like all-cause death, presents a major challenge for the upcoming years. Recent guidelines recommend DAPT for 12 months after acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.

### Meta-analysis of the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients treated with second-generation drug-eluting stents [^111Yb4ps]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention, especially in the era of second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES). The work was conducted from November 2014 to April 2015. All randomized controlled trials comparing short (< 12 months) versus long (≥ 12 months) DAPT in patients treated with second-generation DES were analyzed. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the length of DAPT and type of DES.

All-cause death was the primary endpoint, whereas cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis (ST), and major bleeding were secondary endpoints. Results were pooled and compared using random-effect models and meta-regression analysis. Eight randomized controlled trials with 18,810 randomized patients were included. The studies compared 3 versus 12 months of DAPT (2 trials), 6 versus 12 months (3 trials), 6 versus 24 months (1 trial), 12 versus 24 months (1 trial), and 12 versus 30 months (1 trial).

- **Findings**:
	- Short versus long DAPT showed no significant differences in all-cause death (odds ratio [OR] 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 1.44), cardiovascular death (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.37), and ST (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.83). No differences were present when considering everolimus-eluting and fast-release zotarolimus-eluting stents separately.

	- Shorter DAPT was inferior to longer DAPT in preventing MI (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77). Conversely, major bleeding was reduced by shorter DAPT (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96).

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome [^114CaGZR]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, there are variations in local and regional dual antiplatelet therapy practices, which are confusing for patients, primary care physicians, and cardiologists. Indeed, while European and North American guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome, both acknowledge that shorter or longer durations may be appropriate. Duration of therapy is seen as a major priority for future research by numerous national and international guideline committees. It also has considerable financial implications, especially for the latest generation of P2Y12 receptor antagonists. However, major pharmaceutical companies have, at the time of writing, not funded trials comparing shorter (< 12 months) durations of dual antiplatelet therapy, as it may not be in their commercial interest to do so.

For clinicians and healthcare providers, there remains much uncertainty regarding the default duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for most patients with acute coronary syndrome. Guidelines are largely based on evidence that predates potentially important technological advances, including second-generation drug-eluting stents. In recent trials, only a minority of patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome, and many of these studies were underpowered to detect differences due to low event rates. Selected populations included in randomized controlled trials have lower rates of bleeding and non-cardiovascular death than the general population, as patients with any history of bleeding or major comorbidity were often excluded.
