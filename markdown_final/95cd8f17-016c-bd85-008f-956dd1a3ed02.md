## Question

When to give fidaxomin instead of vancomycin for c. Diff

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to choose fidaxomicin instead of vancomycin for Clostridioides difficile infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, including whether this is an initial episode or a recurrence, and how severity is defined. Then, I should verify the comparative efficacy data for initial cure, recurrence, and sustained response. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile any differences. After that, I need to consider special populations and scenarios like fulminant disease, pediatrics, and concomitant antibiotics. Finally, I should weigh cost, access, and synthesize a practical decision framework with dosing and alternatives, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because it frames the decision. I need to distinguish an initial episode from a recurrence, and I should classify severity as nonsevere versus severe or fulminant, since fulminant disease changes the antibiotic choice and dosing strategy. I should confirm that fulminant CDI is typically defined by hypotension, shock, ileus, toxic megacolon, or need for ICU care, and that guidelines generally exclude fulminant disease from fidaxomicin trials, which matters for evidence applicability [^bbd87b09] [^4886f2db].

> Next, I should review the core efficacy data. Wait, let me verify the pivotal trials and meta-analyses. Two large phase 3 RCTs show fidaxomicin is noninferior to vancomycin for initial clinical cure but achieves a roughly 10–15% absolute reduction in recurrence, translating into higher sustained response. Pooled analyses and a network meta-analysis corroborate this advantage, with an odds ratio around 0.5–0.7 for recurrence versus vancomycin, and no mortality difference, which aligns with guideline summaries [^9ac27af7] [^88b54771] [^d0389d78] [^9a4b9136] [^0674fd15].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should align this with guideline positions. The 2021 IDSA/SHEA focused update recommends fidaxomicin rather than vancomycin for an initial episode, citing moderate certainty evidence and improved sustained response, while acknowledging vancomycin remains acceptable if fidaxomicin is unavailable or cost-prohibitive. ESCMID 2021 similarly prefers fidaxomicin for initial and first recurrence when available, and ACG gives fidaxomicin a strong recommendation with moderate quality evidence for nonsevere disease and a conditional recommendation for severe disease, reflecting limited direct evidence in severe cases [^b1b4aac2] [^71bfd261] [^3b586f45] [^d0afc94b].

> I need to check special scenarios carefully. For fulminant CDI, I initially thought fidaxomicin might be reasonable, but wait, I should verify. The IDSA/SHEA update explicitly recommends high-dose oral vancomycin with or without metronidazole and intravenous metronidazole for fulminant disease, noting trials excluded fulminant cases and there is no evidence base for fidaxomicin in this setting, so fidaxomicin should not be used for fulminant CDI. For pediatrics, I should confirm the SUNSHINE trial showed higher global cure with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin and led to FDA expansion to children 6 months and older, supporting fidaxomicin as an option when available. For patients requiring concomitant antibiotics, subgroup and randomized data suggest fidaxomicin maintains higher cure and lower recurrence than vancomycin, though I should note some newer data are observational and mixed, so I should interpret this cautiously [^bbd87b09] [^3116d756] [^57f7b575] [^315eccf8].

> Let me consider recurrence management specifically. For a first recurrence, guidelines prefer fidaxomicin over vancomycin to reduce second recurrence, and both standard and extended-pulsed fidaxomicin regimens are acceptable. If fidaxomicin was used for the initial episode, adding bezlotoxumab can be considered for high-risk patients, and for multiple recurrences, FMT becomes a key strategy. I should double-check that these recommendations are consistent across IDSA/SHEA, ESCMID, and ACG, which they are [^de4b53c4] [^a50b2ed0] [^99e21f92].

> I should confirm dosing and practicalities. Standard regimens are fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days or vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 days. Fidaxomicin has minimal systemic absorption and does not require renal dosing, which is convenient, but its cost is substantially higher than vancomycin, impacting access and cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest fidaxomicin is cost-effective at commonly used thresholds when downstream recurrence costs are considered, though payer coverage varies and may limit use [^1fabcc60] [^c547acd7] [^eee3b35f].

> But wait, what if resources are constrained or the patient is high risk for recurrence. I should verify that several guidelines advise prioritizing fidaxomicin for patients at highest risk of recurrence, such as older adults, immunocompromised hosts, severe CDI, or those needing concomitant antibiotics, while recognizing that real-world studies sometimes show similar outcomes and that access and stewardship constraints may necessitate vancomycin as an acceptable alternative. This means I need to individualize based on risk, access, and patient preferences [^71bfd261] [^e964636e] [^21fabb26].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework and sanity-check it against the evidence. Choose fidaxomicin over vancomycin when the goal is to minimize recurrence and when the patient is in a non-fulminant initial episode, for a first recurrence, or when risk factors for recurrence are present, provided it is accessible and affordable. Choose vancomycin when fidaxomicin is unavailable or cost-prohibitive, or when treating fulminant disease where high-dose vancomycin with or without metronidazole is indicated. Metronidazole is no longer first-line except in select low-risk, nonsevere cases when preferred agents are not available, and I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary guidelines, which it does [^b1b4aac2] [^bbd87b09] [^3b586f45].

> Final answer, with caveats: Prefer fidaxomicin over vancomycin for non-fulminant initial CDI and for first recurrence because it achieves similar initial cure with significantly lower recurrence and higher sustained response. Vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative when fidaxomicin is unavailable or unaffordable, and vancomycin is preferred for fulminant disease. Individualize for high-risk patients when access allows, and consider pediatric approval and concomitant antibiotic scenarios where fidaxomicin may offer additional benefit, while acknowledging that some real-world data are mixed and cost remains a major barrier [^9ac27af7] [^d0389d78] [^71bfd261] [^3116d756] [^c547acd7].

---

Fidaxomicin is preferred over vancomycin for **initial CDI episodes** [^b1b4aac2] because it achieves similar clinical cure [^9ac27af7] but significantly reduces recurrence [^d0389d78] and improves sustained response [^f89b5bdc]. It is especially beneficial for patients at **high risk of recurrence** — older adults, immunocompromised patients, those with severe CDI, or those requiring concomitant antibiotics [^71bfd261] [^d1460246] [^57f7b575]. Vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative when fidaxomicin is unavailable or cost-prohibitive [^c547acd7] [^1fabcc60]. For fulminant CDI, vancomycin is preferred because fidaxomicin lacks supportive data [^bbd87b09] [^4886f2db].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting fidaxomicin

- **Initial clinical cure**: Fidaxomicin is noninferior to vancomycin for initial clinical cure (88.2% vs 85.8%) [^9ac27af7] [^88b54771].

- **Recurrence**: Fidaxomicin reduces recurrence by ~30% (15.4% vs 25.3%) [^9ac27af7] [^88b54771].

- **Sustained response**: Fidaxomicin improves sustained response at 30 days (74.6% vs 64.1%) [^9ac27af7] [^d0389d78].

- **Concomitant antibiotics**: Fidaxomicin maintains higher cure and lower recurrence than vancomycin when other antibiotics are needed [^57f7b575] [^45ec7804].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from fidaxomicin

Fidaxomicin is **particularly beneficial** for the following patient populations:

| **Patient population** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) | Higher recurrence risk; fidaxomicin reduces recurrence and improves sustained response [^b235cc30] [^d0389d78] |
| Immunocompromised patients | Higher recurrence risk; fidaxomicin lowers recurrence and improves sustained response [^71bfd261] [^d0389d78] |
| Severe CDI | Lower recurrence and better sustained response vs vancomycin [^4886f2db] [^d0389d78] |
| Patients requiring concomitant antibiotics | Higher cure and lower recurrence vs vancomycin [^57f7b575] [^45ec7804] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where vancomycin remains preferred

Vancomycin is preferred in the following scenarios:

- **Fulminant CDI**: Vancomycin is recommended due to lack of fidaxomicin data [^bbd87b09] [^4886f2db].

- **Cost or access constraints**: Vancomycin is an acceptable alternative when fidaxomicin is unavailable or cost-prohibitive [^c547acd7] [^1fabcc60].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Fidaxomicin's higher upfront cost is offset by **lower recurrence** and fewer retreatments, making it cost-effective in many settings [^eee3b35f] [^d8ea4e93]. Cost-effectiveness is strongest in patients at **high risk of recurrence** [^notfound].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

- **IDSA/SHEA 2021**: Prefer fidaxomicin over vancomycin for initial CDI; vancomycin is acceptable if fidaxomicin is unavailable [^b1b4aac2] [^5243544e].

- **ESCMID 2021**: Prefer fidaxomicin for initial and first recurrence; vancomycin if fidaxomicin is unavailable [^71bfd261] [^a50b2ed0].

- **ACG 2021**: Fidaxomicin or vancomycin for initial CDI; fidaxomicin preferred in patients at high recurrence risk [^3b586f45] [^d0afc94b].

---

## Practical clinical decision-making

- **Initial episode**: Prefer fidaxomicin; use vancomycin if fidaxomicin is unavailable or cost-prohibitive [^b1b4aac2] [^1fabcc60].

- **High recurrence risk**: Strongly consider fidaxomicin for elderly, immunocompromised, severe CDI, or concomitant antibiotics [^71bfd261] [^d1460246].

- **Fulminant CDI**: Use vancomycin; fidaxomicin is not recommended due to insufficient evidence [^bbd87b09] [^4886f2db].

- **Recurrent CDI**: Prefer fidaxomicin for first recurrence; vancomycin taper is an alternative [^de4b53c4] [^fb4885b7].

---

Fidaxomicin is preferred over vancomycin for **initial CDI** because it reduces recurrence and improves sustained response, with the greatest benefit in patients at **high risk of recurrence**. Vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative when fidaxomicin is unavailable or cost-prohibitive, and is preferred for fulminant CDI.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for infection with Clostridium difficile in Europe, Canada, and the USA: a double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^88b54771]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Clostridium difficile is the primary infective cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. We aimed to compare efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin and vancomycin to treat patients with C difficile infection in Europe, Canada, and the USA.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled patients from 45 sites in Europe and 41 sites in the USA and Canada between April 19, 2007, and Dec 11, 2009. Eligible patients were aged 16 years or older with acute, toxin-positive C difficile infection. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive oral fidaxomicin (200 mg every 12 h) or oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 h) for 10 days. The primary endpoint was clinical cure, defined as resolution of diarrhoea and no further need for treatment. An interactive voice-response system and computer-generated randomisation schedule gave a randomisation number and medication kit number for each patient. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Non-inferiority was prespecified with a margin of 10%. Modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations were analysed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00468728.

Findings

Of 535 patients enrolled, 270 were assigned fidaxomicin and 265 vancomycin. After 26 patients were excluded, 509 were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. 198 (91·7%) of 216 patients in the per-protocol population given fidaxomicin achieved clinical cure, compared with 213 (90·6%) of 235 given vancomycin, meeting the criterion for non-inferiority (one-sided 97·5% CI -4·3%). Non-inferiority was also shown for clinical cure in the mITT population, with 221 (87·7%) of 252 patients given fidaxomicin and 223 (86·8%) of 257 given vancomycin cured (one-sided 97·5% CI -4·9%). In most subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint in the mITT population, outcomes in the two treatment groups did not differ significantly; although patients receiving concomitant antibiotics for other infections had a higher cure rate with fidaxomicin (46 [90·2%] of 51) than with vancomycin (33 [73·3%] of 45; p = 0·031). Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ between groups. 20 (7·6%) of 264 patients given at least one dose of fidaxomicin and 17 (6·5%) of 260 given vancomycin died.

Interpretation

Fidaxomicin could be an alternative treatment for infection with C difficile, with similar efficacy and safety to vancomycin.

### An open-label, randomized trial comparing fidaxomicin with oral vancomycin for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving concomitant antibiotics for concurrent infections [^315eccf8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) occurs frequently, and concomitant antibiotic (CA) during the initial episode for treatment of non-CDI is a major risk factor. We sought to address the comparative efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in the setting of CA during the initial CDI episode.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial at 2 hospitals in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We consecutively consented and enrolled hospitalized patients ≥ 18 years old with diarrhea, a positive test for C. difficile, and ≥ 1 qualifying CA. Complicated CDI, CDI treatment for > 24 hours prior to enrollment, and planned long-term (> 12 weeks) CA use were notable exclusions. Clinical cure was defined as resolution of diarrhea for 2 consecutive days maintained until 2 days after therapy, and rCDI as recurrent diarrhea with positive testing ≤ 30 days after initial treatment. Patients were randomized to fidaxomicin or vancomycin.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups of 144 patients. Rates of clinical cure (73% vs 62.9%, P = 0.195) and rCDI (3.3% vs 4.0%; P > .99) were similar for fidaxomicin and vancomycin in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol cohorts, respectively. Only 4 patients developed rCDI.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with CDI receiving CA, a numerically higher proportion were cured with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, but this result did not reach statistical significance. Overall recurrence was lower than anticipated in both arms compared with previous studies that did not extend duration of CDI treatment during CA.

### The effect of antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0674fd15]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current practice guidelines favour fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin, giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

Objectives

To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

Interventions

Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

Results

Thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favouring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found, however, initial treatment failure was higher with metronidazole (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10–2.27, 5 RCTs, 843 patients). No study reported on symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment among all randomly assigned patients. Among initially cured patients, symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment was lower with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42–0.71, 6 RCTs, 1617 patients). None of the studies reported on other CDI complications or the burden of infection on daily activities.

Conclusions

Setting patient-relevant outcomes for CDI independently of the RCT definitions and results might lead to less confidence in the guidance for CDI management.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^92955395]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014-present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^71bfd261]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

### Current and emerging management options for Clostridium difficile infection: what is the role of fidaxomicin? [^8f763d38]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Until recently, treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was mainly limited to oral metronidazole and vancomycin, neither of which is optimal. Up to 25% of patients with CDI experience recurrence of infection within 30 days following treatment with these agents, while c. 45–65% of these patients experience further (and sometimes multiple) recurrences. Recurrent CDI represents a major treatment challenge for which new therapeutic options are sorely needed. Fidaxomicin is a first-in-class, oral macrocyclic antibiotic with targeted bactericidal activity against C. difficile and minimal effect on the constituents of the normal colonic microflora. This microflora-sparing activity allows for more rapid restoration of the normal colonic microflora in patients with CDI. In two separate, but almost identical, phase 3 clinical trials in which patients with CDI were treated with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin, fidaxomicin demonstrated superior clinical outcomes in comparison with the current best available treatment. While non-inferiority was demonstrated with respect to rates of clinical cure at end of treatment, significantly fewer fidaxomicin-treated patients experienced disease recurrence, which translated into clinically significant improvements in sustained clinical cure. Subsequent sub-population analyses suggest that these benefits extend to older patients, patients with severe CDI, renally impaired patients and patients with a prior episode of CDI. For CDI patients receiving concomitant antibiotics, fidaxomicin achieved significantly better rates of clinical cure and sustained clinical cure than vancomycin recipients. Fidaxomicin has a safety profile similar to oral vancomycin and appears generally well tolerated. Fidaxomicin represents an important addition to current treatment options for CDI.

### Treatment of first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection: fidaxomicin versus vancomycin [^cb79f2ee]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occurs in approximately 25% of successfully treated patients. Two phase 3 randomized, double-blind trials were conducted at 154 sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe to compare fidaxomicin vs vancomycin in treating CDI. Patients with CDI received fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days. The primary end point was clinical cure of CDI at end of treatment, and a secondary end point was recurrence during the 28 days following clinical cure. In all, 1164 subjects were enrolled, of which a subgroup of 128 in the per-protocol population had another recent episode of CDI prior to the CDI diagnosis at study enrollment. In the analysis of this subgroup, initial response to therapy was similar for both drugs (> 90% cure). However, recurrence within 28 days occurred in 35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin (-15.8% difference; 95% confidence interval, -30.4% to -0.3%; P = 0.045). Early recurrence (within 14 days) was reported in 27% of patients treated with vancomycin and 8% of patients treated with fidaxomicin (P = 0.003). In patients with a first recurrence of CDI, fidaxomicin was similar to vancomycin in achieving a clinical response at end of therapy but superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days.

### The clinical effectiveness of fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin in the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection, A single-center real-world experience [^6932f5e2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of fidaxomicin is recommended as first-line therapy for all patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). However, real-world studies have shown conflicting evidence of superiority.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective single-center study of patients diagnosed with CDI between 2011 and 2021. A primary composite outcome of clinical failure, 30-day relapse, or CDI-related death was used. A multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin in preventing the composite outcome. A separate model was fit on a subset of patients with C. difficile ribotypes adjusting for ribotype.

Results

There were 598 patients included, of whom 84 received fidaxomicin. The primary outcome occurred in 8 (9.5%) in the fidaxomicin group compared to 111 (21.6%) in the vancomycin group. The adjusted multivariable model showed fidaxomicin was associated with 63% reduction in the risk of the composite outcome compared to vancomycin (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI].17-.80). In the 337 patients with ribotype data after adjusting for ribotype 027, the results showing superiority of fidaxomicin were maintained (HR = 0.19; 95% CI, .05-.77).

Conclusions

In the treatment of CDI, we showed that real-world use of fidaxomicin is associated with lower risk of a composite end point of treatment failure.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection [^9ac27af7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile infection is a serious diarrheal illness associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Patients generally have a response to oral vancomycin or metronidazole; however, the rate of recurrence is high. This phase 3 clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin with those of vancomycin in treating C. difficile infection.

Methods

Adults with acute symptoms of C. difficile infection and a positive result on a stool toxin test were eligible for study entry. We randomly assigned patients to receive fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) or vancomycin (125 mg four times daily) orally for 10 days. The primary end point was clinical cure (resolution of symptoms and no need for further therapy for C. difficile infection as of the second day after the end of the course of therapy). The secondary end points were recurrence of C. difficile infection (diarrhea and a positive result on a stool toxin test within 4 weeks after treatment) and global cure (i.e., cure with no recurrence).

Results

A total of 629 patients were enrolled, of whom 548 (87.1%) could be evaluated for the per-protocol analysis. The rates of clinical cure with fidaxomicin were noninferior to those with vancomycin in both the modified intention-to-treat analysis (88.2% with fidaxomicin and 85.8% with vancomycin) and the per-protocol analysis (92.1% and 89.8%, respectively). Significantly fewer patients in the fidaxomicin group than in the vancomycin group had a recurrence of the infection, in both the modified intention-to-treat analysis (15.4% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.005) and the per-protocol analysis (13.3% vs. 24.0%, P = 0.004). The lower rate of recurrence was seen in patients with non–North American Pulsed Field type 1 strains. The adverse-event profile was similar for the two therapies.

Conclusions

The rates of clinical cure after treatment with fidaxomicin were noninferior to those after treatment with vancomycin. Fidaxomicin was associated with a significantly lower rate of recurrence of C. difficile infection associated with non–North American Pulsed Field type 1 strains.

### Comparative effectiveness of Clostridium difficile treatments: a systematic review [^52f0f1fa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile infection is increasing in incidence and severity. The optimal treatment is unknown.

Purpose

To determine whether, among adults with C. difficile infection, treatment with certain antibiotics compared with others results in differences in initial cure, recurrence, and harms.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, AMED, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases (search dates: inception through August 2011, limited to English-language reports); bibliography review.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of adults with C. difficile infection, independent of outcomes, who were treated with medications available in the United States. Observational studies reporting strain were included.

Data Extraction

Study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and strength of evidence as assessed by 2 reviewers, study definitions, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Outcomes included initial cure, recurrence, and treatment harms.

Data Synthesis

11 trials that included 1463 participants were identified. Three trials compared metronidazole with vancomycin; 8 compared metronidazole or vancomycin with another agent, combined agents, or placebo. Strain was analyzed in 1 trial and 2 cohort studies. No study comparing 2 antimicrobial agents demonstrated a statistically significant difference for initial cure; all comparisons were of low to moderate strength of evidence. Moderate-strength evidence from 1 study demonstrated that recurrence was decreased with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin (15% vs. 25%; difference, -10 percentage points [95% CI, -17 to -3 percentage points]; P = 0.005). Subgroup analysis of a single study comparing metronidazole with vancomycin for patients who have severe C. difficile infection showed no difference by intention-to-treat analysis; this was rated as insufficient-strength evidence. Harms, when reported, did not differ between treatments in any study.

Limitations

Definitions of diarrhea, C. difficile infection, initial cure, and relapse varied. Some studies reported insufficient detail to allow assessment of all randomly assigned participants or of harms.

Conclusion

No antimicrobial agent is clearly superior for the initial cure of C. difficile infection. Recurrence is less frequent with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^65cb9368]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014–present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^1d597110]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

After providing informed consent, participants were randomized to receive 10 days' oral therapy as either 200 mg of fidaxomicin every 12 hours with intervening matching doses of placebo or 125 mg of vancomycin every 6 hours. Capsules containing drug or placebo were indistinguishable. Randomization was stratified according to whether the current CDI was a first (primary infection) or second (first recurrence) episode within the 3 months before enrollment and by study site.

Clinical cure was defined as resolution of diarrhea (≤ 3 unformed stools for 2 consecutive days) maintained for the subsequent duration of therapy with no further requirement for CDI therapy assessed 2 days after the end of the 10-day blinded treatment course (the primary posttreatment assessment). Clinical failure was defined as the persistence of diarrhea, need for additional CDI therapy, or both. Participants meeting criteria for clinical cure were followed up for 28 days after the end of treatment for a final trial assessment (36–40 days after randomization). Global cure was defined as clinical cure without subsequent recurrence, with subsequent CDI recurrence defined as the reappearance of > 3 unformed stools in any 24-hour period with C. difficile toxin A or B (or both) detected and a need for CDI retreatment, and prompting a full trial assessment. "Global cure" is identical to "sustained response" as defined by the FDA.

The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure in the modified ITT (mITT) and per-protocol populations at the end-of-therapy assessment as previously described, with a 10% noninferiority margin. Secondary efficacy endpoints were CDI recurrence and global cure as defined previously. In all these prespecified analyses, early withdrawals and deaths were treated as failures (not successes). Safety was evaluated as described for study 003; results were similar (not shown).

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^e19fe794]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Two recently completed phase 3 trials (003 and 004) showed fidaxomicin to be noninferior to vancomycin for curing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and superior for reducing CDI recurrences. In both studies, adults with active CDI were randomized to receive blinded fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg 4 times a day for 10 days. Post hoc exploratory intent-to-treat (ITT) time-to-event analyses were undertaken on the combined study 003 and 004 data, using fixed-effects meta-analysis and Cox regression models. ITT analysis of the combined 003/004 data for 1164 patients showed that fidaxomicin reduced persistent diarrhea, recurrence, or death by 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26%–51%; P < .0001) compared with vancomycin through day 40. A 37% (95% CI, 2%–60%; P = 0.037) reduction in persistent diarrhea or death was evident through day 12 (heterogeneity P = 0.50 vs 13–40 days), driven by 7 (1.2%) fidaxomicin versus 17 (2.9%) vancomycin deaths at < 12 days. Low albumin level, low eosinophil count, and CDI treatment preenrollment were risk factors for persistent diarrhea or death at 12 days, and CDI in the previous 3 months was a risk factor for recurrence (all P < .01). Fidaxomicin has the potential to substantially improve outcomes from CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^1b9e2fac]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CURRENT AND NEWLY APPROVED Clostridioides difficile INFECTION TREATMENTS

The vegetative bacteria can be successfully eliminated with antimicrobial therapy; however, the spores are highly resilient and can persist in the gut. The treatment of initial CDI with antimicrobial therapy can cause further disruptions to the microbiota, exacerbating the intestinal dysbiosis and potentially leading to the relapse of symptoms, known as CDI recurrence. CDI recurrence is defined as the onset of symptoms within 8 weeks of clinical cure from a previous episode and can occur in up to 20% of patients, with increasing frequency with each subsequent episode. This highlights the need to combine current antimicrobial regimes with microbiota-restorative therapies to re-establish colonization resistance of the commensal microbiota and reduce the likelihood of recurrent disease.

In line with current guidelines, CDI treatment options include fidaxomicin, vancomycin and metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates superior preservation of the intestinal microbiota when compared to vancomycin and is associated with similar clinical cure rates and a lower risk of CDI recurrence. Fidaxomicin standard therapy (200 mg, 12 hourly for 10 days) is recommended as the first choice for treatment of the initial episode of nonsevere CDI, severe CDI and severe-complicated/refractory CDI. If fidaxomicin is not available, standard vancomycin therapy (125 mg, 6 hourly for 10 days) can be used as an alternative. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first line agent to treat CDI as the clinical cure rate demonstrated inferiority to vancomycin and was found to be a robust predictor of recurrence; however, despite recommendations, metronidazole remains a first line treatment option in many countries due to the cost and availability of alternatives.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 focused update — rationale for fidaxomicin vs vancomycin states that the panel agrees the balance of benefits and harms favors using fidaxomicin over vancomycin for an initial episode of CDI, with moderate certainty of evidence; the panel also judges the use of fidaxomicin is likely cost-effective, acceptable to patients and providers, and feasible to implement when considering dosing and duration, and notes that achieving both initial and sustained clinical responses are key goals and that lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin are an important advantage.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guideline — initial episode treatment with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin — recommendation and pooled outcomes: For patients with an initial CDI episode, the guideline states, "we suggest using fidaxomicin rather than a standard course of vancomycin (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence)". The comment notes implementation "depends upon available resources" and that "Vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative". Trials compared fidaxomicin with vancomycin "(125 mg orally 4 times daily for 10 days)", and one study used an extended regimen "(200 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, followed by once daily on alternate days on days 7–25)… rather than a standard regimen (200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days)". In pooled analysis, fidaxomicin increased sustained response at 4 weeks versus standard vancomycin with "risk ratio [RR]: 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.24", while initial clinical cure was comparable "(RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96–1.04)" and mortality was not reduced "(RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.66–1.23)". Drug-related adverse events were not increased "(RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.76–1.36)", and "The overall certainty in the evidence was rated as moderate" due to study design and imprecision.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrence — recommendation rationale indicates that evidence now suggests fidaxomicin should be preferred over vancomycin in this setting; the panel agrees that the overall balance of benefits and harms favors using fidaxomicin rather than vancomycin for patients with CDI recurrence and that the certainty of evidence was low, and further judges that patients' values and preferences, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility support the preferential use of fidaxomicin over vancomycin.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^3b586f45]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — initial and severe/fulminant CDI treatment recommend for an initial nonsevere episode that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) or that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), while oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 d may be considered in low-risk patients. As initial therapy for severe CDI, we recommend vancomycin 125 mg 4 times a day for 10 d (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and we recommend fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Patients with fulminant CDI should receive medical therapy that includes adequate volume resuscitation and treatment with 500 mg of oral vancomycin every 6 hr (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) for the first 48–72 hr, and combination therapy with parenteral metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hr can be considered (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with an ileus, the addition of vancomycin enemas (500 mg every 6 hr) may be beneficial (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection [^33b8ae04]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis was published by Louie TJ and colleagues in 2011 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Clostridioides difficile infection. In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the trial question was: is fidaxomicin noninferior to vancomycin in patients with acute C. difficile infection? In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the population was: 596 patients (333 female, 263 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute symptoms of C. difficile infection and a positive result on a stool toxin test. The key exclusion criteria were life-threatening or fulminant C. difficile infection, toxic megacolon, previous exposure to fidaxomicin, history of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, or > 1 occurrence of C. difficile infection within 3 months before the start of the study. In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the interventions were: n = 287 fidaxomicin (200 mg BID PO for 10 days) n = 309 vancomycin (125 mg QID PO for 10 days). In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in recurrence of infection (15.4% vs. 25.3%; ARR 9.9, 95% CI -16.6 to -2.9). In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in resolution of diarrhea without recurrence (74.6% vs. 64.1%; ARD 10.5, 95% CI 3.1 to 17.7). In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Fidaxomicin for C. difficile colitis study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with acute symptoms of C. difficile infection and a positive result on a stool toxin test, fidaxomicin was noninferior to vancomycin with respect to recurrence of infection.

### Antibiotic therapies for Clostridioides difficile infection in children [^e6a43b8b]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

While rates of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) are increasing among children in the United States, studies assessing CDI treatment in children are severely lacking. Thus, treatment guidelines have historically relied on evidence from limited observational data in children and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults to form recommendations. Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommend metronidazole and/or vancomycin for pediatric CDI depending on disease severity. Recently however, the first and only RCT of CDI treatment in children demonstrated fidaxomicin to be non-inferior to vancomycin, proving its safety and efficacy in this population. Additionally, observational data published since the IDSA/SHEA guidelines were released suggest metronidazole has lower rates of clinical improvement when compared to vancomycin in hospitalized children with non-severe CDI. Given these recent publications, fidaxomicin and vancomycin, instead of metronidazole, appear to be more appropriate, evidence-based options for the treatment of CDI in children.

### Efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin as therapy for Clostridium difficile infection in individuals taking concomitant antibiotics for other concurrent infections [^57f7b575]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment guidelines recommend stopping all implicated antibiotics at the onset of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but many individuals have persistent or new infections necessitating the use of concomitant antibiotics (CAs). We used data from 2 phase 3 trials to study effects of CAs on response to fidaxomicin or vancomycin.

Methods

Subjects with CDI were treated for 10 days with fidaxomicin 200 mg every 12 hours or vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours, assessed for resolution of symptoms, and followed up for an additional 4 weeks for evidence of recurrence. Rates of cure, recurrence, and global cure (cure without recurrence) were determined for subgroups of subjects defined by CA use and treatment group.

Results

CAs were prescribed for 27.5% of subjects during study participation. The use of CAs concurrent with CDI treatment was associated with a lower cure rate (84.4% vs 92.6%; P < .001) and an extended time to resolution of diarrhea (97 vs 54 hours; P < .001). CA use during the follow-up was associated with more recurrences (24.8% vs 17.7%; not significant), and CA administration at any time was associated with a lower global cure rate (65.8% vs 74.7%; P = 0.005). When subjects received CAs concurrent with CDI treatment, the cure rate was 90.0% for fidaxomicin and 79.4% for vancomycin (P = 0.04). In subjects receiving CAs during treatment and/or follow-up, treatment with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin was associated with 12.3% fewer recurrences (16.9% vs 29.2%; P = 0.048).

Conclusions

Treatment with CAs compromised initial response to CDI therapy and durability of response. Fidaxomicin was significantly more effective than vancomycin in achieving clinical cure in the presence of CA therapy and in preventing recurrence regardless of CA use.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^ffa30cc9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of primary C. difficile infection: for a patient with an initial episode of CDI, we recommend fidaxomicin instead of a standard course of vancomycin.
Treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection: in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, we recommend fidaxomicin (either standard or extended pulse) rather than a standard course of vancomycin.
Prevention of recurrence of C. difficile infection: for patients with CDI and at least 1 risk factor for recurrence (e.g. age > 65, immunocompromise, severe CDI and history of CDI), we suggest using bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antimicrobial.

These updates to the IDSA/SHEA 2017 guideline further acknowledge the issue that was highlighted in the study by Ma et al. showing a significant increase in multiply recurrent CDI. By treating more aggressively earlier in the disease with fidaxomicin preferentially, there should be less recurrence and better outcomes. This is a remarkable advancement with regards to the recommendations, since fidaxomicin was recommended provisionally in front of vancomycin for both initial and recurrent disease. There have been a number of studies that support this, but the two primary studies are referenced here. The first is a multi-center European study of inpatients with CDI who were randomized to receive either vancomycin 125 mg PO QID for 10 days or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice per day (BID) for 5 days and then one tablet every other day for days 7–25. The study showed that vancomycin and fidaxomicin are similar in terms of initial treatment response, but follow up at 90 days showed a significantly lower rate of recurrence in those who received fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin (6.2% versus 19.0%, p < 0.001). This study shows that, with an alternative usage of fidaxomicin, very low rates of recurrence can be achieved. The other study used to support fidaxomicin being used preferentially ahead of vancomycin was a meta-analysis by Okumura et al. including seven publications. This found that fidaxomicin and vancomycin were more effective treatments for those within initial CDI compared with metronidazole, and that fidaxomicin may be more effective at preventing recurrence than vancomycin. It is important to consider the cost of fidaxomicin as this has been a recurring theme raised by the clinical guidelines and might be something that will limit access to this treatment, even if the finalized IDSA/SHEA update continues to favor fidaxomicin first line in those with initial episode and those with recurrence. Therefore, as with any treatment, accessibility of the treatment must be considered by the practitioner since the best treatment is one that a patient can both acquire and follow through with.

### Fidaxomicin versus oral vancomycin forinfection among patients at high risk for recurrence based on real-world experience [^e964636e]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) provided a focused update for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in June 2021, with fidaxomicin (FDX) recommended as first-line therapy for non-fulminant disease.FDX is recommended primarily based on clinical trial data showing a reduced rate of recurrence compared to oral vancomycin (VAN). – FDX is thought to be associated with lower rates of recurrence due to its narrower spectrum of activity compared to VAN making it less disruptive to gut microbiota, its post-antibiotic effect, and bactericidal activity.

Although the IDSA/SHEA guidelines recommend a preference for FDX, high acquisition cost and limitations in coverage from payers remain a barrier to patient access and contribute to higher overall healthcare costs. The IDSA/SHEA guidelines note that VAN is a reasonable first-line option if resources are not available for obtaining FDX. Additionally, American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines for CDI management still recommend oral VAN as first-line therapy with the same level of evidence as FDX for non-fulminant disease for primary episodes.

At our medical center, prior to the updated IDSA/SHEA guidelines, we routinely recommended VAN over FDX for non-fulminant CDI. Based on the updated guideline recommendations, we modified our recommendations to prefer FDX for patients with CDI meeting certain criteria. Given the high cost of FDX we chose to recommend FDX as first-line therapy only in patients at the greatest risk for recurrent CDI (rCDI). We sought to evaluate whether rates of rCDI at 8 weeks were lower among patients at high risk for rCDI that received FDX compared to VAN as the primary outcome.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^567108be]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are currently only two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for CDI: vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Fidaxomicin was approved for use in adult patients with initial episode of CDI in 2011. Metronidazole has never received FDA approval and is used off label. With this basic understanding, this manuscript is designed to describe the evolution of the antimicrobial treatment guidelines in the US, including all global guidelines to compare and contrast the recommendations understanding the differences among these documents and how they have evolved over time. It is important to consider that, outside of the US, the impact of CDI and associated strains are seen differently and this will influence the recommendations made. The priority of this manuscript is to focus on the changes in these guideline documents over the prior decade.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^b79a4d32]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in both studies were analyzed according to a meta-analysis of these outcomes using fixed-effect models. The endpoints were presented as the poor outcomes, namely, "no clinical cure" (converse of clinical cure), "no global cure" (converse of global cure), and "recurrence", so that relative risks for fidaxomicin versus vancomycin of < 1 consistently indicate reduced risk for poor outcome with fidaxomicin.

A post hoc exploratory time-to-event ITT analysis of the composite endpoint persistent diarrhea (equivalent to no clinical cure) or CDI recurrence or death was undertaken across both studies. This differed from the mITT analysis by only (1) including all randomized patients, censoring those who never took a dose of trial medication at 0.5 days; (2) censoring patients who were last clinically assessed before 8 days following the start of treatment, providing that they were not known to have died subsequently before 40 days from randomization (in which case their failure time was the date of death); (3) censoring patients last seen < 33 days after the start of treatment, but cured at their posttreatment assessment as their last assessment (as the earliest posttreatment assessment occurred at 8 days and the FDA recommends that to be assessed as sustained response [global cure], patients should be followed up for 25 days posttreatment); and (4) considering patients who were last seen ≥ 33 days following treatment initiation, but were cured, as cured (ie, censored) on day 40.

RESULTS

Combined 003 and 004 Studies

A total of 1164 participants were enrolled in either study 003 or 004: there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the primary and secondary outcomes in either the mITT or per-protocol populations (P > .3, Figure 1). Overall results also demonstrated noninferiority of fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin for clinical cure and superiority of fidaxomicin over vancomycin for recurrence and global cure (P < .0001).

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^317a6cc1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for persistent diarrhea, recurrence, or death. Of note, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect 0–12 versus 13–40 days after randomization (P = 0.50), with a significant advantage evident for fidaxomicin versus vancomycin even through 0–12 days (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61 [95% CI,.39–.98]; P = 0.03), which was maintained over days 13–40 (HR, 0.51 [95% CI,.39–.67]; P < .0001). In contrast to the mITT and per-protocol analyses, the only patients who count as failures before 12 days in the ITT analysis are deaths occurring within 12 days of randomization, which occurred in 7 of 572 (1.2%) participants randomized to fidaxomicin versus 17 of 592 (2.9%) randomized to vancomycin (exact P = 0.06). The FDA requires that other participants not assessed posttreatment (early withdrawals) be treated as failures for licensing studies, even though this assumption is not necessarily conservative for the treatment effect. A total of 55 of 592 (9.3%) vs 54 of 572 (9.4%) participants in the fidaxomicin versus vancomycin groups were early withdrawals, respectively; stated reasons were adverse events (16 vs 16), withdrawal by subject (12 vs 14), and no reason stated (27 vs 24). In the ITT analysis, these events are assumed to be uninformative with respect to the outcome. This assumption is plausible given that (1) the median day of early withdrawal was 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 2–5) before treatment response would have been expected, (2) there is no evidence that blinding was compromised, and (3) these events occurred equally in both arms at a median of 3 (IQR, 2–6) and 3 (IQR, 2–5) days for fidaxomicin and vancomycin, respectively. However, as these early withdrawals are numerically greater than the number of early deaths, counting them as failures in the FDA analysis has the potential to obscure a possible, but important, additional benefit of fidaxomicin on early deaths.

### Fidaxomicin (dificid) for Clostridium difficile infection… [^0a9360e3]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Fidaxomicin is an oral macrolide antibiotic labeled for the treatment of Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea in adults. It primarily exhibits activity against species of clostridia, mainly C. difficile, while having no or limited activity against normal gastrointestinal flora. It joins the standard treatments of oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin. TOLERABILITY Fidaxomicin has an adverse effect profile comparable to that of oral vancomycin. In clinical trials of 564 patients, approximately 6 percent withdrew because of adverse effects. The most common adverse effects were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

1. EFFECTIVENESS Fidaxomicin has been compared exclusively with oral vancomycin in clinical trials for initial occurrences of. C. difficile–associated diarrhea.

In two studies enrolling a total of 1, 057 participants, fidaxomicin was as effective as vancomycin at producing clinical cure, which was defined as the resolution of diarrhea. 2, 3 Fidaxomicin decreases recurrence of C. difficile infection compared with vancomycin, although it is no more effective in patients who are infected with a hypervirulent strain of C. difficile that is more likely to cause complications and recurrence. SIMPLICITY Patients 18 years and older should be prescribed 200 mg of fidaxomicin twice daily for 10 days, to be taken with or without food. No dosage adjustments are necessary for older adults or for persons with renal impairment. No specific dosage recommendations exist for children or for patients who have hepatic impairment.

Bottom Line Fidaxomicin is effective for the treatment of C. difficile infection, but it is much more expensive than traditional therapy. Until it is known that the benefits outweigh the significant cost, metronidazole or oral vancomycin is the preferred treatment for most patients.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^9c740f7d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 2.
Persistent diarrhea, recurrence, or death. Study treatment was administered for 10 days and clinical cure was assessed at 12 days, at which time persistent diarrhea (> 3 stools/24 hours and toxin A and/or B positive or requiring anti– Clostridium difficile infection [CDI] treatment) was defined as clinical failure. The events occurring before day 12 are deaths and the step increase in events at day 12 represents cases assessed to have persistent diarrhea at the posttreatment assessment. Events from day 13 to day 40 represent CDI recurrence or deaths. Abbreviation: HR, hazard ratio.

To explore the difference among the 3 analyses, Figure 3 compares the ITT analysis with the mITT and per-protocol analyses of the combined studies using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Overall, fidaxomicin reduced persistent diarrhea, recurrence, or death by 40% (95% CI, 26%–51%; P < .0001) in the ITT analysis, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 7.9 (95% CI, 5.7–12.9) in favor of fidaxomicin and similar to effects on CDI recurrence in the mITT/per-protocol populations. However, in contrast, the ITT analysis estimated a 37% reduction in persistent diarrhea or death by day 12 (95% CI, 2%–60%; P = 0.037), whereas mITT/per-protocol analyses of clinical failure/cure (also assessed at day 12) suggested smaller benefits associated with fidaxomicin that did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.40 and P = 0.33, respectively).

### Safety analysis of fidaxomicin in comparison with oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infections [^e22da08a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

SAFETY PROFILE IN CLINICAL TRIALS

During the clinical development of fidaxomicin, 728 subjects received fidaxomicin: 116 healthy adult volunteers in phase 1 studies and 612 adults with CDI in phase 2A and 3 studies. In the phase 1 and 2A studies, subjects were exposed to doses of fidaxomicin ranging 100–450 mg. No significant dose-related adverse events (AEs) were observed.

The safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin were compared with oral vancomycin in 2 randomized, double-blinded pivotal phase 3 studies. One was performed in North America, and the other was performed in both North America and Europe. In both phase 3 studies, fidaxomicin was administered orally at 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days, and vancomycin was administered orally at 125 mg every 6 hours for 10 days (the currently recommended dose for nonfulminant disease). In these studies, 564 subjects with CDI were treated with fidaxomicin and 583 were treated with vancomycin, respectively. Overall, 86.7% of subjects completed a full course of treatment.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^211bc80d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In the recently reported trials (studies 003 and 004) using FDA-recommended mITT and per-protocol populations, fidaxomicin was shown to be noninferior to vancomycin for clinical cure, the primary prespecified endpoint. It was also shown to be superior to vancomycin for the 2 secondary endpoints, recurrence and global cure.

The antimicrobial properties of fidaxomicin have been shown to have several advantages over vancomycin in a range of settings. Fidaxomicin is bactericidal and exhibits substantially higher inhibitory activity, has a more prolonged postantibiotic effect, and is narrower in spectrum both in vitro and in vivo than vancomycin, which is bacteriostatic. This advantageous activity extended to the BI/NAP1/PCR ribotype 027 strains in vitro. The lack of advantage of fidaxomicin observed in the mITT and per-protocol analyses of clinical cure was therefore disappointing. To further explore the relative benefits of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, we conducted a post hoc exploratory time-to-event analysis, following the ITT analysis strategy used most commonly in nonlicensing trials.

This ITT analysis showed an overall 40% (95% CI, 26%–51%; P < .0001) reduction in persistent diarrhea, recurrence, or death during the 40-day follow-up. Interestingly, the ITT analysis through day 12 also showed a 37% (95% CI, 24%–60%; P = 0.037) reduction in persistent diarrhea or death, which differed from the mITT or per-protocol analyses that suggested smaller nonsignificant early benefits of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin. Furthermore, there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the beneficial effects of fidaxomicin prior to or after day 12 in the ITT analysis, supporting a consistent advantage for fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin treatment both early and late. Even though this beneficial effect is biologically plausible given the in vitro microbiological properties of fidaxomicin, the results from this post hoc exploratory analysis will need to be separately confirmed in further studies.

### Treatment of first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection: fidaxomicin versus vancomycin [^9c3f9dfe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A vexing issue is whether recurrence of CDI is caused by relapse with the original strain or reinfection with a new strain from the environment. In this randomized, blinded trial, we found that treatment of an initial recurrence with fidaxomicin was associated with fewer second recurrences than treatment with vancomycin. In addition, mean time to second recurrence was significantly longer in the fidaxomicin treatment group. Only 38% (5 of 13) of recurrences occurred within 14 days of completing fidaxomicin therapy, whereas 77% (17 of 22) of recurrences in the vancomycin group occurred by day 14. Because both drugs may remain in the large bowel for several days, it is postulated that the early reduction in recurrence represents prevention of relapse from germination of the resident C. difficile spores, and within this time frame, fidaxomicin was clearly more effective than vancomycin. However, CDI recurrence after 14 days, when both antibiotics have been cleared from the gut, more likely represents new infection from environmental sources, and the rates of recurrence after 14 days were similar for both drugs (13% of fidaxomicin-treated patients and 11% of vancomycin-treated patients without recurrence by day 14 of follow-up).

### Safety analysis of fidaxomicin in comparison with oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infections [^796220fc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The arrival of fidaxomicin represents a major addition to the CDI treatment armamentarium, a novel agent with a safety profile comparable with vancomycin in clinical trials. As with all new drug introductions and in particular with novel drugs, careful and continuous surveillance and monitoring in the postmarketing setting will augment the present premarketing safety experience and contribute to further understanding of the safety of fidaxomicin during routine clinical use.

Nonsevere Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode management includes the following and supporting evidence: "We recommend that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days be used to treat an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence)". "We recommend that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days be used for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". "Oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days may be considered for treatment of an initial nonsevere CDI in low-risk patients (strong recommendation/moderate quality of evidence)". In comparative trials, fidaxomicin showed similar clinical cure but lower recurrence than vancomycin: "cure rates with fidaxomicin (82.1%) were similar to vancomycin (88.6%). The rate of recurrence within 30 days, however, was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (13.0% vs 26.6%, P = 0.02)", and a second RCT found "no significant difference in clinical cure (76.2% vs 70.5%, P = 0.473), but lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin (8.3% vs 32.6%, P < 0.05)". A Veteran Administration analysis found "no statistically significant difference in the combined outcome of clinical failure or recurrence between 213 fidaxomicin treatment courses (31.9%) and 639 vancomycin treatment courses (25.5%)", with mortality "30-day (10.8% vs 11.7%), 90-day (22.5% vs 21.9%), and 180-day mortality rates (29.1% vs 29.1%)" similar. A Cochrane review concluded that "moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin", while noting "The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost". For follow-on therapy, rifaximin trials used "400 mg t.i.d. for 20 days" with recurrence "decreased from 31% to 15%", and another trial used "400 mg t.i.d. for 14 days and then 200 mg t.i.d. for an additional 14 days" with recurrence "from 30% to 16% (P = 0.06)", but concerns include "30%–50% resistance rates", and the authors "do not currently recommend its routine use".

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — in a pooled analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adding bezlotoxumab to standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics reduced CDI recurrence after initial clinical cure at 12 weeks (RR: 62; 95% CI: .51–.75) and reduced CDI-associated hospital readmission at 30 days (RR: 46; 95% CI: .29–.71), but failed to show a reduction in mortality (RR: 94; 95% CI: .66–1.34), with certainty ratings as reported; the certainty in the evidence for benefits was initially rated as moderate mainly due to indirectness when fidaxomicin is the SOC antibiotic. The 2 phase III trials enrolled patients between November 2011 and May 2015, during which the 2010 IDSA-SHEA guideline suggested metronidazole for mild–moderate CDI and oral vancomycin for more severe disease, and most trial patients received metronidazole (47%) or oral vancomycin (48%); SOC antibiotics now include vancomycin and fidaxomicin in the updated 2017 IDSA-SHEA guideline. Despite planned subanalyses indicating the choice of SOC antibiotics did not influence clinical outcomes, uncertainty remains about generalizability when fidaxomicin is the SOC antibiotic because it was used in < 5% of the cohort (n = 60 patients); one study reanalyzed the modified intent-to-treat population (n = 1554).

### Cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for Clostridioides difficile infection: an evaluation of the 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines [^eee3b35f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2018, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI). However, there is little guidance regarding which treatments are cost-effective.

Methods

We used a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with an initial CDI diagnosis. We used the model to estimate the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the recently published 2018 IDSA guidelines. The model includes stratification by the severity of the initial infection, and subsequent likelihood of cure, recurrence, mortality, and outcomes of subsequent recurrences. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

Results

Use of fidaxomicin for nonsevere initial CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for subsequent recurrence (strategy 44) cost an additional $478 for 0.009 QALYs gained per CDI patient, resulting in an ICER of $31 751 per QALY, below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. This is the optimal, cost-effective CDI treatment strategy.

Conclusions

Metronidazole is suboptimal for nonsevere CDI as it is less beneficial than alternative strategies. The preferred treatment regimen is fidaxomicin for nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and FMT for subsequent recurrence. The most effective treatments, with highest cure rates, are also cost-effective due to averted mortality, utility loss, and costs of rehospitalization and/or further treatments for recurrent CDI.

### Safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin and vancomycin in children and adolescents with Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection: a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, single-blind clinical trial (SUNSHINE) [^3116d756]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Fidaxomicin, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic approved for Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) in adults, is associated with lower rates of recurrence than vancomycin; however, pediatric data are limited. This multicenter, investigator-blind, phase 3, parallel-group trial assessed the safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in children.

Methods

Patients aged < 18 years with confirmed CDI were randomized 2:1 to 10 days of treatment with fidaxomicin (suspension or tablets, twice daily) or vancomycin (suspension or tablets, 4 times daily). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events. The primary efficacy end point was confirmed clinical response (CCR), 2 days after the end of treatment (EOT). Secondary end points included global cure (GC; CCR without CDI recurrence) 30 days after EOT (end of study; EOS). Plasma and stool concentrations of fidaxomicin and its active metabolite OP-1118 were measured.

Results

Of 148 patients randomized, 142 were treated (30 < 2 years old). The proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events was similar with fidaxomicin (73.5%) and vancomycin (75.0%). Of 3 deaths in the fidaxomicin arm during the study, none were CDI or treatment related. The rate of CCR at 2 days after EOT was 77.6% (76 of 98 patients) with fidaxomicin and 70.5% (31 of 44) with vancomycin, whereas the rate of GC at EOS was significantly higher in participants receiving fidaxomicin (68.4% vs 50.0%; adjusted treatment difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.5%–35.3%). Systemic absorption of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 was minimal, and stool concentrations were high.

Conclusions

Compared with vancomycin, fidaxomicin was well tolerated and demonstrated significantly higher rates of GC in children and adolescents with CDI.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^99e21f92]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — management of CDI recurrence and prevention specify that we suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy, particularly when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). For a first recurrence, we suggest tapering/pulsed dosing of vancomycin be considered after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and we recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy or capsules for treatment of recurrent CDI; we suggest delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 wk of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with rCDI who are not candidates for FMT, who relapse after FMT, or who require ongoing or frequent courses of antibiotics, suppressive oral vancomycin may be used to prevent further recurrences (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Oral vancomycin prophylaxis may be considered during subsequent systemic antibiotic use in patients with a history of CDI who are at high risk of recurrence to prevent further recurrence (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest bezlotoxumab be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest against discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in patients with CDI, provided there is an appropriate indication for their use (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Fidaxomicin versus oral vancomycin forinfection among patients at high risk for recurrence based on real-world experience [^21fabb26]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common nosocomial infection and is associated with a high healthcare burden due to high rates of recurrence. In 2021 the IDSA/SHEA guideline update recommended fidaxomicin (FDX) as first-line therapy. Our medical center updated our institutional guidelines to follow these recommendations, prioritizing FDX use among patients at high risk for recurrent CDI (rCDI).

Methods

This pre- post- quasi-experimental study included patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CDI at risk for recurrence (age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised, severe CDI) that received vancomycin (VAN) or FDX between October 2019 to October 2022. Patients who received bezlotoxumab, had fulminant CDI, or received < 10 days of the same antibiotic for their full treatment course were excluded. Patients were evaluated for rCDI within 8 weeks of completion of therapy, subsequent episodes of CDI within 12 months, and CDI-related admissions within 30 days.

Results

Of 397 CDI regimens evaluated, 196 received VAN and 201 received FDX. Rates of rCDI (9.2% vs 10%, P = 0.86), subsequent CDI within 12 months of therapy completion of therapy (19.4% vs 26%, P = 0.12) and 30-day CDI-related readmissions (3% vs 4.5%, P = 0.6) were similar between patients who received VAN versus FDX.

Conclusion

Outcomes were similar between patients treated with FDX and VAN for the treatment of CDI among those at high risk for rCDI, using our outlined criteria. Although we observed a trend toward lower rates of rCDI among immunocompromised patients, this finding was not significant. Further investigation is needed to determine which patients with CDI may benefit from FDX.

### Making sense of differing guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infection [^9a10c8a5]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) epidemic has been impacting the world for years. Understanding accurate diagnostics is imperative to allow the appropriate patients to be treated and improve outcomes. This article leverages multiple global societal guidelines to focus on the evolving diagnostic tests available summarizing best diagnostic practices including 2-step diagnostic testing. Therapeutically, guideline recommendations more recently have favored fidaxomicin and incorporated immune-based therapies and microbial restoration therapies. As treatment options and guideline recommendations change, it is imperative to understand why these recommendations have evolved and understand current best diagnostic and therapeutic practices in managing CDI.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: update of the treatment guidance document for Clostridium difficile infection [^6410954c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

In 2009 the first European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection (ESCMID) treatment guidance document for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was published. The guideline has been applied widely in clinical practice. In this document an update and review on the comparative effectiveness of the currently available treatment modalities of CDI is given, thereby providing evidence-based recommendations on this issue. A computerized literature search was carried out to investigate randomized and non-randomized trials investigating the effect of an intervention on the clinical outcome of CDI. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The ESCMID and an international team of experts from 11 European countries supported the process. To improve clinical guidance in the treatment of CDI, recommendations are specified for various patient groups, e.g. initial non-severe disease, severe CDI, first recurrence or risk for recurrent disease, multiple recurrences and treatment of CDI when oral administration is not possible. Treatment options that are reviewed include: antibiotics, toxin-binding resins and polymers, immunotherapy, probiotics, and faecal or bacterial intestinal transplantation. Except for very mild CDI that is clearly induced by antibiotic usage antibiotic treatment is advised. The main antibiotics that are recommended are metronidazole, vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Faecal transplantation is strongly recommended for multiple recurrent CDI. In case of perforation of the colon and/or systemic inflammation and deteriorating clinical condition despite antibiotic therapy, total abdominal colectomy or diverting loop ileostomy combined with colonic lavage is recommended.

### Partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin and the effect on recurrence ofInfections [^500b8fb0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) causes a significant national health care burden. Literature has demonstrated lower rates of CDI recurrence with fidaxomicin compared with oral vancomycin. However, patients are sometimes switched to oral vancomycin before completing a fidaxomicin course.

Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate rates of CDI recurrence in full courses of fidaxomicin versus partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by a switch to oral vancomycin.

Methods

In this single-center, retrospective, cohort study of adults with CDI, patients were screened for inclusion if they received either a full 10-day course of fidaxomicin or partial course of fidaxomicin followed by a switch to oral vancomycin. The primary outcome was the rate of CDI recurrence within 30 days after completion of initial therapy determined by a positive CDI test and initiation of treatment.

Results

Ninety-nine patients received a full course of fidaxomicin, and 95 patients received a partial course of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin. Mean age was lower in the full course group compared with the partial course (65.3 years vs 71.5 years, P < 0.002). Clostridioides difficile infection recurrence occurred in 5.1% of the full course group and 7.4% of the partial therapy group (P = 0.503) at 30 days and 13.1% versus 14.7% (P = 0.747) at 90 days. Clostridioides difficile infection-related readmissions at 30 days were similar in the full course and partial course groups (7.1% vs 4.2%, P = 0.389).

Conclusion and Relevance

Partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin had similar 30-day CDI recurrence compared with full course fidaxomicin.

### Fidaxomicin versus oral vancomycin forinfection among patients at high risk for recurrence based on real-world experience [^de930b02]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common nosocomial infection and is associated with a high healthcare burden due to high rates of recurrence. In 2021 the IDSA/SHEA guideline update recommended fidaxomicin (FDX) as first-line therapy. Our medical center updated our institutional guidelines to follow these recommendations, prioritizing FDX use among patients at high risk for recurrent CDI (rCDI).

Methods:

This pre- post- quasi-experimental study included patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CDI at risk for recurrence (age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised, severe CDI) that received vancomycin (VAN) or FDX between October 2019 to October 2022. Patients who received bezlotoxumab, had fulminant CDI, or received < 10 days of the same antibiotic for their full treatment course were excluded. Patients were evaluated for rCDI within 8 weeks of completion of therapy, subsequent episodes of CDI within 12 months, and CDI-related admissions within 30 days.

Results:

Of 397 CDI regimens evaluated, 196 received VAN and 201 received FDX. Rates of rCDI (9.2% vs 10%, P = 0.86), subsequent CDI within 12 months of therapy completion of therapy (19.4% vs 26%, P = 0.12) and 30-day CDI-related readmissions (3% vs 4.5%, P = 0.6) were similar between patients who received VAN versus FDX.

Conclusion:

Outcomes were similar between patients treated with FDX and VAN for the treatment of CDI among those at high risk for rCDI, using our outlined criteria. Although we observed a trend toward lower rates of rCDI among immunocompromised patients, this finding was not significant. Further investigation is needed to determine which patients with CDI may benefit from FDX.

17) Fidaxomicin may be used to treat CDI, especially in the patients at higher risk for recurrence (e.g. elderly patients with severe underlying disease or those requiring receiving concomitant antibiotics) (Recommendation 1 A).

Fidaxomicin orally 200 mg twice daily for 10 days may be an alternative to vancomycin in some patients with CDI.

Fidaxomicin was non-inferior to vancomycin for initial cure of CDI in two prospective trials. In a first double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority trial 629 adults with acute symptoms of C. difficile infection and a positive result on a stool toxin test were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) or vancomycin (125 mg four times daily) orally for 10 days. The rates of clinical cure with fidaxomicin were non-inferior to those with vancomycin in both the modified intention-to-treat analysis (88.2% with fidaxomicin and 85.8% with vancomycin) and the per-protocol analysis (92.1% and 89.8%, respectively). Significantly fewer patients in the fidaxomicin group than in the vancomycin group had a recurrence of the infection, in both the modified intention-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis. In a second multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority trial 535 patients, 16 years or older with acute, toxin-positive C difficile infection were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive oral fidaxomicin (200 mg every 12 h) or oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 h) for 10 days. Non-inferiority was shown for both the modified intention-to-treat analysis (15.4% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.005) and the per-protocol analysis (13.3% vs. 24.0%, P = 0.004). Patients receiving concomitant antibiotics for other infections had a higher cure rate with fidaxomicin (46 [90 · 2%] of 51) than with vancomycin (33 [73 · 3%] of 45; p = 0 · 031). Fidaxomicin may be useful for treating patients who are considered at high risk for recurrence (elderly patients with multiple comorbidities who are receiving concomitant antibiotics). However, it is important to note that there are no data available on the efficacy of Fidaxomicin in severe life-threatening disease.

### Efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin as therapy for Clostridium difficile infection in individuals taking concomitant antibiotics for other concurrent infections [^45ec7804]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Guidelines recommend discontinuation of CA therapy in individuals with CDI (AII recommendation), but individuals frequently require antibiotic treatment during CDI therapy to manage concurrent systemic infections. In this study, 28% of subjects were treated with antibiotics for other infections at the same time as CDI treatment or during 4 weeks of follow-up. Because subjects with immediately life-threatening CDI were excluded from the study, this is likely an underestimate of antibiotic use by all subjects treated for CDI. In this study population, receipt of any antibiotic concurrently with treatment (either fidaxomicin or vancomycin) reduced the cure rate from 92.6% to 84.4% (P < .001) and prolonged the median time to resolution by 43 hours.

Receipt of CA concurrent with vancomycin reduced the cure rate from 92.8% overall to 79.4% (13.4% difference; P = 0.04), but the response to fidaxomicin treatment was relatively unaffected by CA use (92.3% overall and 90.0% in the presence of CA). We observed that treatment with antibiotics associated with a high risk of developing CDI de novo had further negative effects on response to therapy; however, the impact was blunted by fidaxomicin but not by vancomycin.

Table 4.
Comparison of Fidaxomicin and Vancomycin Treatment in the Absence or Presence of Concomitant Antibiotics (CAs)

CA use increased recurrence rates for both the fidaxomicin and vancomycin treatment groups, but recurrence was consistently less frequent following fidaxomicin treatment whether subjects received CAs or not (Table 4). Differences reached significance (P < .001) for subjects receiving no CA during treatment, follow-up, or at any time during the study, and recurrence was approximately doubled for all comparisons of vancomycin with fidaxomicin. For example, if subjects were cured with fidaxomicin and received no CAs during the follow-up period, 11.5% experienced recurrence of CDI whereas 23.9% of subjects cured with vancomycin had recurrences (difference, −12.4% [95% CI, −18.0% to −6.57%]; P < .001). Likewise, for subjects who received CAs during follow-up after fidaxomicin cure, 21.3% had a recurrence of CDI, compared with 27.9% of vancomycin-cured subjects (P = 0.38). When all subjects taking CAs at any time from the first dose of study drug to the end-of-study follow-up visit were compared by treatment group, fidaxomicin had a 12.3% advantage over vancomycin (16.9% vs 29.2%), and the difference was significant (95% CI, −23.9% to −0.12%; P = 0.048). In subjects receiving high-risk antibiotics, recurrence tended to be less frequent (by ≥ 5%) following fidaxomicin than vancomycin treatment, but none of the differences was significant.

Initial episode — conclusion and research needs: The panel suggests the use of fidaxomicin as the preferred therapy for an initial CDI episode to improve sustained response after therapy but recognizes that vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative if fidaxomicin is not available, and calls for additional independent cost-effectiveness studies because cost is a substantial barrier, comparative trials of extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus standard fidaxomicin and extended-dosing vancomycin, and study of the efficacy of fidaxomicin for fulminant CDI.

An ad hoc subgroup analysis separating patients with 1 prior CDI recurrence versus 2 or more found a sustained response at 30 days following end of therapy of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.01–1.49) for 1 prior recurrence and 2.0 (95% CI: .88–4.54) for 2 or more prior recurrences, with the latter based on data from 1 study judged at high risk of bias and a very small number randomized (n = 20).

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^39acd8de]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) first recurrence — treatment recommendations and comparative efficacy are as follows: We suggest tapering/pulsed-dose vancomycin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). rCDI is generally defined as the recurrence of diarrhea and a confirmatory positive test (NAAT or EIA) within 8 weeks after treatment of an initial episode of CDI. In subgroup analyses of two phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin was superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin, P = 0.045). In older adults, extended‑pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days post‑treatment in 124 (70%) of 177 vs 106 (59%) of 179 with vancomycin (P = 0.030). Vancomycin cleared C. difficile by end of therapy more often than metronidazole (89% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.001). Based on efficacy and safety concerns, metronidazole should not be used to treat rCDI and metronidazole treatment should be limited to 1 course because of risk of neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated use.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^dbafa963]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

### Fidaxomicin for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections [^57e4e756]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the pharmacology, microbiology, safety, and efficacy of fidaxomicin for treatment of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI).

Data Sources

Literature was identified through Ovid MEDLINE (1948-December 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-December 2011) using the search terms fidaxomicin, OPT-80, PAR-101, OP-118, difimicin, tiacumicin, lipiarmycin, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium difficile infection, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and cost. Drug monographs were retrieved from manufacturers' Web pages, and the Red Book component of Micromedex was used for cost information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All pertinent Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies published in English were included.

Data Synthesis

Fidaxomicin is a macrocyclic compound bactericidal against C. difficile and inhibits toxin and spore production. It has poor oral absorption with high fecal concentrations. Available Phase 2 and 3 data with fidaxomicin 200 mg orally every 12 hours demonstrate similar effectiveness in treating CDI compared to oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin was shown to have less frequency of recurrent infections. Adverse effects are uncommon and occur at similar rates as with oral vancomycin. The most frequently reported adverse effects are gastrointestinal, hematologic, and electrolyte disorders. Available data are lacking in several areas, including the efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin compared to established regimens for mild-to-moderate, life-threatening, and recurrent CDIs. The cost of a 10-day course of fidaxomicin is significantly more than that of metronidazole and vancomycin for treatment of mild-to-moderate CDI.

Conclusions

Fidaxomicin appears to be an effective and safe alternative to oral vancomycin for treatment of mild-to-moderate and severe CDI. Data on its use compared to guideline-recommended therapies for mild-to-moderate and life-threatening CDI are needed. Further data assessing the cost-effectiveness of fidaxomicin are needed. Currently, it cannot be recommended over vancomycin for treatment of CDI. However, it may be considered for treatment of recurrent infections.

### A cost-utility analysis of two Clostridioides difficile infection guideline treatment pathways [^d8ea4e93]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Treatment guidelines are key drivers of prescribing practice in the management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but recommendations on best practice can vary. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to compare the treatment pathway recommended by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guideline with the pathway proposed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.

Methods

A decision tree modelling approach was adopted to reflect the treatment pathway for CDI as outlined in ESCMID and NICE guidelines. Patients experiencing a CDI infection received up to three treatments per infection to achieve a response and could subsequently experience up to two recurrences. Data on patient demographics, treatment response, recurrence, utilities, CDI-related mortality, and costs were taken from published literature.

Results

The ESCMID treatment pathway was cost-effective versus the NICE treatment pathway at a threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £4931. Cost-effectiveness was driven by differences in index infection recommendations (ESCMID recommends fidaxomicin as first-line treatment whereas NICE recommends vancomycin). The model results were robust to variations in inputs investigated in scenarios and sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ESCMID guideline treatment strategy had a 100% likelihood of being cost-effective versus the NICE treatment strategy.

Discussion

Compared with the NICE guideline, the ESCMID guideline recommendations for treating an index CDI represent the most cost-effective use of healthcare resources from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.

Management

The management of CDI is determined by the number and severity of episodes. Children who do not respond to targeted treatment within 5 days should be re-evaluated for other causes. There is currently insufficient evidence to support probiotics as an alternative to antimicrobial therapy for CDI treatment.

First Episode

For symptomatic children, initial management should include discontinuation of the inciting antibiotic, when possible, to limit further intestinal microbial disruption. Current antimicrobial therapies targeted against the initial CDI episode of mild or moderate severity include oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin (Table 2). Metronidazole, which has been a mainstay treatment of pediatric CDI, was removed as a recommended first line choice for adults in the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are now recommended as preferred first line therapies in adults based on improved clinical cure rates and lower recurrence risk.– High quality data to support treatment guideline recommendation in children were lacking at the time, however postguideline shifts in prescribing practice with decreased use of metronidazole and increased use of oral vancomycin in children with CDI have been observed.

TABLE 2
Summary of Therapies for Children With Clostridioides difficile Infection^

A retrospective, comparative effectiveness study of 192 children hospitalized with nonsevere CDI has since shown that those treated with vancomycin had earlier resolution of symptoms (86.3%) compared with those treated with metronidazole (71.1%) by day 5, whereas recurrence was similar. The recent landmark SUNSHINE study represents the first clinical trial conducted in children with CDI. In this phase 3 trial, 142 children with CDI were age-stratified and randomized to receive either oral fidaxomicin or vancomycin for 10 days. Children had to have negative rotavirus testing results to be eligible, and children with inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. No difference in clinical response at the end of therapy was shown, however at 30 days after therapy, the rate of sustained response was higher with fidaxomcin (68%) compared with vancomycin (50%), with an adjusted treatment difference of 18.8% (95% confidence interval 1.5%–35.3%). Children under 2 years of age were included, so it is unclear if other etiologies contributed to diarrhea in younger participants. Regardless, based on these positive results, in 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded approval of fidaxomicin for treatment of CDI to include children 6 months of age and older. These 2 studies open up new therapeutic options in children.

(.)

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) is caused by an anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium, and is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in developed countries. Although CDI is classically considered a hospital-acquired, antibiotic-associated infection, the incidence of community-acquired CDI is also on the rise. Furthermore, the incidence of pediatric CDI seems to be increasing, most notably among patients with comorbid conditions, such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. The severity of CDI is variable, ranging from asymptomatic colonization or self-limiting diarrhea to fulminant colitis. In hospitalized children, CDI has been associated with increased length of stay and increased risk of mortality. However, because asymptomatic colonization with toxigenic C. difficile is common in children aged < 2 years, the clinical significance of this organism as a cause of diarrhea in young infants is uncertain.

The Infectious Disease Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines for the treatment of CDI in children recommend vancomycin or metronidazole for an initial nonsevere episode or first recurrence, and vancomycin (with or without metronidazole) for an initial severe episode. However, although these antibiotics are successful in approximately 80%–90% of initial episodes, up to 40% of children with CDI experience a recurrence of infection within 60 days. Risk factors for recurrence in children include cancer and chronic comorbid conditions; in adults, recurrence is associated with advanced age and the use of non-CDI antibiotics during or after CDI treatment, among other factors. Consequently, efforts have been directed toward the development of new antibiotics that reduce the risk of CDI recurrence.

The macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxomicin was approved in the United States and in the European Union in 2011 for the treatment of CDI in patients aged ≥ 18 years. Two phase 3 registration trials in adults have shown that fidaxomicin is noninferior to vancomycin for initial clinical cure of CDI and is associated with a significant 10%–15% reduction in the risk of recurrence at 28 days after the end of treatment (EOT). However, patients aged < 16 years were excluded from both studies, and the safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in children aged < 18 years has not been established. This is reflected in the Infectious Disease Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines, which note that insufficient safety and efficacy data are available to recommend the use of fidaxomicin in children with CDI, although occasional off-label use has been reported.

### Treatment of first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection: fidaxomicin versus vancomycin [^e8bb0efe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patients

The mITT study population consisted of 178 enrolled patients who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of fidaxomicin (88 patients) or vancomycin (90 patients) (Figure 1). There were 79 and 83 patients, respectively, in the per-protocol analysis of cure. Patients who were cured (74 fidaxomicin-treated and 76 vancomycin-treated patients) were monitored for recurrence. Eight patients in the fidaxomicin treatment arm and 14 patients in the vancomycin treatment arm were excluded from the per-protocol analysis of recurrence owing to insufficient follow-up, receipt of other therapy for CDI, or other protocol violations. There were 128 patients in the per-protocol analysis of recurrence, 66 treated with fidaxomicin and 62 treated with vancomycin. Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics of the per-protocol population. Despite variability between groups because of the relatively small sample size, the difference was not significant for any treatment group comparison of baseline characteristics (P > .05).

### Partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin and the effect on recurrence ofInfections [^6dd1e70d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) causes a significant national health care burden. Literature has demonstrated lower rates of CDI recurrence with fidaxomicin compared with oral vancomycin. However, patients are sometimes switched to oral vancomycin before completing a fidaxomicin course.

Objective:

The objective of this study is to evaluate rates of CDI recurrence in full courses of fidaxomicin versus partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by a switch to oral vancomycin.

Methods:

In this single-center, retrospective, cohort study of adults with CDI, patients were screened for inclusion if they received either a full 10-day course of fidaxomicin or partial course of fidaxomicin followed by a switch to oral vancomycin. The primary outcome was the rate of CDI recurrence within 30 days after completion of initial therapy determined by a positive CDI test and initiation of treatment.

Results:

Ninety-nine patients received a full course of fidaxomicin, and 95 patients received a partial course of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin. Mean age was lower in the full course group compared with the partial course (65.3 years vs 71.5 years, P < 0.002). Clostridioides difficile infection recurrence occurred in 5.1% of the full course group and 7.4% of the partial therapy group (P = 0.503) at 30 days and 13.1% versus 14.7% (P = 0.747) at 90 days. Clostridioides difficile infection–related readmissions at 30 days were similar in the full course and partial course groups (7.1% vs 4.2%, P = 0.389).

Conclusion and Relevance:

Partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin had similar 30-day CDI recurrence compared with full course fidaxomicin.

IDSA/SHEA 2017 pediatric CDI — initial episode of severe disease: For children with an initial episode of severe CDI, oral vancomycin is recommended over metronidazole (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and clinicians should use vancomycin in children who present with severe or fulminant CDI. Supporting context notes that observational studies of hospitalized children suggest the rate of treatment failure may be greater in severe versus nonsevere disease and that evidence from adult RCTs has demonstrated improved outcomes with oral vancomycin compared with oral metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is not recommended for routine use in children hospitalized with severe CDI, although a survey reported it had been used or recommended by 12% of respondents, and neither vancomycin nor fidaxomicin is significantly absorbed when orally administered, with few systemic adverse events.

### Impact of revised Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections in the United States [^93a07f7e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Our objective was to determine if oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and oral metronidazole use in the United States changed after publication of revised clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in February 2018.

Methods

We obtained US antibiotic prescription data (IQVIA) from 2006-August 2019 and used guideline-recommended dosing regimens to estimate monthly numbers of 10-day treatment courses of vancomycin, fidaxomicin and metronidazole. Interrupted time-series analyses were performed, adjusted by month. We compared linear trends for monthly numbers of treatment courses in different time periods.

Results

Cumulative treatment courses of oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin increased by 54% (n = 226 166) and 48% (n = 18 518), respectively, in 18 months following guidelines compared with 18 months before; those of oral metronidazole decreased by 3% (n = 238 372). Monthly vancomycin and fidaxomicin use significantly increased throughout the period following revised guidelines (P < .0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively), whereas that of metronidazole decreased significantly (P < .0001). Monthly vancomycin use increased and metronidazole use decreased to a significantly greater extent after publication of revised guidelines than after publication of clinical trials establishing superiority of vancomycin over metronidazole (P < .0001).

Conclusions

Revised practice guidelines have had a significant impact on CDI treatment in the US. Clinical trial data used for the revised guidelines were available since 2007–2014 and 2011–2012 for oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, respectively. Guidelines or guidance documents for treating CDI and other infections should be updated in more timely fashion.

### Safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^a48ae2c0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is the most common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea. The current recommended treatment regimens of metronidazole and vancomycin have not changed in nearly 25 years. Fidaxomicin, an exceedingly narrow spectrum macrolide antibiotic, was recently approved for the treatment of CDAD. In phase III clinical trials, fidaxomicin was noninferior to vancomycin in achieving clinical cure of CDAD. Furthermore, fidaxomicin was associated with fewer recurrences of CDAD compared with vancomycin in clinical trials. These results, combined with the ease of administration and a good safety profile, make fidaxomicin an attractive treatment option for treating CDAD.

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^210ffc86]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with emphasis on preventing recurrent infection. This review compares current guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### Efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin as therapy for Clostridium difficile infection in individuals taking concomitant antibiotics for other concurrent infections [^fb7595be]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The effect of CAs used during the treatment phase (days 1–10) was analyzed for the outcomes of clinical cure and time to resolution of diarrhea (TTROD), and CA use at any time during treatment and/or follow-up (days 1–40) was analyzed for global cure. Analysis of recurrence was performed separately for CA use during the treatment period (days 1–10), during follow-up (days 11–40), and at any time (days 1–40). On an individual subject basis, treatment and follow-up periods were defined by the dates of the first and last dose of study drug and the follow-up visit.

Response rates were determined for clinical cure, recurrence, and global cure, and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed around point estimates. To compare subgroups of subjects determined by CA exposure and CDI treatment, 2-sided CIs were constructed around the differences, and a χ² test determined the significance of differences in proportions. TTROD was compared by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis using log rank and Wilcoxon tests for determination of significance. A P value of < .05 was considered to reveal a significant difference.

Results are presented for the per protocol population. Results for the intent-to-treat population were similar for all outcomes.

In critically ill patients, although only 36 patients in this series had a diagnosis of severe or fulminant CDI, one-third of them experienced treatment failure, and a more recent retrospective chart review that compared 213 fidaxomicin and 639 oral vancomycin courses showed no statistically significant difference for the primary outcome of combined clinical failure or recurrence (68/213 [31.9%] vs 169/639 [25.5%], respectively, P = 0.071).

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

DIFICID is a macrolide antibacterial indicated in adult and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older for the treatment of C. difficile -associated diarrhea. (1.1)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of DIFICID and other antibacterial drugs, DIFICID should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by C. difficile. (1.2)

1.1 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea

DIFICID®is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 6 months and older for the treatment of C. difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD).

1.2 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of DIFICID and other antibacterial drugs, DIFICID should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by C. difficile. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Common questions about Clostridium difficile infection [^1fb4c2b0]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It causes no symptoms in more than one-half of infected patients, but can also cause a wide spectrum of illnesses and death. The incidence and severity have increased in recent years. The most important modifiable risk factor for C. difficile infection is antibiotic exposure; this risk is dose-related and higher with longer courses and combination therapy. C. difficile infection is also associated with older age, recent hospitalization, multiple comorbidities, use of gastric acid blockers, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunosuppression. It has become more common in younger, healthier patients in community settings. The most practical testing options are rapid testing with nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays to detect toxin, or a two-step strategy. Treatment includes discontinuing the contributing antibiotic, if possible. Mild C. difficile infection should be treated with oral metronidazole; severe infection should be treated with oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin may be an effective alternative. Recurrences of the infection should be treated based on severity. Tapering and the pulsed-dose method of oral vancomycin therapy for second recurrences are effective. Prevention includes responsible antibiotic prescribing and vigilant handwashing. Probiotics prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but are not recommended specifically for preventing C. difficile infection.

### Safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin and vancomycin in children and adolescents with Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection: a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, single-blind clinical trial (SUNSHINE) [^9d36e662]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Treatment differences between fidaxomicin and vancomycin for rates of confirmed clinical response, recurrence, and global cure (full analysis set). a Adjusted treatment difference (calculated using age-stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, for which 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated using a Newcombe method). b Unadjusted treatment differences (with exact 95% CIs calculated using a binomial distribution). c Adjusted difference not estimable. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; EOS, end of study; EOT, end of treatment.

Of patients in whom CCR was achieved, CDI recurrence before EOS occurred in 11.8% (9 of 76) in the fidaxomicin and 29.0% (9 of 31) in the vancomycin arm (adjusted treatment difference, −15.8%; 95% CI, −34.5% to.5%) (Figure 3). As shown in Supplementary Figure 3, the cumulative incidence of recurrence was significantly higher in participants who received vancomycin compared with fidaxomicin (log-rank P = 0.02). The overall rate of GC at EOS was statistically significantly higher in participants treated with fidaxomicin (68.4% [67 of 98]) versus vancomycin (50.0% [22 of 44]) (adjusted treatment difference, 18.8%; 95% CI, 1.5%–35.3%) (Figure 3).

Subgroup analyses for participants aged ≥ 2 years showed increased treatment differences in favor of fidaxomicin for CCR at 2 days after EOT, recurrence, and GC (Figure 3). Among immunocompromised patients, the rates of CCR 2 days after EOT were similar with fidaxomicin and vancomycin, and although the rate of GC seemed higher with fidaxomicin, the difference was smaller than in the overall population and was not statistically significant (Figure 3).

Clostridioides difficile infection (initial episode) — cost-effectiveness and implementation: Using a "willingness to pay" threshold of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), fidaxomicin showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from €26 000 (~US dollars [USD] 32 000) to €44 500 (~USD 52 000) per QALY gained versus vancomycin, and a comparative trial reported similar total treatment costs of $14 442 for fidaxomicin and $14 179 for vancomycin; the panel agrees that the cost-effectiveness analysis probably favors fidaxomicin over vancomycin for an initial CDI episode but notes that "its cost may be prohibitive" without adequate insurance coverage, with an average wholesale price of $4871 per 20-tablet package and patient-assistance mechanisms available.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is a focused update on management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in adults specifically addressing the use of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab for the treatment of CDI. This guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA). This guideline is intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for adults with CDI, including specialists in infectious diseases, gastroenterologists, hospitalists, pharmacists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for these patients. The panel's recommendations for the management CDI are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews. Summarized below are the recommendations for the management of CDI in adults. The panel followed a systematic process which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendation using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary and rationale that support each recommendation, and knowledge gaps can be found online in the full text.

### Comparative efficacy of treatments for Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^9a4b9136]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Several new treatments for Clostridium difficile infections have been investigated. We aimed to compare and rank treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections with C difficile in adults.

Methods

We did a random effects network meta-analysis within a frequentist setting to obtain direct and indirect comparisons of trials. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for published and unpublished trials from the creation of these databases until June 30, 2017. We included randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections with confirmed C difficile in adults (at least 18 years) that reported both primary cure and recurrence rates, and we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to appraise trial methods. For our analysis, we extracted the total numbers of patients with primary cure and recurrence from published and unpublished reports. The primary outcome was sustained symptomatic cure, defined as the number of patients with resolution of diarrhoea minus the number with recurrence or death.

Findings

Of 23004 studies screened, 24 trials, which comprised 5361 patients and 13 different treatments, were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate to low. For sustained symptomatic cure, fidaxomicin (odds ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·55–0·82) and teicoplanin (0·37, 0·14–0·94) were significantly better than vancomycin. Teicoplanin (0·27, 0·10–0·70), ridinilazole (0·41, 0·19–0·88), fidaxomicin (0·49, 0·35–0·68), surotomycin (0·66, 0·45–0·97), and vancomycin (0·73, 0·56–0·95) were better than metronidazole. Bacitracin was inferior to teicoplanin (0·22, 0·06–0·77) and fidaxomicin (0·40, 0·17–0·94), and tolevamer was inferior to all drugs except for LFF571 (0·50, 0·18–1·39) and bacitracin (0·67, 0·28–1·58). Global heterogeneity of the entire network was low (Cochran's Q = 15·70; p = 0·47).

Interpretation

Among the treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections by C difficile, the highest quality evidence indicates that fidaxomicin provides a sustained symptomatic cure most frequently. Fidaxomicin is a better treatment option than vancomycin for all patients except those with severe infections with C difficile and could be considered as a first-line therapy. Metronidazole should not be recommended for treatment of C difficile.

Funding

### Treatment of first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection: fidaxomicin versus vancomycin [^b235cc30]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Advanced age was also associated with a second recurrence; patients aged ≥ 65 years were more than twice as likely to have a relapse in 28 days than patients aged < 65 years. Other studies have observed an increased risk of recurrence within 2 months for patients aged ≥ 65 years following treatment with metronidazole. The relapse rate was as high as 58% in this age group during the Canadian outbreak in 2003–2004. These studies did not stratify patients according to whether this was a first or subsequent episode of CDI. In the Canadian study, most recurrences in patients who remained hospitalized during the entire 60 days following initial diagnosis occurred within the first 30 days. Comparisons between studies and meta-analyses of recurrence are complicated by differences in methodology and duration of follow-up.

Oral administration of vancomycin or fidaxomicin results in high fecal concentrations of either drug, well above minimum inhibitory concentrations for all clinical isolates of C. difficile. In a study by Louie et al, mean Bacteroides counts in feces were similar at the beginning and end of fidaxomicin treatment (day 10), but use of vancomycin resulted in counts that were 3.8 logs lower following 10 days of treatment. In specimens collected 21–28 days after the end of treatment, mean fecal spore counts were > 2 logs lower in fidaxomicin-treated patients than in vancomycin-treated patients. Fidaxomicin spares most of the major phylogenetic clusters, including clostridial clusters XIVa and IV and Bifidobacterium, in contrast to vancomycin treatment.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^358af140]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Risk Factors

Independent predictors in the final multivariate ITT model are shown in Table 1: randomization to fidaxomicin versus vancomycin reduced the risk for persistent diarrhea, recurrence, or death by 52% (95% CI, 37%–63%; P < .0001) even after adjustment for other factors. Persistent diarrhea or death in the first 12 days was predicted most strongly by previous anti-CDI antibiotics in the 24 hours before randomization (P = 0.0001), and low baseline eosinophil count (P = 0.007) and/or albumin level (P < .0001) at randomization. Eosinophils and previous antibiotic therapy had no effect on events from days 13–40 (recurrence or death), but patients with low albumin levels at CDI diagnosis remained at increased risk for recurrence or death. Although there was no evidence that previous CDI in the last 3 months strongly affected persistent diarrhea/death in the first 12 days, it was associated with a 68% higher risk for recurrence or death (days 13–40). Patients with an elevated BUN level or lower creatinine clearance at CDI diagnosis had slightly higher risks for persisting diarrhea, recurrence, or death throughout follow-up (days 0–40). In this multivariate model, there was no evidence of increased risk for recurrence in patients with lower hemoglobin levels receiving fidaxomicin (P = 0.96). Strain typing information was available for only 814 (70%) of the trial participants' isolates: effects of factors in Table 1 remained similar in the subset with strain typing available. Although BI strain per se was not associated with increased risk for persistent diarrhea, recurrence, or death (HR, 1.07 vs non-BI strains [95% CI,.73–1.56]; P = 0.73), the effect of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin remained larger in those with non-BI strains (HR [fidaxomicin:vancomycin], 0.30 [95% CI,.19–.46]) than BI strains (HR, 0.78 [95% CI,.51–1.19]; heterogeneity P = 0.002), as in the unadjusted analysis.
