## Question

How does ACE level correlate with disease severity in sarcoidosis patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) correlates with disease severity in sarcoidosis and how to interpret ACE clinically in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological rationale linking ACE to granuloma burden and activity. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance of ACE (sensitivity/specificity) and its limitations. Next, I will examine direct evidence for correlation with disease severity, including organ involvement and radiographic stage. After that, I need to check longitudinal data on ACE trends with treatment response and natural history. I should also consider confounders such as ACE gene polymorphisms and assay issues. Finally, I will compare ACE with alternative biomarkers and synthesize practical guidance for clinical use, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. ACE is produced by epithelioid macrophages within granulomas, so higher circulating ACE plausibly reflects a larger granuloma burden and greater macrophage activation, which should track with disease activity and severity in many patients, though not universally [^113459qp].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance before inferring severity. ACE is elevated in roughly 30–80% of untreated sarcoidosis depending on the cohort and assay, with sensitivity around 62% and specificity around 76% in classic series, and it is not diagnostic on its own; it lacks both sensitivity and specificity to stand alone for diagnosis or staging [^117MYPYu] [^111doL8n]. Hold on, I should also note that ACE can be elevated in other granulomatous and non-granulomatous conditions, including histoplasmosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, lymphoma, and even some autoimmune diseases, which further limits its specificity and underscores the need for careful exclusion of mimics [^115pDQj4] [^115rnw9j].

> I will now examine whether ACE correlates with disease severity. Several studies link higher ACE to more extensive organ involvement: in a large cohort, ACE and sIL-2R rose with the number of involved organs, and ACE independently associated with multi-organ disease including skin, lymph nodes, spleen, and abnormal calcium metabolism; similarly, patients with airway involvement had higher ACE and more parenchymal infiltration, suggesting a relationship between ACE and inflammatory burden [^116uGkpZ] [^111gCMfe]. But wait, what if ACE reflects radiographic stage rather than symptom severity? Chitotriosidase activity has correlated with higher radiographic stages and fibrotic patterns, and ACE itself has been higher in stage 3 compared with stage 0, implying a broad association with more advanced pulmonary involvement in some cohorts [^116AWFUe].

> Next, I should review longitudinal and treatment-response data to see if ACE tracks severity over time. Serial observations show ACE can fall with clinical improvement and rise with relapse; in a prospective cohort, ACE declined over four years alongside radiographic and functional improvement, and in methotrexate-treated patients, baseline ACE correlated with lung function gains, with parallel decreases in ACE and sIL-2R accompanying improvement, especially in DLCO, suggesting ACE dynamics reflect changing granulomatous activity in at least a subset [^116Ho9ut] [^11255m1r]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ACE changes can lag or be blunted by therapy, and some patients improve without ACE normalization, so ACE should be interpreted alongside clinical and physiologic measures rather than in isolation [^11255m1r] [^1143qkGP].

> I need to ensure I account for confounders that can obscure severity correlations. The ACE I/D polymorphism explains about 20–25% of interindividual variability, with D/D individuals having substantially higher baseline ACE; using genotype-corrected reference intervals or Z-scores reduces misclassification and improves interpretability when judging whether an ACE value is "high for that patient" in the context of suspected sarcoid activity [^11725Ezn] [^1143qkGP] [^115Hf4oz]. Hmm, wait a minute — ACE inhibitors can also alter ACE activity and conformation, and specialized phenotyping methods can detect this and avoid misinterpretation; additionally, assay variability and lack of standardized cutoffs further complicate cross-study comparisons, so I should double-check local reference ranges and methodology before inferring severity from a single value [^111vmFmU] [^1143qkGP].

> Let me consider organ-specific nuances. In neurosarcoidosis, CSF ACE has poor sensitivity and specificity and is not recommended for routine diagnosis, whereas serum ACE may be normal despite severe disease; in cardiac sarcoidosis, serum ACE is unhelpful for activity assessment, reinforcing that ACE is not a universal severity marker across organs and should be complemented by organ-specific evaluations and imaging when indicated [^111tyF3A] [^1137q3HK] [^112vQoYG]. I should confirm that in ocular sarcoidosis, ACE has high specificity but low sensitivity, so a normal ACE does not exclude disease and combined markers or imaging are often needed to support the diagnosis and gauge severity [^115Fdnd7] [^114ooaMT].

> Next, I should review comparative biomarkers to avoid over-relying on ACE. sIL-2R generally outperforms ACE for sensitivity and correlates more consistently with multi-organ involvement and inflammatory activity, though it is not perfect; chitotriosidase has shown strong sensitivity/specificity and correlates with symptoms, fibrotic patterns, and treatment response in several cohorts; interferon-γ–inducible chemokines (CXCL9/CXCL10) correlate with pulmonary function and composite severity scores when ACE does not, highlighting that different biomarkers capture distinct inflammatory axes and may be complementary rather than interchangeable [^113mzGb8] [^116AWFUe] [^115gmD1p]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline positions align with this nuance — ATS advises against relying on ACE for diagnosis or monitoring, emphasizing clinical, physiologic, and imaging assessments instead, which fits with the observed limitations and the need for integrated evaluation [^notfound].

> I will now synthesize the clinical message. ACE can correlate with disease severity in sarcoidosis, particularly when severity is framed as granuloma burden, multi-organ involvement, or radiographic stage, and serial ACE trends often move in the same direction as clinical improvement or relapse; however, ACE lacks the sensitivity and specificity to define severity reliably in individual patients, is influenced by genetics and assays, and performs poorly as a standalone severity metric in certain organs like the heart and nervous system [^116uGkpZ] [^11255m1r] [^112vQoYG] [^111tyF3A]. Therefore, I need to ensure ACE is interpreted alongside symptoms, pulmonary function, imaging, and, when available, more sensitive biomarkers such as sIL-2R or chitotriosidase, recognizing that no single biomarker currently captures the full spectrum of sarcoidosis severity or activity [^113mzGb8] [^116AWFUe].

> Final take: ACE reflects granulomatous macrophage activity and often rises with greater disease extent and falls with effective therapy, so a high ACE in the right clinical context supports more active or extensive disease, but a normal ACE does not exclude severity, and ACE should never be used in isolation to grade severity or guide treatment decisions; integrating ACE with clinical, physiologic, imaging, and complementary biomarkers yields the most accurate assessment of sarcoidosis severity and trajectory [^113459qp] [^116uGkpZ] [^11255m1r] [^111doL8n].

Serum ACE correlates with sarcoidosis severity, but **only modestly** and inconsistently across studies [^1143qkGP]. ACE is produced by epithelioid cells and macrophages within granulomas, so higher levels generally reflect a greater granuloma burden and more active disease [^113459qp]; however, **about 40% of patients have normal ACE**, especially in early or mild disease, and levels are influenced by genetic variation and organ involvement [^112L2o1p] [^112jnUA4] [^117MYPYu] [^116uGkpZ]. ACE correlates better with pulmonary parenchymal involvement and multi-organ disease than with isolated lymphadenopathy, and serial ACE trends can aid monitoring, but it should not be used alone to assess severity or guide therapy [^111doL8n] [^111gCMfe] [^116uGkpZ] [^11255m1r].

---

## Biological basis of ACE in sarcoidosis

ACE is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase produced by epithelioid cells and macrophages within granulomas; **granuloma burden drives ACE levels**, so higher ACE generally reflects more active granulomatous inflammation [^112L2o1p] [^11347ADi]. However, ACE is also produced by endothelial cells, and genetic variation (notably the ACE I/D polymorphism) significantly affects baseline ACE levels, limiting its specificity as a disease activity marker [^11725Ezn] [^112L2o1p].

---

## Correlation between ACE levels and disease severity

Multiple studies show a **modest correlation** between ACE and disease severity, with higher levels linked to more extensive organ involvement and active inflammation [^116uGkpZ]. However, the correlation is inconsistent, with notable exceptions:

- **Pulmonary involvement**: ACE correlates more strongly with parenchymal lung disease and fibrosis than with isolated lymphadenopathy, reflecting greater granulomatous activity in the lungs [^notfound].
- **Multi-organ involvement**: Higher ACE levels are associated with multi-organ disease, including extrapulmonary manifestations such as skin, eye, and cardiac involvement [^116uGkpZ].
- **Genetic variability**: The ACE I/D polymorphism significantly influences ACE levels, causing false positives or negatives if genetic variation is not accounted for [^11725Ezn] [^115Hf4oz].

---

## Limitations of ACE as a severity marker

Despite its utility, ACE has several **limitations**:

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: ACE is elevated in only 40–60% of patients with sarcoidosis, limiting its sensitivity. False positives can occur in other granulomatous diseases, reducing specificity [^113459qp] [^115pDQj4].
- **Organ-specific variability**: ACE levels vary depending on the organ involved. For example, ACE is less reliable for assessing cardiac or neurologic sarcoidosis severity [^112vQoYG] [^112jnUA4].
- **Influence of therapy**: Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents can suppress ACE production, potentially masking disease activity [^11255m1r] [^112xCqWb].

---

## Comparison with other biomarkers

ACE is often compared with other biomarkers, such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and chitotriosidase. sIL-2R correlates more strongly with disease activity and severity than ACE, particularly in pulmonary sarcoidosis, while **chitotriosidase** reflects macrophage activity and granuloma burden and may outperform ACE in certain contexts [^111dwo7R] [^116AWFUe].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the **limited role of ACE** in assessing sarcoidosis severity. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend against relying solely on ACE levels for disease monitoring or treatment decisions. Instead, they advocate for a comprehensive assessment incorporating clinical evaluation, imaging, and pulmonary function tests [^111doL8n] [^116jLcp4].

---

## Clinical implications and practical applications

While ACE alone is insufficient to determine disease severity, **serial measurements** can provide valuable information when interpreted alongside clinical and imaging data:

- **Trend analysis**: Serial ACE measurements can help monitor disease progression or response to therapy, particularly in patients with elevated baseline levels [^111vRZbJ] [^11255m1r].
- **Adjunctive tool**: ACE can be used as an adjunctive tool, particularly in patients with pulmonary involvement or multi-organ disease, but should not replace comprehensive clinical assessment [^111doL8n] [^116uGkpZ].
- **Individualized interpretation**: Genetic variability and organ-specific differences should be considered when interpreting ACE levels, and genotype-corrected reference ranges may improve accuracy [^11725Ezn] [^115Hf4oz].

---

Serum ACE correlates with sarcoidosis severity, reflecting granuloma burden and active inflammation, but the relationship is **modest and inconsistent**. ACE is most useful for monitoring trends and assessing pulmonary or multi-organ involvement, yet about 40% of patients have normal ACE, and levels are influenced by genetics and therapy. ACE should be interpreted alongside clinical, imaging, and pulmonary function data, with sIL-2R or chitotriosidase considered when available [^11347ADi] [^1143qkGP] [^111gCMfe] [^11255m1r] [^116uGkpZ] [^116jLcp4] [^11725Ezn] [^112xCqWb] [^114oZwgu] [^115Fdnd7] [^116AWFUe].

### Sarcoidosis: epidemiology and clinical insights [^111MgFjs]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas which form in almost any part of the body, primarily in the lungs and/or thoracic lymph nodes. Environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals are believed to cause sarcoidosis. There is variation in incidence and prevalence by region and race. Males and females are almost equally affected, although disease peaks at a later age in females than in males. The heterogeneity of presentation and disease course can make diagnosis and treatment challenging. Diagnosis is suggestive in a patient if one or more of the following is present: radiologic signs of sarcoidosis, evidence of systemic involvement, histologically confirmed noncaseating granulomas, sarcoidosis signs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and low probability or exclusion of other causes of granulomatous inflammation. No sensitive or specific biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis exist, but there are several that can be used to support clinical decisions, such as serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, human leukocyte antigen types, and CD4 Vα2.3+ T cells in BALF. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic patients with severely affected or declining organ function. Sarcoidosis is associated with a range of adverse long-term outcomes and complications, and with great variation in prognosis between populations. New data and technologies have moved sarcoidosis research forward, increasing our understanding of the disease. However, there is still much left to be discovered. The pervading challenge is how to account for patient variability. Future studies should focus on how to optimize current tools and develop new approaches so that treatment and follow-up can be targeted to individuals with more precision.

### Sarcoidosis in chronic granulomatous disease [^111ipx8s]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In addition to increased susceptibility to infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a higher incidence of sterile inflammatory disorders in these patients has been noted. However, sarcoidosis has not been reported previously in CGD. In this report, we describe two patients who have CGD and a disorder consistent with sarcoidosis on the basis of unequivocal clinical-radiographic presentations, their responses to treatment, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were measured in 26 other patients with CGD to establish an appropriate reference range. A possible relationship between CGD and sarcoidosis is discussed.

### Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor level is more sensitive than angiotensin-converting enzyme or lysozyme for diagnosis of sarcoidosis and may be a marker of multiple organ involvement [^116AyBPh]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Skin lesions in sarcoidosis are often the initial symptoms that enable the dermatologist to be the first to diagnose this granulomatosis. However, diagnosis is sometimes very problematic. In 2015, the diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis were updated in Japan, with elevated serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) replacing negative tuberculin reaction. Therefore, we assessed the clinical utility of sIL-2R compared with two other common markers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and lysozyme, in patients who visited the dermatology clinic. Data from 72 patients showed that sIL-2R was more sensitive than both ACE and lysozyme in supporting a diagnosis of sarcoidosis (52.8%) compared with ACE (29%) and lysozyme (26.4%). Additionally, the sIL-2R level was significantly higher in patients with multiple organ involvement and parenchymal infiltration. Patients with elevated sIL-2R levels had higher serum ACE and lysozyme levels, a higher incidence of pulmonary involvement, more severe chest radiographic stage and a high incidence of expression-specific signs by imaging analysis. Receiver-operator curve analysis showed that sIL-2R was a better marker at the threshold cut-off point compared with ACE and lysozyme for identifying patients with multiple organ involvement, detecting patients with pulmonary disease and parenchymal infiltration as well as predicting the presence of specific signs in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Moreover, the kinetics of sIL-2R levels correlated closely with clinical manifestations, in contrast to the modest changes of ACE and lysozyme levels during the follow-up period. In conclusion, sIL-2R may be considered a good marker for diagnosis and a potential indicator of disease activity.

### SACE and IL-2R as serum biomarkers for evaluation of multi-organ involvement and prognosis of sarcoidosis [^114R16Pz]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology that may affect almost every body organ. The most commonly involved organs remain the lung and mediastinal lymph nodes. The incidence of sarcoidosis varies due to different regions, races and demographics, and recent epidemiologic studies suggest that the annual incidence of sarcoidosis varies between 1 and 15 per 100,000. Clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis are various on the basis of the race, gender, as well as the extent and severity of organ mainly affected. Because there is no specific test or algorithm for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, its diagnosis depends on a compatible clinical and imaging feature, histologic evidence of non-necrotizing epithelial granuloma, and exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous diseases. Therefore, identifying biomarkers is warranted to assist in disease diagnosis and disease activity surveillance, as well as improve prognostic outcomes for patients with sarcoidosis.

Because of simple sample collection, minimal invasiveness, and low cost, the serum markers can be of great value in disease prediction and prognosis outcome assessment. Many biomarkers and their correlation with sarcoidosis have been reported in previous studies. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE) is abnormally upregulated in some patients with sarcoidosis, and it could assist in the diagnosis as well as predict disease active status. Soluble Interleukin-2 Receptor (IL-2R) level at the time of diagnosis may be a useful marker for prognosticating spontaneous remission or chronic disease course in sarcoidosis. Beijer et al. reported that serum amyloid A (SAA) levels were higher in fibrotic sarcoidosis patients compared to those without fibrosis. Other investigators have reported that an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be seen in patients with lung parenchymal involvement and chronic sarcoidosis. However, the value of serum biomarkers has not been clearly identified for the prediction of multi-organ involvement or prognostic outcome assessment for patients with sarcoidosis. The aim of this study was to identify common biomarkers that could be used as tools to predict organ involvement and prognosticate outcomes in patients with sarcoidosis.

### Predictive potential of ACE phenotyping in extrapulmonary sarcoidosis [^112L2o1p]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that occurs throughout the world and affects people of all races and ages. Despite years of study and recent advances in diagnostic strategies, the etiology of sarcoidosis and many details of the pathogenesis remain unknown.

Serum levels of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE or CD143) are elevated in many patients with sarcoidosis and initially were thought to parallel the activity of sarcoid lesions. However, this initial excitement about serum ACE representing a useful biomarker for sarcoid activity has proven to be incorrect. Multiple studies have demonstrated that serum ACE levels do not accurately reflect disease activity, and no correlation has been observed between serum ACE and ACE levels in granulomas.

ACE is a Zn 2+ carboxydipeptidase which is vital for the regulation of blood pressure and also associated with the development of vascular pathology. ACE is constitutively expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, absorptive epithelial and neuroepithelial cells, and cells of the immune system (macrophages, dendritic cells). Blood ACE likely originates from endothelial cell ACE, primarily lung capillary endothelium, due to proteolytic cleavage by a still unidentified ACE secretase-see for review.

ACE tissue expression and blood ACE levels are strongly influenced by genetic factors. The best-described is the ACE I/D polymorphism: the absence (deletion, D) rather than the presence (insertion, I) of 287 base marker (Alu repeat) is associated with significantly higher circulating ACE levels, as well as with ACE in lymphocytes, and in human cardiac tissues. Despite the fact that this particular ACE I/D polymorphism accounts for only 20% of the total variation of tissue and serum ACE, it allows for the interpretation of ACE activity in sarcoid patients more precisely by establishing three reference intervals for each genotype. We have proposed that measuring the ACE level (ACE phenotyping) rather than ACE genotyping will be more informative for many purposes, including identification of associations of ACE levels with cardiovascular complications, as well as for diagnostic evaluation of sarcoidosis.

### Serum biomarkers in interstitial lung diseases [^1143qkGP]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Accumulated evidence from the data presented reveal that the predictive values of serum ACE in sarcoid patients are still under consideration and findings derived from these studies are controversial concerning its usefulness in assessing the disease severity and predicting the clinical outcome. Although some investigators suggest that a rising ACE serum level can predict radiographic relapses of sarcoidosis others have clearly demonstrated that ACE appears to be of poor prognostic value. In the aforementioned studies ACE does not yield prognostic information. However, several studies in the literature have addressed this issue and have reported an extraordinary high variability in serum ACE concentration in health, which is provoked by numerous factors. The most important factor, responsible for approximately 25% of this variation is a deletion/insertion polymorphism in intron 16 of the ACE gene. The question whether genotype corrected normal values might be able to increase the reliability of ACE serological concentrations as a marker of disease activity in sarcoidosis remains to be determined by further studies.

The role of chemokines in monitoring the disease behaviour and in reflecting the activity of granuloma formation in sarcoidosis patients has been evaluated and postulated. Hashimoto et al. were the first who carried out a longitudinal evaluation of plasma MCP-1 and MIP-1a levels in a rather small number of sarcoid subjects and demonstrated a closely relation between serum levels of the studied biomarkers and the clinical course of the disease as defined by radiological and laboratory parameters. However, further light should be shed onto the role of these chemokines as markers of the disease activity and severity as well as their cellular sources and their relationship with the granuloma formation.

To this end Iyonaga et al. in parallel with the elevation of MCP-1 serum levels in sarcoid individuals and their linkage with radiographic abnormalities showed by both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization that the origin of the increased MCP-1 plasma levels were the macrophages peripheral to the granulomas suggesting a role for this molecule as an indicator in estimating the activity of granuloma formation and subsequently of the sarcoidosis activity.

### Airway involvement in pulmonary sarcoidosis: clinical and CT features [^111gCMfe]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder with frequent respiratory system involvement, yet comprehensive data on airway abnormalities remain limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and characteristics of airway involvement in pulmonary sarcoidosis and its correlation with clinical and radiological features.

Methods

A retrospective, single-center study was conducted at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, including 842 patients diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis between March 2013 and September 2023. Airway abnormalities were identified via bronchoscopy, and clinical, radiological, and pulmonary function data were analyzed.

Results

Airway involvement was observed in 27.1% of patients (228/842), with thickening (21.4%), nodularity (11.9%), and plaques (7.2%) being the most common patterns. Patients with airway involvement exhibited higher cough prevalence (67.1% vs. 51.5%, p < 0.001), elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, and more extensive pulmonary parenchymal infiltration on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Cobblestoning, nodularity, and plaques were strongly associated with granuloma detection in endobronchial biopsies.

Conclusion

Airway involvement in pulmonary sarcoidosis is associated with more severe symptoms, higher disease activity, and distinct radiological patterns. These findings highlight the interplay between pulmonary parenchymal and airway pathology, warranting further investigation into their relationship.

### Chitotriosidase: a biomarker of activity and severity in patients with sarcoidosis [^111ZPE6j]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study offers new insights into the clinical utility of chitotriosidase as a biomarker in patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a complex, pleiotropic disease with many phenotypes and many clinical classifications have been proposed. Numerous biomarkers have been proposed over time in sarcoidosis, but none of these have been universally recognized in clinical practice. Ideal characteristics of candidate biomarkers should be highly specific and sensitive for the diagnosis, but more importantly, in sarcoidosis patients, from a prognostic point of view, to discriminate among different phenotypes and states of the diseases predicting remission or progression. In the present study we aimed to test chitotriosidase utility for identifying clinical phenotypes, different radiological lung involvement, extrapulmonary organ involvement, and for evaluating its reliability in a large cohort of sarcoidosis patients with and without steroid therapy.

Chitotriosidase is a chitinase involved in defense against chitin-containing pathogens. This enzyme, implicated in innate immunity, macrophage maturation and differentiation, has been found elevated in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with sarcoidosis and has been proposed some years ago as prognostic biomarker by our group of research. It showed higher sensitivity and specificity than other biomarkers, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme and soluble IL-2 receptor and it has been found increased in active sarcoidosis patients showing to predict clinical course, steroid responsiveness and relapse of the disease.

### Diagnostic value of serum-soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels vs angiotensin-converting enzyme in patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis [^111hduhL]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

New and improved diagnostic tests for sarcoidosis-associated uveitis are needed because the currently available laboratory diagnostic biomarkers (eg, lysozyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]) are lacking in high sensitivity and specificity.

Objective

To compare the value of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) with ACE as diagnostic biomarkers of sarcoidosis in patients with uveitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted using data collected from 249 consecutive patients with uveitis at the Erasmus University Medical Center uveitis outpatient clinic, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, from April 3, 2013, through November 25, 2015. Measurements of sIL-2R and ACE in serum samples and data extraction from patient files were conducted from December 2016 through February 2017, and analysis from April to May 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Serum levels of sIL-2R and ACE and chest radiographic findings were assessed. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to determine the probability that individual tests correctly identified patients with sarcoidosis. The Youden Index was used to determine the optimal cutoff points for serum sIL-2R and ACE levels to define sarcoidosis in patients with uveitis.

Results

Data were analyzed from 249 patients with uveitis who had their serum sIL-2R and ACE levels determined and underwent chest radiography. Mean (SD) age at the time of sampling was 51 (16) years, 161 patients (64.7%) were women, and 191 (76.7%) were white. Although patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis had the highest mean (SD) serum sIL-2R (6047 [2533] pg/mL) and ACE (61 [38] U/L) levels, elevated serum sIL-2R levels were also found in patients with HLA-B27–associated (4460 [2465] pg/mL) and varicella-zoster virus–associated (5386 [1778] pg/mL) uveitis. Serum sIL-2R and ACE levels were significantly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.205; p = 0.001, 2-sided), but no association was found between uveitis activity and sIL-2R (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.070, P = 0.27) nor uveitis activity and ACE (ρ, −0.071; p = 0.27). The highest Youden index for sIL-2R alone was 0.45, corresponding to an optimal cutoff of 4000 pg/mL and providing 81% (95% CI, 74%-89%) sensitivity and 64% (95% CI, 56%-72%) specificity alone but combined with chest radiography yielded 92% sensitivity and 58% specificity. Chest radiography combined with sIL-2R at a cutoff of 6000 pg/mL resulted in 77% sensitivity and 73% specificity. Combined chest radiography and serum ACE levels at the standard cutoff of 68 U/L resulted in 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study demonstrates that sIL-2R is a useful marker for diagnosing sarcoidosis in patients with uveitis and has slightly better diagnostic value than ACE.

### Personalized medicine in sarcoidosis: unravelling biomarkers for targeted care [^117MUPEu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an assessment of biomarkers in sarcoidosis, aiming to address the need for improved diagnostic, prognostic and management tools. Sarcoidosis presents diagnostic challenges, necessitating the search for reliable biomarkers to guide clinical decisions.

Recent Findings

Established biomarkers such as serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and serum interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. FDG-PET/CT imaging shows promising results in assessing disease activity and guiding immunosuppression. Gene expression profiling studies reveal potential biomarkers, particularly involving TH1 immune response and IFN-γ-driven signalling pathways. The field of omics sciences offers opportunities for novel biomarker discovery.

Summary

These findings have implications for clinical practice and research. The limitations of established biomarkers underscore the need for improved diagnostic tools in sarcoidosis. The potential of FDG-PET/CT imaging requires further exploration. Gene expression profiling and omics sciences offer avenues for discovering novel biomarkers to enhance diagnosis and predict disease progression. Such advancements can facilitate personalized treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes. Continued research is vital to validate the efficacy and clinical applicability of these biomarkers. Overall, this review emphasizes ongoing efforts to advance sarcoidosis biomarkers research and improve disease management.

### Serum biomarkers in interstitial lung diseases [^111dwo7R]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

One of the first studies attempted to circumvent this problem was published by Ziegenhagen et al. Authors scrutinized the efficacy of both BAL and serum parameters in indicating likelihood of progression in patients with sarcoidosis and revealed that almost half of the patients with no indications for steroid therapy who had elevated sIL-2R plasma levels experienced disease deterioration whereas none with normal values did. The aforementioned observation strongly suggests that this immune parameter could serve as a prognostic guide leading to the identification of patients with greater risk to relapse and maybe associated with clinical findings such as the disease course.

The effectiveness of sIL-2R in evaluating sarcoidosis severity even in the early stages of the disease was further confirmed by another study of the same group of scientists who clearly reported significantly elevated sIL-2R concentrations in patients with progressive sarcoidosis. On the contrary, this evidence was followed by a surprising finding regarding the ACE serum concentrations which did not differ significantly between patients with stable or progressing disease indicating a poor predictive value of this biomarker in sarcoidosis.

In the study of Grutters et al. authors evaluated the serological concentrations of sIL-2R as marker of disease activity, severity and prognosis in a well-defined group of patients with sarcoidosis. Data derived from this study partially consistent with other studies asserts a positive correlation between sIL-2R serum levels and the disease activity and severity and furthermore claims a predictive value for this serum biomarker. However, this study was retrospective and major discrepancies between the latter findings and results derived from older studies were also notable.

To establish a more reliable association between sIL-2R and severity of sarcoidosis Rothkrantz-Kos et al. applied ROC curve analysis and estimated the potential prognostic and diagnostic value of four inflammatory markers to predict respiratory severity in a large number of sarcoidosis patients. Areas under curve indicated that sIL-2R showed the greatest ability to determine pulmonary severity as assessed by the highest sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values among the evaluated markers, including C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and ACE. Nonetheless, discrepancies between serum levels of all markers in treated and untreated patients coupled with the lack of serial measurement through patients' clinical course pose major limitations to the reported data which is unable to determine the potential efficacy of the evaluated markers to reflect respiratory severity in sarcoidosis patients under treatment in general.

### Coexisting primary hyperparathyroidism and sarcoidosis cause increased angiotensin-converting enzyme and decreased parathyroid hormone and phosphate levels [^114cSM3e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and sarcoidosis may separately contribute to abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism via different mechanisms, and their coexistence is infrequently reported.

Objective

We sought to characterize a group of 50 patients with coexisting PHPT and sarcoidosis in our institution to evaluate their clinical and laboratory characteristics.

Design and Setting

This was a retrospective observational study of patients with both disorders at our institution between January 1980 and December 2011.

Outcome

A cohort of 50 patients was identified, with mean ± SD age 59.6 ± 13.9 years and 86% women. Serum calcium in the cohort was 11.1 ± 1.1 mg/dL, phosphate was 3.3 ± 0.6 mg/dL, and PTH was 76 ± 42 pg/mL. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 25 ± 9 ng/mL, and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was 51 ± 20 pg/mL; 24-hour urine calcium was 275 ± 211 mg. In subjects with sarcoidosis, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was 47.2 ± 37.4 U/L. Sarcoidosis was diagnosed first in 50% of patients, PHPT was diagnosed first in 16% of patients, and sarcoidosis and PHPT were both diagnosed within 6 months of each other in 30% of patients. The interval between the 2 diagnoses when sarcoidosis was diagnosed first was 15.5 ± 12.4 years and was 5.5 ± 6.0 years when PHPT was diagnosed first. Patients with PHPT who had active sarcoidosis had higher serum ACE levels (60.9 ± 38.1 vs 20.2 ± 14.0 U/L, P < .0001), lower PTH levels (60 ± 24 vs 96 ± 41 pg/mL, P = 0.01), and lower phosphate levels (2.7 ± 0.6 vs 3.2 ± 0.5 mg/dL, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Fifty patients with coexisting PHPT and sarcoidosis are described, with patients with PHPT coexisting with clinically active sarcoidosis having increased serum ACE levels and decreased serum PTH and phosphate levels compared with those with inactive sarcoidosis.

### Usefulness of combined measurement of serum soluble IL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the detection of uveitis associated with Japanese sarcoidosis [^111FpHU5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

A total of 20 of 52 (38.5%) sarcoid patients were double-positive for ACE and sIL-2R. Serum sIL-2R and ACE levels were positively correlated in patients with sarcoid uveitis (ρ = 0.595, P = 3.18 × 10⁻⁶) (Figure 3A). There was no correlation between serum sIL-2R and ACE levels in the PIOL group (ρ = −0.076, P = 0.81) (Figure 3B). Although the averages of both the serum sIL-2R and ACE levels were not elevated, a weak correlation was observed in patients with non-sarcoid uveitis (ρ = 0.492, P = 8.56 × 10 −6) (Figure 3C).

Figure 3
Correlation between serum sIL-2R and ACE levels in patients with sarcoid uveitis, PIOL, and non-sarcoid uveitis. (A); Sarcoid uveitis, (B); PIOL, (C); non-sarcoid uveitis. A Spearman Rank correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between serum sIL-2R and ACE levels in each group. Positive correlation between two serum markers were observed in sarcoid uveitis (ρ = 0.595, P = 3.18 × 10⁻⁶) and non-sarcoid uveitis (ρ = 0.492, P = 8.56 × 10⁻⁶). There was no correlation between serum sIL-2R and ACE levels in PIOL (ρ = −0.076, P = 0.81).

Furthermore, among patients with sarcoid uveitis, we investigated whether there were any clinical differences between those with and without elevated sIL-2R levels. Serum sIL-2R levels tended to be higher in patients who had lung lesions or had more than three organ lesions. However, the differences did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05).

### Genotype-corrected reference values for serum angiotensin-converting enzyme [^11725Ezn]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The deletion (D)/insertion (I) polymorphism in intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has the greatest impact on serum ACE level in Caucasians of any factor yet discovered. The aim of the present study was to establish new ACE genotype-corrected normal ranges for serum ACE level in a population of central European origin. After a medical examination, 159 healthy Caucasians volunteered to donate blood for the study. ACE genotypes were assessed by PCR and serum ACE levels were determined using two different kinetic tests. The distribution of the D/I polymorphism of the ACE gene was in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Serum ACE levels and ACE genotypes correlated significantly, with the highest serum ACE levels in subjects with ACE genotype D/D, and the lowest serum ACE levels in subjects with genotype I/I (mean ± sd, assay 1: D/D 59.3 ± 15.1 U x L(-1), D/I 45.5 ± 15.2 U x L(-1), I/I 34.8 ± 13.7 U x L(-1); assay 2: D/D 43.7 ± 14.1 U x L(-1), D/I 33.7 ± 12.1 U x L(-1), I/I 25.4 ± 9.5 U x L(-1)). Although they gave different absolute values of serum ACE levels, the results of the two test kits correlated significantly. In conclusion, the present authors recommend the use of new, genotype-specific reference values for serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, especially to improve the sensitivity and specificity of tests for angiotensin-converting enzyme in the follow-up of sarcoidosis.

### Circulating concentration of markers of angiogenic activity in patients with sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116PhoPe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We are not able to replicate some previously published results of circulating cytokine alterations. Methodological differences may account for our different, yet not contradictory findings: whereas many studies have employed single-cytokine ELISA tests, used plasma or culture supernatant samples, or had cohorts of newly diagnosed disease, we employed a multiplex assay, used serum samples, and had a cohort of chronic disease.

Our study has limitations. A relatively small number of patients, especially with IPF, was included into the study and cytokines examinations were performed only in serum, but not in BAL. The results of Diffusing Capacity of the Lungs for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) were available only in few patients as no correlations were estimated between DLCO and cytokines concentrations. No relationships were checked between the examined angiogenic molecules and other potential markers of sarcoidosis or IPF activity, for example: ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) or LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), as no such data were available. It would be interesting to compare results obtained from patients with IPF with those at stage IV of sarcoidosis i.e. with fibrotic lung changes, it was very difficult however to collect a sufficient number of previously untreated sarcoid patients in IV stage.

### Serum biomarkers in interstitial lung diseases [^11347ADi]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Other delineated serological parameters that have been scrutinized for their clinical efficacy as serum biologic markers of the disease severity and the activation of several inflammatory cells contributing to the immunopathogenesis of the disease include markers of T-cell activation and markers for the evaluation of macrophage/monocyte activity.

Soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) represents a biomarker of the T-cell activation and can be found in BAL fluid and serum of sarcoidosis patients and it is released by activated alveolar immune cells. In addition to lymphocytes, activated sarcoid alveolar macrophages are capable of expressing increased numbers of sIL-2R upon activation. There are several reports in the literature, some of them are reviewed here, that reveal an intimate relationship between this parameter and the clinical activity of the disease, providing further evidence for the close linkage between the course of sarcoidosis and the activated state of T-cells.

Parameters suitable for gauging the activity of the macrophage lineage in ILDs and specifically sarcoidosis and occupational diseases have been delineated and comprise the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) a product of epithelioid cells that reflect the granuloma burden of the entire body, neopterin a metabolite of the guanosinetriphosphate pathway that is released by activated macrophages and monocytes under the control of IFN-γ produced by T-cells and b-glucuronidase a lysosomal enzyme, associated with increased phagocytic activity. Serum and BALF levels of these molecules have been found elevated in patients with sarcoidosis and environmental lung disorders and have been used in the everyday clinical practice as markers for the clinical assessment and follow-up of granulomatous inflammation and dust-induced inflammatory response.

### Usefulness of combined measurement of serum soluble IL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the detection of uveitis associated with Japanese sarcoidosis [^112wu6ZK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis is a cryptogenic, multisystem disease that is one of the major causes of uveitis. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires a compatible clinical picture, the histological demonstration of noncaseating granulomas, and the exclusion of other diseases capable of producing a similar clinical or histological picture. In addition to histological diagnosis, the International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis (IWOS) has determined that a diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with suggestive ocular findings of sarcoidosis be supported by laboratory investigations, including an elevated level of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), and other parameters. Concerning sarcoid uveitis, however, ACE levels are not always elevated,–and one proposed diagnostic marker for sarcoidosis is serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R). In particular, serum levels of sIL-2R are elevated in patients with active lung sarcoidosis, and sIL-2R is both a diagnostic marker and predictor of the severity of this condition.–A previous study showed that serum sIL-2R is superior to ACE in ruling out sarcoidosis in patients suspected of sarcoidosis. However, the diagnostic value of sIL-2R levels in sarcoid uveitis has not been well established.

Serum sIL-2R levels are also elevated in patients with non-Hodgkin's B-cell malignant lymphoma. Measuring sIL-2R levels may help in the diagnosis of lymphoma, and monitoring the course of the disease. The histopathological manifestation of primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL), also called primary vitreoretinal lymphoma, is non-Hodgkin's B-cell malignant lymphoma.–Although PIOL appears to be distinguishable from uveitis by cytodiagnosis of vitreous biopsy samples, it may be misdiagnosed as uveitis, including sarcoidosis. To date, the significance of the measurement of serum sIL-2R in patients with PIOL and the frequency of elevation of serum sIL-2R levels remain unknown.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether serum sIL-2R is also a useful diagnostic marker, either as a replacement for or in addition to ACE, the conventional marker in the detection of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis, as well as in the differentiation of sarcoid uveitis from non-sarcoid uveitis and PIOL.

### Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme has a high negative predictive value in the investigation for systemic sarcoidosis [^113nvw87]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine whether measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is useful in diagnosing sarcoidosis in undifferentiated uveitis.

Design

Evaluation of a diagnostic test.

Methods

Data collection was performed from 1035 consecutive subjects presenting with uveitis to Moorfields Eye Hospital undergoing measurement of serum ACE as part of baseline investigations for underlying systemic disease. The main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of elevated serum ACE.

Results

Mean age of the sample was 41.7 years and 56.1% of subjects were female. Sarcoidosis was the underlying cause for the uveitis in 110 subjects (10.6%) and was more common in adults, female subjects, black subjects, and subjects with intermediate uveitis or panuveitis. ACE was elevated in 196 subjects (18.9%) and elevated levels were observed in 85 subjects eventually diagnosed with underlying sarcoidosis (true positive 77.3%) and in 111 subjects with an alternate diagnosis (false positive 12.0%). In adult subjects, sensitivity of serum ACE was 78.1%, specificity 90.0%, and PPV 43.6%, but the NPV was 97.0%. The test performed well, with area under curve (AUC) 0.897 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.854–0.941). Serum ACE performed less well in distinguishing sarcoid uveitis in pediatric subjects, with sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 78.5%, and PPV 10.0%, but again NPV was high at 96.9% and AUC was 0.828 (95% CI 0.571–1.000).

Conclusions

Serum ACE had a very high negative predictive value for sarcoid uveitis, eliminating the need for further screening tests in subjects with normal serum ACE, unless clinical suspicion was high.

### Comparative evaluation of serum markers in pulmonary sarcoidosis [^115n2Sfs]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although several serum markers have shown their ability to reflect lymphocytic alveolitis and disease progression in pulmonary sarcoidosis, to our knowledge no prior study has made comparative evaluations of these markers.

Methods

Forty-three patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis were enrolled. BAL fluid (BALF) cells were analyzed, and serum levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R), lysozyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and the mucin-like, high-molecular-weight glycoprotein KL-6 were measured at disease presentation. Clinical data, including chest radiographs, were collected at presentation and during follow-ups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify markers best predictive of increased parenchymal infiltration.

Results

Significantly higher serum levels of sIL-2R, lysozyme, and KL-6 were found in patients with parenchymal infiltration compared with those without parenchymal infiltration. The numbers of total cells and lymphocytes in BALF were significantly higher in patients with parenchymal infiltration. Serum levels of sIL-2R, lysozyme, and KL-6 were significantly correlated with the numbers of total cells, lymphocytes, and CD4(+) T lymphocytes in BALF. At the cutoff levels determined by receiver operating characteristic curves, sIL-2R, lysozyme, KL-6 serum levels, and the number of BAL lymphocytes showed significant correlations with increased parenchymal infiltrations by univariate analysis. However, multivariate analysis revealed that only KL-6 was a predictor of increased parenchymal infiltration.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that initial serum sIL-2R, lysozyme, and KL-6 levels may reflect lymphocytic alveolitis in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Furthermore, initial serum KL-6 tends to associate with increased parenchymal infiltration in pulmonary sarcoidosis.

### Interferon-inducible chemokines reflect severity and progression in sarcoidosis [^115gmD1p]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Correlations with disease severity

There were significant inverse correlations between CXCL10 and FVC% predicted (Figure 3 A) and CXCL9 and DLCO (diffusing capacity) % predicted (Figure 3 B). There was a trend for CXCL10 and DLCO% predicted (Pearson's R = −0.37, p = 0.056). As an alternative method to examine how these chemokines related to disease severity, we used a severity score developed by Wafsi et al. which incorporates lung function measures, presence of cardiac and/or neurologic disease, and immunosuppression use. Using this equation, both CXCL10 and CXCL9 were significantly correlated with severity score (Figure 4). Of note, levels of non-specific markers of inflammation as well as "sarcoidosis-related" serum markers, such as sIL2R, ESR, CRP, and ACE level, did not correlate with pulmonary function measures or severity score.

Figure 3
Relationship between interferon-inducible chemokines and pulmonary function testing. (A) Serum CXCL10 is inversely correlated with FVC% predicted and (N = 36) (B) serum CXCL9 is inversely correlated with DLCO% (N = 23) predicted in non-immunosuppressed subjects with sarcoidosis.

Figure 4
Relationship between interferon-inducible chemokines and clinical severity. (A) Serum CXCL10 (N = 36) and (B) CXCL9 (N = 30) positively correlated with a sarcoidosis severity score previously published by Wasfi et al.

Correlations with disease progression

Twenty-six subjects with sarcoidosis had longitudinal data (Table 3), meaning they had at least 2 serum samples. In the longitudinal measurements, the majority of subjects with chronic sarcoidosis demonstrated persistently elevated or increased serum CXCL10 levels, whereas remitting sarcoidosis subjects consistently showed a decrease in serum CXCL10 (Figure 5). The mean increase in serum CXCL10 in chronic sarcoidosis was 4.3 ± 14 pg/ml, compared to a drop of 12.8 ± 11 pg/ml in the remitting sarcoidosis group, p = 0.002 (Figure 5). Patients with chronic sarcoidosis demonstrated a mean decline in FVC of 0.13 L ± 0.13 L, whereas remitting subjects demonstrated a mean improvement in FVC of 0.11 ± 0.34 L (p = 0.051). There was no difference in time interval between performing pulmonary function testing between both groups (10.3 ± 5.3 versus 8.9 ± 5.2 months, respectively, p = 0.53).

### ACE and sIL-2R correlate with lung function improvement in sarcoidosis during methotrexate therapy [^11255m1r]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In sarcoidosis, the search for disease activity markers that correlate with treatment response is ongoing. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of two proposed markers, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) during methotrexate (MTX) therapy in sarcoidosis patients.

Materials and Methods

We analysed 114 sarcoidosis patients who used MTX for six months, consisting of a subgroup of 76 patients with a pulmonary indication for treatment and a subgroup of 38 patients with an extra-pulmonary indication. ACE and sIL-2R serum levels were measured at baseline and after six months of treatment. Correlation coefficients (R) and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to study the correlation and predictive effect of serum ACE and sIL-2R levels for pulmonary improvement.

Results

High baseline levels of ACE correlated significantly with lung function improvement after treatment (R = 0.45, p < 0.0001; stronger in the pulmonary subgroup R 0.57, p < 0.0001). ACE baseline levels > 90 U/l predicted a 10% improvement in overall lung function (OR 3.55; CI 1.34–9.38), with the highest prediction level for 10% improvement in DLCO (OR 4.63; CI 1.23–17.4). After six months of MTX, mean ACE decreased with 17.2 U/l (p < 0.0001) and sIL-2R with 1850 pg/ml (p < 0.0001). Decreases in both ACE and sIL-2R correlated with an increase in lung function. The strongest correlation was found with change in DLCO in the pulmonary subgroup (ACE R = 0.63, P < 0.0001; sIL-2R R = 0.56, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Baseline and serial serum ACE and sIL-2R levels correlate well with lung function improvement during MTX treatment. Serial measurements of these biomarkers are helpful in monitoring treatment effects in sarcoidosis patients.

### Chitotriosidase: a biomarker of activity and severity in patients with sarcoidosis [^116AWFUe]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In the present large case series (n = 694), chitotriosidase activity proved to be a reliable biomarker of sarcoidosis; it was significantly increased in patients with sarcoidosis than in healthy controls and it correlated with respiratory symptoms (exertional dyspnea and cough) and with serum ACE concentration. It also proved to correlate with disease severity, expressed as severe progressive pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvement, to be able to detect disease relapse and to identify patients requiring escalation of therapy.

Chitotriosidase correlated with radiological findings in our cohort: patients with chest X-ray stages different from 0 showed significantly higher concentrations. In the present study, we firstly investigated correlations between chitotriosidase activity and different CT patterns of presentation. Severe pulmonary involvement, indicated by HRCT by evidence of lung fibrosis with reticular abnormalities and traction bronchiectasis, was associated with a significant increase in chitotriosidase activity. In sarcoidosis patients, fibrosis is a result of persistent and uncontrolled disease and chitotriosidase may reflect persistent granuloma activity. We also explored Chitotriosidase activity in relation the composite physiological index (CPI), proposed by the Brompton group of research, that showed to identify patients at high clinical risk correlating with radiological extent of fibrosis and we found a slightly significant correlation with chitotriosidase activity. In our cohort strength of such correlation is rather weak, even if significant (r = 0.09434, p = 0.0199); probably it is underestimated by the overwhelming percentage of patients with normal PFTs. Further studies are needed to better understand values of CPI in combination with chitotriosidase in sarcoidosis, but indirectly suggests the association of chitotriosidase expression with fibrosis development. Overexpression of chitotiosidase has been previously associated with abnormal production of TGF-beta, leading to initiation and perpetuation of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis and its expression, and of other chitinases (i.e. YKL-40), has been associated to airway remodelling in severe asthma. Moreover, in BAL from patients with sarcoidosis, chitotriosidase has been found increased in progressive than stable patients. These results suggest that this enzyme could be involved in fibrogenesis in diffuse lung diseases, expression of high activation of certain macrophage pathways responsible for remodeling and fibrosis development.

### Lung CD4 + V α ₂.3 + T-cells in sarcoidosis cohorts with Löfgren's syndrome [^117MYPYu]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

A lung accumulation of CD4+ Vα2.3+ T-cells is well known and characteristic for sarcoidosis. The resulting increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio, in particular when > 3.5, has been suggested to be of help in diagnosing sarcoidosis. The association between a CD4/CD8-ratio > 3.5 and sarcoidosis was also confirmed in this study, which to our knowledge is the largest patient cohort showing this. The results are consistent with a metanalysis of 999 patients and 886 controls. A number of serological tests have also been proposed to reflect the activity and support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. One of these is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which has been extensively investigated since it was first reported to be associated with sarcoidosis in 1975 by Lieberman. The sensitivity was in a study including 101 patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis 62% and the specificity 76%. However, ACE may be normal in early stages of the disease. Also, neopterin was found to be elevated in serum and to correlate with ACE but for both substances the most important value seems to be when sequential analyses are made. According to a study on 232 sarcoidosis patients by Bargagli et al. the enzyme chitotriosidase is also correlating to ACE and showed for sarcoidosis a high sensitivity (88.6%) and specificity (92.8%). In a study by Popevic et al. the corresponding values for sensitivity were 82.5% and for specificity 70%. Serum-ACE in the latter study had 66% sensitivity and 54% specificity. Soluble IL-2 receptor has been shown by Bargagli et al. to correlate to chitotriosidase and to be a useful marker of disease progression. Eurelings et al. reported a sensitivity of 88 and 85% specificity in a total of 101 patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Several other attempts have been made to identify biomarkers. One of them is KL-6 that showed a sensitivity of 78% and seems to reflect the more severe disease stages well. Another is serum amyloid A which is known to be involved in inflammatory reactions and immune disorders. It has been reported to be increased in sarcoidosis and suggested to be valuable especially at follow-up. Taken together, no serological biomarker has so far proven ideal and in this setting we believe that CD4+ Vα2.3+ T-cells could provide additional valuable information in diagnosing and in some cases monitoring sarcoidosis. The Va2.3+ cells could perhaps be a component in the future of suggested multi-assays as proposed by Ramos-Casals et al. A weakness of the present study is the composition of the controls. We did not include patients with e.g. tuberculosis and only one with lymphoma since we seldom see patients with these diagnoses at the lung clinic. Studying the CD4+ T-cell subgroup that express Vα2.3, we found particularly in LS patients a strong association with the diagnose and a capacity to separate sarcoidosis from controls. In non-LS this finding was also existing but weaker.

### Human chitotriosidase: a sensitive biomarker of sarcoidosis [^113fkRRH]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. No suitable biomarkers are available to evaluate the evolution of this disease, which still has an unpredictable clinical course. Some years ago our research group proposed chitotriosidase as a potential biomarker with prognostic value, that however needed to be validated.

Aims and Methods

The aims of this study were to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of chitotriosidase in a population of 232 sarcoidosis patients under the observation of our Sarcoidosis Regional Referral Centre in Siena and to analyse enzyme concentrations in different disease phenotypes (as defined by the recently published COS classification) to define its prognostic value.

Results

Serum chitotriosidase concentrations were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.0001) and were directly correlated with ACE levels (r = 0.25, p < 0.0001). ROC curve analysis revealed 88.6% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity. Enzyme concentrations were significantly higher in stage 3 sarcoidosis than in stage 0 (p = 0.02). The lowest concentrations of chitotriosidase were found in untreated patients in remission (COS-1), while the highest enzyme concentrations were found in symptomatic patients with persistent disease on steroids and with functional deterioration in the last year (COS-9). In COS-9 subgroup, chitotriosidase decreased significantly after the increasing of steroid dose or the introduction of a new immunosuppressant therapy (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Chitotriosidase proved to be a biomarker with good sensitivity and specificity that is easily detected in serum. It can be proposed in clinical practice to identify progressive patients requiring close follow-up, to detect relapses and to evaluate the effects of therapy.

### Interferon-inducible chemokines reflect severity and progression in sarcoidosis [^111p7VEF]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Identification of serum proteins that track with disease course in sarcoidosis may have clinical and pathologic importance. We previously identified up-regulated transcripts for interferon-inducible chemokines CXCL9, and CXCL10, in blood of sarcoidosis patients compared to controls. The objective of this study was to determine whether proteins encoded by these transcripts were elevated in serum and identified patients with remitting vs. chronic progressive sarcoidosis longitudinally.

Methods

Serum levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and proteins associated with inflammation and/or disease activity (sIL2R, ACE, ESR and CRP) were measured in a prospective cohort of sarcoidosis subjects and controls. Comparisons were made between groups and clinical course using pulmonary function measures and a severity score developed by Wasfi et al.

Results

In a cross-sectional analysis of 36 non-immunosuppressed sarcoidosis subjects, serum CXCL9, CXCL10, and sIL2R were significantly elevated compared to 46 controls (p < 0.0001). CXCL9 and CXCL10 were strongly inter-correlated (p = 0.0009). CXCL10 and CXCL9 were inversely correlated with FVC% predicted and DLCO% predicted, respectively. CXCL10 and CXCL9 significantly correlated with sarcoidosis severity score. sIL2R, ESR, CRP, and ACE serum levels did not correlate with pulmonary function measures or severity score. In the longitudinal analysis of 26 subjects, changes in serum CXCL10 level over time corresponded with progression versus remission of disease.

Conclusions

Interferon-γ–inducible chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, are elevated in sarcoidosis and inter-correlated with each other. Chemokine levels correlated with measures of disease severity. Serial measurements of CXCL10 corresponded to clinical course.

### ACE I / D-corrected Z-scores to identify normal and elevated ACE activity in sarcoidosis [^115Hf4oz]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The value of elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the diagnosis and follow-up in sarcoidosis is a matter of ongoing debate. This may be at least related to the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in the ACE gene (ACE I/D). ACE activity is influenced by the ACE I/D polymorphism. As a consequence, the use of one reference interval instead of three genotype-specific reference intervals for ACE activity may lead to a less precise interpretation of ACE activity.

Methods

In order to assess whether determination of ACE activity indeed requires the ACE I/D genotype to be taken into account, we established ACE I/D-corrected reference intervals in healthy, Caucasian volunteers (n = 200). In addition, ACE activities in ACE I/D genotyped patients suspected of or having sarcoidosis (n = 129) were expressed as the Z-score related to ACE I/D-corrected reference intervals.

Results

Comparison of the Z-score with ACE activity in which ACE I/D is ignored rendered 8.5% misclassification of 'elevated' versus 'normal' ACE or vice versa.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate a convenient way to circumvent the use of three reference intervals by introducing a Z-score for ACE activity. It also illustrates the need to re-investigating the possible clinical value of serum ACE activity in sarcoidosis by considering ACE I/D.

### Is there a uniform approach to the management of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) in the UK? A national benchmarking exercise [^116jLcp4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study has revealed some significant differences amongst UK pulmonologists in their approach to managing three common scenarios in DPLD. In case 1, half of respondents would institute treatment with a variety of immunosuppressants while a half would simply observe. The BTS guidelines recommend prednisolone in relapsing pulmonary sarcoidosis and state that other anti-inflammatory agents should be reserved for patients who cannot take steroids, with chloroquine and methotrexate being the preferred agents. The ATS guidelines advocate the use of corticosteroids for patients with persistent pulmonary infiltrates and decline in spirometry, with antimalarials and cytotoxic agents for those requiring long term steroid therapy. Azathioprine was the preferred immunosuppressant after prednisolone in our survey. This may reflect the results of trials published since the guidelines. Since the ATS/ERS/WASOG guidelines, many now regard azathioprine and methotrexate to be the recommended alternatives to prednisolone.

There was no consensus on when to repeat lung function or chest radiograph (the guidelines do not give recommended time intervals for these) for case 1. Interestingly, nearly fifty per cent of all respondents said they would use serum ACE to monitor disease activity. Serum ACE is elevated in approximately 60% of patients with sarcoidosis, but levels do not correlate with stage or prognosis. The BTS guidelines do not recommend routine measurement of serum ACE due to its poor sensitivity and specificity. In the ATS guidelines, serum ACE can be used as a marker of disease activity, but no opinion on its use is given, only that it is never diagnostic on its own. The ATS guidelines recommend following up patients with Stages II – IV at least three to six months, with physical examination, chest radiograph and lung function tests. The British guidelines to not give any advice as to when to follow up these patients, but it also recommends the use of chest radiographs and spirometry to monitor progress. Routine use of CT scanning is not recommended for sarcoidosis, but should be used in for patients with atypical clinical history or chest radiographs and to detect complications such as bronchiectasis and fibrosis.

### Usefulness of combined measurement of serum soluble IL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the detection of uveitis associated with Japanese sarcoidosis [^114oWTnk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

PIOL may masquerade as chronic posterior uveitis or panuveitis, with signs such as vitreous infiltration, retinal vasculitis, or multifocal chorioretinitis,–sometimes resembling those of sarcoid uveitis. In this study, the proportion of patients with high levels of sIL-2R was significantly lower in patients with PIOL (16.7%) than in patients with sarcoid uveitis (69.2%) (P = 0.002, Table 3). The median sIL-2R level was lower in patients with PIOL than in those with sarcoid uveitis (476.1 U/mL vs 834.5 U/mL) (Table 3 and Figure 1). There was no correlation between serum sIL-2R and ACE levels in patients with PIOL (Figure 3B). Furthermore, both sIL-2R and ACE did not correlate with the IL-10/IL-6 ratio in patients with PIOL. In general, serum sIL-2R levels tend to be higher in patients with malignant lymphoma than in those with lung sarcoidosis. It was reported from Japan that sIL-2R levels ranged 195–3750 U/mL in patients with lung sarcoidosis and 240–62,300 U/mL in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and that sIL-2R levels in patients with lymphoma (stage III or IV) were significantly higher than those in patients with sarcoidosis. It is, therefore, possible that intraocular lesions in patients with PIOL are too small and limited to high serum sIL-2R levels, as compared to patients with sarcoid uveitis who have extraocular involvement, such as those in the present study. Since serum sIL-2R levels reflected overall disease activity or extent of disease in sarcoidosis, in this study, patients with lung lesions or with more than three organ lesions tended to have higher sIL-2R levels. Although the sIL-2R levels may not tend to increase in malignant lymphoma when lesions are restricted to the eyes, it is still difficult to distinguish sarcoid uveitis and PIOL simply from sIL-2R levels. Meanwhile, it is known that serum ACE levels tend to be within the normal range or lower in patients with malignant lymphoma, and none of our PIOL patients showed elevated ACE levels in this study. Therefore, serum ACE, thanks to its extremely high specificity, is still considered a good marker to distinguish sarcoidosis from PIOL. It is a fact that the necessity of cytodiagnosis of vitreous biopsy for differentiating PIOL from uveitis is established. Allowing that our results are preliminary and that the role of serum ACE and/or sIL-2R in differentiating between sarcoid uveitis and PIOL is limited, these conditions might initially warrant suspicion of sarcoidosis, especially in cases without lung lesions.

### Cerebrospinal fluid B-cell activating factor levels as a novel biomarker in patients with neurosarcoidosis [^112AeRXv]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Neurosarcoidosis (NS) is a severe complication of sarcoidosis. Patients with NS often have poor outcomes. To improve both the quality of life and prognosis in patients with NS, accurate and reliable methods for early diagnosis and determining the efficacy of treatment are needed. This study aims to investigate B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and elucidate the relationship between CSF BAFF levels and various parameters of NS.

Methods

We studied 20 patients with NS and 14 control subjects. We measured CSF BAFF levels in all subjects and investigated the relationship with clinical findings, serum and CSF measures, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

Results

CSF BAFF levels were significantly increased in patients with NS compared with controls (median 0.089 vs 0.04 ng/mL, p = 0.0005). CSF BAFF values were correlated with CSF findings-cell count, protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and immunoglobulin G-but not with serum parameters. CSF BAFF levels were especially higher in patients with abnormal intraparenchymal lesions of the brain and abnormal spinal MRI findings. CSF BAFF levels decreased significantly after immunosuppressive therapy.

Conclusion

CSF BAFF may aid the quantitative evaluation of NS and may serve as a biomarker for this disease.

### Predictive potential of ACE phenotyping in extrapulmonary sarcoidosis [^117DcBXR]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We performed complete ACE phenotyping in 120 plasma samples from pulmonary clinic patients with interstitial lung disease. Because we previously established a normal range of ACE levels (based on ACE phenotyping of 300 unrelated patients (healthy personnel), which varies threefold in the tested population: ranged between 50–150% from control pooled plasma, we found that 31 patients could be considered as possible candidates for systemic sarcoidosis based only on ACE levels. However, an application of conformational fingerprinting allowed us to identify another set of 22 patients based on another parameter of ACE phenotype (ratio of ACE immunoreactive protein (with mAb 9B9) to ACE activity.

Our approach incorporates multiple parameters to characterize serum ACE in clinically-relevant ways. These parameters include (1) combination of ACE activity determination with two substrates; (2) quantification of ACE immunoreactive ACE protein with a set of mAbs to ACE; and (3) estimation of ACE conformation in each individual.

To summarize the potential clinical importance of these parameters, the ACE fingerprinting approach provides a relatively noninvasive way through blood sampling to eliminate sarcoidosis from consideration in selected patients with elevated ACE levels, as well as detect the presence of sarcoidosis in patients in whom low total ACE levels (often genetically determined) may result in the appropriate diagnosis not being considered. It also provides information useful for identifying systemic sarcoidosis in some patients, thus preventing them from undergoing more invasive (e.g. biopsy) and/or expensive testing (e.g. PET). Because some extrapulmonary manifestations (especially cardiac and neurologic) are associated with higher mortality and/or more severe morbidity than pulmonary sarcoidosis alone, early detection is an important clinical goal. Thus, this comprehensive approach advances precision medicine in sarcoidosis by providing a noninvasive and relatively low cost method for detecting sarcoidosis patients with low total ACE levels, screening for mutations that result in markedly elevated ACE levels in the absence of sarcoidosis, and also identification of patients with systemic sarcoidosis involvement. As a result, the ACE phenotyping method has the potential add significant value very early in the evaluation process for patients with suspected sarcoidosis. If utility and accuracy is confirmed in additional studies, we propose it be added to the algorithm for sarcoidosis evaluation as early as the first clinical visit in which sarcoidosis is suspected.

### Chitotriosidase: a biomarker of activity and severity in patients with sarcoidosis [^115ZPQm5]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Comparison of chitotriosidase activity in steroid-free and treated sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls. Data expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

In sarcoidosis patients, chitotriosidase activity and ACE concentrations were directly correlated (r = 0.34, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2). No significant differences were found in chitotriosidase activity according to sex, smoking status, age and comorbidities. Regarding specific symptoms, exertional dyspnea (t = 2.714; p = 0.0068) and cough were associated with higher chitotriosidase activity, however the latter was only statistically significant in steroid-free patients (t = 2.287; p = 0.0281).

Fig. 2
Correlation between chitotriosidase activity and ACE levels in the sarcoidosis cohort (n = 669) (R = 0.3513, p < 0.0001). Pearson's correlation coefficient

Pulmonary function parameters did not significantly correlate with chitotriodase activity; however, stratifying patients according to specific patterns of alterations at PFTs (obstructive, restrictive or mixed respiratory defect), we observed that restrictive patients and those with reduced DLCO (TLC below the 5th percentile of the predicted value or DLCO < 75% of predicted) showed higher chitotriosidase activity (204 ± 305 vs 157 ± 242 nmol/ml/h, t = 2.180, p = 0.0296 and 310.8 ± 188 vs 162 ± 174 nmol/ml/h, t = 2.682, p = 0.0076, respectively). Chitotriosidase showed a significant correlation with CPI index as well (r = 0.09434, p = 0.0199).

Second line therapy approach included the use of methotrexate in 42 patients as steroid-sparing agent (27 patients) or as steroid resistant second-line treatment (15 patients): no differences of chitrotriosidase expression were found among these subgroups.

### 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, is increased in the expired breath condensate of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis [^1136171Z]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

8-Isoprostane is considered an index of oxidative stress. Measurement of 8-isoprostane in the expired breath condensate, a totally noninvasive method, has not been used to explore the level of inflammation in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Therefore, the aim of our study was to measure the levels of 8-isoprostane in the expired breath condensate of patients with sarcoidosis, and to investigate the relation of 8-isoprostane level to disease activity.

Patients

We investigated 30 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis (active disease, n = 14; nonactive disease, n = 16) and 12 healthy subjects as control group.

Methods

8-Isoprostane was measured in the expired breath condensate of all subjects, and its levels were compared between the control and sarcoidosis groups as well as between the subgroups of patients with active and nonactive disease. In the group with sarcoidosis, 8-isoprostane levels were further correlated with markers that may reflect disease activity, such as serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (sACE) level, serum calcium level, and pulmonary function test results.

Results

The concentration of 8-isoprostane was increased in patients with sarcoidosis compared to control subjects (mean, 64.23 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval, 37.00 to 91.46 pg/mL; vs mean, 20.75 pg/mL; 95% CI, 16.06 to 25.44 pg/mL; p = 0.04). The difference was primarily due to the patients with active disease, who had significantly higher levels of 8-isoprostane (mean, 111.4 pg/mL; 95% CI, 62.56 to 160.30 pg/mL; p < 0.001) compared to patients with nonactive disease (mean, 22.94 pg/mL; 95% CI, 15.89 to 29.99 pg/mL) or healthy subjects. 8-Isoprostane levels in patients with nonactive disease did not differ from those in healthy subjects (p > 0.05). In the patients with sarcoidosis, 8-isoprostane levels were positively correlated with sACE level (p < 0.0001, r = 0.69), but was not correlated with serum calcium level or pulmonary function test values.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that 8-isoprostane levels are increased in the expired breath condensate of patients with sarcoidosis and might serve as an index of disease activity.

### SACE and IL-2R as serum biomarkers for evaluation of multi-organ involvement and prognosis of sarcoidosis [^116uGkpZ]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum biomarkers in the evaluation of organ involvement and prognostic monitoring of sarcoidosis have not been determined. The purpose of this study was to identify common biomarkers that could be used to assess organ involvement and monitor outcomes in sarcoidosis patients.

Methods

From Mar 2013 to Sep 2021, patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary sarcoidosis were enrolled in this study in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. The information from medical records was retrospectively collected including diagnosis, organ involvement, laboratory tests and follow up data. Differences of continuous variables between groups were analyzed by unpaired Student's t-test. Multivariate logistic regression model was performed to identify potential independent factors associated with multiple organ involvement.

Results

A total of 832 patients were included in the study. There were 339 (40.7%) patients with single organ pulmonary involvement, while 493 (59.3%) patients had two to seven organs involved. Among the routine serum tests, only the serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE) level was an independent factor of multiple organ involvement. Compared to those patients without involvement, SACE levels were higher in patients with extra-thoracic lymph node, skin, or spleen involvement as well as abnormal calcium metabolism. Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) levels were higher in patients with extra-thoracic lymph node, spleen involvement and abnormal calcium metabolism than in those without it. The mean levels of SACE and IL-2R showed upward trends paralleling the increase on number of organs involved. In follow up, SACE and IL-2R levels were both decreased in an improved patient group, while there was no obvious difference was noticed before and after treatment in patients with persistent disease.

Conclusion

SACE and IL-2R were useful as serum biomarkers in the initial evaluation of organ involvement as well as monitoring prognosis in sarcoidosis.

### SACE and IL-2R as serum biomarkers for evaluation of multi-organ involvement and prognosis of sarcoidosis [^113GVsRi]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

IL-2R was expressed on the cell surface by the activation of T helper cells in granulomatous inflammation sites. Subsequently, the soluble IL-2R molecules fall off and enter the microcirculation. IL-2R reflects the activity of the T-helper cell component and may play a role to assess disease activity and prognosticate. Reithmann et al. suggested the IL-2R was superior to SACE in detecting the inflammatory activity of cardiac sarcoidosis patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

Other investigators found IL-2R was a good biomarker to identify multiple organs involvement or extrapulmonary disease in sarcoidosis patients. Consistent with these previous small sample research, our study confirmed the serum IL-2R level in multiple organ involvement group was significantly higher than that in single organ involvement. and showed IL-2R level was correlated well with the number of organs involved for sarcoidosis patients. There were few studies about biomarkers and specific organ involvement. In this study, correlation between IL-2 level and extra-thoracic lymph node, spleen involvement and abnormal calcium metabolism had been revealed.

SACE and IL-2R may be useful in disease monitoring. The present study demonstrates that SACE levels and IL-2R levels had a significantly decline between baseline and follow-up in an improved group, while there was no significant difference in levels from a persistently active group, regardless of treatment status. Reports suggest that with spontaneous disease resolution or therapeutic control in patients receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppression elevated SACE levels normalize. The fall of SACE with therapy may be due to resolution of disease or direct suppression of SACE by corticosteroids. Schimmelpennink et al. suggested high levels of sIL-2R might serve as a prognostic biomarker for chronic sarcoidosis. The positive correlation between the decline of SACE or IL-2R levels and the state of disease remission has been revealed in this study, strengthening the viewpoint that these two biomarkers may reflect the granuloma burden or activity in sarcoidosis.

There were several limitations in this study. First, this study was retrospectively conducted in a single pulmonary hospital and may be not representative of other sarcoidosis cohorts. Virtually all patients were diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Hence the findings may not extrapolate to other single sites of granulomatous sarcoid inflammation such as eye, heart, or nervous system. Second, the follow-up population size was relatively small. Finally, we did not examine the polymorphism of ACE or IL-2R in the patients. Therefore, prospective and multicenter studies are necessary to obtain results with higher evidence-based grade.

### The serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme levels in patients with ocular involvement of autoimmune and infectious diseases [^1128Z725]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Increased serum levels of angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme are considered as inflammatory markers for diagnosis of sarcoidosis which is an autoimmune inflammatory disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of differences in serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme levels of patients with ocular involvement of other autoimmune inflammatory and infectious diseases.

Methods

This is a prospective study involving patients with ankylosing spondylitis, behcet's disease, presumed sarcoidosis, presumed latent tuberculosis, presumed latent syphilis, and control group. The serum levels of angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bonnferoni analysis was used to assess pairwise comparisons between the groups.

Results

There was a significant increase in serum angiotensin converting enzyme level in patients with presumed sarcoidosis compared to ankylosing spondylitis (p = 0.0001), behcet's disease (p = 0.0001), presumed latent tuberculosis (p = 0.0001), presumed latent syphilis (p = 0.0001), and control group (p = 0.0001). The increase in serum lysozyme level was significant for patients with presumed sarcoidosis with respect to ankylosing spondylitis (p = 0.0001), behcet's disease, (p = 0.0001) presumed latent tuberculosis (p = 0.001), presumed latent syphilis (p = 0.033), and control group (p = 0.0001).

Conclusion

Elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels are significant for patients with presumed sarcoidosis compared to ocular involvement of other autoimmune diseases such as behcet's disease and ankylosing spondylitis, and ocular involvement of infectious diseases such as presumed latent tuberculosis and presumed latent syphilis. However, elevated serum lysozyme level might be also detected in ocular involvement of infectious diseases such as presumed latent tuberculosis and presumed latent syphilis.

### The serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme levels in patients with ocular involvement of autoimmune and infectious diseases [^114nv8rX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies have demonstrated the correlations of serum levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines with serum ACE and lysozyme activities in patients with ocular and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), also known as monokine induced by gamma interferon, (MIG) and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) also known as interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) have been reported to induce the recruitment of activated T helper (Th1) cells. Serum levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 have been correlated with serum ACE levels in presumed ocular sarcoidosis. Interleukin 12 (IL-12) p40, an essential component of IL-12 has been reported to induce differentiation of naïve Th cells into Th1 cells. Serum concentrations of IL-12 p40 have been found significantly higher in pulmonary sarcoidosis than healthy subjects and have been correlated with serum levels of ACE and lysozyme. This study compares for the first time the serum ACE and lysozyme levels of patients diagnosed with ocular involvement of autoimmune diseases such as AS, BD and presumed sarcoidosis and ocular involvement of infectious diseases such as presumed latent TB and presumed latent syphilis. Intraocular inflammation compatible with sarcoidosis associated with elevated serum ACE levels is considered suggestive for diagnosis of presumptive sarcoidosis in patients without having a tissue biopsy. The serum ACE level is disclosed higher in children than in adults. The World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous disorders (WASOG) considered an increased ACE might help in diagnosis of sarcoidosis in children. The age range in sarcoidosis group in our study is between 10 and 72 with a mean age of 41. The estimated mean level of serum ACE of our patients with presumed sarcoidosis is 58.274 IU/L which is above the normal adult range of 8–52 IU/L. Serum ACE level has been compared between patients having sarcoidosis and sarcoidosis-like lung diseases including TB, fibrosing alveolitis, histiocytosis X, and pneumoconiosis. Rise of serum ACE activity has been found in 93% of patients with active sarcoidosis, 41% of patients with TB and 56% of patients with nonspecific inflammatory lung diseases including fibrosing alveolitis, histiocytosis X, and pneumoconiosis. Serum ACE level has not been studied before in the ocular involvement of presumed latent TB. Our study revealed the estimated marginal mean of serum ACE level in patients with presumed latent TB as 32.500 U/L. Pairwise comparison of serum ACE levels between patients with presumed latent TB and presumed sarcoidosis disclosed a statistically significant difference for patients with presumed sarcoidosis with respect to presumed latent TB (p = 0.0001). There was also no significant difference of elevated serum ACE levels between patients with presumed latent TB and control group (p = 0.204).

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism in relation to HLA-DR in sarcoidosis [^112FCNdd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate if an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene associates with HLA-DR alleles previously found to be of prognostic interest in Scandinavian sarcoidosis patients. This may contribute to characteristics associated with these HLA-DR alleles, such as a good (DR17) or poor (DR14 or 15) prognosis. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND SUBJECTS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for analysing an I/D polymorphism in the gene coding for ACE in 138 subjects; 65 controls and 73 sarcoidosis patients, and for HLA-DR genotyping 67 patients. Serum ACE level (S-ACE) was measured in all controls and 72 patients. Sixty-one patients were classified as chronic or nonchronic after 2 years follow-up. All patients were recruited and followed at our outpatient clinic.

Results

No significant differences in ACE alleles or genotypes were seen between controls and patients or between patients positive and negative for DR17 or DR14/15. The ACE genotype did not differ between nonchronic and chronic patients. The ACE genotype tended to influence the S-ACE in patients, whilst in controls S-ACE significantly differed between the ACE genotypes.

Conclusion

This study does not support an association between ACE genotype and sarcoidosis or disease outcome. However, because significantly (P < 0.001) more DR17 positive (17 of 19) than DR14/15 positive (seven of 26) patients were classified as nonchronic, these results instead strengthen the prognostic importance of HLA-DR alleles in Scandinavian sarcoidosis patients.

### Predictive potential of ACE phenotyping in extrapulmonary sarcoidosis [^115qkmNi]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

During 30 years of intensive study of the ACE protein, we have generated a unique set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to more than 40 different epitopes on the N- and C-domains of human ACE. Localization of the epitopes of all these mAbs on the ACE molecule (epitope mapping) have allowed us to identify and map critical functional regions of this essential enzyme and to establish the novel approach for ACE studies — conformational fingerprinting of ACE.

We also demonstrated that local conformation of ACE is organ- and tissue-specific due to differential glycosylation of the ACE protein. More specifically, this unique set of mAbs can help to distinguish ACE origin from different organs or tissues.

Since some reports indicate that sarcoidosis is increasing in frequency, possibly due to industrial contamination, it is likely that accurate quantitative determination of ACE in the blood will be even more clinically useful. Given that the lung (the primary organ for sarcoidosis involvement) has relatively tighter endothelial cells junctions in its capillaries, we have hypothesized that elevated blood ACE originates primarily from extrapulmonary granulomas residing in organs with fenestrated or discontinuous capillaries. Therefore, elevated serum levels of ACE are more likely to reflect extrapulmonary sarcoidosis involvement. We have established a novel approach, blood ACE phenotyping, for the purpose of full characterization of ACE in plasma or serum.

In the current study, we applied this approach to characterize ACE status in patients with interstitial lung diseases and identified patients who have ACE in their blood originating not only from endothelial capillaries (mostly lung), as in healthy individuals, but also ACE from other sources (macrophages and dendritic cells of granulomas). Therefore, we believe that our method allows for the noninvasive detection of patients with systemic sarcoidosis.

### Pruritic, erythematous, arcuate, and serpiginous smooth plaques [^112R8QUn]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which lab test can be used to monitor treatment response?
A. Rapid plasma reagin
B. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG)
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay

Answers:

A. Rapid plasma regain – Correct. Nontreponemal tests such as rapid plasma regain, venereal disease research laboratory, and toluidine red unheated serum tests are traditionally used as initial screening tests but also as the main way of monitoring a patient's response to treatment due to their quantitative results. Successful therapy will be indicated by a decline in antibody titers.
B. FTA-ABS – Incorrect. FTA-ABS is a qualitative treponemal test, thus providing no useful tracking of treatment response. The FTA-ABS assay is thought to be most sensitive in primary syphilis.
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels – Incorrect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels correlate with disease severity and activity in response to treatment in sarcoidosis, not syphilis.
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG) – Incorrect. The T. pallidum enzyme immunoassay is also a treponemal test that has become a favorite of large laboratories as a screening test due to its lower cost compared with the others.
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay – Incorrect. The chemiluminescence immunoassay is also a treponemal test. All treponemal tests are based upon the detection of antibodies directed against specific treponemal antigens and thus tend to be more specific than nontreponemal tests.

### The role of PET in the management of sarcoidosis [^114GJmqZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CORRELATION OF PET WITH BIOMARKERS

Ideally, there would exist a single serological, physiological or imaging marker, which has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, prognosis, severity, and medication response. However, the exact pathophysiology of sarcoidosis has been elusive with no single pathognomonic finding that can pinpoint the diagnosis or prognosis. Nevertheless, serological and imaging findings are correlated, which suggest that measuring various serological biomarkers can complement PET. A prospective study, which enrolled 30 patients with untreated sarcoidosis measured various biomarkers including soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), C-reactive protein (CRP), ACE, and urine calcium in addition to splenic FDG uptake on PET and found that there was a significant linear correlation between sIL-2R and SUVmax on PET. It has also been shown that a reduction in absolute peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is associated with increased PET activity and possibly serves as a proxy for inflammatory activity. A less commonly known laboratory marker, serum chitotriosidase, was found to be significantly correlated with PET activity whereas no correlation was found with ACE.

Being able to correlate PET results with data from pulmonary function test (PFT) could allow clinicians to monitor progression of disease. PFT results do not allow clinicians to differentiate between irreversible parenchymal damage or reversible inflammation. Multiple measurements are often needed to assess trends to ensure that declines are related to disease activity rather than changes in technique or effort. Individuals with parenchymal lung disease on PET will likely have a decline in gas exchange if the disease is not treated. And intuitively, when individuals with parenchymal disease receive therapy, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) improve significantly. In patients undergoing treatment with infliximab, the change in the SUVmax after starting therapy has been shown to correlate with the change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 but not with DLCO.

Additional studies are needed to provide evidence on the utility of biomarkers before performing or supplementing PET to determine the impact of biomarkers on the management of sarcoidosis.

### Use of likelihood ratios improves interpretation of laboratory testing for pulmonary sarcoidosis [^112MWuJx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests for pulmonary sarcoidosis (percentage lymphocytes and CD4/CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity) lack sensitivity and specificity. In a retrospective study of 153 subjects under suspicion of pulmonary sarcoidosis (36 cases and 117 patients with other diseases [control patients]), we defined likelihood ratios (LRs) for rationally selected result intervals of these tests, which improve clinical interpretation as compared with dichotomous interpretation based on a single cutoff value. By using logistic regression analysis, we further integrated the 3 individual tests into a unified algorithm that could rule out diagnosis in 57 (48.7%) of the 177 control subjects and confirm diagnosis in 12 (33%) of the 36 pulmonary sarcoidosis cases. We conclude that use of LRs improves interpretation of laboratory tests for pulmonary sarcoidosis. In addition, we present a prediction algorithm based on the combination of laboratory tests that helps clinicians confirm or exclude diagnosis in almost half of the study population.

### Usefulness of combined measurement of serum soluble IL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the detection of uveitis associated with Japanese sarcoidosis [^112cD4cr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is reported that chest radiography combined with serum sIL-2R or ACE improved specificity, as compared to the measurements of serum sIL-2R alone. In this study, 86.5% of the patients with sarcoid uveitis had lung lesions, and serum sIL-2R levels tended to be higher in patients who had lung lesions as compared to those without lung lesions. Although we focused on blood biomarkers in the current study, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis can be more supported by the presence of lung lesions, in addition to high levels of these markers.

The limitations of this study include the small number of patients in each subgroup and its retrospective, single-center design. Longitudinal measurement with a larger number of patients and multiple centers will be required to confirm our results.

In summary, this study demonstrates that while serum ACE remains a good marker in the differentiation of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis from non-sarcoid uveitis and PIOL because of its high specificity, the combined measurement of both serum sIL-2R and ACE levels offers higher sensitivity and might be more useful than the measurement of serum ACE levels alone in the detection of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis.

### ACE inhibitor in the treatment of cutaneous and lymphatic sarcoidosis [^116fprKx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme is used as a marker for sarcoid activity. We describe a case of remission of cutaneous and lymphatic sarcoidosis in a patient treated with an ACE inhibitor for congestive heart failure and hypertension; the remission has continued over 4 years of follow-up. Because this is a report of only one case, there is a possibility of sampling error. Whether the patient's remission in this case was a serendipitous spontaneous remission that happened to occur during ACE inhibitor therapy or whether ACE inhibitor therapy can play a role in the treatment of sarcoidosis needs to be determined in a large clinical trial.

Patients and methods

Study design and patients

We conducted an observational, monocentric, retrospective study in the Internal Medicine Department of Bordeaux University Hospital. The study population comprised patients who had undergone flexible bronchoscopy with BAL in the preceding decade. The inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of sarcoidosis by immunological analysis of BAL fluid. The exclusion criteria were diagnosis of sarcoidosis before BAL, no immunological analysis of BAL fluid, or a diagnosis other than sarcoidosis.

Data collection

Anonymised data on sex, age at BAL, clinical signs, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were retrospectively extracted from the electronic medical records. We also evaluated the plasma level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the phenotypes of B and T cells in peripheral blood. Therapeutic interventions after BAL and the diagnosis of sarcoidosis were documented, including steroids, methotrexate, TNF inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide.

### Elevated serum BAFF levels in patients with sarcoidosis: association with disease activity [^116TXSTw]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine serum levels of B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) and its clinical association in patients with sarcoidosis. METHODS; Serum levels of BAFF from 37 patients and 21 healthy subjects were examined by ELISA. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme and IFN-γ levels in sarcoidosis patients were also measured. Isolated monocytes cultured with IFN-γ, IL-4 or IL-10 and their expression of membrane and soluble BAFF were analysed by flow cytometry or ELISA. Peripheral B cell subsets were analysed by flow cytometry. BAFF expression in the granuloma of the skin was examined by immunohistochemistry. ANAs were determined by indirect IF using HEp-2 cells as a substrate.

Results

Serum BAFF levels were significantly elevated in sarcoidosis patients when compared with healthy controls. The frequency of skin and eye involvement was significantly higher in patients with elevated serum BAFF than in patients with normal levels. Serum BAFF levels were correlated with serum levels of ACE, lysozyme and IFN-γ. Immunostaining of anti-BAFF in the skin revealed BAFF expression by epithelioid cells of granuloma. In vitro, IFN-γ induced membrane-bound BAFF expression on monocytes and secretion of soluble BAFF by isolated monocytes. In the peripheral blood, sarcoidosis patients showed increased naïve B cells with a reciprocal decrease in memory B cells and plasmablasts. Seventeen of 26 (65%) sarcoidosis patients exhibited ANA positivity.

Conclusion

Serum BAFF levels can be used as a surrogate marker of disease activity in sarcoidosis patients. Increased BAFF may be related to the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117Nt52a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized but is based on three major criteria: a compatible clinical presentation, finding nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in one or more tissue samples, and the exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous disease. There are no universally accepted measures to determine if each diagnostic criterion has been satisfied; therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure. Methods: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize the best available evidence. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Recommendations for or against various diagnostic tests were formulated and graded after the expert panel weighed desirable and undesirable consequences, certainty of estimates, feasibility, and acceptability. Results: The clinical presentation, histopathology, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses were summarized. On the basis of the available evidence, the expert committee made 1 strong recommendation for baseline serum calcium testing, 13 conditional recommendations, and 1 best practice statement. All evidence was very low quality. Conclusions: The panel used systematic reviews of the evidence to inform clinical recommendations in favor of or against various diagnostic tests in patients with suspected or known sarcoidosis. The evidence and recommendations should be revisited as new evidence becomes available.

### The serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme levels in patients with ocular involvement of autoimmune and infectious diseases [^115ud4ep]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is an important hormonal system which promotes inflammation through the axis of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin peptides-distinct receptor subtypes. Hyperactivation of the RAS system has been disclosed to involve in inflammatory responses of the eye. Increased serum ACE activity has been reported especially in uveitis associated with sarcoidosis, and also infectious uveitis such as recurrent toxoplasmic and toxocaral iridocyclitis and choroioretinitis. Lysozyme is an enzyme that hydrolyses glycosidic bonds, and it is revealed to degrade the peptidoglycans in the bacterial cell wall. Muramidase activity of lysozyme has been shown to limit the inflammation caused by rapidly degrading peptidoglycans at the site of infection. Elevated levels of serum lysozyme have been reported in granulomatous uveitis especially sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of differences in serum ACE and lysozyme levels of patients with ocular involvement of autoimmune diseases such as HLAB27 + ankylosing spondylitis (AS), HLAB51 + behcet's disease (BD) and presumed sarcoidosis and ocular involvement of infectious diseases such as QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold + presumed latent tuberculosis (TB) and presumed latent syphilis compared to control group by using pairwise comparisons between the groups.

### Childhood sarcoidosis: a rare but fascinating disorder [^113RMNAh]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

There is no laboratory test diagnostic of sarcoidosis. Laboratory evaluation may reveal elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or other acute phase reactants. Anemia, leukopenia, and eosinophilia are commonly seen on blood counts. Immunological abnormalities include hypergammaglobulinemia and impaired delayed hypersensitivity on skin testing. Hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria may be found. The serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is elevated in over 50% of children with late-onset sarcoidosis, but the test is not specific for sarcoidosis, and many other disorders may be similarly associated with increased serum ACE activity.

The source of serum ACE in sarcoidosis is believed to be epitheloid cells in granulomata. ACE serum levels have been shown to be useful in diagnosing sarcoidosis and following disease activity and the effect of therapy in older children with sarcoidosis. Reference values for serum ACE is age-dependent and healthy children have ACE levels that are 40–50% higher than in adults.

Chest radiograph is very useful and may reveal bilateral hilar adenopathy. Because alveolitis precedes granuloma formation in the lungs and is the earliest sign of activity in pulmonary sarcoidosis, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed through a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope has been used to assess that activity. BAL typically demonstrates an increased number of lymphocytes, most of which are activated helper-inducer T lymphocytes, which can cause the CD4/CD8 ratio to be high. However, in children BAL lymphocytosis does not correlate with disease activity, treatment response or prognosis. Therefore, serial BAL is not routinely recommended in pulmonary sarcoidosis in children. High-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) can be helpful in delineating the extent of parenchymal disease and hilar adenopathy. Although fibrotic lung disease is a rare consequence of childhood sarcoidosis, follow-up with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) is useful in detecting it. Other studies such as gallium-scan, have not proven to have clear prognostic benefits. Another emerging tool that is been used mainly in detecting metastatic cancer is positron emession tomography (PET scan). A recent study determined that PET scan does not allow differentiation of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) from a non-IPF pulmonary diseases including sarcoidosis.

### CTAS: a CT score to quantify disease activity in pulmonary sarcoidosis [^114oZwgu]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A major gap in the management of sarcoidosis is the lack of accessible and objective methods to measure disease activity. Since 90% of patients have pulmonary involvement, we explored if a disease activity score based on thoracic CT scans could address this clinical issue.

Methods

High-resolution CT scans from 100 consecutive patients with sarcoidosis at a regional sarcoidosis service were scored for extent of CT abnormalities known to relate to granuloma or lymphocytic infiltration from published CT-pathological studies. These individual abnormality scores were then correlated against serum ACE, sIL-2R and change in FVC to identify CT abnormalities that reflect contemporaneous disease activity. The sum of these scores, or CT A ctivity S core (CTAS), was then validated against FVC response to treatment.

Findings

CT extent scores for nodularity, ground-glass opacification, interlobular septal thickening and consolidation correlated significantly with at least one of the disease activity parameters and were used to form CTAS. CTAS was found to predict FVC response to treatment at 1 year and was highly reproducible between radiologists. An abbreviated CTAS (aCTAS), constructed from presence or absence of the four CT abnormalities, also showed significant correlation with FVC response to treatment. CTAS and aCTAS also correlated with response to treatment in the fibrotic subgroup.

Interpretation

CTAS provides a concept for an objective and reproducible CT scoring method to quantify disease activity in sarcoidosis. The score can potentially be used to stratify patients according to disease activity, determine response to treatment and establish if fibrotic sarcoidosis is active.

### Randomised, placebo-controlled trial of dexamethasone for quality of life in pulmonary sarcoidosis [^112xCqWb]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis experience reduced quality of life. Although oral corticosteroids are the most common agents used in sarcoidosis, very little is known on the effects on quality of life.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, newly diagnosed patients without an indication for high dose immunosuppressive therapy were randomised to once-daily dexamethasone 1 mg (6.5 mg prednisone equivalent) or placebo for 6 months. The primary study parameter was the subscale physical functioning of the 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36). Secondary parameters included five other patient reported outcome measures, disease activity markers and plasma cytokine profiles.

Results

A total of 16 patients was randomised to dexamethasone (n = 7) and placebo (n = 9). During follow-up no significant difference for physical functioning was measured (p = 0.18). Dexamethasone treated patients showed a decrease in fatigue score (Checklist Individual Strength) from 106 (baseline) to 88 (3 months; p = 0.03); 86 (6 months; p = 0.05); 79 (9 months; p = 0.04); 90 (12 months; p = 0.03). Placebo treated patients showed no change: 96 (baseline) to 105 (3 months; p = 0.16); 91 (6 months; p = 0.48); 92 (9 months; p = 0.61); 95 (12 months; p = 0.90). During treatment with dexamethasone significant improvements in the SF-36 subscales vitality and pain, and a significant reduction in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels and serum cytokines and chemokines were measured.

Conclusions

Low-dose dexamethasone results in a reduction of the inflammatory profile and has the potential to improve quality of life parameters and fatigue.

### First patient-centred set of outcomes for pulmonary sarcoidosis: a multicentre initiative [^113mzGb8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Tier 1: outcome measures 1, 2 and 3: health status (survival and degree of health)

Survival at 1 and 5 years after the diagnosis is an important outcome (outcome measure 1), especially for patients with advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis. Survival is measured as all-cause mortality, calculated from clinical and administrative data sources. Sarcoidosis-related mortality is reported to be up to 7.6% in a US-based population. Most deaths are due to pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, neurological and cardiac involvement.

Outcome measure 2 is pulmonary function (FVC, FEV 1 and DLCO c), which is widely used to monitor disease progression. Currently, serial FVC is considered as the best endpoint to monitor during the course of care for pulmonary sarcoidosis.

Finally, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was selected as outcome measure 3. SIL-2R is considered to be a marker of T-cell activation. A shortcoming of this outcome is the fact that it is not routinely measured and implemented in all the collaborating expert clinics. Furthermore, there are conflicting data regarding the correlation between sIL-2R level changes and respective treatment response. However, it outperforms conventional biomarkers such as ACEand is cheaper and more widely available than sensitive tests like fluorodeoxyglucose PET.

Tier 2: outcome measure 4: recovery process (time to recovery, disutility of care)

The treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis aims at preventing a progressive disease pattern with organ failure. The clinical manifestations are widely variable, ranging from asymptomatic radiographic findings to a more chronic progressive disease pattern with multiple organ failure. However, complications due to the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis are also significant, such as adverse side effects due to high-dose and/or long-term prednisone use, excessive weight gain, risk of osteoporosis and fatigue. Globally, corticosteroids, such as prednisone, remain the mainstay of therapy in sarcoidosis. The initial recommended dose of prednisone is 20–40 mg/day, which should later be tapered down to a dose around or below the 10 mg/day. However, it remains debated whether prednisone therapy modifies long-term progression of the disease. We chose weight gain as a measure of disutility of care, outcome measure 4 in the outcome measures set.

### Predictive potential of ACE phenotyping in extrapulmonary sarcoidosis [^117Jg2by]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Results and discussion

Blood ACE phenotyping

Previously we developed a new approach to characterize blood ACE in individual patients–blood ACE phenotyping. This approach includes not just determination of ACE activity (with two substrates, ZPHL and HHL), but also determination of a novel kinetic parameter, the ratio of the rates of the hydrolysis of these two substrates (ZPHL/HHL ratio), which is able to control for the native state of the N and C domains of ACE active centers and to reveal the potentially complicating presence of ACE inhibitors. The third parameter is the concentration of ACE immunoreactive protein, and finally, the fourth and most sensitive approach is conformational fingerprinting of ACE using a set of anti-ACE mAbs showing subtle conformational changes in ACE surface topography.

Only 60% of patients with histologically proven pulmonary sarcoidosis have an elevated ACE level in the blood. We and others hypothesized that this group of patients with elevated blood ACE are more likely to have systemic sarcoidosis. Recently, we performed ACE phenotyping in 300 sera samples from individuals without known sarcoidosis or other pulmonary disease. Our results revealed substantial inter-individual variability of ACE levels (activity and level of immunoreactive ACE protein) characterized by a threefold difference, i.e. indicating that ACE levels in this normal population can be characterized as 100 + 25% (variability from 50 to 150%).

Based on these data and analysis of the existing literature, we propose that patients with elevated ACE activity (> 150%) may have systemic sarcoidosis.

In the current study, we performed ACE phenotyping in citrated plasma from 120 patients recruited from pulmonary clinics (Table 1) in order to characterize their ACE profiles more comprehensively (ACE activity, the kinetic characteristics, the amount of ACE immunoreactive protein, and ACE conformation). Sarcoidosis was diagnosed in 59 patients based upon histopathologic (morphologic) assessment of biopsy samples. In another 30 patients no biopsies were available, but the diagnosis of presumptive sarcoidosis was made based upon a combined assessment of clinical criteria, including chest CT imaging, whole body PET-CT, laboratory results, clinical manifestations, and course of the disease. At the time the plasma samples used in this study were obtained, these patients were being evaluated for the first time in the pulmonary referral clinic. None were receiving steroids or other immunosuppressant therapy at the time the samples were collected.

### 18F-FDG PET, genotype-corrected ACE and sIL-2R in newly diagnosed sarcoidosis [^115qTNSX]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) are serological markers, widely used for determining sarcoidosis activity. (18)F-FDG PET has proven to be a sensitive technique in the imaging of sarcoidosis. The aim of this study was to determine sensitivity of (18)F-FDG PET, genotype-corrected ACE and sIL-2R in active sarcoidosis as well as their correlation.

Methods

This retrospective study included 36 newly diagnosed, symptomatic sarcoidosis patients. ACE and sIL-2R levels were simultaneously obtained within 4 weeks of (18)F-FDG PET. ACE was corrected for genotype and expressed as Z-score. (18)F-FDG PET was visually evaluated and scored as positive or negative. Maximum and average standardized uptake values (SUV(max) and SUV(avg)) were compared with ACE and sIL-2R.

Results

(18)F-FDG PET was found positive in 34 of 36 patients (94%). Thirteen patients (36%) showed an increased ACE with the highest sensitivity found in patients with the I/I genotype (67%). Seventeen patients (47%) showed an increased sIL-2R. No correlation was found between SUV and ACE or sIL-2R. Increased ACE and sIL-2R correlated with a positive (18)F-FDG PET in 12 patients (92%) and 16 patients (94%), respectively.

Conclusion

(18)F-FDG PET is a very sensitive technique to assess active sarcoidosis, in contrast with ACE and sIL-2R, suggesting a pivotal role for (18)F-FDG PET in future sarcoidosis assessment.

### Increased circulating interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40 in pulmonary sarcoidosis [^116rkMCT]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

In sarcoidosis, a T helper 1 (Th1) response is an essential event and the up-regulation of interleukin-12 (IL-12) has been detected in affected disease sites. In order to investigate the clinical usefulness of circulating IL-12, we measured the serum concentrations of IL-12 by ELISA and performed immunohistochemistry using specific MoAbs for IL-12 in the lungs and scalene lymph nodes of patients with sarcoidosis. The serum concentration of IL-12 p40 was detectable in all 45 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and 18 normal controls, whereas that of IL-12 p70 was undetectable. The serum concentrations of IL-12 p40 in pulmonary sarcoidosis were significantly higher than those of the normal controls, especially in cases with abnormal intrathoracic findings detected by chest roentogenogram. The serum concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) also increased compared with those of normal controls and there was a significant positive correlation between the serum concentrations of IL-12 p40 and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and lysozyme, which are known to be useful markers for disease activity in sarcoidosis, correlated well with the serum concentrations of IL-12 p40. The positive 67Ga scan group (for lung field) had significantly elevated serum IL-12 p40 levels compared with those of the negative group. No bioactivity of IL-12 p70 was detected in three sarcoid cases sera by using the IL-12 responsive cell line. Finally, the immunohistochemical approach revealed that IL-12 p40 was expressed in the epithelioid cells and macrophages of sarcoid lungs and lymph nodes. We concluded that the production of IL-12 p40 was far greater in the sera and we have demonstrated this to be a useful clinical marker for disease activity and the Th1 response in pulmonary sarcoidosis.

### Usefulness of combined measurement of serum soluble IL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the detection of uveitis associated with Japanese sarcoidosis [^114ooaMT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated whether serum sIL-2R levels can be used as a diagnostic marker, in addition to serum ACE levels, in the detection of sarcoid uveitis and differentiation from non-sarcoid uveitis and PIOL. We found that serum sIL-2R levels for the detection of sarcoidosis had higher sensitivity (69.2% vs 44.2%) but slightly lower specificity (93.0% vs 100.0%) than serum ACE levels. Meanwhile, the sensitivity and specificity of elevated sIL-2R and/or ACE were 75.0% and 93.0%, respectively. Thus, our data suggest that the combined measurement of both serum sIL-2R and ACE levels improves sensitivity in the detection of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis. In contrast, serum ACE alone remains useful because of its high specificity in the differentiation of sarcoid uveitis from non-sarcoid uveitis and PIOL.

Serum sIL-2R, a proposed biomarker of sarcoidosis, is thought to be produced not only by activated T cells but also by alveolar macrophages. Measurement of sIL-2R as part of the routine diagnostic workup of patients with uveitis could help distinguish sarcoid uveitis from non-sarcoid uveitis because of the relatively high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (98%) of sIL-2R levels. Another study showed that the serum sIL-2R had 81% sensitivity and 64% specificity. These results are in agreement with this study, which found that the most probable diagnosis among uveitis cases was associated with sarcoidosis when serum sIL-2R levels were elevated. Also, patients with sarcoid uveitis had higher levels of serum sIL-2R (834.5 U/mL) than those with PIOL and non-sarcoid uveitis (476.1 and 313.0 U/mL, respectively) (Figure 1, Table 3).

### Neurosarcoidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^112jnUA4]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of NS is summarized in Table 1 and is heavily influenced by the presenting neurologic syndrome. Sarcoidosis is fundamentally a pathologic diagnosis, and biopsy from affected tissue is strongly recommended to support a final diagnosis. Rigorous exclusion of mimics is particularly important, and even with pathologic confirmation of granulomatous inflammation consistent with sarcoidosis, there is also a histologic differential diagnosis to consider. Granulomatous infections and, rarely, granulomatous reactions associated with lymphoma can have histopathologic findings similar to those seen in sarcoidosis. A multisystem granulomatous syndrome phenotypically similar to sarcoidosis (and sometimes NS) has been observed to develop in 8%–22% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency, a heterogenous group of antibody deficiencies characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and symptoms of immunodeficiency including infection and autoimmunity. Rigorous clinical-radiologic phenotyping and follow-up remain critical even with biopsy confirmation. Clear worsening or lack of a partial response to immunosuppressive treatment in patients with probable or possible NS warrants diagnostic reconsideration.

Neurosarcoidosis Diagnostic Criteria

Updated consensus NS diagnostic criteria were published in 2018 and categorize patients based on diagnostic certainty into definite, probable, and possible NS based on pathologic and clinical features, emphasizing clinical phenotype and biopsy confirmation (Table 2).

Table 2
Clinical Criteria for a Diagnosis of Neurosarcoidosis (2018 Neurosarcoidosis Consortium Consensus)

Serum Testing

Because neither sensitive nor specific serum tests for sarcoidosis diagnosis exist to date, the primary value of serum testing is to evaluate for alternative etiologies and for markers of other organ system manifestations of sarcoidosis (Table 3). Acute-phase reactants may be elevated but are non specific. Hypervitaminosis D and hypercalcemia are occasionally present and should prompt evaluation for hyperparathyroidism. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels are elevated in up to 60% of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, but are insensitive and nonspecific. A 2019 study identified serum soluble IL-2 receptor levels to be 88% sensitive and 85% specific for sarcoidosis compared with 62% and 76%, respectively, for ACE.

### Decreased serpin C1 in extracellular vesicles predicts response to methotrexate treatment in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis [^113sc8Wa]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause mainly affecting the lungs, intrathoracic lymph nodes, eyes and skin. Diagnosis, monitoring, as well as predicting disease course or response to therapy is challenging in the management of patients with sarcoidosis. For decades, biomarkers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) have been studied to guide clinical management, unfortunately with modest sensitivity and specificity. Pharmacological treatment of sarcoidosis is initiated to prevent further specific organ damage or alleviate symptoms. Immunosuppressing and immunomodulating drugs, most often in the form of prednisone and methotrexate (MTX) are the first- and second-line choice of therapy. When initiating therapy however, it is not possible to predict the treatment response for individual patients upfront, while a significant part show no benefit from therapy. Personalized prediction of treatment response is a clinical unmet need in light of protecting patients from exposure to ineffective drugs and their side effects.

Sarcoidosis is characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas, persistent inflammation and activated monocytes/macrophages. Macrophages form the core of the granuloma, producing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to attract lymphocytes resulting in an inflammatory environment. These macrophages originate from circulating bone-marrow derived monocytes which are patrolling antigen presenting cells but have a secondary function as a reservoir to replenish the macrophage pool in the tissues when needed. Several studies have highlighted an increased inflammatory status of monocytes in the blood of sarcoidosis patients. This increased inflammatory status can also be induced through extracellular vesicles (EVs) as has been described previously by Wahlund et al. Furthermore, more monocytes are found in the circulation of patients with sarcoidosis and these cells have the capacity to activate other immune cells, not only through cell-cell interaction but also through monocyte derived EVs. Taken together, EVs isolated from whole blood serum may be particularly informative in sarcoidosis.

### Usefulness of combined measurement of serum soluble IL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the detection of uveitis associated with Japanese sarcoidosis [^113459qp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

ACE, the conventional biomarker of sarcoidosis, is produced by epithelioid cells of granulomas, and it is known that ACE concentrations may be related to the granuloma burden. Sensitivity of ACE in sarcoidosis were 62% in one studyand 41.4% in a population-based study. In sarcoid uveitis, the sensitivity of ACE is relatively low, at 22% in a study by Gundlach et aland 55% in a study by Grajewski et al, as well as 44.2% in this study. The reason for this lower sensitivity of ACE compared to sIL2R may be because serum ACE levels are influenced by an ACE I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene. There was a difference in serum ACE in the three genotype groups, DD, ID, and II, showing inter-individual and ethnic variation. By contrast, the specificity of ACE levels in sarcoidosis was high, at 89.9% in a population-based study, and ACE elevation was associated with a 6-fold increase in the likelihood of sarcoidosis. In addition, the specificity of serum ACE in sarcoid uveitis is extremely high, at 94% and 88% in previous reports, as well as 100% in this study. Therefore, ACE may still be a good marker for differentiating sarcoid uveitis from other uveitis because of its high specificity. On the other hand, more than half of our patients with sarcoid uveitis displayed normal ACE levels (Table 3), and only the measurement of serum ACE would be insufficient in detecting sarcoid uveitis.

The frequency of patients with sarcoid uveitis who had elevated serum levels of sIL-2R and/or ACE was higher than that of those who had only elevated serum ACE levels (75.0% and 44.2%, respectively; P = 0.0025) (Table 3). Although serum sIL-2R and ACE levels were positively correlated (Figure 3A), both biomarkers do not always exhibit parallel changes. Therefore, the combined measurement of both markers can improve sensitivity as compared to the measurement of serum ACE only. In this study, the PPV (0.87) and NPV (0.86) of elevated sIL-2R and/or ACE were reliable for the detection of sarcoid uveitis. In addition, we considered finding a new factor using these markers such as the sIL-2R/ACE ratio, but no other useful factor was found.

### Predictive potential of ACE phenotyping in extrapulmonary sarcoidosis [^112QKxGQ]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis of ACE phenotype in sarcoidosis groups

We next evaluated ACE activity in 68 patients with clinically verified sarcoidosis, which was significantly higher than in 298 unrelated patients — median (interquartile range): 118.7 (98.9–160.4) vs. 97.3 (81.7–117.5), p < 0.001, respectively) (Additional file 2: Fig. S2A). Our newly established parameter mAb 9B9 binding/ACE activity ratio also demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in sarcoidosis patients compared to healthy individuals (99.9 (91.5–112.4) vs. 88.9 (81.3–94.7), p < 0.001, respectively) (Additional file 2: Fig. S2B). However, neither ACE activity nor 9B9 binding/activity ratio were significantly different in 37 patients with clinically defined extrapulmonary sarcoidosis versus 31 sarcoidosis patients with only lung involvement (not shown). This absence of statistically significant differences between these 2 groups of sarcoidosis patients also has been observed previously-not only for ACE activity, but for serum chitotriosidase level as well. Relevant to our hypothesis, increased ACE activity or decreased mAb 9B9 binding/activity ratio could occur when a proportion of excess ACE from sarcoid granulomas (i.e.g.ranuloma load) becomes significantly elevated. The observation that 22 of 44 patients with clinically defined extrapulmonary sarcoidosis demonstrated decreased mAb 9B9 binding/activity ratio may indicate that only in these patients (50%) did the extrathoracic granuloma load reach a significant threshold.

### Chitotriosidase: providing confirmation of cutaneous sarcoidosis when angiotensin converting enzyme fails [^112gYFcU]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Seven months after initiation of treatment in our patient, a repeat chitotriosidase was mildly elevated at 131 nmol/h/mL, which had decreased significantly from 295 nmol/h/mL. A study found that chitotriosidase is seen at its highest levels in patients treated with systemic steroids who have persistent disease. Concentrations of chitotriosidase decreased dramatically after steroid dose was increased or new immunosuppressant therapy was administered. As a result, the decrease in chitotriosidase seen in our patient may explain the good response of systemic inflammation to therapy, given that chitotriosidase remained low months after the last dose of prednisone was taken.

This case is novel because it demonstrates the utility of chitotriosidase in diagnosing cutaneous sarcoidosis. The literature on chitotriosidase has only been in reference to systemic sarcoidosis, not its cutaneous manifestations. In addition, there is very little mention of chitotriosidase in the dermatologic literature. One article found chitotriosidase to be a marker of systemic inflammation in psoriasis, but associations between chitotriosidase and cutaneous sarcoidosis have not been reported. Because skin lesions are the manifesting symptoms in 20% of patients with sarcoidosis, chitotriosidase is a marker that dermatologists should use in the diagnostic work-up for cutaneous sarcoidosis.

### Associations of peripheral blood lymphopenia to disease course, treatment and TNF-α in sarcoidosis [^116S2ndM]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Study design

PB samples, including measurement of total lymphocyte concentration and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (s-ACE) were obtained as part of the normal clinical follow-up. The patients underwent extra sampling solely for the purpose of this study for analysis of PB concentrations and percentages of T-, B- and NK cells and serum tumour necrosis factor α (s-TNF-α). The analyses were performed at Karolinska University Laboratory or affiliated accredited external laboratories. For s-TNF-α analysis, samples were sent to Laboratory of Immunology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital Gothenburg.

The medical charts were retrospectively searched for the first PB total lymphocyte value available, mostly recorded at referral. Patients were divided into 2 groups; one consisting of patients with PB total lymphopenia and one with normal PB lymphocyte counts. Data on sex, age at sarcoidosis diagnosis, extra pulmonary manifestations (EPM) and information about treatment were also extracted. The treatments were categorized as follows; single corticosteroid (CS), cytotoxic (i.e. MTX or azathioprine) ± CS, TNF-α inhibitor (TNFi, i.e. infliximab) + CS/MTX. Lung function parameters and chest X-ray staging according to Scadding (0 = no visible intrathoracic pathology compatible with sarcoidosis, I = lymphadenopathy, II = parenchymal infiltrates and lymphadenopathy, III = parenchymal infiltrates, IV = fibrosis) were matched as close as possible to the date of inclusion. EPM was defined as a positive biopsy from the affected organ or obvious symptoms/assessment from a specialist in the area. Resolving disease was defined as no signs of sarcoidosis, evaluated by chest X-ray, lung function test, absence of EPM, patient symptoms and laboratory signs of inflammation. Stable disease was defined as remaining pulmonary manifestations without deterioration, no signs of inflammatory activity in laboratory parameters and no systemic treatment required. In analysis patients with stable and resolving disease were grouped together. Patients with worsening pulmonary manifestations and/or EPM, signs of increasing inflammatory activity in laboratory parameters and/or in need of systemic treatment were classified as having an active disease.

### Circulating CD14 + CD16 + monocytes are expanded in sarcoidosis patients [^114rLaLf]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas, consisting mainly of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells derived from monocyte-macrophage lineage cells. Monocytes fall into subpopulations comprising CD14++ CD16-, and CD14+ CD16+ cells, and expansion of the later monocytes has been reported under some pathological conditions. In this study, we examined the immunophenotype of blood monocytes in patients with sarcoidosis using two-color immunofluorescence flow cytometry. In healthy controls CD14+ CD16+ monocytes account for 5.8 ± 2.8% of monocytes. The percentage of CD14+ CD16+ monocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.02) in the sarcoidosis patients (11.8 ± 4.9%) compared with those in healthy control subjects. The serum ACE levels were significantly correlated with the percentage of CD14+ CD16+ monocytes (p < 0.05). In contrast, the percentage was not correlated with purinergic receptor expression of monocytes as estimated by LDH release from BzATP-stimulated monocytes. These findings suggest that CD14+ CD16+ monocytes represent a sensitive marker for the disease activity of sarcoidosis.

### The utility of 18F-FDG PET / CT for diagnosis and adjustment of therapy in patients with active chronic sarcoidosis [^111iXSQC]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for detection of inflammation in granulomatous sites and management of patients with chronic sarcoidosis. The 3 specific aims were to assess differences between (18)F-FDG PET/CT and multidetector CT (MDCT) findings, to compare (18)F-FDG PET/CT results with serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and to determine whether (18)F-FDG PET/CT findings are associated with the decision to change therapy.

Methods

We studied 90 sarcoidosis patients (mean age ± SD, 47 ± 12 y; 32 men and 58 women) with persistent symptoms who were referred for (18)F-FDG PET/CT evaluation to assess the extent of inflammation. They also underwent MDCT and measurement of serum ACE level. After the follow-up (12 ± 5 mo after (18)F-FDG PET/CT), the clinical status and changes in therapy were analyzed.

Results

(18)F-FDG PET/CT detected inflammation in 74 patients (82%) (maximum standardized uptake value, 8.1 ± 3.9). MDCT was positive for sarcoidosis in 6 additional patients (80, 89%). The difference between the 2 methods was not significant (P = 0.238, McNemar test), and their agreement was fair (κ = 0.198). Although ACE levels were significantly higher in patients with positive than negative (18)F-FDG PET/CT results (P = 0.002, Mann-Whitney test), 38 patients (51%) with positive (18)F-FDG PET/CT results had normal ACE levels. The therapy was initiated or changed in 73 out of 90 patients (81%). Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that positive (18)F-FDG PET/CT results were significantly (P < 0.001) associated with changes in therapy, with no contribution from age, sex, ACE level, CT results, or previous therapy.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that (18)F-FDG PET/CT is a useful adjunct to other diagnostic methods for detecting active inflammatory sites in chronic sarcoidosis patients with persistent symptoms, especially those with normal ACE levels. (18)F-FDG PET/CT proved advantageous for determining the spread of active disease throughout the body and influenced the decision to adjust the therapy.

### The predictive effects of adiponectin and irisin hormones on diagnosis and clinical involvement of sarcoidosis [^1153muh2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the studies conducted between adiponectin and systemic autoimmune diseases, there was no difference between the patient and control groups in terms of BMI, gender and age, as in our study.

In a study by Zielinski et al. adipokines were analysed in patients with sarcoidosis and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In a study conducted in 44 patients with sarcoidosis, higher adiponectin levels were found in patients with sarcoidosis, similar to the study by Zielinski et al. In this study, elevated adiponectin levels were found to be associated with arthralgia and ankle swelling, whereas in our study no association was found between clinical involvement and adiponectin levels. Contrary to these studies, there are also studies showing that adiponectin levels are similar in connective tissue diseases and control groups. In our study, there was no statistical difference in adiponectin levels between the patient and control groups.

Adiponectin hormone has been shown to inhibit many cytokines involved in inflammation underlying sarcoidosis in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It is also involved in the regulation of fibrosis and inflammation.

The fact that adiponectin was found at similar levels to the control group in our study may be due to the fact that it has a strong anti-inflammatory effect and is inhibited by pro-inflammatory cytokines in sarcoidosis. Although no significant difference was found in our study, we believe that a thorough evaluation of adiponectin in sarcoidosis is important.

Biomarkers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), chitotriosidase (CTO), lysozyme, neopterin, and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (SIL-2R) have been most frequently studied in patients with sarcoidosis. Among these, ACE is the most widely used biomarker. It plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and assessment of activity in sarcoidosis patients. ACE levels are elevated in 30–80% of untreated sarcoidosis patients. Sensitivity from 22 to 86% and specificity between 54 and 95%. In our study, the sensitivity of irisin was determined to be 84%, with a specificity of 55.8%; however, an appropriate cut-off value for adiponectin could not be established. Most studies have reported that high ACE levels correlate with systemic involvement, disease activity, and stage; conversely, our study found no significant associations between ACE, irisin, or adiponectin levels and extrapulmonary involvement or disease stages.

### Diagnostic value of lymphopaenia and elevated serum ACE in patients with uveitis [^115KE9u1]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Our study indicates that the combination of lymphopaenia and elevated serum ACE can serve as a useful biomarker for diagnosing sarcoidosis in uveitis patients, demonstrating a better overall diagnostic performance than solely that of serum ACE levels or lymphopaenia alone. This holds particularly true for young patients and those suffering from granulomatous uveitis.

### The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates sarcoidosis granulomatous inflammation [^112vK8bP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder of unclear cause notable for abnormal elevation of blood and tissue ACE1 (angiotensin converting enzyme 1) levels and activity. ACE1 regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the terminal product of which is aldosterone, which selectively engages mineralocorticoid receptors to promote inflammation. Objectives: We sought to determine whether the RAAS promotes sarcoidosis granuloma formation and related inflammatory responses. Methods: Using an established ex vivo model, we first determined whether aldosterone was produced by sarcoidosis granulomas and verified the presence of CYP11B2, the enzyme required for its production. We then evaluated the effects of selective inhibitors of ACE1 (captopril), angiotensin type 1 receptor (losartan), and mineralocorticoid receptors (spironolactone, eplerenone) on granuloma formation, reflected by computer image analysis-generated granuloma area, and selected cytokines incriminated in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Measurements and Main Results: Aldosterone was spontaneously produced by sarcoidosis peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and both intra- and extracellular levels steadily increased during granuloma formation. In parallel, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were shown to express more CYP11B2 during granuloma formation. Significant inhibition of sarcoidosis granulomas and related cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ, IL-10) was observed in response to pretreatments with captopril, losartan, spironolactone, or eplerenone, comparable to that of prednisone. Conclusions: The RAAS is intact in sarcoidosis granulomas and contributes significantly to early granuloma formation and to related inflammatory mediator responses, with important implications for clinical management.

### Usefulness of combined measurement of serum soluble IL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the detection of uveitis associated with Japanese sarcoidosis [^115Fdnd7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is conventionally used as a biomarker in the diagnosis of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis, but its sensitivity is relatively low. In this study, we investigated whether serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is also useful as a diagnostic marker, in addition to ACE, in the detection of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis.

Patients and Methods

Data were analyzed from 126 patients with uveitis (52 sarcoidosis and 74 non-sarcoid uveitis) and 12 with primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) who had their serum sIL-2R and ACE levels measured.

Results

Serum sIL-2R level was elevated in 69.2% of patients with sarcoid uveitis, 5.4% of those with non-sarcoid uveitis, and 16.7% of those with PIOL. The sensitivity and specificity of an elevated sIL-2R level for the detection of sarcoidosis were 69.2% and 93.0%, respectively. In contrast, serum ACE levels were elevated only in patients with sarcoid uveitis, with a sensitivity of 44.2% and specificity of 100%. Furthermore, serum sIL-2R and/or ACE level was elevated in 75.0% of patients with sarcoid uveitis, which is higher than those who had elevated serum ACE level only (44.2%, P = 0.0025). The sensitivity and specificity of elevated sIL-2R and/or ACE in detecting sarcoid uveitis were 75.0% and 93.0%, respectively. The PPV was 0.87, and the NPV was 0.86.

Conclusion

Compared with the sensitivity of serum ACE levels alone, combined measurement of both serum sIL-2R and ACE levels improves sensitivity in the detection of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis. Nevertheless, serum ACE alone remains useful thanks to its high specificity in the differentiation of uveitis patients, with sarcoidosis from those without sarcoidosis.

### CASPA (CArdiac sarcoidosis in PApworth) improving the diagnosis of cardiac involvement in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis: protocol for a prospective observational cohort study [^112vQoYG]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

There are no widely accepted blood-based markers for evaluation of cardiac disease in sarcoidosis. Levels of pro-BNP (pro-brain natriuretic peptide) has been investigated with one study of 150 patients showing association with CS with an area under the curve of 0.913. However, pro-BNP is not specific for CS and is elevated in a number of cardiac diseases. High sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hscTnT) has been investigated and shown to correlate with serum ACE levels and may be useful in diagnosing CS.hscTnT has also been shown in some patients to normalise with treatment of CS using corticosteroids. However, serum ACE alone is unhelpful in both diagnosis and monitoring of CS activity.

Proteins associated with CS could pave the way towards simple and cheap blood tests to assist with diagnosis but this technique has not yet been used in CS. In respect to proteomics in pulmonary sarcoidosis, Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) has been shown to identify serum proteins specific to radiographic stage of sarcoidosis, and serum and bronchoalveolar cytokine profiles have been shown to differentiate between pulmonary forms of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.

Ancillary Investigations

Testing of the CSF was conducted in 16 patients, of which results were known in 14. A leukocytosis (> 5 cells/mm 3, range 8–1,000 cells/mm 3) was present in 9/14 (64.3%), all of which were lymphocyte predominant. Protein was elevated in 10/14 (71.4%, range 49–254 mg/dL). Hypoglycorrhachia was present in 2/12 (16.7%). CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands were present in 1/3 (33.3%) tested, while IgG index was normal in all 5 patients tested. CSF angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was normal in 5 patients undergoing testing.

CSF was analyzed according to the presence or absence of concurrent leptomeningitis. In those without leptomeningitis (6 patients), CSF findings included a pleocytosis in 3/6 (50.0%, range 8–13 cells/mm 3), elevated protein in 3/6 (50.0%, range 49–57 mg/dL), and hypoglycorrhachia in 0/6 (0.0%). In those with concurrent leptomeningitis (8 patients), CSF findings included a pleocytosis in 6/8 (75.0%, range 8–1,000 cells/mm 3), elevated protein in 7/8 (87.5%, range 65–254 mg/dL), and hypoglycorrhachia in 2/8 (25.0%).

Serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were elevated in 4/20 (25%) tested, all of whom had extraneural sarcoidosis involving the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and lungs. Serum calcium levels were normal in all tested (23/23). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were elevated in 13/16 (81.3%) and 7/15 (46.7%), respectively. Serum IgG4 levels were tested in 5 patients, only one of which had a value exceeding 135 mg/dL (1/5, 20%).

The mean (SD) values of serum ACE for patients with AS, BD, presumed sarcoidosis, presumed latent TB, presumed latent syphilis and control group were 29.363 (2.012), 31.227 (15.225), 58.164 (35.110), 33.061 (15.065), 30.527 (16.016) and 20.704 (7.962) U/L respectively (Table 3). The estimated marginal means of serum ACE levels in groups were disclosed in Fig. 1. According to this graph, the lowest value for the estimated marginal mean of serum ACE level is 21.251 U/L for control group, and the highest value is 58.274 U/L for the patients with presumed sarcoidosis. The estimated marginal mean values of serum ACE level for the patients with AS, BD, presumed latent TB and presumed latent syphilis were 29.360, 31.392, 32.500 and 30.452 U/L respectively which were lower than the estimated marginal mean value of ACE for presumed sarcoidosis, but higher than the estimated marginal mean value of ACE for control group (Fig. 1). The mean (SD) values of serum lysozyme level for patients with AS, BD, presumed sarcoidosis, presumed latent TB, presumed latent syphilis and control group were 14.096 (4.586), 14.244 (5.358), 20.712 (6.780), 15.259 (8.516), 14.018 (6.679) and 12.927 (4.720) mg/L respectively (Table 3).

### CD4 / CD8 T-cell ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a marker of sarcoidosis severity: a retrospective study [^114zQEqu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Biological characteristics

We analysed the patients' biological characteristics at diagnosis according to CD4/CD8 ratio value (Table 3). The ACE level tended to be higher in the ratio ≥ 3.5 group (median 73 IU/L vs. 54.5 IU/L in the ratio < 3.5 group; p = 0.082). The plasma B- and T-cell counts were similar in the two groups. The number of CD8 + T cells tended to be greater in the ratio < 3.5 group (median 0.29 vs. 0.19 × 10⁹/L in the ratio ≥ 3.5 group; p = 0.06). The number of activated CD8 + T cells was significantly higher in patients with ratio < 3.5 (median 0.07 × 10⁹/L [32.8% of total CD8 + T cells] vs. 0.03 × 10⁹/L [21.1% of total CD8 + T cells] in patients with ratio ≥ 3.5 [p = 0.014]). Patients with a high percentage of activated CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood had a lower ratio value in BAL fluid (R = − 0.3, p = 0.03). Importantly, a ratio < 3.5 was correlated with a high percentage of CD8 + T cells (R = − 0.27, p = 0.04), but there was no such correlation with the percentage of CD4 + T cells (R = − 0.17, p = 0.22). Patients with a high percentage of activated CD4 + T cells had a high ACE level (R = 0.35, p = 0.01), but this was not the case for those with a high percentage of activated CD8 + T cells (R = 0.05, p = 0.7).

### CD4 / CD8 T-cell ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a marker of sarcoidosis severity: a retrospective study [^1113fCvS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CD4 + T cells are typically activated in sarcoidosis and accumulate in affected organs. We did not find a difference between CD4 + T cells activation in peripheral blood in the 2 groups, but patients with R < 3.5 had a larger number of activated CD8 + T cells. This is consistent with prior reports that CD8 + T-cell activation in peripheral blood is associated with a greater risk of more severe respiratory impairment chronic disease progression, probably because of production of granzymes, perforins, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (INF)-γ, leading to higher cytotoxicity. Regarding secondary outcomes, a high ACE level tended to be associated with a greater number of activated CD4 + T cells, and patients with R < 3.5 had a high number of circulating of CD8 + T cells, consistent with the pathophysiology of sarcoidosis. Heightened activation of CD4 + T-helper cells is associated with the formation of more granulomas, as reflected by the blood ACE level. However, during the chronic and more fibrotic phase of the disease, the ACE level decreases with increasing CD8 + T-cell cytotoxicity.

Interestingly, the treatments administered varied according to disease severity. Patients with R < 3.5 had more extrapulmonary manifestations (excluding cutaneous and joint involvement) with more multisystemic damage and required more therapeutic interventions with an increased need for immunosuppressive agents and multiple lines of treatment.

This study has several limitations. It was a retrospective study involving a small number of patients, limiting the statistical power. Additionally, the R value may be influenced by factors such as disease activity, age, and smoking, which we did not evaluate.

Most of our findings are consistent with prior reports; patients with a high R value have a better prognosis, and chronic disease evolution is significantly associated with a low R value: high ratio correlates with disease activity and low ratio with disease severity. Our work retrospectively confirms these findings, as patients with R < 3.5, especially those with abdominal or cardiac–cutaneous–CNS involvement, had more severe disease, required more intensive treatment and/or were refractory to successive treatment modalities, and had a high proportion of activated CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood.

### Optic neuropathy associated with systemic sarcoidosis [^114bzu8J]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

We have identified a small subgroup of patients in whom the serum ACE is elevated at presentation and then subsequently normalizes without relapse. On further investigation, these patients do not have sarcoidosis and on follow-up show no sign of transformation into a more widespread disease. The serum ACE appears to increase in a nonspecific way and appears not to indicate a systemic granulomatous disease. It is important to identify this subgroup, which requires no additional treatment, merely close follow-up and observation.

This large series of patients with optic neuropathy in conjunction with sarcoidosis has shown that more than half are not previously diagnosed with sarcoidosis, only a third have concurrent intraocular inflammation, and the clinical characteristics and in most cases the imaging features are not substantially different from that seen in a regular demyelinating optic neuritis. However, patients should be identified early because the response to treatment may lessen with time, and the identification of more widespread disease, particularly within the nervous system, will require prolonged, often high-dose treatment with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and modern biological therapies. Modern imaging investigations including PET may make identification of these cases easier, but a high index of clinical suspicion is still important, particularly in non-Caucasian patients presenting with a painless optic neuritis.

Once identified, we recommend that patients be treated with high-dose (oral or IV) corticosteroids, followed by a slow taper watching carefully for relapse as the dose is reduced. Repeated relapses, particularly preventing steroid dose reduction, should be treated with an additional immunosuppressive agent. The presence of neurosarcoidosis requires more prolonged higher-dose treatment with steroids and immunosuppression from the outset, with early recourse to biological agents should the clinical and radiologic features of the disorder fail to improve quickly. Further study is required to identify precisely which treatments are best and over what period of time.

### Exhaled 8-isoprostane as a prognostic marker in sarcoidosis. A short term follow-up [^113NK2PL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

8-Isoprostane (8-IP) is a marker of lipid peroxidation. Elevated concentrations have been reported in BAL fluid and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in sarcoidosis (S). To validate the prognostic value of this marker we tested whether: 1. high initial EBC 8-IP predispose to more severe disease; 2. low initial concentrations increase a chance of early remission; 3. remissions are connected with the decrease of EBC 8-IP.

Methods

40 patients (S) have been examined initially (V1) and after 8.5 ± 0.5 months (V2). EBC 8-IP concentrations were measured by ELISA. Chest X-ray, lung function test, serum ACE and Ca 2+ concentrations, 24 hrs Ca 2+ loss, abdominal ultrasonography, symptoms evaluation were performed.

Results

We confirmed higher concentrations of 8-IP in EBC of patients with sarcoidosis (p = 0.001). Relative risk (RR) of persistence of disease at V2 when initial 8-IP was above 20 pg/mL was 1.04, and the frequency distributions estimated by χ 2 test were not significantly different. A chance (RR) of early complete remission when V1 8-IP was below DL, was 3.33 (p = 0.04 by χ 2 test). A significant decrease of 8-IP at V2 was observed only in patients who received treatment (p = 0.03), but not in those with spontaneous remission.

Conclusions

We come to the conclusion, that low initial 8-IP may be a positive prognostic factor. A decrease of 8-IP in treated patients reflects a non-specific effect of treatment and is not related to mere regression of disease.

### The serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme levels in patients with ocular involvement of autoimmune and infectious diseases [^116wCHBB]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The serum activity of ACE has been compared for patients with BD, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's disease and sarcoidosis. Significant elevation of serum ACE activity has been observed only for patients with sarcoidosis. Our study revealed the estimated marginal mean of serum ACE level for patients with BD as 31.392 U/L. A significant elevation of serum ACE level in patients with presumed sarcoidosis with respect to BD has been disclosed in our study (p = 0.0001). Serum levels of ACE activity have been compared in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and BD, and no statistically significant differences have been found from those of normal controls. The serum ACE activity has not been investigated in HLAB27 positive AS related uveitis. Our study disclosed the estimated marginal mean of serum ACE level in patients with AS as 29.363 U/L. Our study revealed a statistically significant difference in serum ACE level for patients with presumed sarcoidosis compared to patients with AS (p = 0.0001). No significant difference of elevated serum ACE levels was found between AS and control group. (p = 1.000) Elevated serum lysozyme levels have been included in the criteria for diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis. The serum levels of ACE and lysozyme have been reported increased in 40 and 42% of patients with biopsy-proven ocular sarcoidosis respectively. The levels of at least one of the serum markers ACE and lysozyme were found elevated in 58% of patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis. The estimated marginal means of serum ACE and lysozyme levels for the patients with AS, BD, presumed sarcoidosis, presumed latent TB, presumed latent syphilis and control group disclosed on Graph 1 and Graph 2 in our study have similar curves with minimum values for control group and maximum values for presumed sarcoidosis. The sensitivity of serum lysozyme for predicting sarcoidosis was reported as 79.1% and the sensitivity of serum ACE for predicting sarcoidosis was reported as 59%. However, the specificity of serum lysozyme level has been reported to be less for sarcoidosis than serum ACE level, and it has been considered that the diagnostic value of serum lysozyme for sarcoidosis might be limited. In another study considering the predictive value of serum ACE and lysozyme levels in diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis, the sensitivity of increased serum ACE level was found as 84%, specificity was 95%, and predictivity was 47%. However, the sensitivity of increased serum lysozyme levels was 60%, specificity was 76%, and spredictivity was 12%. Both studies showed that increased serum lysozyme levels might be less predictive for ocular sarcoidosis. Our study revealed the estimated marginal means of serum lysozyme for patients with AS, BD, presumed sarcoidosis, presumed latent TB, presumed latent syphilis and control group as 14.124, 14.371, 20.765,14.987, 13.980, and 13.196 mg/L respectively. Pairwise comparisons of the serum lysozyme levels between patients with presumed sarcoidosis and AS and BD revealed statistically significant differences for presumed sarcoidosis (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0001 respectively). Pairwise comparison of the serum lysozyme levels between patients with presumed sarcoidosis and presumed latent TB revealed a statistically significant difference for sarcoidosis with the p value 0.001 which was greater than the p value of pairwise comparison of the serum ACE levels between patients with presumed sarcoidosis and presumed latent TB. Pairwise comparison of the serum lysozyme levels between the patients with presumed sarcoidosis and presumed latent syphilis revealed a statistically significant difference for presumed sarcoidosis with the p value 0.033 which was also greater than the p value of pairwise comparison of the serum ACE levels between patients with presumed sarcoidosis and presumed latent syphilis. Our study disclosed that increase in serum lysozyme levels is more significant than increase in serum ACE levels for patients with infectious uveitis such as presumed latent TB and presumed latent syphilis. This study also revealed that the increase in serum lysozyme levels is less specific than increase in serum ACE levels for presumed sarcoidosis, and elevated serum lysozyme levels might be much more commonly detected in infectious uveitis such as presumed latent TB and presumed latent syphilis than autoimmune uveitis such as AS and BD.

ACE levels in patient samples. Citrated plasma samples from 100 pulmonary clinic patients were analyzed for ACE activity using ZPHL substrate (A) and immunoreactive ACE protein levels using mAb 9B9 (B). Data are expressed as % of parameters of ACE levels (activity or the amount of immunoreactive ACE protein from value for control pooled plasma samples from healthy controls (green bars)). Bars with statistically significant changes in % of ACE precipitation are colored as follows: increase more than 20% (orange), > 50% (brown), more than twofold (red), decrease more than 50% (yellow). Shown are mean values from 2 to 5 experiments (each made in triplicates); SD (not shown for clarity) was less than 10%. Correlation coefficients are displayed in the figure

Subtle conformational changes in ACE can be detected in naïve plasma if concomitant ACE inhibitor use (ACEI) is not present. Because ACEI significantly alter the local conformation of ACE, the detection of patients with ACE inhibitors in their blood (and further exclusion of them from consideration when using this technique to assess for the presence of systemic sarcoidosis) is an obligate step in ACE phenotyping. We have developed two independent and very sensitive methods for the detection of ACE inhibitors in the blood of patients. Figure 2 A demonstrates the 1G12/9B9 binding ratio — the most sensitive parameter for the detection of exogenous ACEI in the blood. We identified 19 patients with an elevated 1G12/9B9 ratio, suggesting likely ACE inhibitor usage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study population

Forty patients, monitored at the Siena Regional Referral Centre for Sarcoidosis and other Interstitial Lung Diseases, were enrolled retrospectively. We excluded patients with active respiratory infections, malignant diseases, Lofgren syndrome, acute disease onset or spontaneous remission of sarcoidosis, as well as those patients for whom simultaneous BAL and peripheral blood samples were not available. Thirteen were selected for the study. The median age [interquartile range (IQR)] was 57 years (range = 48–59); 23% were male. All had undergone bronchoscopy for interstitial lung disease (ILD) diagnostic work‐up. Diagnosis was based on international criteria. In all cases, medical history, lung function parameters and serum angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations were recorded in a specific database. Bronchoscopy with BAL and chest X‐ray with radiological staging, performed in the framework of the sarcoidosis diagnostic work‐up, were also available. The radiological classification was according to Scadding: stage 0, normal; stage 1, bilateral hilar adenopathy without parenchymal involvement; stage 2, bilateral adenopathy and parenchymal infiltration; stage 3, parenchymal infiltration; and stage 4, pulmonary fibrosis associated with sarcoidosis. All patients were negative for tuberculosis (TB), bacterial infections, mycological infections and malignant diseases. Twelve healthy controls [median age (IQR) = 53 years (52–65); 16% male] were also enrolled into the study. They had no history of concomitant pathologies and were not on any medication, and had normal lung function test parameters.

Peripheral blood was sampled from both patients and controls while BAL samples were collected only from sarcoidosis patients, because BAL cannot be performed on healthy subjects for scientific purposes in Italy.

All patients and healthy individuals gave their written informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee (CEAVSE, Markerlung 17431, Tuscany, Italy).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparation

Preparation and storage of PBMCs was performed at the Respiratory Diseases Laboratory, University Hospital of Siena. Peripheral blood samples were collected after 8‐h fasting in a tube containing etylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) anti‐coagulant (BD Vacutainer ® EDTA tubes; BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA) and processed within 8 h, as previously reported.

Figure 1 A demonstrates ACE activity quantification in 100 patients with substrate Z-Phe-His-Leu (ZPHL). As a control (100%), we used pooled samples of citrated plasma from 3 blood donors. We found (1) 15 patients with ACE levels > 150% (highlighted in brown); compared to 6 such patients in a healthy population; (2) and 7 patients with 200% of ACE (red color) — compared to 0 in a healthy population. According to our preliminary hypothesis, these patients with ACE activity > 150% may have systemic sarcoidosis. Figure 1 B demonstrates the precipitation of ACE activity from patients' plasma by mAbs 9B9 — there were 7 patients with > 150% the amount of immunoreactive ACE protein (with mAb 9B9); compared to 2 in the healthy population. 1 patient had ACE protein > 200% (red color) — compared to 0 in the healthy population. The correlation coefficient of ACE activity determination with the amount of ACE immunoreactive protein (with mAb 9B9) is extremely high at 0.942, which indicates a very high accuracy of measurement of ACE levels by both methods. Patient #87 has extremely high levels of both ACE activity and immunoreactive protein, and based on our experience, it is likely that this patient is a carrier of an ACE mutation leading to the increase in ACE shedding. Previously, we found several such mutations that result in increased rates of ACE shedding by different mechanisms, reviewed in. In the same paper, we confirmed this suggestion and identified that patient #87 has a novel ACE mutation that increases ACE shedding through introduction of a stop codon (Q1224X) that eliminates its transmembrane anchor. As a result, ACE produced by one allele is directly secreted into circulation. This patient was excluded from further analysis.

### Diagnostic value of lymphopaenia and elevated serum ACE in patients with uveitis [^116FmMuX]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Sarcoidosis is a major cause of uveitis worldwide. An accurate diagnosis of sarcoidosis in uveitis patients has important consequences for managing patients' care and visual outcomes as well as medicinal options. Determining whether an uveitis patient also has sarcoidosis is usually established by combining chest imaging and biochemical measures and then preferably confirmed by biopsy results. The lack of a highly sensitive and specific sarcoidosis screening test in uveitis patients poses a major problem in diagnosing, because undetected sarcoidosis can lead to substantial systemic and ocular morbidity. Although serum ACE (sACE) is the most commonly used diagnostic and activity biomarker for sarcoidosis, it has a sensitivity varying from 40% to 83%. Lymphopaenia, a result of peripheral T-cell depletion, occurs in up to > 50% of sarcoidosis patients and is associated with a chronic course of the disease. However, large studies investigating lymphopaenia's value in predicting sarcoid uveitis remain scarce. This study was conducted to investigate the value of lymphopaenia and elevated sACE, singly or in combination, as diagnostic biomarkers of sarcoid uveitis.

### Predictive potential of ACE phenotyping in extrapulmonary sarcoidosis [^115csigu]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevated ACE expression in tissues (reflected by blood ACE levels) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and is also a marker for granulomatous diseases. We developed a new approach for characterization of ACE status in the blood — ACE phenotyping and established normal values of ACE levels 50–150% of control pooled plasma. ACE phenotyping was performed in citrated plasma of 120 patients with known interstitial lung diseases. In the 1st set of 100 patients we found 22 patients with ACE levels > 150%; ACE phenotyping also objectively identified the presence of ACE inhibitors in the plasma of 15 patients. After excluding these patients and patient with ACE mutation that increases ACE shedding, 17 patients were identified as a suspicious for systemic sarcoidosis based on elevation of blood ACE (> 150% of mean). A new parameter that we have established–ACE immunoreactivity (with mAb 9B9) — allowed us to detect 22 patients with decreased values (< 80%) of this parameter, which may indicate the presence of ACE in the blood that originates from macrophages/dendritic cells of granulomas. In the remaining 20 patients, this new parameter (mAbs binding/activity ratio) was calculated using 3 mAbs (9B9, 3A5 and i1A8 — having overlapping epitopes), and 8 patients were identified as having decreases in this parameter, thus increasing dramatically the sensitivity for detection of patients with systemic sarcoidosis. Whole body PET scan confirmed extrapulmonary granulomas in some patients with lower immunoreactivity towards anti-ACE mAbs. ACE phenotyping has novel potential to noninvasively detect patients with systemic sarcoidosis.

### Chitotriosidase: providing confirmation of cutaneous sarcoidosis when angiotensin converting enzyme fails [^111gWMT1]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The percentage of sarcoidosis cases that present with cutaneous involvement varies widely across the literature, likely due to the differences in patient populations. Cutaneous involvement is seen in 20% to 35% of patients with sarcoidosis. Although erythema nodosum is the most common cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis, lupus pernio is the only pathognomonic cutaneous finding. Lupus pernio is most commonly seen in women aged 45 to 65 years of African descent. Other less common cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis include papular sarcoidosis, nodular sarcoidosis, and plaque sarcoidosis. Because of the wide array of skin presentations and variability in the initial presenting symptoms, the diagnosis is often delayed. In 20% of patients, skin lesions are the presenting signs of systemic sarcoidosis, but in 30% of patients, the skin lesions appear up to 10 years after the systemic disease has been documented. Skin and systemic symptoms appear simultaneously in 50% of patients. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is often made after lymphadenopathy is noted incidentally on chest x-ray. Serologic studies can assist in diagnosing sarcoidosis when imaging is inconclusive, as demonstrated in our patient.

Although lupus pernio itself is not life-threatening, initiating treatment promptly is important for curtailing disfigurement. Hydroxychloroquine is the preferred initial therapy for cutaneous sarcoidosis, whereas prednisone is preferred for treating the lungs. In this patient, the diagnosis led to monitoring of pulmonary status through repeat pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography scans.

The ACE level has been the most frequently used laboratory test for patients with sarcoidosis. ACE is elevated in 60% of patients with sarcoidosis and is an indication of the total body granuloma burden. Chitotriosidase can assess disease activity in sarcoidosis with an approximate sensitivity of 88.6% and specificity of 92.8%. This is in contrast to a sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 54% seen in ACE. The chitotriosidase test is performed using a blood sample, from which the plasma is separated in a laboratory. The level of chitotriosidase enzyme in the plasma is then measured. It is not routinely available at most hospital laboratories and thus is a send-out test.

### Disposal of iNKT cell deficiency and an increase in expression of SLAM signaling factors characterizes sarcoidosis remission: a 4-year longitudinal study [^116Ho9ut]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Monitoring of pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease and treatment

At diagnosis, nine patients showed chest radiographic stage I, 19 showed stage II, and two showed stage III (Table 1). At 3 months, the stages were highly comparable. However, after 1 year there was a significant improvement in radiographic chest stages (six showed stage 0), and even more after 4 years, when 17 patients showed stage 0, two stage I, nine stage II, and one stage III (Figure 2 A). The pulmonary function data also significantly improved, with a median increase of predicted FEV1 from 92 to 97%, FVC from 94 to 103%, and DLCO from 92 to 100% after 4 years of disease follow-up (Figure 2 B–D). There was also a significant decrease of sACE (from 1 to 0.6 μkat/l; Figure 2 E) after 4 years of disease follow-up.

Figure 2
Radiographic, functional, clinical, and treatment data in newly diagnosed patients with sarcoidosis and then over 4 years of disease follow-up: (A) chest radiographic stages, (B, C, D) lung functions, (E) serum ACE levels, (F) manifestations of granuloma in organs other than the lungs, and (G) systemic corticosteroid treatment. The data measured are presented with the median and interquartile range.

At presentation, 16 patients showed extrapulmonary disease (Table 1). At follow-up there was a decrease to 12 patients at 3 months, to eight at 1 year, and finally after 4 years to six patients (four with skin involvement and two with liver involvement) (Figure 2 F).

Among the 29 patients, only five needed initial treatment with oral corticosteroids. At 1 year only one patient remained on treatment; later, in the 3rd year, the disease again progressed in another patient, and so finally after 4 years two patients that seemed to have chronic disease needed corticosteroid treatment (Figure 2 G).

### Hypercalcemia due to excess 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D in Crohn's disease [^116LnJtT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia has been described in patients with a number of granulomatous diseases, including sarcoidosis and mycobacterial infection. Disordered vitamin D metabolism is the root cause for the elevated serum calcium levels. A similar mechanism of abnormal vitamin D metabolism explained the hypercalcemia occurring in patients with lymphoma. Crohn's disease is a granulomatous disorder that is more commonly associated with hypocalcemia caused by poor calcium intake and decreased intestinal calcium absorption related to vitamin D deficiency as a consequence of malabsorption. A man with Crohn's disease who presented with hypercalcemia and acute renal failure is described. Biochemical parameters showed an elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, with a low-normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and decreased parathyroid hormone level. Inflammatory bowel disease had been clinically active during the preceding 2 months. With resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, serum calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels returned to normal. Serum creatinine levels decreased toward normal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels have been reported to be elevated in patients with sarcoidosis, particularly in the setting of active disease with hypercalcemia. Controversy exists about ACE levels in the face of active Crohn's disease: 1 report noted elevated levels, whereas other publications reported depressed levels. Our patient had an elevated ACE level in the setting of active bowel disease and hypercalcemia, and ACE levels returned to normal with resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Cerebrospinal fluid angiotensin-converting enzyme for diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis [^111tyF3A]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Neurosarcoidosis (NS) is a rare condition that may mimic central nervous system (CNS) infection, neoplasia and other inflammatory disorders of the CNS such as multiple sclerosis, encephalitis and vasculitis. Diagnosis is challenging in cases with minimal or absent systemic involvement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) angiotensin-converting enzyme (c-ACE) has been claimed as a valuable diagnostic tool for NS. However, there is little data evaluating its performance in routine clinical practice.

Findings

We performed a monocentric, retrospective, chart-based study including all patients investigated with a lumbar puncture and c-ACE dosage for suspected NS between 01/01/2006 and 31/12/2012 at the Geneva University Hospital. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were performed to calculate the optimal cut-off value of c-ACE and to determine the discriminative ability of c-ACE. Of the 440 patients included in the study, 9 were diagnosed with NS on the basis of tissue biopsy. Mean c-ACE was not significantly different between NS and non-NS patients. With a cut-off value of 2 (0–2 vs ≥ 3), sensitivity and specificity of c-ACE were 66.7% and 67.3%, respectively.

Conclusions

In our clinical setting, the sensitivity and specificity of c-ACE for NS diagnosis were relatively poor and of little clinical utility.

### Choroidal manifestations of non-ocular sarcoidosis: an enhanced depth imaging OCT study [^112TL4dn]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several reports demonstrated that a subsequent decrease in choroid thickness after steroid treatments when it is initially increased in response to the intraocular inflammation in conditions such as human leukocyte antigen-B27 related uveitis, Behçet's disease, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. Notably, in this non-ocular sarcoidosis group, steroid treatment also showed a significant association with choroidal thickness; Eyes treated with oral steroids had thinner choroid compared with eyes under observation. This choroidal response to the steroid treatment may further support that eyes with non-ocular sarcoidosis are under subclinical choroidal inflammation. Unfortunately, we could not identify serum biomarkers reflecting localized and subclinical choroidal inflammation status in eyes with non-ocular sarcoidosis; Choroidal thickness in the non-ocular sarcoidosis group did not show significant association with CRP (an inflammation marker in various inflammatory systemic diseases) or ACE (a biomarker for systemic sarcoidosis, correlated with the granuloma burden and disease severity) levels. Caution is needed in interpreting these results due to a time gap between blood tests and OCT acquisition caused by referral-to-ophthalmologic screening duration (mean 33.38 ± 41.12 days). Further prospective studies, including additional blood test components besides CRP and ACE, are necessary for validation of this issue.

Age and axial length are considered as significant factors influencing choroidal thickness, with older age and longer axial length associated with reduced total choroidal thickness. However, in this study, a significant association between age and choroidal thickness was found only in healthy control eyes, not in those with non-ocular sarcoidosis. Furthermore, SE, which is expected to reflect axial length, also showed a significant association with choroidal thickness only in healthy control, not in non-ocular sarcoidosis. These findings suggest that pro-inflammatory environment of systemic sarcoidosis may exert a more substantial influence on choroidal thickness than age or axial length alone. While some studies have reported a decrease in choroidal thickness proportional to the rise in intraocular pressure, and others have suggested no correlation, this study found no significant association between intraocular pressure and choroidal thickness in both groups.

### Correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 α-hydroxylase gene expression in alveolar macrophages and the activity of sarcoidosis [^111a8M52]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To demonstrate expression of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 alpha-hydroxylase (1 alpha-hydroxylase) gene in human alveolar macrophages and measure the correlations among the 1 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA level, the activity of sarcoidosis, and calcium metabolism.

Subjects and Methods

We examined 7 patients with sarcoidosis and 6 control patients with other pulmonary disorders who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Levels of 1 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA were measured by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification. We measured serum levels of calcium, ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to evaluate calcium metabolism. To estimate the activity of sarcoidosis, we measured the cell count, the CD4/CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and the serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity.

Results

Expression of 1 alpha-hydroxylase was demonstrated in purified human alveolar macrophages. The 1 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels in bronchoalveolar lavage cells were fivefold higher in sarcoidosis patients than in control patients (10.8 ± 3.6 vs. 2.2 ± 1.4, P < 0.003). Among all patients studied, there were significant correlations between the 1 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA level in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and the percentage of alveolar lymphocytes (r = 0.83, P < 0.005), the CD4/CD8 ratio (r = 0.77, P < 0.02), serum ACE level (r = 0.58, P < 0.05), serum ionized calcium level (r = 0.58, P < 0.05), and the calcitriol/25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ratio (r = 0.57, P < 0.05). In the sarcoidosis patients, a significant correlation was also observed between 1 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA and the percentage of alveolar lymphocytes (r = 0.82, P < 0.05).

Conclusion

There is a correlation between 1 alpha-hydroxylase gene expression in alveolar macrophages with the activity of sarcoidosis and its associated disturbances in calcium metabolism.

### Serial observations of angiotensin-converting enzyme and pulmonary function in sarcoidosis… [^111vRZbJ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Fifty-six measurements of angiotensin-converting enzyme level, diffusing capacity, and total lung capacity were made in 18 sarcoid patients with a maximum of 25 months of follow-up observation. During spontaneous or corticosteroid-induced changes in disease activity, there was a significant inverse correlation between changes in ACE level and changes in DLCO and between changes in ACE level and changes in TLC. These observations suggest that ACE measurement may be a useful adjunct to pulmonary function tests to follow the course of sarcoidosis and to monitor the effects of corticosteroid therapy on the lung.

### Serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme level in patients with cutaneous sarcoidal granulomas… [^113DB5bQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- In a previous study we found that only half of those patients presenting with cutaneous sarcoidal granulomas have evidence of systemic involvement. The current study was designed to determine whether abnormal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were predictive of multisystem disease. Serum ACE levels were determined in 15 patients with active cutaneous sarcoidal granulomas. The ACE levels were elevated in ten of the patients but did not clearly differentiate those with systemic involvement. Three of the six patients with disease localized to the skin had elevated ACE levels, whereas seven of the nine patients with systemic disease had elevated ACE levels. The ACE levels did not correlate with the extent of cutaneous disease, or any individual or combined system involvement. A normal ACE level cannot be used to rule out a diagnosis of sarcoidosis and, conversely, an abnormal level does not confirm multisystem involvement. Callen JP, Hanno R.

### Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity in patients with histoplasmosis… [^115pDQj4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The association between increased serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity and active sarcoidosis is well documented. During a recent outbreak of acute histoplasmosis, a disease that shares many of the clinical and roentgenographic features of sarcoidosis, we examined serum ACE activity. Twenty-one of 86 patients with histoplasmosis had increased serum ACE activity. There were neither roentgenographic nor other substantive clinical differences between the groups of patients with increased and normal ACE values. Therefore, an increase in serum ACE activity must not be assumed to be caused by sarcoidosis unless histoplasmosis had been excluded. Ryder KW, Jay SJ, Kiblawi SO, Hull MT. Serum Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Activity in Patients With Histoplasmosis. JAMA. 1983; 249: 1888–1889.

### Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels in sarcoid arthritis… [^1123jDyK]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level is elevated in 75% of patients with sarcoidosis and often is associated with disease activity. In an attempt to correlate the SACE level with sarcoid arthritis, we did a retrospective chart review of 116 patients with sarcoidosis. Of the 24 patients who complained of arthritis, five were excluded from the study because they were receiving corticosteroids, SACE levels were not determined, or another cause for their arthritis was found. The mean SACE levels were 65 units/mL for the patients with acute arthritis and 51 units/mL for the patients with chronic arthritis. Levels of SACE may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of patients with "seronegative polyarthritis". Sequeira W, Stinar D. Serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Levels in Sarcoid Arthritis.

### Clinical application of measurement of angiotensin-converting enzyme level… [^115rnw9j]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Assay of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the sera of 69 patients demonstrated elevated levels in 19 of 22 of those with clinically active, biopsy-proved sarcoidosis. Patients with dormant sarcoidosis and generally those with various other disorders had normal levels. Elevated levels were also seen in six cases possibly representing sarcoid variants and in one case each of leprosy, carcinoma, tuberculosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and immunoblastic sarcoma. Although ACE is sensitive to active sarcoidosis, the presence of false-positive findings limits its diagnostic usefulness to an adjunctive role; the assay should be combined with medical evaluation and tissue biopsy in selected cases.
