## Question

Is Descovy intended for use as monotherapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Descovy is intended for use as monotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's composition and pharmacologic class. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and any explicit warnings against monotherapy. Next, I should distinguish treatment indications from PrEP to avoid conflating use cases. After that, I will cross-check with clinical trial regimens that incorporate Descovy as a backbone to ensure consistency. Finally, I will synthesize these findings into a clear conclusion with the resistance rationale and safety implications.

> Let me first confirm the composition and classification, because if Descovy were a complete regimen, it would contain more than just a nucleos(t)ide backbone; Descovy is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), both nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, making it a dual-NRTI backbone rather than a complete antiretroviral regimen [^1129eaJX] [^115HSuN1].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled indication for HIV treatment, since the precise wording matters; the FDA label states Descovy is indicated "for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV‑1 infection", which directly implies it is not intended as stand-alone therapy for HIV-1 treatment [^115HSuN1].

> I should double-check for any explicit warnings against monotherapy to avoid misinterpretation; the label is unambiguous that "Descovy alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment", and furthermore cautions that resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection taking only Descovy, underscoring why monotherapy is inappropriate for treatment [^117EWm9s].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on its single-tablet status; I need to distinguish treatment from prevention, because Descovy is a complete regimen for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in select populations with a required negative HIV test prior to initiation and at regular intervals, yet this PrEP use is distinct from HIV treatment and does not imply suitability as monotherapy once infection is established [^115HSuN1] [^116iXobp] [^115z5BQG].

> Next, I should review how Descovy is actually used in treatment regimens in trials and practice, to confirm real-world and guideline-concordant patterns; Descovy functions as the NRTI backbone coformulated with an integrase inhibitor in complete regimens such as bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF), which demonstrates durable efficacy and high barriers to resistance, and as FTC/TAF combined with dolutegravir in triple therapy designs, reinforcing that FTC/TAF alone is insufficient for treatment [^115HSuN1] [^111UgRbh] [^112mgUb4].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions with dual therapy; I need to ensure I don't conflate validated two-drug regimens with an NRTI-only approach; standard initial ART has historically relied on a dual-NRTI backbone plus a third agent from another class, with robust evidence supporting this structure, whereas modern two-drug regimens that are effective pair an integrase inhibitor with a single NRTI (e.g., dolutegravir/lamivudine) in specific scenarios, not two NRTIs alone, so FTC/TAF monotherapy does not align with evidence-based treatment paradigms [^113NnP7Y] [^111YAdjR] [^1122BBNs].

> I should confirm the resistance and safety rationale one more time to close the loop; using only two NRTIs without an additional active agent from a different class increases the risk of virologic failure and resistance selection, which the FDA explicitly warns about in the context of undetected HIV infection among individuals taking only Descovy, further justifying the prohibition of Descovy monotherapy for HIV treatment [^117EWm9s].

> Final answer: No, Descovy is not intended for use as monotherapy for HIV-1 treatment; it is a dual‑NRTI backbone (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) that must be combined with other antiretroviral agent(s) to form a complete regimen, and the FDA label explicitly states that Descovy alone does not constitute a complete treatment regimen and warns of resistance emergence with use in undiagnosed HIV infection; Descovy as a single tablet is appropriate only for the distinct PrEP indication in HIV-negative individuals per labeling [^115HSuN1] [^117EWm9s] [^116iXobp].

---

No, Descovy is **not intended as monotherapy** [^115HSuN1] for HIV-1 treatment. It must be used **with a third antiretroviral** (such as an integrase inhibitor or NNRTI) [^114CzpDj] to achieve and maintain viral suppression [^112mgUb4] and prevent resistance. Monotherapy with Descovy is ineffective and risks rapid resistance and treatment failure [^117EWm9s]. For PrEP, Descovy is used alone in HIV-negative individuals to prevent HIV acquisition [^115z5BQG], but it is not a complete regimen for treating established HIV infection [^115HSuN1] [^117EWm9s].

---

## Indications and approved uses of descovy

Descovy is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), both NRTIs [^1129eaJX]. It is approved for **HIV-1 treatment** in combination with other antiretroviral agents in adults and pediatric patients weighing ≥ 35 kg [^115HSuN1], and for **HIV-1 PrEP** in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg to reduce sexual acquisition of HIV-1, excluding receptive vaginal sex [^115HSuN1] [^114L23Ej].

---

## Descovy in HIV-1 treatment: combination therapy requirement

For HIV-1 treatment, Descovy is indicated only **in combination with other antiretroviral agents** [^115HSuN1]. It provides the NRTI backbone and requires a **third agent** (typically an integrase inhibitor or NNRTI) [^114CzpDj] to achieve durable viral suppression and prevent resistance [^113NnP7Y].

---

## Risks and consequences of descovy monotherapy in HIV-1 treatment

- **Descovy monotherapy** is **strongly discouraged** due to:

- **Rapid resistance**: HIV quickly develops resistance to NRTIs when used alone, compromising future options [^117EWm9s].

- **Virologic failure**: Monotherapy cannot sustain suppression, leading to rebound and disease progression.

- **Clinical guidelines**: All major guidelines recommend at least three active agents for initial and maintenance therapy [^114CzpDj].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Extensive evidence supports Descovy as part of combination therapy, including **Bictegravir/FTC/TAF** [^114CzpDj], which demonstrated high efficacy and no emergent resistance through 240 weeks in randomized trials, and **Dolutegravir-based regimens**, in which DTG plus FTC/TAF [^112mgUb4] shows high efficacy and tolerability in first-line therapy.

---

## Descovy in HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

For PrEP, Descovy is **used alone in HIV-negative individuals** to prevent HIV acquisition [^115z5BQG]; however, it is **not a complete regimen** for treating established HIV infection and should not be used as monotherapy in HIV-positive individuals [^117EWm9s] [^115HSuN1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current DHHS, IAS-USA, and EACS guidelines emphasize that **combination therapy** is required — Descovy must be combined with other antiretrovirals for HIV-1 treatment [^114CzpDj]. They also clarify **PrEP use**: Descovy alone is appropriate only for HIV-negative individuals at risk of HIV acquisition [^115HSuN1].

---

## Summary of descovy usage recommendations

| **Indication** | **Recommended usage** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| HIV-1 treatment | Combination therapy with other antiretrovirals | Prevent resistance and achieve viral suppression |
| HIV-1 PrEP | Monotherapy in HIV-negative individuals | Prevent HIV acquisition |

---

Descovy is **not intended as monotherapy** for HIV-1 treatment [^115HSuN1]; it must be combined with other antiretrovirals to prevent resistance and achieve suppression [^113NnP7Y]. Monotherapy is appropriate only for **PrEP in HIV-negative individuals** [^115z5BQG].

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^114CzpDj]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended in initial antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection according to multiple guidelines, including those from the Department of Health and Human Services, the International Antiviral Society-USA, and the European AIDS Clinical Society. The recommended INSTIs, bictegravir (B or BIC) and dolutegravir (DTG), exhibit excellent efficacy and tolerability, require once-daily dosing, have few drug interactions, and possess high barriers to resistance.

BIC is available as a coformulated single-tablet regimen with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine (F or FTC). This combination, B/F/TAF, was compared to two guideline-recommended DTG-based 3-drug regimens in two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials. B/F/TAF was compared to DTG/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) in one study and to DTG plus F/TAF in the other. Both studies found B/F/TAF to be non-inferior to the DTG-based regimens, with high rates of viral suppression and no treatment-emergent resistance through 144 weeks.

After all participants completed at least 144 weeks of the blinded study drug, unblinding occurred, and participants were offered the opportunity to switch to open-label B/F/TAF for an additional 96 weeks, totaling 240 weeks of follow-up on the study. To inform the safety and efficacy profile of B/F/TAF over 5 years, this long-term study reports results for those originally assigned to B/F/TAF, including the percentage of participants who maintained HIV-1 suppression to below 50 copies/mL.

### Descovy [^117EWm9s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Use Descovy for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy. This strategy should include adherence to daily administration and safer sex practices, such as consistent condom use, to further reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the time from initiation of Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP to achieving maximal protection against HIV-1 infection is currently unknown.

The risk of HIV-1 acquisition may involve behavioral, biological, or epidemiological factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, engaging in condomless sex, having a history of STIs, self-identifying as at risk for HIV, having sexual partners with unknown HIV-1 viremic status, or engaging in sexual activities within high-prevalence areas or networks.

- **Additional prevention measures**: Counsel individuals on the importance of using additional prevention strategies such as correct condom use, knowing their partner(s)' HIV-1 status including viral suppression status, and undergoing regular testing for STIs that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission. Inform and support uninfected individuals in efforts to reduce their sexual risk behaviors.

Use Descovy to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals who have been confirmed to be HIV-1 negative. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only Descovy, as Descovy alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, care should be taken to minimize the risk of initiating or continuing Descovy in individuals who are not confirmed as HIV-1 negative.

### Descovy [^115HSuN1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**:

- **HIV-1 treatment**: Descovy is a two-drug combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), both HIV nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It is indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. Additionally, it can be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents, excluding protease inhibitors requiring a CYP3A inhibitor, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg and less than 35 kg.

- **HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Descovy is indicated for use in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection from sexual acquisition, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex. It is crucial for individuals to have a negative HIV-1 test immediately prior to initiating Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP.

- **Limitations of use**: The indication does not include the use of Descovy in individuals at risk of HIV-1 from receptive vaginal sex, as effectiveness in this population has not been evaluated.

### Safety and pharmacokinetics of a tenofovir alafenamide fumarate-emtricitabine based oral antiretroviral regimen for prevention of HIV acquisition in women: A randomized controlled trial [^114L23Ej]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

TDF, in combination with FTC (F/TDF), is approved as Truvada® (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA) for both treatment and prevention of HIV acquisition. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is another antiretroviral (ARV) prodrug of tenofovir (TFV) with improved safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties over TDF. TAF 25 mg, in combination with FTC 200 mg (F/TAF 25), has also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Descovy® (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA) for the treatment of HIV infection and for HIV prevention in individuals who are at risk for sexually acquired HIV other than through vaginal intercourse. Unlike F/TDF, there is no approval of F/TAF 25 for the prevention of vaginal acquisition of HIV-1 among healthy women. TAF is more potent than TDF, which results in significantly higher active metabolite concentrations in lymphoid cells and tissues and demonstrates higher antiviral activity in target cells with less long-term toxicity in tissues, particularly kidney and bone. Therefore, an oral PrEP regimen based on TAF may be safer and potentially more forgiving of imperfect adherence for HIV prevention. The active metabolites of TFV and FTC, TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) and FTC-triphosphate (FTC-TP), compete with endogenous deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into the proviral DNA of HIV, resulting in strand termination and determining the activity of the two drugs.

The study evaluated the short-term safety and systemic and genital tract pharmacokinetics of two oral forms of daily F/TAF-based regimens compared to…

### Descovy [^1129eaJX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Descovy (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide) is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for oral administration. FTC, a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine, is an HIV nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (HIV NRTI). TAF, also an HIV NRTI, is converted in vivo to tenofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (nucleotide) analog of adenosine 5′-monophosphate.

Descovy tablets are available in two dose strengths:

- **200 mg/25 mg tablets**: Contain 200 mg of FTC and 25 mg of TAF (equivalent to 28 mg of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate).

- **120 mg/15 mg tablets**: Contain 120 mg of FTC and 15 mg of TAF (equivalent to 16.8 mg of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate).

Both dose strengths of Descovy tablets include the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The 200 mg/25 mg tablets are film-coated with a coating material containing indigo carmine aluminum lake, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide. The 120 mg/15 mg tablets are film-coated with a coating material containing polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, and talc.

- **Emtricitabine**: The chemical name of FTC is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-(2R-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolan-5S-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin-2-one. FTC is the (-)enantiomer of a thio analog of cytidine, which differs from other cytidine analogs in that it has a fluorine in the 5 position. FTC has a molecular formula of C8H10FN3O3S and a molecular weight of 247.24.

### Tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and efavirenz vs. zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz for HIV [^113NnP7Y]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Durable suppression of replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depends on the use of potent, well-tolerated antiretroviral regimens to which patients can easily adhere.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, noninferiority study involving 517 patients with HIV infection who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy. These patients were randomly assigned to receive either a regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF), emtricitabine, and efavirenz once daily (tenofovir-emtricitabine group) or a regimen of fixed-dose zidovudine and lamivudine twice daily plus efavirenz once daily (zidovudine-lamivudine group). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without baseline resistance to efavirenz whose HIV RNA level was less than 400 copies per milliliter at week 48 of the study.

- **Results**: Through week 48, significantly more patients in the tenofovir-emtricitabine group reached and maintained the primary endpoint of less than 400 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter than did those in the zidovudine-lamivudine group (84 percent vs. 73 percent, respectively; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, 4 to 19 percent; P = 0.002). This difference excludes the inferiority of the tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and efavirenz regimen, indicating a significantly greater response with this regimen. Significant differences were also observed in the proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter (80 percent in the tenofovir-emtricitabine group vs. 70 percent in the zidovudine-lamivudine group).

### Abacavir-lamivudine versus tenofovir-emtricitabine for initial HIV-1 therapy [^111YAdjR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Use of fixed-dose combination nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with a nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor is recommended as initial therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, which NRTI combination has greater efficacy and safety is not known.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, blinded equivalence study involving 1,858 eligible patients, we compared four once-daily antiretroviral regimens as initial therapy for HIV-1 infection: abacavir-lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)-emtricitabine, plus efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from randomization to virologic failure, defined as a confirmed HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 1,000 copies per milliliter at or after 16 weeks and before 24 weeks, or ≥ 200 copies per milliliter at or after 24 weeks.

- **Results**: A scheduled interim review by an independent data and safety monitoring board showed significant differences in virologic efficacy according to the NRTI combination among patients with screening HIV-1 RNA levels of 100,000 copies per milliliter or more. At a median follow-up of 60 weeks, among the 797 patients with such screening levels, the time to virologic failure was significantly shorter in the abacavir-lamivudine group than in the tenofovir DF-emtricitabine group (hazard ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.46 to 3.72; P < 0.001), with 57 virologic failures (14%) in the abacavir-lamivudine group.

### Dolutegravir plus two different prodrugs of tenofovir to treat HIV [^112mgUb4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Two drugs under consideration for inclusion in antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are dolutegravir (DTG) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF). There are limited data on their use in low- and middle-income countries.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 96-week, phase 3, investigator-led, open-label, randomized trial in South Africa. We compared a triple-therapy combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and DTG plus either of two tenofovir prodrugs — TAF (TAF-based group) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (TDF-based group) — against the local standard-of-care regimen of TDF-FTC-efavirenz (standard-care group). Inclusion criteria included an age of 12 years or older, no receipt of ART in the previous 6 months, a creatinine clearance of more than 60 mL per minute (> 80 mL per minute in patients younger than 19 years of age), and an HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of 500 copies or more per milliliter. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a 48-week HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter (as determined with the Snapshot algorithm from the Food and Drug Administration; noninferiority margin, -10 percentage points). We report the primary (48-week) efficacy and safety data.

- **Results**: A total of 1053 patients underwent randomization from February 2017 through May 2018. More than 99% of the patients were black, and 59% were female. The mean age was 32 years, and the mean CD4 count was 337 cells per cubic millimeter. At week 48, the percentage of patients with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than…

### Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide vs emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (DISCOVER): Primary results from a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^115z5BQG]. Lancet (2020).

Tenofovir alafenamide demonstrates high antiviral efficacy and improved renal and bone safety compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when used for HIV treatment. Here, we report primary results from a blinded phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide versus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention.

- **Methods**: This study is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial conducted at 94 community, public health, and hospital-associated clinics in regions of Europe and North America, where there is a high incidence of HIV or prevalence of people living with HIV, or both. We enrolled adult cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men, all with a high risk of acquiring HIV based on their self-reported sexual behavior in the past 12 weeks or their recent history (within 24 weeks of enrolment) of bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Participants with previous use of PrEP with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were not excluded.

We used a computer-generated random allocation sequence to assign participants randomly (1:1) to receive either emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group), or emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group).

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^111UgRbh]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

For both studies, 48-week, 96-week, and 144-week efficacy and safety data have previously been reported. After 144 weeks, all participants in both studies were offered an optional 96-week study extension with open-label B/F/TAF, with study visits occurring every 12 weeks. To summarize long-term outcomes for B/F/TAF, this analysis focuses on participants from both studies who were originally assigned to B/F/TAF through 240 weeks (144 weeks of blinded phase + 96 weeks of open-label phase), i.e. 5 years of treatment.

The studies were undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by central or site-specific review boards or ethics committees. All participants provided written informed consent. Study 1489: EudraCT 2015–004024–54. Study 1490: EudraCT 2015–003988–10.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^117R1QWx]. AIDS (2024). Low credibility.

Although one case of new-onset HBV infection was reported in the DTG/ABC/3TC group during the blinded phase, no cases were reported in participants on B/F/TAF, consistent with the prophylactic activity of TAF against HBV.

This study has several limitations. While the first 144 weeks of studies 1489 and 1490 were blinded, the data presented here are based on an optional OLE of those studies. This open-label design may have introduced some bias into the results. Although a 96-week treatment period allows us to monitor medium-term efficacy and safety, we cannot exclude the possibility of adverse events or complications that can only be detected with longer follow-up. However, the efficacy and safety results were consistent with outcomes during the first 144 weeks. The timing of the switch was protocol-defined in this study, so it may not reflect how people chose to switch regimens in real life. A proportion of data was also missing for some participants, and some follow-up visits did not take place because of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, similar rates of discontinuation were observed in other antiretroviral studies conducted during this period.

- **Participant decision**:
	- The most common reasons for discontinuation were participant decision, loss to follow-up, and investigator's decision.
	- There was a very low percentage of participants who discontinued due to an adverse event (2% in those who switched from DTG/ABC/3TC; 0% in those who switched from DTG+F/TAF).
	- However, M = E and M = F analyses of viral suppression should sufficiently account for any missing data.

### Coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide after initial treatment with bictegravir or dolutegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide [^111iAJo4]. AIDS (2018). High credibility.

A phase 2, randomized, active-controlled study of initial antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir or dolutegravir in combination with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide showed excellent efficacy. After 60 weeks of blinded treatment, participants switched to a single-tablet regimen of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Switching maintained viral suppression in all participants who remained on the study through 12 weeks in the open-label phase and was safe and well tolerated.

### Impact of switching from efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide on psychiatric symptoms and neurocognition [^112zRT3o]. AIDS (2025). Low credibility.

Efavirenz (EFV) has played a decisive role in HIV treatment strategies due to its therapeutic effectiveness and regimen simplicity. However, the use of EFV-based combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is now an alternative option for first-line therapy. This is supported by some international guidelines, citing reasons such as neuropsychological tolerability. While neuropsychiatric symptoms, typically short-lasting after therapy initiation, are well recognized and mostly transient, symptoms like abnormal dreams, dizziness, somatization, irritability, and stress can persist in some individuals for several months or years. A proportion of individuals may experience depression at any time during treatment with EFV. In contrast, the association between EFV and neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains unclear and controversial. Some cohort studies associate worse neurocognitive performances with EFV, while others do not. Moreover, replacing EFV does not appear to be associated with changes in neurocognitive performance in prospective studies.

Bictegravir (BIC) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) approved as first-line treatment in cART-naive and virologically suppressed individuals. It is combined with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) in a single tablet regimen (STR).

Whether changes in ART towards more innovative regimens, such as BIC/FTC/TAF, have an impact on neuropsychological symptoms and/or cognition has not yet been investigated.

### SPL drug information for emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide fumarate [^111Nqxgn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide PO (also known as Descovy) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Monitor CD4 counts and plasma HIV RNA; viral load should be assessed. Perform standard glucose screening. A first trimester ultrasound is recommended for gestational age assessment. A second trimester ultrasound can be used for both anatomical survey and determination of gestational age.

Antiretroviral therapy should be provided to all patients during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count. Using highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and to minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. Begin HAART as soon as pregnancy is recognized or HIV is diagnosed. HIV guidelines recommend the use of emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as a preferred 2-NRTI backbone in patients who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.

The drug emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide PO (also known as Descovy) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^114RGSrc]. AIDS (2024). High credibility.

The number of people with HIV accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasing, from 7.8 million in 2010 to 28.7 million in 2021. Furthermore, increased longevity on HIV therapy means that people will require decades of ART. Managing emerging comorbidities and drug interactions as people age on ART is an increasing challenge. Simplification of treatment regimens and treatment switches to optimize care may be needed. There are many different reasons why a provider or patient may want or need to switch their ART regimen. Evaluating medium- and long-term clinical trial outcomes, where available, can guide decisions on optimal treatment options for specific subpopulations.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a three-drug, fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen containing an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, bictegravir, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine and TAF. Clinical trial results have shown that B/F/TAF is highly effective and well tolerated in adults. There is also growing evidence supporting the use of B/F/TAF in routine clinical practice.

B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) is approved for adults in many countries around the world and is recommended in international HIV guidelines in high-income countries, both as first-line and as a switch regimen for those with virologic suppression.

Study 1489 and Study 1490 are randomized, double-blinded, phase 3 clinical trials that evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of either dolutegravir (DTG)-based treatment or B/F/TAF over 144 weeks.

### Tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, coformulated with elvitegravir, cobicistat, and emtricitabine, for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection: two randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trials [^111VEwvz]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can cause renal and bone toxic effects related to high plasma tenofovir concentrations. Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel tenofovir prodrug with a 90% reduction in plasma tenofovir concentrations. Regimens containing tenofovir alafenamide can potentially offer improved renal and bone safety compared with those containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: In these two controlled, double-blind phase 3 studies, we recruited treatment-naive HIV-infected patients with an estimated creatinine clearance of 50 mL per minute or higher from 178 outpatient centres in 16 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily oral tablets containing 150 mg elvitegravir, 150 mg cobicistat, 200 mg emtricitabine, and 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/tenofovir alafenamide) or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with a matching placebo. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size of 4) and was stratified by HIV-1 RNA, CD4 count, and region (USA or ex-USA). Investigators, patients, study staff, and those assessing outcomes were masked to the treatment group. All participants who received one dose of the study drug were included in the primary intention-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses. The main outcomes were the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm (pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 12%), and pre-specified renal and bone endpoints at 48 weeks.

### Descovy [^111d5VnG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Emtricitabine: FTC was administered orally to pregnant mice at doses of 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day through organogenesis, which occurred on gestation days 6 through 15 for mice, and 7 through 19 for rabbits. No significant toxicological effects were observed in the embryo-fetal toxicity studies performed with FTC in mice at exposures (area under the curve [AUC]) approximately 60 times higher, and in rabbits at approximately 108 times higher, than human exposures at the recommended daily dose. A pre/postnatal development study on FTC showed that mice given doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day exhibited no significant adverse effects directly related to the drug. The offspring exposed daily from before birth, in utero, through sexual maturity experienced daily exposures (AUC) approximately 60-fold higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose.

Tenofovir alafenamide: TAF was administered orally to pregnant rats at doses of 25, 100, or 250 mg/kg/day and to rabbits at doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day through organogenesis which occurred on gestation days 6 through 17 for rats, and 7 through 20 for rabbits. No adverse embryo-fetal effects were observed in rats and rabbits at TAF exposures approximately similar to rats and 53 times higher than those in humans at the recommended daily dose of Descovy. TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir, and the observed tenofovir exposures in rats and rabbits were 59 and 93 times higher, respectively, than human tenofovir exposures at the recommended daily dose.

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: Five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^116Wvvnf]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single-tablet regimen recommended for HIV-1 treatment. The safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF as initial therapy were established in two Phase 3 studies: 1489 (versus dolutegravir [DTG]/abacavir/lamivudine) and 1490 (versus DTG + F/TAF). After 144 weeks of randomized follow-up, an open-label extension evaluated B/F/TAF to 240 weeks.

- **Methods**: Of 634 participants randomized to B/F/TAF, 519 completed the double-blinded treatment, and 506/634 (80%) chose the 96-week open-label B/F/TAF extension, which was completed by 444/506 (88%) participants. Efficacy was based on the secondary outcome of the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240, assessed by missing = excluded and missing = failure methods. All 634 participants who were randomized to B/F/TAF and received at least one dose of B/F/TAF were included in efficacy and safety analyses. (Study 1489: ClinicalTrials.govNCT02607930; EudraCT 2015–004024–54. Study 1490: ClinicalTrials.govNCT02607956; EudraCT 2015–003988–10).

- **Findings**: Of those with available virologic data, 98.6% (95% CI [97.0%-99.5%], 426/432) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 (missing = excluded); when missing virologic data were considered as failure, 67.2% (95% CI [63.4%-70.8%], 426/634) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The mean (SD) change in CD4+ count from baseline was +338 (236.2) cells/μL. No treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected. Adverse events led to drug discontinuation in 1.6% (n = 10/634) of participants, with n = 5 having events considered drug-related.

### Dolutegravir plus lamivudine versus dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection (GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2): week 48 results from two multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials [^116kGBER]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Effective two-drug regimens could decrease long-term drug exposure and toxicity in HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART). We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a two-drug regimen compared with a three-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-naive adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted two identically designed, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials: GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2. Both studies were conducted at 192 centres in 21 countries. We included participants (≥ 18 years) with HIV-1 infection and a screening HIV-1 RNA of 500,000 copies per mL or less, who were naive to ART. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive either a once-daily two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg) or a once-daily three-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg). Both drug regimens were administered orally. We masked participants and investigators to the treatment assignment: dolutegravir was administered as single-entity tablets (similar to its commercial formulation, except with a different film color), and lamivudine tablets and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine tablets were over-encapsulated to visually match each other. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 in the intention-to-treat-exposed population, using the Snapshot algorithm and a non-inferiority margin of -10%. Safety analyses were conducted on the safety population. GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 are registered with…

### Descovy [^114BD5ek]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: In clinical trials of an FTC+TAF-containing regimen for the treatment of HIV-1, 80 of the 97 subjects enrolled aged 65 years and over received FTC+TAF and EVG+COBI. No differences in safety or efficacy have been observed between elderly subjects and adults between 18 and less than 65 years of age.

- **Renal impairment**: No dosage adjustment of DESCOVY is recommended in individuals with estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL per minute, or in adults with ESRD (estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL per minute) who are receiving chronic hemodialysis. On days of hemodialysis, administer the daily dose of DESCOVY after completion of hemodialysis treatment. The safety and effectiveness of DESCOVY coadministered with an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, which is administered with either ritonavir or cobicistat, have not been established in patients with ESRD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. DESCOVY is not recommended in individuals with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 15 to below 30 mL per minute), or in individuals with ESRD who are not receiving chronic hemodialysis, as the safety of DESCOVY has not been established in these populations [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: No dosage adjustment of DESCOVY is recommended in individuals with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. DESCOVY has not been studied in individuals with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Descovy [^116iXobp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (HBV) have been reported in HBV-infected individuals who have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and may occur with the discontinuation of DESCOVY. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals who are infected with HBV and discontinue DESCOVY. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

DESCOVY used for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and at least every 3 months during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with the use of FTC/TDF for HIV-1 PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate DESCOVY for HIV-1 PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless a negative infection status is confirmed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Once-daily darunavir/ritonavir and abacavir/lamivudine versus tenofovir/emtricitabine for treatment-naïve patients with a baseline viral load of more than 100000 copies/ml [^111whaMx]. AIDS (2013). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of fixed-dose abacavir/lamivudine compared to tenofovir/emtricitabine, both administered with once-daily darunavir/ritonavir, were examined in 80 treatment-naïve patients with a baseline HIV-1 viral load of more than 100,000 copies/ml. The time to virologic failure by 48 weeks was not different between the two groups. The percentage of patients with viral suppression was not significantly different within the per protocol population. Tenofovir/emtricitabine demonstrated better tolerability; more patients on abacavir/lamivudine switched regimens than those on tenofovir/emtricitabine. A randomized trial to further elucidate the efficacy and safety of these two regimens is warranted.

### Switching to coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir versus continuation of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with emtricitabine and tenofovir in virologically suppressed adults with HIV (STRATEGY-NNRTI): 48 week results of a randomised, open-label, phase 3b non-inferiority trial [^1115VdHr]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) might be a safe and efficacious switch option for virologically suppressed patients with HIV who experience neuropsychiatric side effects on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or who are on a multitablet NNRTI-containing regimen and want a regimen simplification. We assessed the non-inferiority of such a switch compared with the continuation of an NNRTI-containing regimen.

- **Methods**: STRATEGY-NNRTI is a 96-week, international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3b, non-inferiority trial enrolling adults (≥ 18 years) with HIV-1 and plasma HIV RNA viral load below 50 copies per mL for at least 6 months on an NNRTI plus emtricitabine and tenofovir regimen. With a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly allocated participants (2:1; blocks of six, stratified by efavirenz use at screening) to switch to coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir (switch group) or continue the NNRTI plus emtricitabine and tenofovir regimen (no-switch group). Key eligibility criteria included no history of virological failure and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 70 mL per min or greater. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma viral loads below 50 copies per mL at week 48 based on a snapshot algorithm with a non-inferiority margin of 12% (assessed by modified intention to treat). This trial is ongoing and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01495702.

### Randomized clinical trial on efficacy of fixed-dose efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine on alternate days versus continuous treatment [^116816RL]. AIDS (2019). High credibility.

Antiretrovirals with long half-lives, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and efavirenz (EFV), are suitable for reduced frequency dosing, with the potential for improved adherence and reduced toxicity and costs. The objective of this study was to investigate the noninferiority of the TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination on alternate days versus the standard regimen in virologically suppressed patients.

- **Design**: This study utilized a randomized-controlled open-label noninferiority trial enrolling HIV-1-infected patients who had been treated for at least six months with the TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination. Participants who were virologically suppressed (< 40 HIV-RNA copies/ml) with EFV plasma concentrations greater than 1000 ng/ml were randomized to either maintain the TDF/FTC/EFV standard-of-care regimen (SOC, Arm A) or switch to TDF/FTC/EFV on alternate days (ATAD, Arm B).

- **Methods**: The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with less than 40 HIV-RNA copies/ml at week 48.

- **Results**: A total of 197 patients were randomized (98 in the SOC and 99 in the ATAD arm). Of these, 179 (90.3%) were men, with a median age of 43.2 years, and 133 (67.5%) identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). The CD4+ T-cell count at baseline was 706 cells/μl in the SOC arm and 632 cells/μl in the ATAD arm. At week 48, 95 (96.9%) patients in the SOC group and 93 (93.9%) in the ATAD group had a virological response, resulting in an overall risk difference of -3.0% (95% CI: -8.86%/2.86%). The median change from baseline at week 48 in CD4+ T-cell count was 29.4 cells/μl (95% CI: 2.5/56.4) in the SOC arm (P = 0.008) and 61.0 cells/μl (95% CI: 32.1/89.9) in the ATAD arm (P < 0.001).

### Co-formulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate versus ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus co-formulated emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection: A randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^1119LTdh]. Lancet (2012). High credibility.

The HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) has been co-formulated with the CYP3A4 inhibitor cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) into a once-daily, single tablet. We compared EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF with a ritonavir-boosted (RTV) protease inhibitor regimen of atazanavir (ATV)/RTV+FTC/TDF as initial therapy for HIV-1 infection.

- **Methods**: This phase 3, non-inferiority study enrolled treatment-naive patients with an HIV-1 RNA concentration of 5000 copies per mL or more and susceptibility to atazanavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF or ATV/RTV+FTC/TDF plus matching placebos, administered once daily. Randomisation was by a computer-generated random sequence, accessed via an interactive telephone and web response system. Patients, investigators, and study staff who gave treatments, assessed outcomes, or analysed data were masked to the assignment. The primary endpoint was HIV RNA concentration of 50 copies per mL or less after 48 weeks (according to the US FDA snapshot algorithm), with a 12% non-inferiority margin. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01106586.

- **Findings**: 1017 patients were screened, 715 were enrolled, and 708 were treated (353 with EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF and 355 with ATV/RTV+FTC/TDF). EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF was non-inferior to ATV/RTV+FTC/TDF for the primary outcome (316 patients [89.5%] vs 308 patients [86.8%], adjusted difference 3.0%, 95% CI -1.9% to 7.8%). Both regimens had favourable safety and tolerability.

### Descovy [^116vGLVz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Use of Descovy in pediatric patients between 2 to less than 6 years of age and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies. These include trials of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI in adults and a separate open-label trial of FTC+TAF with bictegravir in virologically-suppressed pediatric patients aged at least 2 years and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg through Week 24 (N = 22; cohort 3). The safety and efficacy of FTC+TAF in these pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults who received FTC+TAF with bictegravir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The safety and effectiveness of Descovy coadministered with an HIV-1 protease inhibitor that is administered with either ritonavir or cobicistat have not been established in pediatric patients weighing less than 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Moreover, the safety and effectiveness of Descovy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients weighing less than 14 kg have not been established.

- **HIV-1 PrEP**: The safety and effectiveness of Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP in at-risk adolescents weighing at least 35 kg, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex, are supported by data from an adequate and well-controlled trial of Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP in adults. Additional data come from safety and pharmacokinetic studies in previously conducted trials with the individual drug products, FTC and TAF, with EVG+COBI, in HIV-1 infected adults and pediatric subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Efficacy and safety of dolutegravir with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate HIV antiretroviral therapy regimens started in pregnancy (IMPAACT 2010/VESTED): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^117GmQYG]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is important for both maternal health and the prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission; however, adequate data on the safety and efficacy of different ART regimens likely to be used by pregnant women are scarce. In this trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of three antiretroviral regimens started in pregnancy: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the United States, and Zimbabwe). Pregnant women (aged ≥ 18 years) with confirmed HIV-1 infection and at 14–28 weeks' gestation were eligible. Women who had previously taken antiretrovirals were excluded (up to 14 days of ART during pregnancy was permitted), as were women known to be pregnant with multiple fetuses or those with known fetal anomaly or a history of psychiatric illness. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a central computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was done using permuted blocks (size six) stratified by gestational age (14–18, 19–23, and 24–28 weeks' gestation) and country. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg, and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^117Y2gJF]. AIDS (2024). High credibility.

Participants in studies 1489 and 1490 who switched to B/F/TAF from a DTG-containing regimen maintained high rates of virologic suppression, with no emergent resistance. The treatment was well tolerated, and there were no new safety signals reported during medium-term B/F/TAF treatment. These results provide further medium-term evidence of B/F/TAF safety and efficacy in people with HIV who switch from a DTG-based therapy.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^112oEkRZ]. AIDS (2024). Low credibility.

Overall, 519 of 534 (97.2%) participants who completed 144 weeks of DTG-based ART were switched to B/F/TAF and included in this analysis: 254 of 260 participants from Study 1489 and 265 of 274 participants from Study 1490. In total, 457 of 519 (88.1%) participants completed Week 240 (OLE Week 96); 221 of 254 (87.0%) participants from Study 1489 and 236 of 265 (89.1%) from Study 1490 (Fig. 1).

Demographics and clinical characteristics at the time of B/F/TAF start are summarized as follows. Participants in the OLE of both studies were predominantly male (88.6% in Study 1489 and 90.2% in Study 1490). The median age at the time of B/F/TAF initiation was 36 years in Study 1489 and 38 years in Study 1490. In both studies, approximately one-third of participants who switched to B/F/TAF were Black, and over one-fifth were Hispanic/Latinx. The median CD4+ cell count at the time of B/F/TAF start was 766 cells/μl in Study 1489 and 730 cells/μl in Study 1490.

### Population modeling highlights drug disposition differences between tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the blood and semen [^1137q32S]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Understanding antiretroviral disposition in the male genital tract, a distinct viral compartment, can provide insight into the eradication of HIV. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted to investigate the disposition of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and emtricitabine, along with their metabolites in blood and semen. Blood plasma and seminal plasma (SP) concentrations of tenofovir and emtricitabine were measured, as well as tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine-triphosphate concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and seminal mononuclear cells.

Sequential compartmental modeling described drug disposition in blood and semen. Our modeling suggests slower elimination of apparent tenofovir-diphosphate PBMC and faster elimination of tenofovir SP after administration of TAF compared to TDF, likely reflecting flip-flop kinetics. Additionally, TAF metabolism to tenofovir appeared slower in semen compared to blood; however, SP elimination of TAF-derived tenofovir appeared faster than its blood plasma elimination. These findings provide valuable insight for further mechanistic study of cellular entry and drug metabolism in the male genital tract.

### Effect of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine on nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load burden amongst outpatients with COVID-19: A pilot, randomized, open-label phase 2 trial [^116HYtAY]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

The new results reported here could shed more light on the observational associations between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine use, COVID-19 risk of infection, and COVID-19 related outcomes. In a cohort of 77,590 people living with HIV in Spain, Del Amo and collaborators reported a protective effect of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine compared to other antiretroviral therapies in reducing the risk for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization. Acknowledging the large sample size and the magnitude of this association, channeling bias was a reasonable alternative interpretation because younger patients with no comorbidity are more likely to: (i) receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and (ii) have a good COVID-19 prognosis. Noteworthy, these findings were robust to stratification on age and instrumental variable analyses.

In a cohort study of 750 men who have sex with men and transgender women, also from Spain, PrEP users who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies showed twice more asymptomatic infection (42.7% of PrEP users vs. 21.7% of non-PrEP users; p = 0.07). In the Spanish HIV Research Network Cohort, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine therapy was independently associated with a 3-fold lower prevalence of COVID-19 seropositivity (5/154 (3.2%) versus 40/416 (9.6%) with tenofovir alafenamide therapy, adjusted Odds Ratio, 0.32, 95% confidence interval (0.12 to 0.84); p = .021), controlling for age, sex, and comorbidities.

Finally, people living with HIV in South Africa with documented antiretrovirals dispensed in the last 12 months who…

### Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed patients with chronic hepatitis B: A randomised, double-blind, phase 3, multicentre non-inferiority study [^111FibiR]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with renal toxicity or reductions in bone mineral density, or both, in some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir alafenamide is a tenofovir prodrug with high intrahepatic concentrations of active drug and reduced systemic tenofovir exposures compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In patients with chronic HBV, tenofovir alafenamide has shown efficacy non-inferior to that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with improved renal and bone safety. With this non-inferiority study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide in patients with HBV infection switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who are virally suppressed.

- **Methods**: Patients with chronic HBV infection who had been receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 48 weeks or more and who had HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for at least 12 weeks were recruited to this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once a day or to continue tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once a day. The primary efficacy endpoint was loss of virological control, defined as the proportion of patients who received at least one dose of study drug who had HBV DNA of at least 20 IU/mL at week 48 by the modified US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm. Key safety endpoints were changes in hip and spine bone mineral density, estimated creatinine clearance.

### Ritonavir-boosted darunavir combined with raltegravir or tenofovir-emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naive adults infected with HIV-1: 96 week results from the NEAT001/ANRS143 randomised non-inferiority trial [^111FroLB]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Standard first-line antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection includes two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), but these drugs have limitations. We assessed the 96-week efficacy and safety of an NtRTI-sparing regimen.

- **Methods**: Between August 2010 and September 2011, we enrolled treatment-naive adults into this randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial in 15 European countries. The composite primary outcome was change to randomized treatment before week 32 due to insufficient virological response, no virological response by week 32, HIV-1 RNA concentration of 50 copies per mL or higher at any time after week 32; death from any cause; any new or recurrent AIDS event; or any serious non-AIDS event. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral treatment with 400 mg raltegravir twice daily plus 800 mg darunavir and 100 mg ritonavir once daily (NtRTI-sparing regimen) or tenofovir-emtricitabine in a 245 mg and 200 mg fixed-dose combination once daily, plus 800 mg darunavir and 100 mg ritonavir once daily (standard regimen). This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01066962.

- **Findings**: Of 805 patients enrolled, 401 received the NtRTI-sparing regimen and 404 the standard regimen, with a median follow-up of 123 weeks (IQR 112–133). Treatment failure was seen in 77 (19%) in the NtRTI-sparing group and 61 (15%) in the standard group. Kaplan-Meier estimated proportions of treatment failure by week 96 were 17.8% and 13.8%, respectively (difference 4.0%, 95% CI -0.8 to 8.8).

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^113WDnfZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Through 48 weeks, 7 subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 5 subjects in the zidovudine/lamivudine group experienced a new CDC Class C event (10 and 6 subjects through 144 weeks).

- **Study 907: Treatment-experienced adult patients**: Study 907 was a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets added to a stable background regimen of antiretroviral agents in 550 treatment-experienced subjects. After 24 weeks of blinded trial treatment, all subjects continuing on trial were offered open-label tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for an additional 24 weeks. Subjects had a mean baseline CD4+ cell count of 427 cells/mm³ (range 23 to 1385), median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA of 2340 (range 50 to 75,000) copies/mL, and mean duration of prior HIV-1 treatment was 5.4 years. The mean age of the subjects was 42 years; 85% were male, 69% Caucasian, 17% Black, and 12% Hispanic.

The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL and outcomes of subjects through 48 weeks are summarized in Table 20.

- **Table 20: Outcomes of randomized treatment (Study 907)**

a. Subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL and no prior study drug discontinuation at Week 24 and 48, respectively.

b. Subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL, efficacy failure, or missing HIV-1 RNA at Week 24 and 48, respectively.

c. Includes lost to follow-up, subject withdrawal, noncompliance, protocol violation, and other reasons.

At 24 weeks of therapy, there was a higher proportion of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets arm.

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: Five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^114fE8HM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single-tablet regimen recommended for HIV-1 treatment. The safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF as initial therapy were established in two Phase 3 studies: 1489 (versus dolutegravir [DTG]/abacavir/lamivudine) and 1490 (versus DTG + F/TAF). After 144 weeks of randomized follow-up, an open-label extension evaluated B/F/TAF to 240 weeks.

Of 634 participants randomized to B/F/TAF, 519 completed the double-blinded treatment, and 506 out of 634 (80%) chose the 96-week open-label B/F/TAF extension, which was completed by 444 out of 506 (88%) participants. Efficacy was based on the secondary outcome of the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 by missing = excluded and missing = failure methods. All 634 participants who were randomized to B/F/TAF and received at least one dose of B/F/TAF were included in efficacy and safety analyses.

Of those with available virologic data, 98.6% (95% CI [97.0%–99.5%], 426/432) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 (missing = excluded). When missing virologic data were considered as failure, 67.2% (95% CI [63.4%–70.8%], 426/634) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The mean (SD) change in CD4+ count from baseline was +338 (236.2) cells/μL. No treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected. Adverse events led to drug discontinuation in 1.6% (10/634) of participants, with five events considered drug-related.

### Switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^115vbCPL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

We performed the primary analysis after all participants completed their week 48 study visit or had prematurely discontinued the study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who had plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 as defined by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm. We assessed the primary efficacy endpoint using a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in virologic failure rates (B/F/TAF minus DTG + F/TAF); the upper bound of the 95% CI was assessed using a prespecified noninferiority margin of 4%. All randomized participants who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug were included in the primary efficacy analysis. A secondary per-protocol analysis excluded participants who did not have a plasma HIV-1 RNA value in the week 48 analysis window due to reasons other than early study drug discontinuation because of lack of efficacy, low adherence (defined as adherence below the 2.5th percentile), and key entry criteria violations.

Assuming 2% of participants in each group would have HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48, a sample size of 520 would achieve ≥ 90% power to detect a noninferiority margin of 4% in difference between groups at a 1-sided α level of .025. One planned external independent data monitoring committee interim analysis was performed after all enrolled participants completed their week 12 study visit or prematurely discontinued study drugs. An α penalty of .00001 was applied for the planned interim analysis.

### Descovy [^115tfHNt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Potential for other drugs to affect one or more components of Descovy**: TAF, a component of Descovy, is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Drugs that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in TAF absorption [see Table 5]. Drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of TAF, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TAF, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Descovy and development of resistance. Coadministration of Descovy with other drugs that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase the absorption and plasma concentration of TAF. TAF is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or UGT1A1. TAF is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro. TAF is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo.

- **Drugs affecting renal function**: Because FTC and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Descovy with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g. gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Established and other potentially significant interactions**: Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially significant interactions.

### Estimated changes in price discounts for tenofovir-inclusive HIV treatments following introduction of tenofovir alafenamide [^115Pb6yp]. AIDS (2022). Low credibility.

In 2015–2016, Gilead Sciences received approval for a series of revised HIV treatments that incorporated tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) instead of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is a formulation of tenofovir that Gilead identified as possibly having lower toxicity. These new approvals resulted in three evergreened TDF/TAF product lines: Truvada (TDF/emtricitabine) and Descovy (TAF/emtricitabine); Complera (TDF/emtricitabine/rilpivirine) and Odefsey (TAF/emtricitabine/rilpivirine); and Stribild (TDF/elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine) and Genvoya (TAF/elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine).

Patent protection for TDF expired in 2018, with a generic of TDF/emtricitabine launching in 2020. Patents for TAF, however, are claimed until 2032. In anticipation of generic competition, Gilead followed an explicit strategy of converting patients from the TDF-based originator products to the evergreened TAF-based combinations to avoid generic substitution. This was particularly the case in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), where there is limited clinical justification to use TAF over TDF.

We analyzed Gilead's list and net pricing strategy for TDF and TAF products. We tested whether the pricing strategy differed between the Truvada/Descovy pair, approved for PrEP, and the HIV treatments Complera/Odefsey and Stribild/Genvoya.

### Systematic de-escalation of successful triple antiretroviral therapy to dual therapy with dolutegravir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine in Swiss HIV-positive persons [^112jvpzm]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Studies increasingly suggest that the efficacy of certain dual antiretroviral therapy (ART) combinations is equal to triple ART. Increasing concerns among HIV-positive patients and physicians in Switzerland include ART cost and long-term ART safety and toxicity, i.e. taking only as many ART agents as necessary. The aims of this retrospective analysis are to report on the de-escalation of our entire clinic population of eligible patients with well-controlled HIV infection to dolutegravir-containing dual ART.

- **Methods**: Starting in March 2015, we systematically considered the de-escalation of eligible patients to either dolutegravir/emtricitabine or dolutegravir/lamivudine by discontinuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or abacavir. We report on the virological efficacy, tolerability, and patient satisfaction ≥ 48 weeks after de-escalation.

- **Findings**: Of 106 HIV-positive patients followed in our clinic, 70 patients were de-escalated. Three returned to triple ART (insomnia after dolutegravir start, n = 2; new wish for single tablet regimen, n = 1). All de-escalated patients and all who continued triple ART had suppressed HIV viremia at last follow-up and were satisfied with their ART regimen, except for one patient who had virological failure after ART discontinuation in the setting of major depression. The most common reasons to not de-escalate included hepatitis B co-infection (n = 6), physician's concern about ART adherence (n = 6), patient reluctance to switch from a single tablet to a 2-tablet regimen (n = 7), and patient satisfaction with ART (n = 5).

### Estimated changes in price discounts for tenofovir-inclusive HIV treatments following introduction of tenofovir alafenamide [^11124BCF]. AIDS (2022). Low credibility.

We estimated list and net prices for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) products Truvada, Complera, and Stribild, and their tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) versions Descovy, Odefsey, and Genvoya. Gilead offered discounts for Descovy that resulted in lower net prices compared to Truvada. This strategy encouraged patients to switch from Truvada to Descovy before the availability of generic Truvada. Conversely, Gilead offered lower discounts for Odefsey and Genvoya, which resulted in higher net prices compared to Complera and Stribild.
