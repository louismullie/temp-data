## Question

What is the appropriate dose to taper prednisolone in asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose and strategy for tapering prednisolone in asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether tapering is even indicated. Then, I should distinguish short-course burst therapy from chronic maintenance therapy. Next, I will review guideline-based dosing for acute courses and whether tapering is needed. After that, I need to examine tapering strategies for long-term maintenance OCS, including dose-reduction increments, monitoring for adrenal insufficiency, and the role of biologics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and highlight special populations and safety considerations, making sure I verify each claim against high-credibility sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the core principle: tapering is not required for short courses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) in asthma, but it becomes important after prolonged use due to hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. I should verify the duration threshold and the rationale before proceeding [^112G8gaC] [^111EEe41] [^111vyWEz].

> I will now examine short-course "burst" therapy for acute exacerbations. Adults typically receive prednisolone 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days, and children receive 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/day for 3–5 days, and importantly, tapering is not needed if the total duration is less than 2 weeks, which I should double-check against multiple guideline sources to ensure consistency [^112G8gaC] [^111EEe41] [^111vyWEz] [^112UTXGN].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric nuances by age group because maximum doses differ in younger children. For ages 0–2 years the maximum is 20 mg/day, for 3–5 years it is 30 mg/day, and for 6–11 years it is 40 mg/day, and these age-stratified caps are consistently reflected in guideline dosing summaries and FDA labeling, so I should confirm those ceilings when advising on pediatric courses [^112MXZew] [^112wSSrq].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives to prednisolone in acute care. Dexamethasone 12–16 mg once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events compared with 3–5 days of prednisolone in adults, and in children 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days is noninferior to multi-day prednisolone, with better adherence and less vomiting, but dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days and should be switched to prednisolone if symptoms fail to resolve or relapse, which I need to emphasize to avoid inappropriate continuation [^111EEe41] [^1121xZVs].

> Next, I should review maintenance OCS therapy where tapering is relevant. Long-term daily OCS is a last resort in severe asthma, ideally at low physiologic doses (often ≤ 7.5–10 mg prednisone equivalent), and tapering should be attempted in all such patients once control is optimized, with individualized rhythm and speed, which I should confirm against consensus statements and GINA guidance [^116gcij6] [^115xr92v] [^111Ecc9T].

> Let me think about tapering mechanics. I initially thought a fixed 10 mg every 2–4 weeks might be reasonable, but wait, I should verify what trial protocols actually used because that will be more reliable than a one-size-fits-all decrement. In OCS-sparing biologic studies, reductions commonly start at 10 mg or 5 mg every 4 weeks, with smaller decrements of 2.5–1.25 mg as doses approach physiologic levels, and some programs use 1 mg steps near the end, so a stepwise approach with larger early decrements and smaller late decrements is prudent [^113zWzky] [^113FqSqd] [^116FxViv].

> I need to ensure I incorporate adrenal insufficiency (AI) screening and safety. Morning serum cortisol should be checked periodically during taper, with dynamic ACTH stimulation testing when results are intermediate, and tapering should slow or pause if AI symptoms emerge. Importantly, patients should carry stress-dose instructions for illness, injury, or surgery for up to 6 months after stopping long-term OCS, and I should confirm that these monitoring steps are explicitly recommended in endocrine and respiratory guidelines [^1112igoZ] [^117BM9Wz] [^112yXkR9].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a biologic? I should confirm how that changes tapering feasibility. Biologic therapies such as mepolizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab facilitate OCS reduction and discontinuation in severe asthma, and real-world data show substantial dose reductions and high rates of OCS cessation over 12–24 months, so I should integrate biologic initiation or optimization into the taper plan when appropriate [^111ixboe] [^111U9gmP].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while I double-check each element against sources. For short courses under 2 weeks, no taper is needed and abrupt cessation is acceptable. For long-term maintenance OCS, stabilize on the lowest effective dose, then taper by about 5–10 mg every 4 weeks initially, slowing to 2.5–1.25 mg decrements as you approach 10–5 mg, monitor morning cortisol and symptoms of AI, and consider dynamic testing when indicated. If the patient is on or starting a biologic, taper more assertively while maintaining close monitoring of control and adrenal function [^112G8gaC] [^113zWzky] [^1112igoZ] [^111U9gmP].

> I should confirm special populations and edge cases. In children, follow weight-based dosing with age-appropriate maximums and avoid tapering for short courses. In patients with repeated OCS bursts, remember that cumulative exposure increases risks even without chronic daily therapy, so stewardship and prevention of recurrent bursts are essential. And in those with suspected poor adherence or steroid resistance, consider serum prednisolone levels to verify exposure before escalating or tapering [^112MXZew] [^116Mvwhq] [^117HQ1Tn].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line to avoid overgeneralization. Tapering is unnecessary for short OCS bursts but is mandatory after prolonged use to mitigate AI risk, the pace should be individualized with smaller decrements near physiologic doses, and biologic therapy can enable faster, safer reductions. Throughout, monitor asthma control and adrenal function in parallel to prevent relapse or crisis [^112G8gaC] [^115xr92v] [^113zWzky].

---

Prednisolone tapering in asthma is **not required for short courses** (< 2 weeks) [^112G8gaC] and should be reserved for patients on **long-term therapy** (≥ 2–3 weeks) to avoid adrenal insufficiency [^112yXkR9]. For maintenance OCS, taper by **2.5–5 mg every 2–4 weeks** [^113zWzky] while monitoring symptoms and lung function; slower tapers (1–2.5 mg every 4–6 weeks) are advised for high or prolonged doses. Tapering is individualized, with closer monitoring in high-risk patients, and abrupt cessation is avoided after chronic use [^115xr92v].

---

## Indications for prednisolone tapering in asthma

Prednisolone tapering is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Long-term therapy**: Patients receiving prednisolone for ≥ 2–3 weeks, as prolonged use increases the risk of adrenal suppression [^112G8gaC].

- **High cumulative exposure**: Repeated short courses or cumulative doses ≥ 1–2 g/year [^111Vkt1Y].

- **Adrenal suppression risk**: Patients with symptoms or biochemical evidence of adrenal insufficiency [^notfound].

- **Biologic therapy initiation**: Patients starting biologic therapy, where tapering is attempted to minimize OCS exposure [^111U9gmP].

---

## Recommended prednisolone tapering regimens

Tapering regimens should be individualized based on the patient's clinical status, duration of OCS therapy, and risk of adrenal insufficiency. The following regimens are commonly recommended:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Tapering regimen** |
|-|-|
| Short-term use (< 2 weeks) | No tapering required; abrupt cessation is acceptable [^111vyWEz] |
| Long-term use (≥ 2–3 weeks) | - Reduce dose by 2.5–5 mg every 2–4 weeks [^113zWzky] <br/> - Slower taper (1–2.5 mg every 4–6 weeks) for high doses or prolonged use |
| High-risk patients (e.g. repeated courses, adrenal suppression) | - Slower taper (1–2.5 mg every 4–6 weeks) <br/> - Monitor adrenal function [^117BM9Wz] |

---

## Monitoring during prednisolone tapering

During tapering, **close monitoring** is essential to detect early relapse or adrenal insufficiency:

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular assessment of asthma control, symptoms, and lung function (FEV1, peak flow) [^113LK1Vf].

- **Adrenal function monitoring**: Morning serum cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests if indicated [^1112igoZ].

- **Patient education**: Teach patients to recognize relapse or adrenal insufficiency symptoms and when to seek medical attention [^113cb6mr].

---

## Risks associated with prednisolone tapering

Prednisolone tapering carries potential risks, including:

- **Asthma relapse**: Worsening symptoms or exacerbations during dose reduction [^113zWzky].

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Risk of acute adrenal crisis, particularly after prolonged high-dose therapy [^112dbzoN].

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Fatigue, malaise, and joint pain [^notfound].

---

## Role of biologic therapies in prednisolone tapering

Biologic therapies (e.g. mepolizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab) have significantly facilitated prednisolone tapering in severe asthma by reducing exacerbations and enabling dose reduction or discontinuation [^117CjTVa]. Clinical trials and real-world studies demonstrate substantial OCS-sparing effects, with many patients achieving complete cessation of OCS therapy [^1141CgZs].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus emphasize the following principles:

- **Minimize OCS exposure**: Use the lowest effective dose and duration [^111Vkt1Y].

- **Individualized tapering**: Tailor tapering regimens to patient-specific factors, including disease severity, duration of OCS therapy, and risk of adrenal insufficiency [^115xr92v].

- **Monitor for adrenal insufficiency**: Regular assessment of adrenal function, particularly in patients on prolonged or high-dose OCS therapy [^116iT7G1].

---

Prednisolone tapering in asthma is **not required for short courses** (< 2 weeks) [^111vyWEz] and should be reserved for patients on long-term therapy (≥ 2–3 weeks) to avoid adrenal insufficiency [^112G8gaC] [^112yXkR9]. For maintenance OCS, taper by 2.5–5 mg every 2–4 weeks while monitoring symptoms and lung function; slower tapers (1–2.5 mg every 4–6 weeks) are advised for high or prolonged doses. Tapering is individualized, with closer monitoring in high-risk patients, and abrupt cessation is avoided after chronic use [^115xr92v].

Biomarkers for effective OCS dose reduction

The use of biomarkers to monitor both the efficacy and safety of reducing OCS dose in these trials can support an individualized patient-focused approach. The OCS-sparing studies described here did not formally identify biomarkers to guide tapering, although serum cortisol concentration was used in the PONENTE study.

Blood eosinophil counts may also serve as useful indicators for effective OCS-tapering in patients with eosinophilic inflammation, as patients with OCS-dependent asthma may present with elevated levels of type 2 inflammatory markers. OCS-sparing studies have correlated elevated blood eosinophil counts to a loss of asthma disease control. Furthermore, an inverse association between OCS dose and blood eosinophil count has been demonstrated in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma not treated with an asthma biologic, with reduced OCS dose being associated with increased eosinophil count. Moreover, a post hoc analysis of data from SIRIUS showed that patients with the lowest blood eosinophil counts at baseline (< 150 cells/µL) had the highest mean OCS dose at the end of the optimization phase. As such, timely blood eosinophil count might be useful as a potential biomarker for effective OCS dose reduction prior to biologic treatment initiation, either during OCS dose optimization in a trial setting or in real-world clinical practice.

It is clear that long-term OCS use is associated with adrenal insufficiency; therefore, symptomatic measurements for adrenal insufficiency (fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension) were used during OCS-tapering in SIRIUS to determine the appropriateness of reducing OCS dose. This methodology has been developed further in the PONENTE study by evaluating hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis integrity for adrenal insufficiency as part of the OCS tapering protocol. Serum cortisol concentration was used as a biomarker for adrenal insufficiency, and an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test was performed when morning cortisol concentrations were less than the normal range but higher than that anticipated for those with complete adrenal insufficiency. In a recent Delphi consensus statement on OCS tapering in asthma, consensus was reached on the need for physicians to assess for adrenal insufficiency, which should involve an endocrinologist or multidisciplinary approach. Experts agreed that adrenal insufficiency should be assessed using fasting morning cortisol, with the use of a (short) tetracosactide/cosyntropin (e.g. Synacthen®) test in patients with intermediate results.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^114ad4x5]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid regimen — Recommendation 8 states, "We suggest the use of either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or an equivalent dose of prednisone/prednisolone) for children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)", addressing the question of whether, in children presenting with critical asthma, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or an equivalent dose of prednisone/prednisolone) should be administered as the systemic corticosteroid regimen; background notes that recent evidence has suggested that dexamethasone may be similarly effective to prednisone for the management of asthma exacerbations in the ED and hospital setting although the quality of this evidence is low, and the evidence base comprised 2 RCTs, 1 quasi-randomized trial, and 6 observational studies, including four observational studies before and after an institutional protocol change that transitioned to the use of dexamethasone for acute asthma management and 2 additional studies leveraging the Pediatric Health Information System database.

### Expert consensus on the tapering of oral corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. A Delphi study [^115xr92v]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: There is a need to minimize oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in patients with asthma to prevent their costly and burdensome adverse effects. Current guidelines do not provide recommendations for OCS tapering in patients with asthma. Objectives: To develop expert consensus on OCS tapering among international experts. Methods: A modified Delphi method was used to develop expert consensus statements relating to OCS use, tapering, adverse effects, adrenal insufficiency, and patient-physician shared decision-making. Initial statements proposed by experts were categorized, filtered for repetition, and presented back to experts over three ranking rounds to obtain consensus (≥ 70% agreement). Measurements and Main Results: One hundred thirty-one international experts participated in the study, and 296 statements were ranked. Numerous recommendations and guidance regarding appropriate OCS use were established. Experts agreed that OCS tapering should be attempted in all patients with asthma receiving maintenance OCS therapy, with personalization of tapering rhythm and speed. The importance of recognizing individual adverse effects was also established; however, a unified approach to the assessment of adrenal insufficiency was not reached. Shared decision-making was considered an important goal during the tapering process. Conclusions: In this Delphi study, expert consensus statements were generated on OCS use, tapering, adverse-effect screening, and shared decision-making, which may be used to inform clinical practice. Areas of nonconsensus were identified, highlighting uncertainty among the experts around some aspects of OCS use in asthma, such as adrenal insufficiency, which underscores the need for further research in these domains.

Trial design and OCS-tapering schedule

In the key single-center study, the OCS dose was reduced providing the patient had not experienced a defined exacerbation and target doses were 0, 2.5 and 5 mg/day in patients requiring daily OCS doses of < 10, 10– < 15 and ≥ 15 mg/day at baseline, respectively. Additional information detailing the criteria for not further reducing OCS dose during the OCS reduction period for each study can be found in the Additional file 1.

Building upon the OCS-tapering methodology used in the single-center study, the subsequent trials were able to use a more tailored approach (Fig. 1 a and b). SIRIUS was the first study to include an OCS dose optimization phase, which aimed to reduce a patient's OCS dose to the lowest possible effective dose while maintaining asthma control prior to randomization to biologic treatment. During the 3–8-week OCS dose optimization phase in SIRIUS, OCS dose was reduced weekly until asthma worsening was observed, defined as worsening of asthma symptoms (a ≥ 0.5-point increase in Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]-5 score) or an exacerbation. The optimized OCS dose was the dose that was one titration step higher than the OCS dose received when the patient saw an onset of asthma worsening; the patient then maintained this optimized dose for 2 weeks. Subsequently, patients entered the induction phase (4 weeks) where they were randomized to biologic or placebo treatment, stratified by previous duration of OCS use (< 5 years versus ≥ 5 years) as previously noted and received the optimized dose of OCS. Following the induction phase, patients entered a 16-week dose reduction phase in which the OCS dose was reduced in a stepwise manner based on asthma control and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, with a target of 0 mg/day only for those who had reached an optimized dose of < 25 mg/day prior to randomization (Fig. 1 a). For those on an optimized dose ≥ 25 mg/day, a target of 0 mg/day was not possible within the 24-week study in order to protect the patient from the risk of adrenal crisis. It is unclear whether the inclusion of multiple sites in multiple countries impacted the optimization of OCS dose, given the likelihood that OCS management practices varied across these sites/countries, and this may also be applicable to the other multicenter studies reported in this article.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution) [^112arHyN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (25 mg prednisolone per 5 mL) may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (33.6 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

Cortisone, 125 Triamcinolone, 20

Hydrocortisone, 100 Paramethasone, 10

Prednisolone, 25 Betamethasone, 3.75

Prednisone, 25 Dexamethasone, 3.75

Methylprednisolone, 20

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Similar efficacy of ciclesonide versus prednisolone to treat asthma worsening after steroid tapering [^114Hd5UY]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

Oral corticosteroids effectively treat asthma exacerbations but are associated with well-described side effects.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and safety of a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid with oral prednisolone in patients with worsening of their asthma after medication withdrawal.

Methods

Patients tapered off their inhaled corticosteroids until they reached predefined criteria of "worsening asthma". Randomized patients (n = 130) were treated double blind with either ciclesonide 800mug twice daily (starting with 800mug hourly for 3h after randomization) or prednisolone 40mg once daily for 2 weeks. Spirometry, daily asthma symptoms, morning and evening peak expiratory flow and blood parameters were assessed in all, methacholine challenge and inflammatory measures were determined in induced sputum in a subset of patients.

Results

Ciclesonide was as effective as prednisolone in improving forced expiratory flow in 1s, morning peak expiratory flow and symptoms, the latter improving more rapidly with ciclesonide. No differences were found in methacholine responsiveness or inflammatory measures in sputum or blood. Ciclesonide caused significantly less reduction in morning plasma cortisol levels (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

This study shows that inhaled ciclesonide (800mug twice daily) has comparable efficacy to oral prednisolone (40mg once daily) to regain asthma control in patients with asthma worsening. The more rapid onset and smaller effect on cortisol suppression suggest a better safety profile of ciclesonide.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### Assessment of an oral corticosteroid withdrawal pathway for severe asthma patients receiving biologic therapies [^1125bHYJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal approach to weaning maintenance oral corticosteroids (mOCS) in patients with severe asthma receiving biologics remains unclear. Previous studies assessed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function at 5 mg daily prednisolone, a supraphysiologic dose for many, necessitating further mOCS reduction for adrenal recovery.

Objective

We evaluated a protocol-driven, nurse-led mOCS withdrawal pathway with clinical oversight for patients with severe asthma receiving biologics.

Methods

Patients with severe asthma receiving biologics, who had reduced mOCS to 5 mg prednisolone daily and maintained good asthma control, entered the withdrawal pathway. Prednisolone was decreased to 4 mg daily for 6 weeks and then 3 mg daily for 6 weeks, followed by 09.00 serum cortisol measurement. Patients with cortisol greater than 25 nmol/L followed a 20-week weaning protocol. Serum cortisol was rechecked 12 weeks after stopping mOCS.

Results

Of 102 patients, 92 had cortisol greater than 25 nmol/L with 3 mg prednisolone and continued weaning. A total of 73 (72%) successfully discontinued mOCS with median (interquartile range) cortisol increasing from 192 (88–299) nmol/L with 3 mg prednisolone to 314 (248–437) nmol/L at 12 weeks after discontinuation (P < .0001). Twenty-nine patients (28%) paused weaning owing to adrenal insufficiency symptoms (n = 22), worse asthma control (n = 1), anxiety (n = 2), and other reasons (n = 4). The baseline cortisol in this group was 53 (25–166) nmol/L, and patients are currently well and receiving a median of 3.0 (3.0–3.9) mg prednisolone. Duration of prior oral corticosteroid use was significantly shorter in the group that was successfully weaned compared with those who failed weaning (P = 0.003). No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Most clinically stable patients with asthma receiving biologics successfully withdrew mOCS without requiring dynamic adrenal function testing.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112G8gaC]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Randomized trial of single-dose intramuscular dexamethasone compared with prednisolone for children with acute asthma [^111goPHF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy of single-dose intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone phosphate to a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate asthma exacerbations in young children discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized trial in children aged 18 months to less than 7 years with asthma who presented to the ED with a clinical asthma score of 3 to 7 on a 9-point scale. Children were randomized to 1 dose of IM dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum 15 mg) or oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg) once daily for 5 days. The primary outcome, measured only for patients discharged from the ED, was change in asthma score from ED presentation to 4-day follow-up examination, as assessed by a physician masked to group assignment. We assessed secondary clinical course outcomes by a structured interview at 4 and 14 days.

Results

Eighty-eight patients were appropriately randomized to dexamethasone and 93 to prednisolone. Group characteristics were similar at baseline. Among those discharged from the ED, 62 (90%) of 69 and 64 (90%) of 74 patients in the dexamethasone and prednisolone groups, respectively, were reassessed at 4 days for the primary outcome. The mean change in total asthma score at 4-day follow-up was 3.6 in the dexamethasone group and 3.4 in the prednisolone group (difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, -0.4 to 0.7). Of patients initially discharged, 5.9% of dexamethasone patients and 4.1% of prednisolone patients were admitted before the 2-week follow-up (difference, 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, -5.4% to 9.0%).

Conclusions

A single dose of IM dexamethasone showed no clinically meaningful difference in outcomes compared with a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate acute asthma exacerbations in young children who are discharged from the ED.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^114CrTkk]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) occurs as the result of any process that disrupts normal hypothalamic and/or anterior pituitary function and causes a decrease in the secretion of steroid hormones from the adrenal cortex. The most common cause of secondary AI is exogenous corticosteroid therapy administered at supraphysiologic dosages for ≥ 1 month. AI caused by oral corticosteroids (OCS) is not well-recognized or commonly diagnosed but is often associated with reduced well-being and can be life-threatening in the event of an adrenal crisis. Corticosteroid use is common in respiratory diseases, and asthma is a representative condition that illustrates the potential challenges and opportunities related to corticosteroid-sparing therapies. For individuals with severe asthma (approximately 5%-10% of all cases), reduction or elimination of maintenance OCS without loss of control can now be accomplished with biologic therapies targeting inflammatory mediators. However, the optimal strategy to ensure early identification and treatment of AI and safe OCS withdrawal in routine clinical practice remains to be defined. Many studies with biologics have involved short evaluation periods and small sample sizes; in addition, cautious approaches to OCS tapering in studies with a placebo arm, coupled with inconsistent monitoring for AI, have contributed to the lack of clarity. If the goal is to greatly reduce and, where possible, eliminate long-term OCS use in severe asthma through the increasing adoption of biologic treatments, there is an urgent need for clinical trials that address both the speed of OCS withdrawal and how to monitor for AI.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111Vkt1Y]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, there is no established dosage or duration of OCS that is determined to control asthma symptoms without causing AEs. Experts are calling for 'OCS stewardship' to reduce the risks, including AI, related to OCS use. To mitigate the potential for AEs, OCS use should be minimized by optimizing inhaled and biologic therapies for asthma. The availability of newer biologics has allowed for the advent of OCS‐sparing therapies in asthma, although the process by which long‐term corticosteroids should be tapered and/or discontinued has not been established. Consideration should be given to the risk of symptom recurrence and withdrawal‐induced AI.

In 2020, a consensus statement on the use of OCS was issued by 131 practitioners of specialties who frequently use OCS (mostly pulmonologists, respiratory disease specialists and allergists). Of the participating experts, more than 95% concurred that, ultimately, the goal in asthma should be to avoid the use of OCS. When OCS are required, the dosage and duration should be minimized as much as possible. Experts also agreed that individualized tapering to a minimally effective dosage (or complete discontinuation) should be attempted in all patients receiving OCS for maintenance therapy regardless of comorbid conditions. For AI risk, the experts agreed that AI is insufficiently assessed and that patients on long‐term OCS therapy should be assessed for the risk and presence of AI. This includes patients receiving OCS dosages in excess of 2.0 g per year or more than 4 repeat courses of short‐term OCS in 1 year.

### Internet-based tapering of oral corticosteroids in severe asthma: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^117BKRRi]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with prednisone-dependent asthma the dose of oral corticosteroids should be adjusted to the lowest possible level to reduce long-term adverse effects. However, the optimal strategy for tapering oral corticosteroids is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether an internet-based management tool including home monitoring of symptoms, lung function and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)) facilitates tapering of oral corticosteroids and leads to reduction of corticosteroid consumption without worsening asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.

Methods

In a 6-month pragmatic randomised prospective multicentre study, 95 adults with prednisone-dependent asthma from six pulmonary outpatient clinics were allocated to two tapering strategies: according to conventional treatment (n = 43) or guided by a novel internet-based monitoring system (internet strategy) (n = 52). Primary outcomes were cumulative sparing of prednisone, asthma control and asthma-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), exacerbations, hospitalisations and patient's satisfaction with the tapering strategy.

Results

Median cumulative sparing of prednisone was 205 (25–75th percentile -221 to 777) mg in the internet strategy group compared with 0 (-497 to 282) mg in the conventional treatment group (p = 0.02). Changes in prednisone dose (mixed effect regression model) from baseline were -4.79 mg/day and +1.59 mg/day, respectively (p < 0.001). Asthma control, asthma-related quality of life, FEV1, exacerbations, hospitalisations and satisfaction with the strategy were not different between groups.

Conclusions

An internet-based management tool including home monitoring of symptoms, lung function and FE(NO) in severe asthma is superior to conventional treatment in reducing total corticosteroid consumption without compromising asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^113LK1Vf]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The modifications in study design since the key single-center study (n = 20) was published in 2009, have focused on refinement of the OCS dose optimization strategy, which has implications for the study outcomes. An insufficient optimization period may result in a greater reduction in OCS dose while on study treatment, which has the potential to overemphasize the active treatment effect when taken in isolation of placebo response. Furthermore, the longer the tapering period, the greater the potential to demonstrate a larger reduction in dose, so this aspect of study design may affect outcomes reported during the study. It is also worth noting that the use of tailored OCS dose reductions based on baseline optimal OCS dose ensures a balance between minimizing OCS dose, maintaining asthma control and minimizing any impact of adrenal insufficiency on patients.

Assessing asthma control during OCS-tapering

During tapering, OCS dose is reduced based on the level of asthma control, as well as symptoms of adrenal sufficiency (as monitored in SIRIUS, VENTURE and PONENTE). ACQ score, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) measurements, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements, occurrence/history of exacerbations, in addition to blood eosinophil counts, feature as indicators of asthma control across the five OCS tapering studies (see also Additional file 1). Additionally, patients in SIRIUS used eDiaries to report their daily symptoms allowing close monitoring of asthma control by study investigators. The use of eDiaries has now become commonplace in subsequent studies. As such, methods to monitor asthma symptom control have broadened, from the sole reliance on clinical monitoring to a combination of clinical monitoring and patient-reported monitoring using standardized questionnaires. Such monitoring tools provide a much more holistic picture of asthma control throughout clinical studies.

### Tools to assess (and achieve?) long-term asthma control [^113ZbriX]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Assessment tools are needed to monitor asthma control and to detect exacerbations before the alteration of functional parameters and the occurrence of symptoms. The ability to effectively monitor asthma control would enable clinicians to increase corticosteroid dose or to stop corticosteroid tapering before symptoms occur. As a few severe exacerbations are expected per year in treated patients, these tools must be suitable for long-term use. They must also be reproducible, acceptable to patients and be non-invasive. Tools currently available to assess asthma control include assessment of: clinical parameters (e.g. nocturnal awakenings; bronchodilator intake; symptom scores); lung function (e.g. peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in 1 s); subjective parameters of asthma control (e.g. asthma control questionnaire (ACQ)); bronchial hyper-responsiveness; eosinophilia in induced sputum; and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) concentration. Clinical symptoms, lung function and the ACQ have proved to be inadequate markers of asthma control, as changes in these parameters occur at the same time as symptom manifestation. By contrast, sputum eosinophilia and exhaled NO concentrations are truly predictive of asthma exacerbations; monitoring these parameters are useful in preventing exacerbations from occurring in the first instance. They also assess, and help to achieve asthma control in the long term.

Severe asthma oral treatments — gradually decrease or stop OCS first, because of their significant adverse effects; tapering of OCS in severe asthma may be supported by internet-based monitoring of symptom control and FeNO. Monitor patients for risk of adrenal insufficiency by measuring morning serum cortisol, and provide patient and primary care physician with advice about the need for extra corticosteroids during injury, illness or surgery for up to 6 months after cessation of long-term OCS, and continue to assess for presence of osteoporosis with review of preventative strategies including bisphosphonates.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^114ZsXzX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosing

Dosage of Orapred ODT should be individualized according to the severity of the disease and the response of the patient. For pediatric patients, the recommended dosage should be governed by the same considerations rather than strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

Do not break or use partial Orapred ODT tablets. Use an appropriate formulation of prednisolone if indicated dose cannot be obtained using Orapred ODT. This may become important in the treatment of conditions that require tapering doses that cannot be adequately accommodated by Orapred ODT, e.g., tapering the dose below 10 mg.

The initial dose of Orapred ODT may vary from 10 to 60 mg (prednisolone base) per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time, there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, Orapred should be discontinued and the patient placed on other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of Orapred ODT for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^1175d3nR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Safest corticosteroids are the Fewest corticosteroids

For patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma with T2 inflammation, reduction or elimination of long‐term OCS, without loss of control, can be accomplished by using a biologic treatment directed towards inflammatory mediators. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to IgE and decreases the expression of IgE receptors on inflammatory cells; dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL‐4 receptor that blocks both IL‐4 signalling and IL‐13 signalling and ultimately lessens inflammation; mepolizumab and reslizumab are monoclonal antibodies that act as IL‐5 antagonists, effectively neutralizing IL‐5 and selectively inhibiting inflammation in the airways; and benralizumab is an IL‐5Rα‐directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody that directly binds to the IL‐5 receptor and activates antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity, ultimately decreasing eosinophilic inflammation.

Biologics have led to decreased OCS use, reduced rates of exacerbations and improved symptom control, and they are approved as add‐on therapy for patients with severe, persistent asthma. Although the OCS‐sparing results of both clinical trials and real‐world analyses of biologics in asthma are promising, many studies used short evaluation periods and small sample sizes. In addition, cautious approaches were used to taper OCS, given the placebo‐controlled nature of some of these studies, and AI was not consistently monitored (Table 2).

Table 2
Studies of OCS‐sparing capabilities of biologic agents for severe asthma

The PONENTE trial, the results of which are expected in mid‐2021, seeks to address the gaps left by previous studies and answer key questions to guide real‐world clinical practice, including how quickly long‐term OCS can be tapered and how best to monitor for and manage AI after introducing benralizumab. PONENTE is the largest OCS‐sparing trial conducted to date, with a goal of including approximately 600 patients, and is the only one to directly address AI. The PONENTE trial will outline a personalized, rapid tapering of supraphysiologic dosages of OCS based on OCS dosage and asthma control, as well as provide guidance on tapering OCS in the presence of suspected or confirmed AI. The maintenance phase is also substantially longer (24–32 weeks after the OCS reduction phase) than most other studies (4 weeks). This longer maintenance phase will detail the long‐term effectiveness and safety of benralizumab after OCS reduction or elimination.

### SOURCE: a phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in reducing oral corticosteroid use in adults with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma [^111a1PqP]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) are widely used for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma and asthma exacerbations in patients who cannot achieve symptomatic control when treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β 2 agonists (LABAs). Approximately 20–60% of patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma require long-term treatment with OCS as an additional asthma controller medication. Although OCS have been shown to be effective in controlling airway inflammation in asthma, chronic use (≥ 6 months) is associated with potentially debilitating side effects including, but not limited to, metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes), osteoporosis, adrenal insufficiency, pneumonia, cardiovascular adverse events, cataracts and weight gain. OCS-related complications are dose-dependently associated with long-term (≥ 6 months) OCS use at daily doses as low as 5 mg or less of prednisolone (or an equivalent dose of another corticosteroid). Long-term exposure to systemic corticosteroids is associated with increased costs and healthcare resource utilization in patients with severe asthma. Therefore, asthma treatments that allow a reduction in OCS dose or complete cessation of treatment with OCS, while maintaining control of asthma symptoms, would reduce morbidity and improve patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Current biologic treatments (e.g. benralizumab, dupilumab and mepolizumab) may be viable alternative therapies to OCS, and can assist in tapering and discontinuing OCS therapy. These treatments precisely target factors contributing to asthma pathogenesis and severity, such as inflammation-promoting cytokines and interleukins, and are indicated for the treatment of patients with specific severe asthma phenotypes (e.g. eosinophilic or allergic asthma). Targeting an upstream mediator of inflammatory pathways may have a broader effect on airway inflammation, and may provide more effective asthma control in a broader patient population than currently available biologic treatments.

### Serum prednisolone levels as a marker of oral corticosteroid adherence in severe asthma [^117HQ1Tn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect approximately 300 million people worldwide, with an ever increasing incidence. Within this staggering figure, 5–10% of this population is estimated to have severe asthma, requiring Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 4 or 5 therapy. A disproportionate amount of the costs due to asthma is accrued by this particular population due to healthcare utilization, medication costs, disability, and lost productivity. In addition, many of the novel biologic agents that are reserved for patients with severe asthma are relatively expensive compared to traditional therapies. As a result, it is important to distinguish truly severe asthma that is refractory to treatment from that which is difficult to control, secondary to poor inhaler technique, inadequate self-management skills, poor adherence, comorbidities, or smoking.

Ensuring adherence to existing therapy is essential to ensure that costly novel therapies are applied to a truly severe asthma population. The GINA guidelines, along with many other international guidelines have established the importance of ensuring adherence to therapy to facilitate this distinction, and ensure that any escalation of therapy is appropriate. Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) suppression testing has been studied to assess adherence to inhaled corticosteroids, however, the assessment of adherence to oral corticosteroid therapy is currently limited to self-reported or indirect outcomes. Commonly used methods include patient interview, medication diaries, pill counts, prescription fill audits, device counters, and electronic device monitors. While useful, many of these options are fraught with potential sources of error. These include them being subjective, open to recall bias, as well as there being an inability to differentiate if medication is taken, absorbed, or administered appropriately. The aim of this study was to examine serum prednisolone levels as a marker of oral corticosteroid adherence in patients with severe asthma and the combination of serum prednisolone levels and sputum eosinophil counts to identify corticosteroid resistant severe asthma.

### Composite type-2 biomarker strategy versus a symptom-risk-based algorithm to adjust corticosteroid dose in patients with severe asthma: a multicentre, single-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^116UU4Hx]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Background

Asthma treatment guidelines recommend increasing corticosteroid dose to control symptoms and reduce exacerbations. This approach is potentially flawed because symptomatic asthma can occur without corticosteroid responsive type-2 (T2)-driven eosinophilic inflammation, and inappropriately high-dose corticosteroid treatment might have little therapeutic benefit with increased risk of side-effects. We compared a biomarker strategy to adjust corticosteroid dose using a composite score of T2 biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FENO], blood eosinophils, and serum periostin) with a standardised symptom-risk-based algorithm (control).

Methods

We did a single-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial in adults (18–80 years of age) with severe asthma (at treatment steps 4 and 5 of the Global Initiative for Asthma) and FENO of less than 45 parts per billion at 12 specialist severe asthma centres across England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Patients were randomly assigned (4:1) to either the biomarker strategy group or the control group by an online electronic case-report form, in blocks of ten, stratified by asthma control and use of rescue systemic steroids in the previous year. Patients were masked to study group allocation throughout the entirety of the study. Patients attended clinic every 8 weeks, with treatment adjustment following automated treatment-group-specific algorithms: those in the biomarker strategy group received a default advisory to maintain treatment and those in the control group had their treatment adjusted according to the steps indicated by the trial algorithm. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with corticosteroid dose reduction at week 48, in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary outcomes were inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose at the end of the study; cumulative dose of ICS during the study; proportion of patients on maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) at study end; rate of protocol-defined severe exacerbations per patient year; time to first severe exacerbation; number of hospital admissions for asthma; changes in lung function, Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 score, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score, and T2 biomarkers from baseline to week 48; and whether patients declined to progress to OCS. A secondary aim of our study was to establish the proportion of patients with severe asthma in whom T2 biomarkers remained low when corticosteroid therapy was decreased to a minimum ICS dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02717689 and has been completed.

Findings

Patients were recruited from Jan 8, 2016, to July 12, 2018. Of 549 patients assessed, 301 patients were included in the ITT population and were randomly assigned to the biomarker strategy group (n = 240) or to the control group (n = 61). 28·4% of patients in the biomarker strategy group were on a lower corticosteroid dose at week 48 compared with 18·5% of patients in the control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·71 [95% CI 0·80–3·63]; p = 0·17). In the per-protocol (PP) population (n = 121), a significantly greater proportion of patients were on a lower corticosteroid dose at week 48 in the biomarker strategy group (30·7% of patients) compared with the control group (5·0% of patients; aOR 11·48 [95% CI 1·35–97·83]; p = 0·026). Patient choice to not follow treatment advice was the principle reason for loss to PP analysis. There was no difference in secondary outcomes between study groups and no loss of asthma control among patients in the biomarker strategy group who reduced their corticosteroid dose.

Interpretation

Biomarker-based corticosteroid adjustment did not result in a greater proportion of patients reducing corticosteroid dose versus control. Understanding the reasons for patients not following treatment advice in both treatment strategies is an important area for future research. The prevalence of T2 biomarker-low severe asthma was low.

Funding

This study was funded, in part, by the Medical Research Council UK.

*The open-label benralizumab treatment period consists of a 4-week induction phase, a variable OCS tapering phase and a 24–32-week maintenance phase

Patient selection

Across the OCS-tapering studies, patients had similar asthma disease phenotypes (Table 2); all studies targeted patients with severe asthma who were on regular maintenance OCS. Continuous OCS use was required for all studies but the amount of time patients were required to have been receiving maintenance OCS differed (Table 2). There were also differences in the prednisone equivalent OCS dose required for eligibility for the five studies (Table 2). Additionally, patients in SIRIUS were stratified at randomization by history of maintenance OCS use (< 5 years versus ≥ 5 years) based on an assumption that OCS tapering would be more difficult in patients who had been receiving maintenance OCS for a long period. Further differences in eligibility criteria included varying exacerbation history and blood eosinophil count requirements (Table 2).

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate [^112nDjuY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (20.2 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

### Anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids in patients with asthma: systematic review of current evidence [^1128J4H2]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To examine the evidence for the efficacy and glucocorticoid sparing effect of oral anti-leukotrienes taken daily as add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids in patients with asthma.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of children and adults with asthma comparing the addition of anti-leukotrienes or placebo to inhaled glucocorticoids.

Main Outcome Measures

The rate of exacerbations of asthma requiring rescue systemic glucocorticoids when the intervention was compared to the same or double dose of inhaled glucocorticoids, and the glucocorticoid sparing effect when the intervention was aimed at tapering the glucocorticoid.

Results

Of 376 citations, 13 were included: 12 in adult patients and one in children. The addition of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes to inhaled glucocorticoids resulted in a non-significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (two trials; relative risk 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 1.05). No trials comparing the use of anti-leukotrienes with double the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids could be pooled. The use of anti-leukotrienes resulted in no overall group difference in the lowest achieved dose of inhaled glucocorticoids (three trials; weighted mean difference -44.43 microg/day, -147.87 to 59.02: random effect model) but was associated with a reduction in withdrawals owing to poor asthma control (four trials; relative risk 0.56, 0.35 to 0.89).

Conclusions

The addition of anti-leukotrienes to inhaled glucocorticoids may modestly improve asthma control compared with inhaled glucocorticoids alone but this strategy cannot be recommended as a substitute for increasing the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids. The addition of anti-leukotrienes is possibly associated with superior asthma control after tapering of glucocorticoids, but the glucocorticoids sparing effect cannot be quantified at present.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Burden of oral corticosteroid use in severe asthma: challenges and opportunities [^117D1Jg5]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials of biologics have used stepwise OCS‐tapering algorithms, which, although they differ between studies and across biologics, have shown feasibility while maintaining asthma control. In addition, patients were monitored for possible adrenal insufficiency during tapering (e.g. by using symptomatic measurements or serum cortisol concentrations as a biomarker). This monitoring is essential, as titration off of systemic steroids may be more difficult once adrenal insufficiency has developed. In the absence of clear evidence‐based guidelines, the Oral Corticosteroid Tapering Delphi Expert Panel has developed consensus. In addition to changing statements by using expert knowledge and recommendations to guide OCS use, tapering, and monitoring for adverse events (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Schematic of consensus protocol for OCS tapering and down‐titration. a Adrenal insufficiency (AI) should be assessed routinely in the morning with fasting cortisol. If intermediate results are obtained, a (short) tetracosactide/cosyntropin assessment should follow. Management of AI should be cross‐disciplinary and include an endocrinologist. b Comorbidities to be screened for should include (but not be limited to): blood pressure, bone density, cataracts and glaucoma, fracture risk score, glycemic control, weight change, and growth in pediatric populations. Recommendations regarding the frequency of comorbidity screening vary. ABPA = allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; ACQ = asthma‐control questionnaire; ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone; EGPA = eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; HPA = hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis; OCS = oral corticosteroid. Adapted with permission from Suehs et al.

Key findings with broad consensus from panel members were that the goal should be to no longer need OCS for the treatment of asthma, and if they are required, doses and duration of use should be kept to a minimum; tapering should be attempted for all patients receiving maintenance OCS therapy; and the tapering algorithm should be individualized to patient needs. Proposed elements of an OCS‐tapering algorithm included advice on the speed of tapering and the impact of increased symptoms during tapering.

Some patients are unable to down‐titrate or eliminate maintenance OCS while using biologics, particularly those receiving OCS at a higher dose or for a long duration prior to initiating a biologic. Therefore, stewardship to reduce the initiation and/or minimize the duration of use of maintenance OCS is important to maximize the number of patients with asthma who can achieve independence from OCS.

### Biomarker-guided withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma patients with a non-T2 inflammatory phenotype-a randomized controlled trial protocol [^113fG7zP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-T2 asthma is characterized by the absence of elevated type 2 inflammatory biomarkers such as blood-eosinophils, total and allergen-specific Immunoglobulin E and Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO). According to guidelines, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of asthma management. However, ICS treatment is associated with a risk of local side effects, including hoarseness and thrush, and long-term high-dose therapy may cause systemic adverse effects. Furthermore, whereas treatment with ICS is highly effective in T2 asthma, studies have shown a markedly reduced ICS efficacy in patients with a lower degree of T2 inflammation, thus posing a clinical challenge in this subgroup of patients. Hence, owing to the ICS dosage step-up approach in current clinical guidelines, patients with low T2 biomarkers are at risk of being exposed to high doses of ICS, and by that at risk of side effects. Thus, an ICS-treatment regime guided by biomarkers that reflects the inflammatory phenotype is warranted in order to reduce the corticosteroid burden in patients with non-T2 asthma. This study combines a panel of non-T2 inflammatory markers (low periostin, low blood-eosinophils, and low FeNO), to determine if this group of patients can maintain asthma control during ICS withdrawal.

Methods

This is an ongoing prospective multicenter open-label randomized, controlled trial aiming to assess if ICS can be safely tapered in patients with non-T2 asthma. The patients are randomized 1:1 to either standard of care or an ICS tapering regimen (n = 55 in each group) where the initial ICS dose is reduced by 50% for 8 weeks followed by total ICS removal. The primary endpoint is change in asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) from baseline to post-tapered ICS. The secondary endpoints are time from baseline to drop-out caused by loss of asthma control, changes in serum-periostin, blood-eosinophils, FeNO, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1) and in sputum-eosinophils.

Discussion

This study aims to provide data on ICS tapering in non-T2 asthma patients and to contribute to a more individualized and corticosteroid-sparing treatment regime in this group of patients.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^113xqzFL]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; p = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; p = 0.005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Corticosteroids for acute severe asthma in hospitalised patients [^111Egr2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continues to be debated. Some investigators have reported a greater benefit of higher doses of corticosteroids in the management of severe asthma, while others have not.

Objectives

To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma Register. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following broad inclusion criteria: described as randomised controlled trials, included patients with acute severe asthma, compared different doses of corticosteroids (any route) in 2 or more treatment arms, and had a minimum period of follow up of 24 hours. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and disagreement was resolved by third party adjudication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) for primary pulmonary function outcomes using a fixed effects model. For the purposes of the review, three broad categories of corticosteroid dose (equivalent dose of methylprednisolone in 24 hours) were defined in advance: low dose (≤ 80 mg), medium dose (> 80 mg and ≤ 360 mg) and high dose (> 360 mg). There were thus 3 main comparison groups: low versus medium dose, medium versus high dose and low versus high dose.

Main Results

Nine trials were included; a total of 344 adult patients have been studied (96 with low dose, 85 with medium dose and 163 with high dose corticosteroids). Only 6 trials provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences detected in % predicted FEV1 among comparison groups after 24, 48 or 72 hours. At 48 hours, the weighted mean difference was -3.3% predicted (95% confidence interval -12.4 to + 5.8) for the low vs medium dose comparison, -1.9% predicted (95% CI -8.1 to + 4.3) for the medium vs high dose comparison and + 0.5% predicted (95% CI - 7.8 to + 8.8) for the low vs high dose comparison. There appeared to be no significant differences in side effects or rates of respiratory failure among the varying doses of corticosteroids. A further search was conducted on 3rd August 2000. No new trials were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences were identified among the different doses of corticosteroids in acute asthma requiring hospital admission. Low dose corticosteroids (≤ 80 mg/day of methylprednisolone or ≤ 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone) appear to be adequate in the initial management of these adult patients. Higher doses do not appear to offer a therapeutic advantage.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113KRmut]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management — oral corticosteroids (OCS) action plan dosing and triggers: For most patients, the written asthma action plan should provide instructions for when and how to commence OCS, with a short course used for adults at 40–50 mg/day usually for 5–7 days for patients who fail to respond to an increase in reliever and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing maintenance medication for 2–3 days, deteriorate rapidly or have a peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 60% of their personal best or predicted value, or have worsening asthma and a history of sudden severe exacerbations; for children 6–11 years, the recommended dose of prednisone is 1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days, and patients should be advised about common side-effects and should contact their doctor if they start taking OCS.

### Doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: randomised controlled trial [^111dqCZv]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Asthma self-management plans that include doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when the condition deteriorates improve asthma control. Whether doubling the dose of corticosteroid in isolation is effective is unknown. We undertook a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteriods when asthma deteriorates.

Methods

390 individuals with asthma who were at risk of an exacerbation monitored their morning peak flow and asthma symptoms for up to 12 months. When peak flow or symptoms started to deteriorate, participants added an active or placebo corticosteroid inhaler to their usual corticosteroid for 14 days to produce a doubling or no change in dose. The primary outcome was the number of individuals starting oral prednisolone in each group.

Findings

During 12 months, 207 (53%) started their study inhaler and 46 (12%) started prednisolone — 22 (11%) of 192 and 24 (12%) of 198 in the active and placebo groups, respectively. The risk ratio for starting prednisolone was therefore 0.95 (95% CI 0.55–1.64, p = 0.8).

Interpretation

We recorded little evidence to support the widely recommended intervention of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control starts to deteriorate.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Inhaled vs oral steroids for adults with chronic asthma [^111HNRFM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine therapeutically equivalent doses of inhaled versus oral steroids for adults with chronic asthma.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group trials register was searched using the terms: (drug delivery systems OR ((nebuli* OR inhal* OR MDI) AND oral*)) AND (steroid* OR corticosteroid* OR glucocorticoid* OR beclomethasone OR betamethasone OR fluticasone OR cortisone OR dexamethasone OR hydrocortisone OR prednisolone OR prednisone OR triamcinolone).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were selected of at least 4 weeks duration and included patients over the age of 15 years with chronic asthma. Trials compared inhaled steroids and oral prednisolone or prednisone; where the maximum dose for inhaled steroids was 2000 mcg/day and prednisolone 60 mg (on alternate days).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers screened 1285 titles and abstracts from the electronic search, bibliography searches and other contacts. Of these, 10 trials met previously defined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, and outcome measures.

Main Results

All trials were small and no data could be pooled. Carry-over effects were present in at least one cross-over trial. Data from six trials produced the same pattern, in which prednisolone 7.5–12 mg/day appeared to be as effective as inhaled steroid 300–2000 mcg/day. In two trials, inhaled steroid 300–400 mcg/day was more effective than prednisolone 5 mg/day. All doses of inhaled steroid appeared to be more effective than alternate day doses of prednisolone up to 60 mg on alternate days. Side-effect data were reported too variably to permit comparisons. A 30% incidence was reported in one study in patients receiving prednisolone 5 mg/day, none were reported in patients on inhaled steroids. A further search was conducted in October 2000 which yielded no further trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A daily dose of prednisolone 7.5–10 mg/day appears to be equivalent to moderate-high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Side-effects may be present on low doses, so if there is no alternative to oral steroids, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^1124tJbt]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The evolution of eligibility criteria since the key single-center study has led over time to study populations in the larger multicenter studies that more precisely reflect patients for whom biologic therapy is appropriate in real-world clinical practice. The inclusion criteria for the most recent studies ensured that patients have severe asthma with active eosinophilic inflammation. In addition, the need for stable OCS use prior to initiation of a biologic has been introduced, with three of the four most recent studies (SIRIUS, VENTURE and PONENTE) requiring a stable OCS dose prior to enrollment/screening.

### Optimal dose of maintenance steroid therapy for relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a multicentre retrospective study [^113HgcDE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Long-term steroid therapy is a significant independent predictor of numerous adverse effects, which are dose- and duration-dependent. Major risks include infections, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis. Furthermore, even doses of prednisolone less than 5 mg/day have been associated with an increased risk of fractures and serious infections. However, short-term use may also lead to serious adverse effects, particularly at higher doses. One study reported that 30 mg/day of prednisolone for 1 month carried a similar risk of serious infection as 5 mg/day for 3 years. Some studies have suggested that very low doses of steroids (eg, prednisolone at a dose less than 5 mg/day) are associated with fewer adverse effects. A placebo-controlled trial of 5 mg/day add-on prednisolone over 2 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed an increase in mild to moderate infections, with other glucocorticoid-specific adverse effects being rare. However, the threshold duration for steroid therapy where adverse events become more frequent remains unclear. In steroid therapy for repeated relapses of CEP, the decision to continue maintenance therapy at the optimal dose or to discontinue therapy and resume therapy at relapse remains an issue for future investigation. Alternate-day low-dose prednisone therapy may also help reduce side effects, but the optimal dose for preventing relapse has not been clearly defined.

In our study, the prednisolone dose at the time of relapse was 10 mg or lower in all relapse groups. Relapses with high doses of prednisolone should trigger a thorough investigation for other potential causes of eosinophilic pneumonia, such as vasculitis, drugs, fungal or parasitic infections. Biological therapies approved for severe asthma may offer a safer alternative to control relapses of idiopathic CEP, allowing for a reduction in steroid dose and sometimes replacing steroid therapy. However, the available evidence is limited and primarily composed of case reports and series. Given that 46% of the relapse group had asthma complications, the low rate of concomitant biologic use is notable. Therefore, more aggressive combination therapy with biologics should be considered, especially for patients on high-dose or long-term MST.

Our study revealed that the median serum eosinophil count was 1125 /µL (IQR, 735–2108). Currently, symptoms and chest imaging remain the most reliable and efficient guides for therapy. The absence of absolute serum eosinophil count criteria for steroid therapy complicates determining optimal doses for repeated relapses. Although relapse generally does not worsen prognosis and airway obstructive abnormalities are of borderline clinical significance, CEP can cause long-term issues, including persistent pulmonary impairmentand irreversible fibrosis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115sPaLx]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is no need to taper the dose of oral corticosteroids, either in the short term or over several weeks, in patients on maintenance ICSs.

### Prospective, placebo-controlled trial of 5 vs 10 days of oral prednisolone in acute adult asthma [^113Uxxwd]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral steroid treatment in the management of acute adult asthma is unclear. We prospectively studied the effect of 5 vs. 10 days of oral prednisolone in patients with acute asthma requiring hospital admission.

Methods

Each patient received 40 mg of enteric-coated prednisolone daily for 5 days, followed by 5 days of 40 mg prednisolone daily (n = 24) or placebo (n = 20). All were given their usual inhaled asthma therapy including inhaled corticosteroids. Patients kept PEF and symptom diaries for 21 days.

Results

For the 5-day treatment group mean (95% CI) early morning PEF was 6 (-47,+36) l/min lower to day 21 (P = 0.78). There was no evidence of differences in other PEF measures (morning post-bronchodilator, evening or worst of day). One patient in each group had an exacerbation requiring further oral steroids during the 21-day observation period. Asthma symptom scores were worse in the 5-day group on days 6–21 but the significance of this finding was uncertain, as a difference had emerged by day 5 (prior to trial entry).

Conclusions

It may be possible to reduce the standard steroid course to 5 days in acute adult asthma, provided all patients receive inhaled steroids and a personal asthma management plan.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1121xZVs]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to assess progress before stopping oral corticosteroids. Limit treatment to 1–2 days if the oral corticosteroid is dexamethasone, switching to prednisolone if there is a failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### Oral corticosteroids tapering in severe asthma [^116Mvwhq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The OCS consensus report in this issue of the Journal puts forward the important concept of cumulative OCS exposure. Physicians tend to underestimate repeated OCS bursts' long-term side effects. However, research has revealed that there is no benign OCS prescription, as the risk of adverse events is cumulative and escalates with each treatment. An increase in morbidity is seen after only four short courses of OCS. In terms of lifetime cumulative dose, most side effects begin after 1–2.5 g, but the diabetes incidence starts to increase after only 0.5 g. This may be reflected in the 0.5–1 g yearly threshold chosen by the expert panel to indicate poor asthma control. Hopefully, this statement will raise awareness on the consequences of using OCS and reinforce the recommendation that all options must be considered before considering OCS.

Experts agreed that OCS tapering should be attempted in every patient and the Delphi method achieved a consensus on several statements concerning OCS decrease, which are summarized in the graphical abstract available in the publication. Although it does not constitute a specific algorithm, for the first time, it provides clinicians with management strategies on how to proceed with OCS tapering. Many aspects to consider when undertaking OCS weaning were covered, but no agreement could be reached regarding biomarkers. Yet, evidence exists linking OCS responsiveness to Th2 inflammation and small studies suggested that sputum eosinophils, blood eosinophils, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide could be useful in OCS dose adjustments. A large, randomized trial exploring the value of composite biomarkers to titrate OCS therapy should bring more evidence to support biomarker use for OCS tapering.

Major advances have been made in asthma care in the last two decades. OCS, once a frequently unavoidable treatment for severe asthma, are progressively being replaced by safer options. We can dream of a day when OCS will not be needed anymore in asthma management, but until then, we should learn to use them cautiously. Suehs and colleagues provide expert advice establishing groundwork to regulate OCS use. Research will be needed to substantiate future recommendations with evidence-based data.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112UTXGN]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to continue systemic (oral) corticosteroids for 5–7 days in adult patients (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and for 3–5 days in pediatric patients (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) to reduce the risk of relapse.

### Doubling the dose of budesonide versus maintenance treatment in asthma exacerbations [^114wFKtA]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Previous guidelines recommend doubling the daily dose of maintenance inhaled corticosteroid to treat or prevent progression of exacerbations of asthma.

Methods

Over a 6 month period a cohort of patients were evaluated prospectively and randomised in a double blind controlled trial to treatment with either a continued maintenance dose (MD) of inhaled corticosteroid or doubling the dose (DD) at the time of an exacerbation.

Results

A total of 290 patients were randomised (33% male) and 98 (DD, n = 46) experienced evaluable asthma exacerbations during the study period. Mean (SD) baseline characteristics at randomisation (age 33.5 (14.0) years; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 2.8 (0.7) l; peak expiratory flow (PEF) 422.9 (110.5) l/min) were similar in both groups. In the DD group 41% of patients were considered treatment failures because they either required systemic steroids (n = 12), had an unscheduled visit to a physician (n = 1), or their asthma did not return to baseline (n = 6). This did not differ from the MD group in which 40% were treatment failures (n = 9, 0, and 12, respectively; p = 0.94).

Conclusions

In patients who regularly take an inhaled corticosteroid, doubling the maintenance dose may not affect the pattern of the exacerbation.

### Geographical differences in the use of oral corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma in Spain: heat map based on existing databases analyses [^1139Zdmw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common and potentially serious chronic inflammatory respiratory disease with a substantial burden on patients, their families, and the community. It causes respiratory symptoms, limitation of activity, and exacerbations that sometimes require urgent health care and might have fatal consequences. The prevalence of asthma is higher in industrialized western countries (10%) compared to the underdeveloped countries (≤ 1%), although this may be due to an underestimation of cases in the less developed health systems. Within western countries, its prevalence is higher in urban areas than in the rural population. It has been estimated that approximately 5–10% of asthma patients have severe disease. Severe asthma is defined as uncontrolled asthma despite adherence with optimized high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS); long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) therapy and treatment of the contributory factors, or disease that worsens when high dose treatment is decreased.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends a stepwise approach to asthma therapy, aiming to optimize symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations. Despite these recommendations, patients with asthma remain at high risk of severe exacerbations due to the lack of adherence to maintenance therapy, overuse of reliever therapy, poor inhaler technique, comorbidities, or difficult-to-treat asthma. Hence, many patients with severe asthma require two or more oral corticosteroid (OCS) bursts per year for managing their exacerbations. According to a recently published analysis of the International Severe Asthma Registry, patients with severe asthma have an average of four severe exacerbations per year, and therefore, require four bursts per year on average. Considering the adverse events associated with the use of OCS, recent guidelines allow their use as the last therapeutic alternative. Furthermore, due to the higher risk of adverse effects, an expert consensus recommends tapering of OCS for the treatment of asthma, while focusing on the general objective of avoiding the use of OCS. However, the use of both maintenance OCS and the repetitive bursts for acute asthma exacerbations lead to cumulative adverse events thereby, increasing the healthcare costs.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113cb6mr]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma guideline — considerations for stepping down therapy detail patient selection, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) tapering, long-acting beta agonist (LABA) discontinuation, and action planning. Do not reduce ICS dose in patients who cannot be closely monitored, such as those who are planning to travel or have inconsistent follow-up appointments, and avoid stepping down in individuals at high risk of severe exacerbations, such as pregnant individuals or those with recent acute illnesses. For tapering, decrease the ICS dose gradually by 25–50% every 3 months with the goal to reach the lowest effective maintenance dose that continues to control asthma symptoms, and assess asthma symptoms regularly throughout the tapering process to ensure stable control. LABAs can generally be discontinued without a taper, as they do not require a gradual reduction like ICS. Patients should have a written action plan to monitor for any signs of worsening asthma; ensure that the patient has a written asthma action plan that includes instructions for recognizing early signs of worsening asthma and steps to take, including medication adjustments and when to seek medical attention, and make sure they have access to adequate medication and know what actions to take if symptoms return or worsen after discontinuing LABA or stepping down the ICS.

### Oral corticosteroids tapering in severe asthma [^114h8Swb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

First marketed 70 years ago, corticosteroids transformed the life of patients suffering from asthma and quickly became the mainstay of treatment for this condition. Despite major developments in therapeutic options since, particularly with the use of inhaled corticosteroids more than 40 years ago, the powerful antiinflammatory effects of oral corticosteroids (OCS) are as of yet impossible to replace completely, explaining their persistent use in asthma management. Most of the time, they are prescribed intermittently to treat severe exacerbations, although some patients require them chronically to achieve asthma control. However, OCS are associated with well-recognized long-term side effects and an increase in mortality. Recent evidence suggests that this risk is related to the cumulative lifetime exposure to OCS, implying that even repeated short courses may have a significant impact on their associated morbidity.

More recently, monoclonal antibodies brought the first real long-term alternative to OCS in severe asthma since the 1950s. They are powerful antiinflammatory agents targeting T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) inflammation with minimal side effects and with corticosteroid-sparing properties. Their availability provoked a change in OCS perception in severe asthma, from a necessary evil to an increasingly avoidable one. With the increasing use of biologics, tapering and cessation of maintenance OCS has become much more common and feasible, but specific guidance on how to proceed is lacking.

Numerous studies exploring steroid-sparing drugs have reported their OCS weaning protocols. The OCS tapering regimens used were quite variable, as were the assessments of asthma control, biomarker use, and screening for adrenal insufficiency, thus making generalization difficult. Many of them also lacked the details needed to be efficiently implemented in clinical practice. An exception would be the ongoing PONENTE trial, investigating the safety and efficacy of OCS tapering after initiation of benralizumab. Although not evidenced-based, it provides a detailed OCS reduction algorithm with systematic assessment of adrenal insufficiency that could be used by clinicians.

Research and guidelines have recognized the need to reach the minimal effective dose when OCS are needed for long-term treatment of severe asthma. To achieve this, their focus and advice has been to optimize asthma control strategies and use of OCS-sparing drugs without clear guidance on how to actually proceed with weaning. Hence, there are currently no standardized guidelines on how and when to safely perform OCS tapering. A recent review identified this lack of clear recommendations as a clinical barrier to reduce OCS exposure in severe asthma.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^112gizX2]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) occurs as the result of any process that disrupts normal hypothalamic and/or anterior pituitary function and causes a decrease in the secretion of steroid hormones from the adrenal cortex. The most common cause of secondary AI is exogenous corticosteroid therapy administered at supraphysiologic dosages for ≥ 1 month. AI caused by oral corticosteroids (OCS) is not well‐recognized or commonly diagnosed but is often associated with reduced well‐being and can be life‐threatening in the event of an adrenal crisis. Corticosteroid use is common in respiratory diseases, and asthma is a representative condition that illustrates the potential challenges and opportunities related to corticosteroid‐sparing therapies. For individuals with severe asthma (approximately 5%–10% of all cases), reduction or elimination of maintenance OCS without loss of control can now be accomplished with biologic therapies targeting inflammatory mediators. However, the optimal strategy to ensure early identification and treatment of AI and safe OCS withdrawal in routine clinical practice remains to be defined. Many studies with biologics have involved short evaluation periods and small sample sizes; in addition, cautious approaches to OCS tapering in studies with a placebo arm, coupled with inconsistent monitoring for AI, have contributed to the lack of clarity. If the goal is to greatly reduce and, where possible, eliminate long‐term OCS use in severe asthma through the increasing adoption of biologic treatments, there is an urgent need for clinical trials that address both the speed of OCS withdrawal and how to monitor for AI.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^113KHaef]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The subsequent ZONDA and VENTURE studies also included OCS dose optimization phases (8 weeks and 3–10 weeks, respectively, Fig. 1 b). The ZONDA study did not require a stable OCS dose at screening/enrollment; however, the run-in (OCS dose optimization) period included stabilization of OCS dose. Only patients who were receiving a dose of ≤ 12.5 mg/day at the end of the OCS dose optimization/run-in phase were eligible for a 100% dose reduction to 0 mg/day during the 20-week dose reduction phase (Fig. 1 a). Patients in ZONDA with documented failures of OCS dose reduction within 6 months prior to enrollment were not required to proceed through the OCS dose optimization phase (Additional file 1). In VENTURE, the 16-week OCS dose reduction phase had a target dose of 2.5 mg/day and 0 mg/day for patients with an optimized OCS dose of ≥ 35 mg/day and < 35 mg/day, respectively (Fig. 1 a). The lowest effective OCS dose was defined by the emergence of asthma symptoms (a ≥ 0.5-point increase in ACQ-5 score), the occurrence of an exacerbation or any clinically significant event leading to an increase in dose.

In the PONENTE study, no OCS dose optimization phase was included, likely due to the open-label design; however, the OCS dose reduction phase had an initial target of 5 mg/day, with further dose reductions of 2.5 mg/day permitted for patients with no adrenal insufficiency, assessed by adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing (Fig. 1 a). This was the first study to formally introduce adrenal function testing as part of the OCS reduction protocol. For patients with partial adrenal insufficiency or symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (in the absence of abnormal adrenal insufficiency tests), OCS dose was only reduced by 1 mg/day every 4 weeks once a dose of 5 mg/day was reached. However, in case of complete adrenal insufficiency, no further tapering in the OCS dosage was allowed.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^115okSPN]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

The results of this study are important because there has been minimal previous success in identifying parent initiated strategies that may reduce the burden of acute asthma in children. One of the approaches that has been evaluated is administration of a short course of inhaled corticosteroids. Although there is some evidence that high dose inhaled corticosteroids may be effective in the treatment of acute asthma in the hospital settingand may also be associated with modest benefit in the ambulatory setting, high dose inhaled corticosteroids are not as effective as oral corticosteroids.

A second approach is the use of formulations containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting β agonist. Among children with uncontrolled asthma, the use of inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist as both maintenance and reliever medication may reduce asthma related health resource use compared with fixed dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist as maintenance treatment only. However, fewer than 15% of children who present to an emergency department with an episode of acute asthma have a background of uncontrolled asthma; therefore, maintenance and reliever treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist is not appropriate for the great majority of children likely to use health resources to relieve acute asthma.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^116kVhmb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future direction

Despite the advent of targeted biologics and OCS drawbacks and disadvantages, corticosteroids continue to be used in asthma management. The goal is to find ways to greatly reduce or eliminate their long‐term use and to better balance the safety and effectiveness of asthma treatments.

There are gaps in knowledge and practice related to OCS stewardship. Systemic corticosteroids are the option of last resort in Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 5 treatment, and GINA recommends gradual decrease and/or discontinuation of OCS after patients achieve a good response to biologic therapies. Ideally, the role of OCS will continue to narrow as the use of novel therapies targeting specific pathways increases.

In order to prevent both the systemic effects and the development of AI associated with long‐term OCS use, steroid‐sparing strategies are needed to advance safety amongst patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Treatments that directly target airway inflammation offer improved overall control of asthma and reduce OCS use. Biologic therapies greatly decrease the role of OCS and, in many cases, eliminate their need entirely.

Education is key to elevating awareness of optimal asthma control for patients, as well as steroid‐sparing strategies amongst clinicians. Ongoing clinical trials are already changing clinical practice by guiding the tapering of OCS and the screening and management of AI after introducing biologics. Importantly, substantial and long‐lasting modifications in prescribing patterns of OCS may well require changes to healthcare systems and collaborations amongst different specialties.

### Stepping down the dose of inhaled corticosteroids for adults with asthma [^114Fb7SW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a condition of the airways affecting more than 300 million adults and children worldwide. National and international guidelines recommend titrating up the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to gain symptom control at the lowest possible dose because long-term use of higher doses of ICS carries a risk of systemic adverse events. For patients whose asthma symptoms are controlled on moderate or higher doses of ICS, it may be possible to reduce the dose of ICS without compromising symptom control.

Objectives

To evaluate the evidence for stepping down ICS treatment in adults with well-controlled asthma who are already receiving a moderate or high dose of ICS.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group and conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We searched all databases from their inception with no restriction on language. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We performed the most recent search in July 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration and excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies of adults (aged ≥ 18 years) whose asthma had been well controlled for a minimum of three months on at least a moderate dose of ICS. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with any other respiratory comorbidity. We included trials comparing a reduction in the dose of ICS versus no change in the dose of ICS in people with well-controlled asthma who a) were not taking a concomitant long-acting beta agonist (LABA; comparison 1), and b) were taking a concomitant LABA (comparison 2).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included studies, extracted data on prespecified outcomes of interest and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) using study participants as the unit of analysis and analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included six studies, which randomised a total of 1654 participants (ICS dose reduction, no concomitant LABA (comparison 1): n = 892 participants, three RCTs; ICS dose reduction, concomitant LABA (comparison 2): n = 762 participants, three RCTs). All included studies were RCTs with a parallel design that compared a fixed dose of ICS versus a 50% to 60% reduction in the dose of ICS in adult participants with well-controlled asthma. The duration of the treatment period ranged from 12 to 52 weeks (mean duration 21 weeks; median duration 14 weeks). Two studies were performed in the setting of primary care, two were performed in the secondary care setting and two reported no information on setting. Meta-analysis was hampered by the small number of studies contributing to each comparison, combined with heterogeneity among outcomes reported in the included studies. We found the quality of synthesised evidence to be low or very low for most outcomes considered because of a risk of bias (principally, selective reporting), imprecision and indirectness. Although we found no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences between groups with respect to any of the primary or secondary outcomes considered in this review, the data were insufficient to rule out benefit or harm.

Authors' Conclusions

The strength of the evidence is not sufficient to determine whether stepping down the dose of ICS is of net benefit (in terms of fewer adverse effects) or harm (in terms of reduced effectiveness of treatment) for adult patients with well-controlled asthma. A small number of relevant studies and varied outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Additional well-designed RCTs of longer duration are needed to inform clinical practice regarding use of a 'stepping down ICS' strategy for patients with well-controlled asthma.

Systemic corticosteroids for acute asthma — timing and doses: OCS should be given promptly, especially if the patient is deteriorating, or had already increased their reliever and maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting (Evidence B). The recommended dose of prednisolone for adults is 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, and 1–2 mg/kg/day for children 6–11 years.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^114rhsgp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Orapred ODT are packaged in a blister. Patients should be instructed not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. The blister pack should then be peeled open, and the orally disintegrating tablet placed on the tongue, where tablets may be swallowed whole as any conventional tablet, or allowed to dissolve in the mouth, with or without the assistance of water. Orally disintegrating tablet dosage forms are friable and are not intended to be cut, split, or broken.

Multiple Sclerosis

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

Pediatric

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of Orapred may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

Nephrotic Syndrome

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

Asthma

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses.

It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

2.2 Recommended Monitoring

Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including serum potassium and fasting blood glucose, should be obtained at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Appropriate diagnostic studies should be performed in patients with known or suspected peptic ulcer disease and in patients at risk for reactivation of latent tuberculosis infections.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115Sbu4q]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations in primary or acute care for children 5 years and younger — assess severity while starting SABA and oxygen: "SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for first hour) and oxygen (to maintain saturation 94–98%)". Recommend escalation and transfer criteria: "Recommend immediate transfer to hospital if there is no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours;… respiratory rate > 40/minute… or if oxygen saturation is < 92% on room air". Systemic corticosteroid options and dosing include: "Consider oral prednisolone/prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day… up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0–2 years, and 30 mg/day for children aged 3–5 years, for up to 5 days; or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 days". If relapse or non‑resolution occurs with dexamethasone, "consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone". Note measurement caution: "oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color".

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112yXkR9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5–7 or 10–14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

### Initiation, dose reduction, and duration of inhaled corticosteroid therapy [^1175tDWG]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by persistent airway inflammation, which is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and variable airflow obstruction, which accounts for the majority of symptoms experienced by asthmatic patients. Allergen sensitization and inhalation causes airway inflammation, and is likely important in the initiation and persistence of asthma in more than 50% of patients, and while allergen avoidance (or avoidance of other initiating factors, such as occupational sensitizers) can help some patients, it is often difficult to achieve. For this reason, pharmacologic treatment to reduce airway inflammation is currently the cornerstone of therapy for most individuals who have asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111Ecc9T]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — decision point: Is asthma still uncontrolled, despite optimized therapy? YES: if asthma is still uncontrolled, the diagnosis of severe asthma has been confirmed, and if not done by now, refer the patient to a specialist or severe asthma clinic if possible. NO: if asthma is now well controlled, consider stepping down treatment; start by decreasing/ceasing oral corticosteroids (OCS) first (if used), checking for adrenal insufficiency, then remove other add-on therapy, then decrease ICS dose, but do not stop ICS.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112c8V5R]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111vyWEz]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

### Randomized clinical trial of intramuscular vs oral methylprednisolone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations following discharge from an emergency department [^111rqBzF]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of long-acting IM methylprednisolone to tapering oral methylprednisolone in adult asthmatic patients discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a single IM dose of 160 mg depot methylprednisolone vs 8-day tapering of a total dose of 160 mg oral methylprednisolone in adult asthmatic patients (age range, 18 to 45 years) who were discharged from the ED following standardized treatment for an acute exacerbation. The primary end point was relapse, which was defined as the need to seek unscheduled care at a doctor's office, clinic, or ED for symptoms of persistent or worsening asthma within 10 days of ED discharge.

Results

Of 190 patients enrolled into the study, 180 completed the study and the follow-up at 10 days (96%). The relapse rate was nearly identical for the two treatment groups (IM administration, 14.1% [13 of 92 patients]; oral administration, 13.6% [12 of 88 patients]; difference, 0.5% [95% confidence interval, - 9.6 to 10.6%]).

Conclusions

Single-dose IM methylprednisolone administered to adult asthmatic patients at ED discharge appears to be a viable therapeutic alternative to a course of oral methylprednisolone. Clinicians may choose to base the route of administration of corticosteroids on concerns about nonadherence to therapy or on the ability of a patient to afford a prescription for outpatient medication.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1157R5if]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### Two days of dexamethasone versus 5 days of prednisone in the treatment of acute asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^116tZzDe]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Dexamethasone has a longer half-life than prednisone and is well tolerated orally. We compare the time needed to return to normal activity and the frequency of relapse after acute exacerbation in adults receiving either 5 days of prednisone or 2 days of dexamethasone.

Methods

We randomized adult emergency department patients (aged 18 to 45 years) with acute exacerbations of asthma (peak expiratory flow rate less than 80% of ideal) to receive either 50 mg of daily oral prednisone for 5 days or 16 mg of daily oral dexamethasone for 2 days. Outcomes were assessed by telephone follow-up.

Results

Ninety-six prednisone and 104 dexamethasone subjects completed the study regimen and follow-up. More patients in the dexamethasone group reported a return to normal activities within 3 days compared with the prednisone group (90% versus 80%; difference 10%; 95% confidence interval 0% to 20%; p = 0.049). Relapse was similar between groups (13% versus 11%; difference 2%; 95% confidence interval -7% to 11%, P = 0.67).

Conclusion

In acute exacerbations of asthma in adults, 2 days of oral dexamethasone is at least as effective as 5 days of oral prednisone in returning patients to their normal level of activity and preventing relapse.

### Systematic literature review of systemic corticosteroid use for asthma management [^114kiGgE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, this review demonstrates that OCS and SCS, including long-term OCS, continue to be commonly used and overused for the management of asthma across the disease spectrum and particularly for severe asthma. This use is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Importantly, patients receiving repeated short-term, high OCS dosages may incur a greater risk of AEs than those receiving long-term, low dosages, as the risk of AEs increases with the cumulative OCS dosage. The introduction of biologics has led to a reduction in OCS use in other disease areas, but our review shows that a similar change has not yet occurred for asthma. This is because biologics have only recently been approved for the treatment of severe asthma. Omalizumab was the only add-on biologic therapy available for the treatment of severe asthma during the time periods covered in many of the identified studies. The recent approval of further biologic treatments that reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbation risks and allow OCS tapering for OCS-dependent patients has the potential to reduce future OCS use for patients with asthma.

### Oral corticosteroids tapering in severe asthma [^113aNT8T]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Suehs and colleagues (pp.) provide an expert consensus report on the important topic of OCS use and tapering in patients with asthma, including statements on less frequent conditions such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A modified Delphi method was used to develop a consensus (> 70% agreement) among 131 experts from different specialties, mostly pulmonologists (73%) and allergists (18%), in addition to patient advocacy organization representatives. Although opinions sometimes differed, some general principles for use and reduction of OCS were agreed on.

This study is a first major attempt to provide clinicians with guidelines based on expert opinion specifically on OCS use for asthma. In the absence of evidenced-based clinical data to support such recommendations, using a Delphi approach to reach consensus statements is a sensible and pragmatic approach. The study included a considerable number of experts, more than expected in a usual Delphi method. However, the criteria used for expert selection were sound and the resulting panel, although large, had the required expertise in severe asthma needed to provide valuable opinions.

The project undertaken by the panel of experts is substantial, with 296 final statements to agree on, from an initial 1,447 raw statements produced from brainstorming. Nevertheless, the participating experts were dedicated, with 96 of the 131 answering the three ranking rounds.

In line with current recommendations, almost all experts on the panel (95%) agreed that our goal should be not to use OCS, but they also acknowledged that maintenance OCS, although a last resort, are still required in some situations. On this matter, the optimal daily OCS dose-reaching consensus was equivalent to 5 mg of prednisone. Up until now, only the Global Initative for Asthma group committed to an "acceptable" OCS dose for maintenance therapy and they settled on the dose corresponding to the physiological steroid production, 7.5 mg daily. However, the lower threshold agreed on by the experts may only reflect the submitted statements as it seems that 7.5 mg was not an option to choose from.

### Oral corticosteroid sparing effects of anti-IL5 / anti-IL5 receptor treatment after 2 years of treatment [^111ixboe]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical trials have shown oral corticosteroid (OCS) sparing effects of anti-IL5/anti-IL5-receptor treatments. The generalisability of these clinical trials may be limited, due to the rigid inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the short tapering duration. Real-world evidence is needed to bridge the gap between the clinical trials and the clinical practice. With this study we present real-life data on the OCS sparing effects of anti-IL5/anti-IL5-receptor treatments after 12 and 24 months of treatment.

Methods

Severe, eosinophilic asthma patients treated with mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab for 24 months were included in this observational study. Data on OCS-dose, FEV1, ACT/ACQ score and blood eosinophils were obtained from the patients records before anti-IL5/anti-IL5-receptor treatment, and after 12 and 24 months of treatment.

Results

At baseline 75% of patients were on daily OCS. This number was reduced to 50% after one year of treatment, p < 0.001, and 28% after two years of treatment, p < 0.001. Within the group on daily OCS the median daily dose was reduced from 10 mg of Prednisolone at baseline (IQR 5–20) to 3.75 mg Prednisolone (IQR 0–10) after 12 months, and 0 mg Prednisolone (IQR 0–7.5) after 24 months, p < 0.001.

Conclusions

The findings in this study add to the generalisability of the clinical studies, showing significant OCS sparing effects of anti-IL5/anti-IL5-receptor treatment in a real-life setting. Furthermore, these findings add to the understanding of the long-term effects of anti-IL5/anti-IL5-receptor treatment, showing an even further and persistent OCS reduction after two years of treatment.

### An official ATS clinical practice guideline: interpretation of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FENO) for clinical applications [^113nLwnm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide — corticosteroid responsiveness and tapering: FENO has been shown to predict the likelihood of steroid responsiveness and may also help identify patients in whom steroid therapy may be safely withdrawn. Even without sputum eosinophilia, FENO is highly predictive of steroid response at a cut point of 33 ppb. For tapering decisions, high FENO (> 47 ppb) predicts loss of asthma control when inhaled steroids are reduced or withdrawn in children with confirmed asthma, whereas low FENO (< 22 ppb) predicts successful reduction or withdrawal with a positive predictive value of 92%.

### Composite type-2 biomarker strategy versus a symptom-risk-based algorithm to adjust corticosteroid dose in patients with severe asthma: a multicentre, single-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^117AM3QX]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The median daily ICS reduction in patients who reduced treatment was consistent across all analyses at a beclometasone dipropionate equivalent dose of 1000 μg. Our expert Delphi consensus advised that at least a 250–500 μg reduction in daily ICS treatment would be regarded as a clinically meaningful dose reduction in a severe asthma population on high-dose ICS, suggesting that severe asthma specialists will recognise this as a substantial treatment benefit.

The current study also aimed to establish the prevalence of T2 biomarker-low asthma in our severe asthma population when the corticosteroid dose was reduced to a minimum, because it is recognised that exposure to corticosteroids downregulates T2 biomarkers and overtreatment might potentially overestimate the prevalence of the T2 low phenotype. At study entry, 23% of participants were composite biomarker-low, which was in line with our analysis of the placebo groups of clinical trials with lebrikizumab and omalizumab (appendix p 6). However, only 11 (5%) of 209 patients managed either to down-titrate successfully to the lowest dose of ICS and remained biomarker-low or remained serially biomarker-low and did not reduce their corticosteroid treatment. These data suggest that ICS can be reduced cautiously to relatively low maintenance levels in T2 biomarker-low patients, and this would seem important before assigning any phenotypic label. It further implies that T2 biomarker-low severe asthma, as defined in this study, is uncommon. We propose that detailed clinical assessment including corticosteroid withdrawal is important before investigational research studies and testing of clinical interventions in this T2 biomarker-low population.

In summary, this study did not meet its primary outcome of showing a greater proportion of patients on a lower corticosteroid dose by means of a biomarker-based strategy in severe asthma compared with corticosteroid adjustment based on symptoms and previous exacerbation history in the ITT population. We noted a large number of patients who did not follow treatment advisories to reduce corticosteroid treatment in both treatment groups; understanding the reasons for this finding is an important area for future research. In the study population who followed treatment advice per protocol or who had uncontrolled asthma at study entry, meaningful corticosteroid reduction was achieved. A biomarker-adjusted corticosteroid strategy seems particularly beneficial in those patients where symptoms and T2 biomarker profile are discordant and, as seen in up to 50% of patients with severe asthma; we suggest that before progression to high-dose inhaled and systemic corticosteroid treatment, predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response should be assessed. Once established on this dose, biomarker-driven dose reduction can be particularly challenging in patients with high levels of asthma symptoms.

Fig. 1
OCS-sparing schedules during the OCS dosing reduction period (A) and overall trial design (B). In the key single-center study, patients with a baseline OCS dose ≥ 15 mg/day were not permitted to reduce their dose below 5 mg/day and patients with baseline 10– < 15 mg/day were not permitted to reduce their dose below 2.5 mg/day; only patients with a baseline dose < 10 mg/day were permitted to reduce to 0 mg/day. In SIRIUS, patients with an optimized OCS dose of ≥ 25 mg/day were not permitted to reduce their dose to 0 mg/day (not permitted below 2.5 mg/day). In ZONDA, patients with an optimized dose of between 20 and 30 mg/day were not permitted to reduce their dose below 5 mg/day and patients with an optimized dose of 17.5 or 15 mg/day were held temporarily at 5 mg/day for at least 8 weeks before continuing OCS dose reductions; only patients who were receiving an optimized dose of ≤ 12.5 mg/day could reduce their dose to 0 mg/day. In VENTURE, patients with an optimized OCS dose of ≥ 35 mg/day were not permitted to reduce their dose below 2.5 mg/day; only patients receiving an optimized dose < 35 mg/day could reduce their dose to 0 mg/day. Further information detailing the criteria for not reducing OCS dose for each study can be found in the Additional file 1. Patients in ZONDA with documented failures of OCS dose reduction within 6 months prior to enrollment were not required to proceed through the OCS dose optimization phase (Additional file 1). *Starting doses of 12.5 mg/day had an initial reduction of 2.5 mg/day (to 10 mg/day) followed by a reduction of 5 mg/day (to 5 mg/day); † variable duration with no minimum or maximum limits, depending on individual baseline OCS dose; ‡ no further changes in OCS dose were permitted during this period.

### Initial starting dose of inhaled corticosteroids in adults with asthma: a systematic review [^113c4Np1]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma guidelines vary in their recommendations for the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in asthma. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to establish the optimal starting dose of ICS for asthma in adults.

Methods

Randomised controlled trials comparing two doses of the same ICS in adults with asthma and no concomitant inhaled or oral corticosteroid were assessed. Included trials were analysed according to the following ICS dose comparisons: high (≥ 800 microg/day beclomethasone (BDP)) versus moderate (400 < 800 microg/day BDP) (n = 7); moderate versus low (< 400 microg/day BDP) (n = 6); step down versus constant dose (n = 4).

Results

Fourteen publications describing 13 trials were included in the review. Studies (n = 4) that compared a step down approach with a constant moderate/low dose of ICS found no difference in lung function, symptoms, or rescue medications between the two treatment approaches (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the change in morning peak flow after treatment with high compared with moderate dose ICS. When compared with low dose ICS, moderate dose ICS significantly improved morning peak flow (change from baseline WMD 11.14 l/min, 95% CI 1.34 to 20.93) and nocturnal symptoms (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.06).

Conclusions

For patients with asthma who require ICS, starting with a moderate dose is equivalent to starting with a high dose and stepping down. The small non-significant benefits of starting with a high ICS dose are not of sufficient clinical benefit to warrant its use. Initial moderate ICS doses appear to be more effective than an initial low ICS dose.

### Addition of anti-leukotriene agents to inhaled corticosteroids for adults and adolescents with persistent asthma [^116QUPi1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma management guidelines recommend low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as first-line therapy for adults and adolescents with persistent asthma. The addition of anti-leukotriene agents to ICS offers a therapeutic option in cases of suboptimal control with daily ICS.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of anti-leukotriene agents added to ICS compared with the same dose, an increased dose or a tapering dose of ICS (in both arms) for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with persistent asthma. Also, to determine whether any characteristics of participants or treatments might affect the magnitude of response.

Search Methods

We identified relevant studies from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the trial registries clinicaltrials.gov and ICTRP from inception to August 2016.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older on a maintenance dose of ICS for whom investigators added anti-leukotrienes to the ICS and compared treatment with the same dose, an increased dose or a tapering dose of ICS for at least four weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was the number of participants with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (except when both groups tapered the dose of ICS, in which case the primary outcome was the % reduction in ICS dose from baseline with maintained asthma control). Secondary outcomes included markers of exacerbation, lung function, asthma control, quality of life, withdrawals and adverse events.

Main Results

We included in the review 37 studies representing 6128 adult and adolescent participants (most with mild to moderate asthma). Investigators in these studies used three leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs): montelukast (n = 24), zafirlukast (n = 11) and pranlukast (n = 2); studies lasted from four weeks to five years. Anti-leukotrienes and ICS versus same dose of ICSOf 16 eligible studies, 10 studies, representing 2364 adults and adolescents, contributed data. Anti-leukotriene agents given as adjunct therapy to ICS reduced by half the number of participants with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.86; 815 participants; four studies; moderate quality); this is equivalent to a number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) over six to 16 weeks of 22 (95% CI 16 to 75). Only one trial including 368 participants reported mortality and serious adverse events, but events were too infrequent for researchers to draw a conclusion. Four trials reported all adverse events, and the pooled result suggested little difference between groups (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22; 1024 participants; three studies; moderate quality). Investigators noted between-group differences favouring the addition of anti-leukotrienes for morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), asthma symptoms and night-time awakenings, but not for reduction in β 2 -agonist use or evening PEFR. Anti-leukotrienes and ICS versus higher dose of ICSOf 15 eligible studies, eight studies, representing 2008 adults and adolescents, contributed data. Results showed no statistically significant difference in the number of participants with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.39; 1779 participants; four studies; moderate quality) nor in all adverse events between groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 1899 participants; six studies; low quality). Three trials reported no deaths among 834 participants. Results showed no statistically significant differences in lung function tests including morning PEFR and FEV 1 nor in asthma control measures including use of rescue β 2 -agonists or asthma symptom scores. Anti-leukotrienes and ICS versus tapering dose of ICSSeven studies, representing 1150 adults and adolescents, evaluated the combination of anti-leukotrienes and tapering-dose of ICS compared with tapering-dose of ICS alone and contributed data. Investigators observed no statistically significant difference in % change from baseline ICS dose (mean difference (MD) -3.05, 95% CI -8.13 to 2.03; 930 participants; four studies; moderate quality), number of participants with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.04; 542 participants; five studies; low quality) or all adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08; 1100 participants; six studies; moderate quality). Serious adverse events occurred more frequently among those taking anti-leukotrienes plus tapering ICS than in those taking tapering doses of ICS alone (RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.92; 621 participants; two studies; moderate quality), but deaths were too infrequent for researchers to draw any conclusions about mortality. Data showed no improvement in lung function nor in asthma control measures.

Authors' Conclusions

For adolescents and adults with persistent asthma, with suboptimal asthma control with daily use of ICS, the addition of anti-leukotrienes is beneficial for reducing moderate and severe asthma exacerbations and for improving lung function and asthma control compared with the same dose of ICS. We cannot be certain that the addition of anti-leukotrienes is superior, inferior or equivalent to a higher dose of ICS. Scarce available evidence does not support anti-leukotrienes as an ICS sparing agent, and use of LTRAs was not associated with increased risk of withdrawals or adverse effects, with the exception of an increase in serious adverse events when the ICS dose was tapered. Information was insufficient for assessment of mortality.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^111U9gmP]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with severe asthma often require regular oral corticosteroids (OCS) to maintain asthma control. For patients with severe allergic or severe eosinophilic asthma who experience poor symptom control and/or frequent asthma exacerbations, despite the use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABA) and/or maintenance OCS, the use of biologic treatments as add-on therapy is becoming the new standard of care. Five biologics are now approved for the treatment of severe asthma. Omalizumab is an anti-immunoglobulin E antibody approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma. Mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab are anti–interleukin-5/anti–interleukin-5 receptor humanized monoclonal antibodies approved in the USA and Europe for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. Most recently, dupilumab, an anti–interleukin-4 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody was approved in the USA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or OCS-dependent asthma and in Europe for the treatment of severe asthma with type 2 inflammation.

Studies assessing the efficacy of biologics for the treatment of asthma often aim to reduce the use of OCS, in turn, reducing the risk of adverse events (AEs) and comorbidities associated with chronic OCS use. However, this must be done without loss of disease control; current guidance and data from less recent publications on the strategy for reducing maintenance OCS use in patients initiating biologic treatment are insufficient. In a clinical trial setting, suitable patient selection criteria and effective OCS dose tapering strategies are key when assessing biologic asthma therapies, to ensure trial outcomes are clinically informative.

Here, we describe the development of OCS-sparing study methodologies for biologic therapies in patients with asthma. In particular, we focus on lessons learned from four randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies: a key single-center study (mepolizumab), SIRIUS (mepolizumab), ZONDA (benralizumab), VENTURE (dupilumab) and one open-label study (PONENTE [benralizumab]). All these studies assessed the effect of asthma biologics on OCS use using predefined OCS-tapering schedules (Table 1).

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (Pediapred) [^114L4qnq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of PEDIAPRED®may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (33.6 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^113zWzky]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Designs for OCS tapering studies have evolved over time. The design of the key single-center study laid the foundations for improvements in study design that allowed OCS tapering methodologies to be successfully applied during larger, international, multicenter studies. Building upon the first steps taken by the key single-center study and SIRIUS, the duration and specificity of OCS tapering, as well as the monitoring of both disease control and safety during OCS tapering, have informed OCS-sparing asthma studies in recent years. The studies to date show that stepwise OCS dose reduction under biologic therapy is possible while maintaining asthma control. While the protocols used during clinical trials are often complex, they provide important information on the effects of OCS-tapering methodologies that may be useful in clinical practice. Common features of these methodologies include a sufficient OCS dose optimization phase prior to initiation of biologic treatment, an end-target OCS dose tailored based on the OCS dose achieved during dose optimization, and careful monitoring for loss of asthma control and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during tapering. Though adrenal insufficiency during OCS tapering remains a concern, the steps needed to reduce the risks are becoming clearer and better understood. Additionally, most schedules consisted of OCS dose reductions every 4 weeks, beginning with reductions of either 10 mg/day or 5 mg/day for patients with the highest baseline OCS doses and finishing with smaller reductions of 2.5 mg/day or 1.25 mg/day until the target dose was achieved. This general approach may be useful in real-world settings.

Future studies may identify genes that are up- or down-regulated during OCS tapering and these genetic markers as well as other biomarkers could help to provide a more patient-centered approach to OCS tapering, either prior to or during biologic therapy. Lessons learned in the development of effective OCS-tapering trial methodologies in asthma may be useful in the development of future trials in this area and will likely help guide OCS reduction in real-world patient care.

Study outcomes

The need for OCS dose optimization and dose reduction phases of an appropriate length and design may be demonstrated by comparison of outcome results from OCS tapering studies. In VENTURE, the OCS dose was reduced by a median of 50% in the placebo-treated group, which is greater than that seen in the ZONDA and SIRIUS studies, (25% and 0% reduction with placebo, respectively). This high placebo response in VENTURE is suggestive of potentially inadequate OCS optimization before randomization. When comparing treatment effects versus placebo, the proportion of patients with a ≥ 90% reduction in OCS dose was greater with biologic therapy versus placebo in each of the VENTURE, ZONDA and SIRIUS studies (24% difference between placebo and dupilumab in VENTURE, a 21–25% difference between placebo and benralizumab in ZONDA, and 12% difference between placebo and mepolizumab in SIRIUS). In the PONENTE study, most patients (63%) eliminated the use of OCS following treatment with benralizumab. These study outcomes are not, however, comparable as there were differences between the studies in the length of the OCS dose optimization and OCS reduction phases. It is likely that differing study populations and varying OCS management practices also influenced study outcomes, particularly the differences in eosinophil count requirement prior to the study, severity of disease and duration of OCS therapy, given that the use of OCS in patients with asthma has become more judicious over time.

### An umbrella review: corticosteroid therapy for adults with acute asthma [^114YeeUY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this "umbrella" review is to synthesize the evidence and provide clinicians a single report that summarizes the state of knowledge regarding the use of corticosteroids in adults with acute asthma. Systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library and additional clinical trials published in English from 1966 to 2007 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL, and references from bibliographies of pertinent articles were reviewed. Results indicate that the evidence base is frequently limited to small, single-center studies. Findings suggest that therapy with systemic corticosteroids accelerates the resolution of acute asthma and reduces the risk of relapse. There is no evidence that corticosteroid doses greater than standard doses (prednisone 50–100 mg equivalent) are beneficial. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids, as well as intramuscular and oral corticosteroid regimens, seem to be similarly effective. A nontapered 5- to 10-day course of corticosteroid therapy seems to be sufficient for most discharged patients. Combinations of oral and inhaled corticosteroids on emergency department/hospital discharge might minimize the risk of relapse.

### Addition of anti-leukotriene agents to inhaled corticosteroids in children with persistent asthma [^116sqPEF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In the treatment of children with mild persistent asthma, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the preferred monotherapy (referred to as step 2 of therapy). In children with inadequate asthma control on low doses of ICS (step 2), asthma management guidelines recommend adding an anti-leukotriene agent to existing ICS as one of three therapeutic options to intensify therapy (step 3).

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of anti-leukotriene agents and ICS to the use of the same, an increased, or a tapering dose of ICS in children and adolescents with persistent asthma who remain symptomatic despite the use of maintenance ICS. In addition, we wished to determine the characteristics of people or treatments, if any, that influenced the magnitude of response attributable to the addition of anti-leukotrienes.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials (CAGR), which were derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, and CINAHL; and the handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts, as well as the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. The search was conducted until January 2013.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in children and adolescents, aged one to 18 years, with asthma, who remained symptomatic despite the use of a stable maintenance dose of ICS and in whom anti-leukotrienes were added to the ICS if they were compared to the same, an increased, or a tapering dose of ICS for at least four weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Five paediatric (parallel group or cross-over) trials met the inclusion criteria. We considered two (40%) trials to be at a low risk of bias. Four published trials, representing 559 children (aged ≥ six years) and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma, contributed data to the review. No trial enrolled preschoolers. All trials used montelukast as the anti-leukotriene agent administered for between four and 16 weeks. Three trials evaluated the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS compared to the same dose of ICS alone (step 3 versus step 2). No statistically significant group difference was observed in the only trial reporting participants with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids over four weeks (N = 268 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.91). There was also no statistically significant difference in percentage change in FEV₁ (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) with mean difference (MD) 1.3 (95% CI -0.09 to 2.69) in this trial, but a significant group difference was observed in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR): N = 218 participants; MD 9.70 L/min (95% CI 1.27 to 18.13) and MD 10.70 (95% CI 2.41 to 18.99), respectively. One trial compared the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS to a higher-dose of ICS (step 3 versus step 3). No significant group difference was observed in this trial for participants with exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids over 16 weeks (N = 182 participants; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25), nor was there any significant difference in exacerbations requiring hospitalisation. There was no statistically significant group difference in withdrawals overall or because of any cause with either protocol. No trial explored the impact of adding anti-leukotrienes as a means to taper the dose of ICS.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of anti-leukotrienes to ICS is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the need for rescue oral corticosteroids or hospital admission compared to the same or an increased dose of ICS in children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma. Although anti-leukotrienes have been licensed for use in children for over 10 years, the paucity of paediatric trials, the absence of data on preschoolers, and the variability in the reporting of relevant clinical outcomes considerably limit firm conclusions. At present, there is no firm evidence to support the efficacy and safety of anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to ICS as a step-3 option in the therapeutic arsenal for children with uncontrolled asthma symptoms on low-dose ICS.

7 Stewardship and Tapering of OCS

Given the evidence of OCS dose‐sparing effects of add‐on biologics and the acceptable safety profiles of these treatments, biologics can play a key role in OCS stewardship and reducing OCS dependence. As the use of biologics has become more common, tapering and cessation of OCS, even for long‐term users, has become more feasible, although clear guidance on how best to reduce OCS has been lacking.

OCS doses must be reduced gradually because abrupt discontinuation can result in adrenal insufficiency or a life‐threatening adrenal crisis. Use of OCS, even short term and at low doses, suppresses the natural production of glucocorticoids by preventing the release of corticotropin‐releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary gland. Over time, hypoplasia and atrophy of the adrenal glands can occur, reducing their capacity to produce hormones such as cortisol. After discontinuation of external glucocorticoids, adrenal insufficiency, when the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol, can occur. The estimated absolute risk of adrenal insufficiency in patients with asthma taking any OCS is 49%. The risk of adrenal insufficiency or a life‐threatening adrenal crisis is highest for patients abruptly discontinuing OCS and those who have received OCS for 3–4 weeks or more. However, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should also be considered in patients withdrawing from a short course of OCS. For example, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving a 14‐day course of OCS (40 mg), adrenal suppression was noted in 8 of the 9 patients by the last day of therapy, with 3 patients still experiencing adrenal dysfunction 21 days after discontinuation.

Oral corticosteroids in children with severe exacerbations — A dose of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years of age and 30 mg/day for children aged 2–5 years, is currently recommended (Evidence A). Several studies have failed to show any benefits when OCS are given earlier during periods of worsening wheeze managed in an outpatient setting, whereas a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of hospitalization when OCS were administered in the emergency department, but no clear benefit when given in the outpatient setting. A course of 3–5 days is sufficient in most children of this age and can be stopped without tapering, but the child must be reviewed after discharge to confirm recovery. In children discharged from the emergency department, an intramuscular corticosteroid may be an alternative to a course of OCS for preventing relapse, but the risk of long-term adverse effects must be considered and there is insufficient evidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^112xtceD]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) is associated with a risk of adverse events and comorbidities. As such, a goal in assessing the efficacy of biologics in severe asthma is often to monitor reduction in OCS usage. Importantly, however, OCS dose reductions must be conducted without loss of disease control.

Main Body

Herein, we describe the development of OCS-sparing study methodologies for biologic therapies in patients with asthma. In particular, we focus on four randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies of varying sizes (key single-center study [n = 20], SIRIUS [n = 135], ZONDA [n = 220], VENTURE [n = 210]) and one open-label study (PONENTE [n = 598]), which assessed the effect of asthma biologics (mepolizumab, benralizumab or dupilumab) on OCS use using predefined OCS-tapering schedules. In particular, we discuss the evolution of study design elements in these studies, including patient eligibility criteria, the use of tailored OCS dose reduction schedules, monitoring of outcomes, the use of biomarkers and use of repetitive assessments of adrenal function during OCS tapering.

Conclusion

Taken together, these developments have improved OCS-sparing asthma studies in recent years and the lessons learned may help with optimization of further OCS-sparing studies, and potentially clinical practice in the future.

HPA axis recovery following exogenous corticosteroid exposure

Recovery of HPA axis function is unpredictable, and there are little data that accurately describe an expected time course for the recovery of adrenal function. Following discontinuation of exogenous corticosteroids, HPA axis suppression may resolve quickly (within hours or days) or persist, in some cases for up to 1 year or longer. Moreover, in some patients, endogenous cortisol secretion remains permanently suppressed. Although even a single dose of corticosteroid can cause HPA axis suppression (this is the basis for the overnight dexamethasone suppression test used to screen for Cushing syndrome), recovery is usually rapid with no adverse clinical sequelae.

Longer courses (e.g. 4 weeks or more) have been linked with longer recovery times, and, as a general rule, slow tapering after long‐term OCS usage is almost always necessary to support the recovery of normal HPA axis function. In this context, complete HPA axis recovery is unlikely to be observed until at least 4 weeks after cessation of corticosteroids. In a systematic review of systemic glucocorticoid therapy and AI in adults, 75% of patients had persistent AI 10 weeks after discontinuation of OCS (≥ 4 weeks of use), whereas 15% still had AI 3 years beyond discontinuation. Glucocorticoid exposure varied significantly across studies, but no obvious correlations were noted when AI cases were stratified by dosage or duration of corticosteroid use. Across all groups, 14% of patients who received a medium cumulative dosage (0.5–5.0 g) and 50% of those who received a high cumulative dosage (> 5.0 g) developed AI.

Currently, there is little consensus as to the optimum approach for safely tapering corticosteroids. The decision of when and how to taper corticosteroids, and when and how to monitor for AI, is usually at the clinician's discretion and based on signs and symptoms of disease control. The fear of underlying AI may actually hinder a clinician's confidence in tapering OCS. Ideally, tapering should be individualized, with continuous monitoring of the disease and AEs.

Glucocorticoid tapering safety — Evidence from included studies: One study considered only the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131), and another evaluated a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after benralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma; across all five studies, the data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency or clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up. The authors note that these results suggest it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term high-dose use, and that after long-term use, more rapid tapering at supraphysiologic dosing followed by a slower taper at physiologic dosing appears safe; no studies compared different tapering schemes.

### A review of prednisolone prescribing for children with acute asthma in the UK [^112DKbTt]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide asthma guidelines recommend short courses of oral prednisolone in children with acute exacerbations generating high prescription numbers. There is a paucity of evidence to inform the optimal dose and course duration. This has led to a variation in the recommendations for prednisolone prescribing. Our objective was to assess prednisolone prescribing practise for children with acute asthma in a representative sample of UK prescribers.

Methods

We developed an online questionnaire asking prescribers the prednisolone dosage, course duration and formulation used, whether they discussed oral prednisolone side effects with the family and at what child's age they changed from prescribing soluble to non-soluble formulations. This was sent to 1006 UK prescribers including Paediatric Respiratory Consultants, doctors in training, asthma nurses and General Practitioners.

Results

200 complete responses were received (response rate 20%). The majority of surveyed prescribers follow the British National Formulary for Children recommendations on dosage rather than those included in the British Thoracic Society and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Despite this, we highlighted a 4-fold variation in prednisolone dosages for acute asthma. The majority of prescribers chose 3 days as the course duration. High use of soluble formulations was highlighted.

Conclusions

There is wide variation in the dose of prednisolone prescribed for children with acute asthma in the UK. This reflects a relative lack of evidence that needs addressing.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

### Managing corticosteroid-related comorbidities in severe asthma [^117CjTVa]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in severe asthma remains all too common despite advances in asthma treatment. Use of OCS is associated with significant toxicity that can have a lasting adverse impact on a patient's overall health. Monoclonal antibodies have been developed that reduce both the rate of occurrence of OCS-treated exacerbations and the OCS requirements in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. This article describes strategies to prevent and best manage endocrine complications associated with OCS use and provides guidance on OCS dose management after the introduction of steroid-sparing therapies. (1) We identify OCS-dependent patients and assess for comorbidities including bone health, glycemic control, and adrenal function; (2) we begin attempts at OCS dose optimization before or soon after introducing a steroid-sparing biologic therapy; (3) we taper OCS, using explicit criteria for asthma control; (4) we assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis integrity once a physiologic dose of OCS is achieved to guide further the rate of OCS taper; and (5) we manage corticosteroid-related comorbidities as detailed in this article.

Discussion

This audit provides the first outcome data on a well characterised cohort of adults with severe refractory asthma. We report significant changes in important healthcare outcomes, particularly reductions in unscheduled visits, hospital admissions and rescue oral steroids, which taken collectively suggests a reduction in severe exacerbations. Improvement was also seen in lung function, but notably daily reliever medication use was not different, suggesting persistent symptomatic morbidity in this group. Because of the precise characterisation of this group, we believe this is due to asthma and not other non-asthma comorbidities.

As this is an observational clinical registry, we cannot exclude the possibility that the improvement in healthcare outcomes simply represents 'regression to the mean', since at the time of referral and initial assessment, patients are likely to be clinically unwell. However, 60–75% of patients in these centres are tertiary referrals and had difficult asthma for prolonged periods prior to assessment, making regression to the mean unlikely to be the entire explanation for the observed improvement. Even at baseline, in this severe asthmatic population, hospital admission rate was relatively low, but unscheduled healthcare contact and rescue steroid courses were high. With appropriate specialist management, hospital admission rates were further reduced, suggesting the economic cost of refractory asthma is unlikely to be driven by hospital admission.

The commonest therapeutic strategy was initiation of maintenance steroids, which is consistent with the reduction in peripheral blood eosinophils and the reduction in rescue oral steroid courses. The dissociation between FeNO, clinical outcome and blood eosinophilia is consistent with other data, which have shown that FeNO-based strategies have not been able to reduce exacerbation rates. In a recent oral steroid tapering study, which included FeNO as part of the steroid reduction algorithm, weekly Asthma Control Questionnaire and forced expiratory volume in 1 s measurement were the major drivers of steroid reduction, with minimal contribution from daily FeNO. Collectively, these data question whether FeNO is useful in adjusting steroid dose in patients on maintenance or frequent bursts of oral steroids.

The increase in BMI is also consistent with more steroid exposure, but BMI also increased in subjects not on maintenance oral steroids at follow-up. This latter group remained on high-dose inhaled steroids but rescue steroid exposure in the preceding 12 months was relatively low (median 1, IQR 0–3), suggesting that BMI increase is not exclusively related to oral steroid exposure in this population, and reduced exercise capacity due to persistent asthma may be relevant.
