## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a statement that discusses the risks of opioids in chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the vulnerable physiology in chronic hypercapnia. Then, I should examine the mechanism of opioid-induced respiratory depression and why it is amplified here. Next, I will quantify risk from trials and observational data. After that, I need to identify key modifying risk factors. Then, I will outline clinical consequences and differentiate them from mimics. Next, I should specify mitigation and monitoring strategies, including when to escalate to NIV or intubation. Finally, I will balance risks versus benefits in palliative settings and reconcile any guideline nuances or potential contradictions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the patient population and physiological vulnerability: chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia often arises from COPD, restrictive chest wall/neuromuscular disease, or obesity hypoventilation, all conditions with reduced ventilatory reserve and often blunted central chemoreceptor responsiveness to CO2, rendering patients dependent on hypoxic drive and at high risk for decompensation when hypoventilation worsens even modestly, which is associated with excess mortality as PaCO2 rises [^111uZTNY] [^1174hykS].

> I will now examine the primary mechanism of opioid-induced harm; opioids depress brainstem respiratory centers via μ-receptor agonism, lowering respiratory rate and tidal volume, attenuating the hypercapnic ventilatory response, and causing CO2 retention that further potentiates sedation, with FDA labels warning that patients with COPD, cor pulmonale, or substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, or hypercapnia are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea even at recommended doses [^115HHaeE] [^112hSTpX] [^111e4xsQ].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk in monitored inpatients; the multinational PRODIGY study found that 46% of general ward patients on parenteral opioids had at least one episode of opioid-induced respiratory depression when continuously monitored, highlighting how intermittent checks miss events and how early subtle changes can precede deterioration and costlier, longer hospitalizations [^115iBS4w] [^1166riHy] [^1166riHy].

> I should confirm the association with hypercapnic respiratory failure at the population level; a high-credibility case-control analysis identified opioid use as strongly associated with hypercapnic respiratory failure with a notable population attributable fraction, and other data suggest at least a three-fold increase in risk, though I need to acknowledge observational design and confounding while noting biological plausibility given direct ventilatory suppression and sleep-related hypoventilation effects [^1173s2RU] [^114dY6SB].

> Next, I should review sleep-related breathing risks; opioids increase central sleep apnea and sleep-related hypoxemia in a dose-dependent manner, and polysomnography series describe ataxic breathing and central apneas predominantly in NREM sleep, which, in a chronically hypercapnic patient, compounds nocturnal hypoventilation and worsens daytime hypercapnia and somnolence [^111bUL2V] [^115n8wsh] [^1141JtvA].

> Hold on, I should verify mortality modifiers; concurrent benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants confer synergistic respiratory depression with warnings of profound sedation, coma, and death, while observational COPD cohorts suggest that higher opioid doses and benzodiazepine co-prescription are linked to modestly increased mortality, whereas carefully titrated low-dose opioids may not increase admissions or death, underscoring dose and co-medication as critical modifiers rather than opioids being uniformly unsafe [^111bUL2V] [^111FZt5x] [^117HxyLH] [^113nUBGc].

> I need to check patient- and treatment-specific risk factors; age ≥ 60 years, opioid naivety, sleep-disordered breathing, and chronic heart failure independently increase OIRD risk in PRODIGY, and neuraxial administration can cause delayed respiratory depression up to 24 hours, particularly with intrathecal or thoracic dosing, all of which magnify hazards in hypercapnic disease with limited reserve [^115iBS4w] [^115HieJ1].

> Let me think about clinical consequences and diagnostic pitfalls; even therapeutic opioid doses can precipitate acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring NIV or intubation, yet opioid-induced hypoventilation may be misattributed to a COPD exacerbation unless clinicians consider opioid effect and check ABGs, and OIRD is associated with additional length of stay and costs, while chronic opioid exposure may cause adrenal insufficiency that confuses the picture with nonspecific fatigue and weakness [^111LmNWc] [^115GNgHM] [^1166riHy] [^112hSTpX].

> Next, I should review mitigation and monitoring; high-risk patients should be risk-stratified using PRODIGY and, when opioids are necessary, monitored with continuous oximetry and capnography given the high event miss rate with spot checks, and serial ABGs are prudent in hypercapnic disease to detect rising PaCO2 while concurrently addressing precipitating factors per general principles of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure management [^115iBS4w] [^1166riHy] [^112XA9Ur].

> I should confirm prescribing principles; avoid opioids during acute severe bronchospasm in unmonitored settings, reserve opioids for refractory symptoms after non-opioid and nonpharmacologic strategies, use the lowest effective dose with slow titration, consider sustained-release morphine in the 10–30 mg/day range for refractory breathlessness with close follow-up, co-prescribe naloxone and avoid benzodiazepines and other sedatives whenever possible given additive risk [^111e4xsQ] [^116fxFmx] [^117HxyLH] [^111FZt5x] [^111bUL2V].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation thresholds and actions; intervene immediately for bradypnea, hypoxemia, or increasing somnolence with opioid dose reduction and naloxone as indicated, and if hypercapnic acidosis persists or worsens, initiate NIV which reduces intubation and mortality in COPD exacerbations with acidosis, escalating to invasive ventilation if NIV fails or is contraindicated; when sedation is needed during NIV, favor agents without respiratory depression and avoid combining classes that increase risk [^111FZt5x] [^111LmNWc] [^115GNgHM] [^111uLBaV].

> I need to ensure the palliative balance is clear; in end-stage respiratory disease with chronic refractory breathlessness despite optimized care, carefully titrated low-dose opioids can improve symptoms without clear excess mortality in observational cohorts, but benefits must be weighed against risks, with meticulous monitoring and avoidance of sedative co-therapies, and opioids should be only one component of a multimodal breathlessness plan [^113nUBGc] [^117HxyLH] [^116fxFmx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought NIV should generally be avoided in hypercapnia unless severe; let me reconsider and reconcile the guidelines: ERS/ATS recommend not using NIV in COPD patients who are hypercapnic but not acidotic during exacerbation, whereas BTS/ICS and Cochrane support NIV when there is persistent respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.35 with PaCO2 > 6.5 kPa) and as first-line for many causes of acute hypercapnic failure, which aligns when framed by the presence or absence of acidosis and clinical context [^11639QQM] [^111LmNWc] [^115GNgHM].

> But wait, I almost overstated that opioids are absolutely contraindicated in hypercapnic COPD; I should double-check the labels: the absolute contraindication is acute or severe bronchial asthma in unmonitored settings, while hypercapnic COPD and reduced reserve confer increased risk even at recommended doses, necessitating extreme caution, lower dosing, and monitoring rather than a categorical prohibition outside of specific labeled contraindications [^111e4xsQ] [^112hSTpX].

> Final take-home, and I should confirm the key figures: opioids pose substantial risk in chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure through central respiratory depression, CO2 retention, and sleep-disordered breathing; nearly half of monitored inpatients on parenteral opioids experience OIRD, opioid exposure is strongly associated with hypercapnic respiratory failure in population data with estimates around three-fold increased risk, and co-administration with benzodiazepines amplifies danger; risk stratification, continuous respiratory monitoring, slow dose titration at the lowest effective dose, naloxone access, and strict avoidance of sedative co-therapy are essential, with NIV promptly initiated for acidotic decompensation and opioids reserved for carefully selected palliative scenarios where benefits outweigh risks [^115iBS4w] [^1173s2RU] [^114dY6SB] [^111bUL2V] [^111LmNWc] [^116fxFmx].

Opioids in chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia carry a **high risk of life-threatening respiratory depression** [^112hSTpX] and CO2 retention [^115HHaeE], even at recommended doses, due to blunted ventilatory drive and impaired gas exchange [^111e4xsQ] [^111evtqq]. Risk is greatest at **initiation and during dose escalation** [^115HieJ1] [^112hSTpX] and is further amplified by concomitant CNS depressants [^111bUL2V] [^111evtqq], sleep-disordered breathing [^115iBS4w], and advanced age or frailty [^115iBS4w]. Opioids can worsen hypercapnia [^115HHaeE], cause central sleep apnea [^111bUL2V] [^1141JtvA], and increase mortality and hospitalizations [^1166riHy] [^117HxyLH]. Use the **lowest effective dose** [^112hSTpX], avoid high doses, and monitor closely with ABGs and continuous oximetry/capnography [^115iBS4w] [^114BjYpt] [^111uLBaV]. Consider non-opioid alternatives and reserve opioids for refractory symptoms with careful titration and monitoring [^116fxFmx].

## Physiological mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression

Opioids depress ventilation through **multiple mechanisms**, including:

- **Blunted ventilatory drive**: Reduced sensitivity to CO2 and hypoxia, worsening hypercapnia and hypoxemia [^112hSTpX] [^111evtqq].

- **Central respiratory depression**: Direct suppression of brainstem respiratory centers, causing hypoventilation and apnea [^111e4xsQ] [^115HieJ1].

- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Central sleep apnea and hypoxemia, further impairing gas exchange [^111bUL2V] [^1141JtvA].

---

## Clinical risks associated with opioid use in hypercapnic respiratory failure

Opioid use in hypercapnic respiratory failure is associated with **several clinical risks**:

- **Life-threatening respiratory depression**: Increased risk of apnea and respiratory arrest, even at recommended doses [^112hSTpX] [^115HieJ1].

- **Exacerbation of hypercapnia**: CO2 retention can worsen respiratory acidosis and precipitate acute decompensation [^115HHaeE] [^111e4xsQ].

- **Increased mortality and hospitalizations**: Higher risk of death and respiratory-related admissions [^1113Kqwv] [^117HxyLH].

- **Central sleep apnea**: Dose-dependent CSA that further impairs ventilation [^111bUL2V] [^1141JtvA].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Certain patient characteristics **increase opioid-related respiratory risk**:

- **Advanced age**: Elderly patients have higher risk due to altered pharmacokinetics and clearance [^112hSTpX] [^115iBS4w].

- **Comorbidities**: COPD, cor pulmonale, and reduced respiratory reserve heighten risk [^112hSTpX] [^111e4xsQ] [^1173s2RU].

- **Concurrent medications**: Benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants markedly increase risk [^111bUL2V] [^111evtqq].

- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: OSA and CSA amplify opioid-induced respiratory depression [^111bUL2V] [^115iBS4w].

---

## Dose-dependent risks

Opioid respiratory depression is **dose-related**: Higher doses increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypercapnia, and mortality [^112hSTpX] [^111bUL2V], and risk is highest during **initiation and titration**, when doses are being escalated [^115HieJ1] [^113hDDzJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize cautious opioid use in hypercapnic respiratory failure: use the **lowest effective dose** and avoid high-dose regimens [^112hSTpX] [^115qp44n], with close monitoring of respiratory status, ABGs, and sedation [^115iBS4w] [^114BjYpt]. Limit concomitant benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants [^111bUL2V] [^111evtqq]. Educate patients to recognize respiratory depression and seek emergency care when needed [^111FZt5x] [^111e4xsQ].

---

## Alternative analgesic and palliative strategies

Non-opioid options should be prioritized, including **acetaminophen and NSAIDs** when appropriate [^112hSTpX] [^111e4xsQ]. Non-pharmacological interventions — such as pulmonary rehabilitation, breathing retraining, and psychological support — should be incorporated [^116fxFmx]. If opioids are necessary, titrate cautiously with close monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Effective monitoring and management include **continuous capnography and oximetry** to detect early respiratory depression [^115iBS4w] [^114BjYpt] [^112ukhmG]. Regular ABG analysis should track CO2 retention and acid-base status; prompt intervention with naloxone and supportive measures is indicated for respiratory depression [^115HieJ1] [^112hSTpX] [^111e4xsQ].

---

Opioids in chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia **pose substantial risks** of respiratory depression, worsening hypercapnia, and increased mortality. Use the **lowest effective dose**, monitor closely, and prefer non-opioid strategies; reserve opioids for refractory symptoms with careful titration and vigilant monitoring.

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^112ukhmG]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Opioid-related adverse events are a serious problem in hospitalized patients. Little is known about patients who are likely to experience opioid-induced respiratory depression events on the general care floor and may benefit from improved monitoring and early intervention. The trial objective was to derive and validate a risk prediction tool for respiratory depression in patients receiving opioids, as detected by continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring.

- **Methods**: Prediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) was a prospective, observational trial of blinded continuous capnography and oximetry conducted at 16 sites across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Vital signs were intermittently monitored per standard care. A total of 1,335 patients receiving parenteral opioids and continuously monitored on the general care floor were included in the analysis. A respiratory depression episode was defined as respiratory rate ≤ 5 breaths/min (bpm), oxygen saturation ≤ 85%, or end-tidal carbon dioxide ≤ 15 or ≥ 60 mm Hg for ≥ 3 minutes; an apnea episode lasting > 30 seconds; or any respiratory opioid-related adverse event. A risk prediction tool was derived using a multivariable logistic regression model of 46 a priori defined risk factors with stepwise selection and was internally validated by bootstrapping.

- **Results**: One or more respiratory depression episodes were detected in 614 (46%) of the 1,335 general care floor patients (43% male; mean age, 58 ± 14 years) who were continuously monitored for a median of 24 hours.

### Fentora [^112hSTpX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Life-threatening respiratory depression in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients**: The use of Fentora in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, or those with substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive, including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Fentora. Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients are more likely to experience life-threatening respiratory depression due to altered pharmacokinetics or clearance compared to younger, healthier individuals. Regular evaluation is recommended, particularly when initiating and titrating Fentora, or when Fentora is used alongside other respiration-depressing drugs. Alternatively, the use of non-opioid analgesics should be considered.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, occurring more frequently after more than one month of use. The presentation may include non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, and weakness.

### Mitigo [^111bUL2V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent manner. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid tapering [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants**: Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from concomitant use of Mitigo® with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g. non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. The use of neuroleptics in conjunction with neuraxial morphine may increase the risk of respiratory depression.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to the use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect a similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^111e4xsQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Use of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

- **Patients with chronic pulmonary disease**: Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive, including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets.

- **Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients**: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets and when these tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following great.

### Case reports in respiratory care [^111zY2wp]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The information in a case report should be viewed cautiously in terms of generalization beyond the reported example. Appropriately written and interpreted, however, a case report can be a valuable contribution to medical knowledge and educational for both author and reader. This article discusses the essential components of a case report, important issues of patient confidentiality, and how authorship should be determined.

- **Common pitfalls in case report writing**: These include inexperience, insufficient documentation of the case, insufficient awareness of practice beyond one's own clinical setting, describing substandard care, illogical or unphysiologic intervention, poor focus of presentation and discussion, inappropriate manuscript format, poor writing, ineffective illustrations, and poor use of references.

- **Ways to avoid pitfalls**: The article then presents 10 specific ways to avoid or deal with these pitfalls, with the aim of increasing the likelihood that a prospective author's manuscript will be accepted for publication. These include seeking appropriate assistance with writing, documenting the case as thoroughly as possible, and carefully justifying any new technique or intervention. Authors are urged to expend the time and effort required to prepare the manuscript properly, using the journal's guidelines and paying special attention to illustrations and references. They should also have the manuscript read by a local colleague before formal submission. After submission, authors should view the receipt of reviewers' comments and subsequent manuscript revision as necessary.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^1146ntT5]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypercapnic respiratory failure, more specifically for patients with restrictive lung disease, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend providing a trial of noninvasive ventilation as a first-line strategy in almost all patients with hypercapnia and chest wall or neuromuscular disease who are acutely unwell.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1177pCxt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The methodologists extracted data and imported them into RevMan version 5.3 software (Cochrane) for meta-analysis. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to conduct all meta-analyses; study weights were generated using the inverse-variance method. We present results of all analyses using relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) independently and in duplicate for each outcome of individual studies using the Cochrane RoB tool that classifies RoB as "low", "high", or "unclear" for each of the following domains: sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. We rated the overall RoB as the highest risk attributed to any criterion.

With input from the panel chairs, the methodologists developed an evidence profile for each PICO. Following GRADE principles, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was judged to be "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low". In accordance with GRADE, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was originally set as high if it originated from RCTs and low if it originated from observational data. We subsequently downgraded the quality of the evidence by one or two degrees if results from individual studies had a serious or very serious RoB, there were serious inconsistencies in the results across studies, the evidence was indirect, the data were imprecise, or publication bias was believed.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^113nUBGc]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

The evidence generated indicates that there is a cohort of patients with severe COPD who seem to tolerate regular lower-dose opioids in a way that is likely to deliver a net symptomatic benefit. The level of follow-up and healthcare provided to patients might influence the outcomes, and our findings should be interpreted in the context of levels of clinical contact.

For clinicians, this study further supports the safety of regular low-dose systemic opioids to reduce breathlessness in severely ill patients with respiratory compromise and hypercapnia — patients who have an immense need for relief of symptoms. The need for higher opioid doses for symptomatic control should be balanced against the possible increased risk of adverse events. Our study supports the suggestion that benzodiazepines should not be the first-line treatment for breathlessness in those with respiratory failure, given the unclear evidence of net clinical benefit. Benzodiazepines and opioids can be safely combined in lower doses.

All treatments assume adequate follow-up of the patient's clinical condition and symptoms, including proper prophylaxis and treatment for expected effects such as opioid-related constipation. The approach for chronic breathlessness is no different from that of opioid treatment for pain. Sustained-release morphine should be considered as a first-line treatment and should be initiated at a low dose regularly and titrated upward over days and weeks, balancing beneficial and adverse effects. Titration up to 30 mg of morphine daily might safely improve…

### Sleep-disordered breathing associated with long-term opioid therapy [^1141JtvA]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Three patients are described who illustrate distinctive patterns of sleep-disordered breathing observed in patients receiving long-term, sustained-release opioid medications. Polysomnography shows respiratory disturbances occurring predominantly during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. They are characterized by ataxic breathing, central apneas, sustained hypoxemia, and unusually prolonged obstructive "hypopneas" secondary to delayed arousal responses. In contrast to what is usually observed in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), oxygen desaturation is more severe and respiratory disturbances are longer during NREM sleep compared to rapid eye movement sleep. Further studies are needed regarding the effects of opioids on respiration during sleep, as well as the importance of interaction with other medications and associated risk factors for OSA.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^112SwGFC]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Breathlessness is a major cause of impaired activity and quality of life, affecting as many as a fifth of people aged over 65. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of breathlessness, morbidity, and mortality. Worldwide, more than 300 million people have COPD, many of whom have breathlessness that affects their daily life for many years. Breathlessness predicts mortality in COPD to a stronger degree than impairment of lung function. The burden of breathlessness increases with increasing age and severity of the respiratory disease; 98% of patients with end-stage respiratory disease experience breathlessness, which persists at rest or on minimal exertion, despite optimal treatment of the underlying disease (chronic refractory breathlessness). Patients with severe COPD are more breathless than patients with advanced lung cancer and are breathless for longer periods of time.

Randomised trials have shown that oral sustained-release morphine can relieve chronic refractory breathlessness. Whether benzodiazepines reduce breathlessness is not clear, and their safety in this setting is unknown. Benzodiazepines are also used to treat anxiety and opioids to treat pain, conditions that are highly prevalent in patients with severe COPD.

A concern among clinicians is that benzodiazepines and opioids alone or in combination could cause adverse events, including respiratory depression, confusion, falls, and even premature death in patients with respiratory compromise. Risks might be higher in frail patients, especially if they have not previously been treated.

### Timing of noninvasive ventilation failure: Causes, risk factors, and potential remedies [^11778xMu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The utilization of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) has emerged as one of the most significant advancements in the field of mechanical ventilation over the past two decades. The use of NIV during acute respiratory failure (ARF) has increased since the late 1990s for all diagnoses, including patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), regardless of the supporting evidence for the latter.

NIV failure is defined as the need for endotracheal intubation (ETI) or death. Its rate varies significantly between 5 and 60%, depending on various factors, including the cause of ARF. Unsuccessful NIV has been found to be independently associated with death, particularly in patients with de novo ARF. This may suggest the necessity for caution regarding the application of NIV and for close monitoring to ensure a prompt switch to ETI when needed.

Several investigators have attempted to assess the best predictors of NIV failure. To the best of our knowledge, despite the extensive literature in the NIV field, there is only one paper, published 10 years ago, summarizing the evidence for risk factors of NIV failure, with no studies examining the timing of the failure. Based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three temporal moments were identified: 1) immediate failure (within minutes to < 1 hour), 2) early failure (1 to 48 hours), and 3) late failure (after 48 hours). The purpose of this narrative review is to illustrate the main patient-related predictors or risk factors of immediate, early, and late failure. We also discuss possible…

### What's old is new again: Opioid and benzodiazepine actions on ventilation, a reminder of the importance of knowing one's drugs [^111evtqq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Co-administering opioids and benzodiazepines can have deleterious effects on ventilation. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms leading to hypoventilation. A recent article in the British Journal of Anaesthesia is not just another reminder of the hazards of combining opioids with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, but also applies mechanistic understanding to guide informed practice and future pharmaceutical development.

### Fentanyl citrate [^115HHaeE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Life-threatening respiratory depression is a significant risk associated with the use of opioids, including fentanyl citrate, even when used as recommended. If respiratory depression is not promptly recognized and treated, it can lead to respiratory arrest and potentially result in death. It is critical to have adequate facilities for postoperative monitoring and ventilation of patients who have been administered anesthetic doses of fentanyl citrate injection. These facilities must be fully equipped to manage all levels of respiratory depression. The management strategies may include close observation, supportive measures, and the use of opioid antagonists, depending on the clinical status of the patient [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in carbon dioxide (CO₂) retention, which can further enhance the sedating effects of opioids.

Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl citrate injection are essential to reduce the risk of respiratory depression. Like other potent opioids, the respiratory depressant effect of fentanyl citrate injection may last longer than its analgesic effect. The total dose of all administered opioid agonists should be considered by practitioners before prescribing opioid analgesics during recovery from anesthesia.

Certain forms of conduction anesthesia, such as spinal anesthesia and some peridural anesthetics, can alter respiration by blocking intercostal nerves. Fentanyl citrate injection may also alter respiration through other mechanisms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Therefore, when fentanyl citrate injection is administered, it is important to carefully monitor the patient's respiratory function.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: A population-based case-control study [^114dY6SB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Self-reported use of opioid medications contributed significantly, with a population attributable fraction (PAF) comparable to that of COPD. In recent decades, Australia and other high-income countries have documented a marked increase in the use of prescription opioids. The clinical indication for most opioid prescriptions is acute pain, but chronic non-cancer pain is associated with continued opioid use.

Opioids directly suppress respiration but can also contribute to ventilatory failure indirectly via mediators of sleep-related hypoventilation, obstructive and central sleep apnea. Among adults with COPD, incident opioid prescriptions are associated with increased risk of adverse respiratory outcomes and death. However, safety data among patients with chronic respiratory disease are inconsistent, particularly when considering those who receive opioids for refractory breathlessness. Few previous studies have included drugs as a potential cause for hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF), generally excluding such patients. We found opioid use to be associated with at least a three-fold increase in the risk of HRF and hence may be an important modifiable risk factor in similar populations. Our results emphasize the need to rationalize opioid use to clinical situations where potential harms are outweighed by the benefits of these medicines.

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^115iBS4w]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

- **Key points**:

- **Question**: Can we use continuous capnography and oximetry monitoring data to derive a risk prediction tool to predict the risk of respiratory depression episodes in patients receiving parenteral opioid therapy on surgical and medical general care floors?
- **Findings**: The Prediction of Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression in patients monitored by Capnography (PRODIGY) trial found a 46% incidence of respiratory depression and developed a novel respiratory depression risk prediction tool. This tool includes five easy-to-assess variables: age ≥ 60 years by decade, sex, opioid naivety, sleep disorders, and chronic heart failure.
- **Meaning**: This risk prediction tool, based on continuous, blinded oximetry and capnography data, accurately predicts respiratory depression in patients receiving parenteral opioids on the general care floor.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^117HxyLH]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

This study extends previous observations in several important ways. By estimating adverse drug effects in a relevant high-risk population in clinical practice, it supports that lower dose opioids are not associated with an increased risk of admission to hospital or death. They might be safe for symptomatic treatment, even in patients with severe and end-stage COPD. It also suggests that benzodiazepines and higher dose opioids are associated with modestly increased risks of mortality, especially when used concurrently. The possibility of true causal effects, however, needs to be validated by prospective observational and randomized trials.

- **Strengths and limitations of the study**: A major strength of the present study is its inclusion of a large population-based consecutive cohort of old severely ill patients with respiratory failure caused by COPD, many of whom had hypercapnia. Sweden has an integrated publicly financed health system that provides care independently of the patient's health insurance and financial status. No patient was lost to follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for major confounders, including comorbidity and concomitant drug treatment, and the findings probably have excellent applicability to clinical practice in similar settings around the world.

	- One limitation is that we cannot rule out residual confounding from unmeasured covariates and from the indications for benzodiazepines and opioids because of the absence of randomization. This bias, however, would tend to overestimate the risk of adverse events.

### Perioperative opioid use in total shoulder arthroplasty is associated with dose-dependent risk of major surgical and medical complications [^114WkzeX]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Higher perioperative opioid use has been associated with an increase in periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), thromboembolic complications, respiratory events, gastrointestinal complications, cost, and length of stay following hip and knee arthroplasty. Limited data exist regarding the relationship between the postoperative opioid dose and complication rates following primary total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between perioperative opioid consumption and postoperative complications following TSA.

- **Methods**: The Premier Healthcare Database was queried to identify patients who underwent primary anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty from 2016–2020. Perioperative opioid consumption was totaled utilizing morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) to stratify patients based on quintiles of consumption. Primary outcomes included total opioid consumption, 90-day postoperative complications, revision, and readmission.

- **Results**: One hundred forty thousand two hundred fifty-one patients undergoing primary TSA were identified and stratified based on total opioid consumption into quintiles. Patients with increased MME exposure were significantly younger, more often female, and Black (P < .0001 for all). On multivariate analysis, increased MME exposure was associated with increased risk of multiple surgical complications, including superficial wound infection, PJI, periprosthetic fractures, seroma, loosening, unspecified mechanical complications, and 90-day readmission.

### Pentazocine and naloxone [^113hDDzJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression. The risk is greatest when starting Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets or when the dosage is increased, and it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression].

Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see WARNINGS].

- **Interactions with benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants**: Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

- **Patient access to naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose**: Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines, such as by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as per other allowed methods.

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^114RxMN5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Opioid-related adverse events are a serious problem in hospitalized patients. Little is known about patients who are likely to experience opioid-induced respiratory depression events on the general care floor and may benefit from improved monitoring and early intervention. The trial's objective was to derive and validate a risk prediction tool for respiratory depression in patients receiving opioids, as detected by continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring.

- **Methods**: Prediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) was a prospective, observational trial of blinded continuous capnography and oximetry conducted at 16 sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Vital signs were intermittently monitored per standard of care. A total of 1,335 patients receiving parenteral opioids and continuously monitored on the general care floor were included in the analysis. A respiratory depression episode was defined as a respiratory rate of ≤ 5 breaths per minute (bpm), oxygen saturation of ≤ 85%, or end-tidal carbon dioxide level of ≤ 15 or ≥ 60 mm Hg for ≥ 3 minutes; an apnea episode lasting > 30 seconds; or any respiratory opioid-related adverse event. A risk prediction tool was derived using a multivariable logistic regression model of 46 a priori defined risk factors with stepwise selection and was internally validated by bootstrapping.

- **Results**: One or more respiratory depression episodes were detected in 614 (46%) of 1,335 general care floor patients (43% male; mean age, 58 ± 14 years) continuously monitored for a median of 24 hours.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^117S9eRz]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for hypercapnic respiratory failure, specifically concerning invasive ventilation strategy, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend considering permissive hypercapnia. This involves aiming for a pH of 7.2–7.25 to avoid high airway pressures when airflow obstruction is severe.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^111uLBaV]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). High credibility.

NIV is the preferred initial method of mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure during COPD exacerbations. NIV improves hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and work of breathing as discussed previously, and it reduces the need for intubation, mortality, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay, while also being associated with lower rates of nosocomial pneumonia.

- **Indications, contraindications, and potential complications**: These aspects of NIV are outlined in Figure 2.

Initial settings depend on patient characteristics; however, basic principles include titrating PEEP to improve work of breathing while not worsening hyperinflation and setting pressure support to target a tidal volume (Vₜ) of approximately 6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight. Patients should be monitored regularly, particularly early in the course, using physical examinations and blood gas assessments to guide settings.

For patients with persistent hypercapnia despite the initial application of NIV, the pressure support can be uptitrated to increase V T and minute ventilation. Sedative or analgesic medications, such as opioids or benzodiazepines, are commonly used to manage discomfort or anxiety associated with NIV. Dexmedetomidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, is an attractive sedative agent in this setting given its lack of respiratory depression and potential to reduce the risk of intubation and ICU length of stay. However, data on the safety of sedative and analgesic medications during NIV are mixed, with a particular risk of harm when combining agents from different medication classes.

### Intermittent noninvasive ventilation after extubation in patients with chronic respiratory disorders: a multicenter randomized controlled trial (VHYPER) [^114KdQbU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Early noninvasive ventilation (NIV) after extubation decreases the risk of respiratory failure and lowers 90-day mortality in patients with hypercapnia. Patients with chronic respiratory disease are at risk of extubation failure; therefore, it could be useful to determine the role of NIV with a discontinuous approach, not limited to patients with hypercapnia. We assessed the efficacy of early NIV in decreasing respiratory failure after extubation in patients with chronic respiratory disorders.

A prospective randomized controlled multicenter study was conducted. We enrolled 144 mechanically ventilated patients with chronic respiratory disorders who tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial. Patients were randomly allocated after extubation to receive either NIV (NIV group, n = 72), performed with a discontinuous approach for the first 48 hours, or conventional oxygen treatment (usual care group, n = 72). The primary endpoint was decreased respiratory failure within 48 hours after extubation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01047852).

Respiratory failure after extubation was less frequent in the NIV group: 6 (8.5%) versus 20 (27.8%); p = 0.0016. Six patients (8.5%) in the NIV group versus 13 (18.1%) in the usual care group were reintubated (p = 0.09). Intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 90-day mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.28 and p = 0.33, respectively). Median post-randomization ICU length of stay was lower in the usual care group: 3 days (IQR 2–6) versus 4.

### Opioids for breathlessness: a narrative review [^116fxFmx]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic breathlessness is a disabling and distressing condition for which there is a growing evidence base for a range of interventions. Non-pharmacological interventions are the mainstay of management and should be optimized prior to the use of opioid medication. Opioids are being implemented variably in practice for chronic breathlessness. This narrative review summarizes the evidence defining opioids for breathlessness best practice and identifies remaining research gaps.

There is level 1a evidence to support the use of opioids for breathlessness. The best evidence is for 10–30 mg daily de novo low-dose oral sustained-release morphine in opioid-naïve patients. This should be considered the standard of care following independent, regulatory scrutiny by one of the world's therapeutic regulatory bodies. Optimal benefits are seen in steady state; however, there are few published data about longer-term benefits or harms. Morphine-related adverse events are common but mostly mild and self-limiting on withdrawal of the drug. Early and meticulous management of constipation, nausea, and vomiting is needed, particularly in the first week of administration.

Serious adverse events are no more common than placebo in clinical studies. Observational studies in severe chronic lung disease do not show excess mortality or hospital admission in those taking opioids. We have no long-term data on immune or endocrine function. There are promising data regarding prophylaxis for exertion-related breathlessness, but given the risks associated with transmucosal fentanyl, caution is needed.

### Identifying risk factors and developing a nomogram for high flow nasal cannula failure in patients with hypercapnic acute respiratory failure [^11212mE1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Currently, there is a deficiency in nomograms specifically designed for predicting the failure of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy in patients with hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (hypercapnic ARF). The aim of this retrospective study is to develop and evaluate a nomogram that assesses the risk of HFNC failure in this patient population.

- **Methods**: Patients with ARF and hypercapnia (PaCO₂ ≥ 45 mmHg in the initial arterial blood gas), who received HFNC in the intensive care unit (ICU) from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2023, were enrolled in this study. Risk factors were identified through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. A novel nomogram model was subsequently developed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The model's predictive performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).

- **Results**: A total of 189 patients were included in the analysis, comprising 128 patients in the HFNC success group and 61 in the HFNC failure group. Multivariate logistic regression identified blood urea nitrogen, calcium, sepsis, and the respiratory rate oxygenation index (ROX) after 4 hours of oxygen therapy as independent prognostic factors for HFNC failure. The nomogram exhibited superior performance compared to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (P = 0.011) and the 4-hour ROX index (P = 0.001). Additionally, the calibration curve demonstrated satisfactory predictive accuracy, while DCA highlighted the clinical utility of the nomogram.

### Incidence of postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression episodes in patients on room air or supplemental oxygen: a post-hoc analysis of the PRODIGY trial [^114BjYpt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

An OIRD episode was pre-defined as follows: respiratory rate ≤ 5 breaths/min (bpm), oxygen saturation ≤ 85%, or end-tidal carbon dioxide ≤ 15 or ≥ 60 mm Hg for ≥ 3 min; apnea episode lasting > 30 seconds; or any respiratory opioid-related adverse event. Potential OIRD episodes were identified by monitor algorithms and independently assessed by a panel of capnography experts, blinded to patient medical history, including their supplemental oxygen (SO) use, to categorize patients as having either ≥ 1 OIRD episode or none. Patients with > 1 potential OIRD episode underwent OIRD adjudication only until the first OIRD episode was confirmed. This adjudicated data was then used to develop the PRODIGY risk prediction tool, which assesses five patient characteristics (age > 60 in decades, male sex, sleep-disordered breathing, opioid naivety, and chronic heart failure) to determine whether a patient has low, intermediate, or high risk for OIRD.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to determine whether patients on room air (RA) experience more OIRD episodes compared with when receiving intermittent or continuous SO. Secondary objectives were to assess the type of OIRD episodes occurring in patients receiving intermittent or continuous SO or on RA, evaluate the association between OIRD episodes during intermittent or continuous SO or on RA as a function of the PRODIGY score, and finally, examine the frequency of OIRD episodes as a function of the time after the end of surgery.

- **OIRD episode assessment**: This analysis included data from surgical patients enrolled at two United States hospitals.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112Asmmg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

After the generation of recommendations, the panel divided into working groups for manuscript preparation. For each PICO question, we summarized the recommendation, provided a narrative summary of the evidence (highlighting the largest and most relevant clinical trials for each PICO question), discussed issues raised as part of the EtD framework, and provided a justification for the final recommendation considering the above, together with implementation considerations and future research directions. Each PICO summary was reviewed by the individual working group and then synthesized by the chairs and methodologists.

Editing and feedback on the manuscript were conducted electronically and coordinated by the panel chairs. The final wording of all recommendations and justifications was agreed upon by the entire panel and submitted to ATS for review and approval. The guideline underwent anonymous peer review by content experts and a methodologist. After multiple cycles of review and revision, the guideline was reviewed and approved by a multidisciplinary board of directors.

### Endotracheal intubation after acute drug overdoses: Incidence, complications, and risk factors [^116Edq2T]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related fatalities in the United States, and respiratory failure remains a major source of morbidity and mortality.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for endotracheal intubation after acute drug overdose.

- **Methods**: This secondary data analysis was performed on a 5-year prospective cohort at two urban tertiary-care hospitals. The present study analyzed adult patients with suspected acute drug overdose to derive independent clinical predictors of endotracheal intubation.

- **Results**: We analyzed 2,497 patients with acute drug overdose, of whom 87 (3.5%) underwent endotracheal intubation. Independent clinical risk factors for endotracheal intubation were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–0.98) and history of obstructive lung disease (OR 6.6, 95% CI 3.5–12.3), although heart failure had no association. Patients with obstructive lung disease had significantly more hypercapnia (mean difference 6.8 mm Hg, 95% CI 2.3–11.3) and a higher degree of acidemia (mean pH difference 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.07) than patients without obstructive lung disease. Lack of rapid sequence sedative/paralytic was associated with in-hospital fatality. Early complications of endotracheal intubation itself included desaturation (3.4%) and bradycardia (1%).

- **Conclusions**: Endotracheal intubation was infrequently performed on patients with acute drug overdose, and complications were rare when performed. Risk factors associated with endotracheal intubation included younger age and prior obstructive lung disease.

### Association between race and opioid-induced respiratory depression: An international post hoc analysis of the prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression in patients monitored by capnography trial [^1157nMzy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). High credibility.

Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is common on medical and surgical wards and is associated with increased morbidity and health care costs. While previous studies have investigated risk factors for OIRD, the role of race remains unclear. We aim to investigate the association between race and OIRD occurrence on medical and surgical wards.

- **Methods**: This is a post hoc analysis of the PRediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) trial, a prospective multinational observational blinded study of 1,335 general ward patients who received parenteral opioids and underwent blinded capnography and oximetry monitoring to identify OIRD episodes. For this study, demographic and perioperative data, including race and comorbidities, were analyzed and assessed for potential associations with OIRD. Univariable χ² and Mann-Whitney U tests were used. Stepwise selection of all baseline and demographic characteristics was employed in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 1,253 patients had sufficient racial data (317 Asian, 158 Black, 736 White, and 42 other races) for inclusion. The incidence of OIRD was 60% in Asians (N = 190/317), 25% in Blacks (N = 40/158), 43% in Whites (N = 316/736), and 45% (N = 19/42) in other races. Baseline characteristics varied significantly: Asians were older, more opioid naïve, and had higher opioid requirements, while Blacks had higher incidences of heart failure, obesity, and smoking. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression revealed that Asians had increased…

### Duramorph [^115HieJ1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Life-threatening respiratory depression

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Duramorph, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. This respiratory depression and/or respiratory arrest may be severe and could require intervention.

Because of the delay in maximum CNS effect with intravenously administered drugs (30 min), rapid administration may result in overdosing. Single-dose neuraxial administration may result in acute or delayed respiratory depression for periods at least as long as 24 hours. Severe respiratory depression up to 24 hours following epidural or intrathecal administration has been reported. Intrathecal use has been associated with a higher incidence of respiratory depression than epidural use. Thoracic administration has been shown to dramatically increase the incidence of early and late respiratory depression, even at doses of 1 to 2 mg.

Because of the risk of severe adverse effects when the epidural or intrathecal administration is employed, caution is advised.

- **Warning**: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, immune-mediated reactions, and risk of acute cardiorespiratory failure. See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis**: Anaphylaxis has occurred during the early course of enzyme replacement therapy and after an extended duration of therapy. Initiate Lumizyme in a healthcare setting with appropriate medical monitoring and support measures, including access to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) occurs, discontinue Lumizyme and immediately initiate appropriate medical treatment, including the use of epinephrine.

- **Immune-mediated reactions**: Immune-mediated reactions presenting as proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and necrotizing skin lesions have occurred in some patients following Lumizyme treatment. Monitor patients for the development of systemic immune-mediated reactions involving the skin and other organs while receiving Lumizyme.

- **Risk of acute cardiorespiratory failure**: Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) patients with compromised cardiac or respiratory function may be at risk of serious acute exacerbation of their cardiac or respiratory compromise due to fluid overload and require additional monitoring.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis**: Patients treated with enzyme replacement therapies have experienced life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^116TdAty]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Drug effects on the rates of admission to hospital were expressed as subdistribution hazard ratios and estimated by using Fine-Gray regression, which accounts for the competing risk of death. For the analysis of admissions, the time under observation was from the first day of long-term oxygen therapy in the community until the date of first admission to hospital for all causes, with censoring at withdrawal of long-term oxygen therapy, death, or study end (31 December 2009). The final admission model was adjusted for WHO performance status, number of previous admissions, number of cardiovascular diagnoses, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and treatment with oral glucocorticoids.

Associations with mortality were expressed as hazard ratios and estimated with Cox regression. For mortality, the observation time was from the start date of long-term oxygen therapy until the date of death from all causes, with censoring at withdrawal of long-term oxygen therapy or 31 December 2009. The final mortality model was adjusted for age, sex, PaO2 air, PaCO2 air, WHO performance status, BMI, anaemia, number of cardiovascular diagnoses, renal failure, and oral glucocorticoids.

Sleeping pills did not predict admission to hospital or mortality or affect the estimates for benzodiazepines and opioids. Findings were similar when we excluded patients taking sleeping pills.

- **Interaction terms**: We evaluated interactions by including interaction terms in the fully adjusted models, between the effect of benzodiazepines and opioids and concurrent treatment with both drugs, and the presence of hypercapnia (PaCO2 air > 6.5).

### Timing of noninvasive ventilation failure: causes, risk factors, and potential remedies [^1147CSyS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Risk factors and predictors of NIV failure are numerous. They differ between hypercapnic and hypoxemic patients and according to the timing of the failure. Every physician dealing with NIV should be aware of these risk factors and closely monitor each patient for their presence or development to achieve a good response and improve prognosis. If a patient fails to improve sufficiently, prompt ETI should be performed without delay because there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality with ETI after failed NIV. A satisfactory initial NIV attempt is not always a marker of a good outcome, as late NIV failure may occur in up to 15% of patients in whom the initial NIV attempt was satisfactory.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^113Wnbky]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

In this national prospective study, treatment with lower dose opioids was not associated with an increased risk of admission to hospital or death in patients with COPD who were dependent on oxygen, regardless of whether the patient was naive to opioids, concurrently used benzodiazepines, or had hypercapnia. Treatment with benzodiazepines also did not affect the rate of admission but was associated with a modest increase in mortality. Though this association cannot be interpreted as cause and effect, the association remained after we adjusted for known or plausible confounders.

### Dsuvia [^115n8wsh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and the use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Dsuvia, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression while on treatment with Dsuvia. Accidental exposure to or ingestion of even one dose of Dsuvia, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of sufentanil.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider minimizing the use of Dsuvia and carefully monitor the patient for signs of respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^1166riHy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

The general care floor is a low-acuity inpatient environment. However, nearly half of all in-hospital cardiorespiratory events occur on the general care floor, often with catastrophic outcomes. A national registry identified 44,551 acute respiratory events in US hospitals, with an associated in-hospital mortality of nearly 40%. Early recognition of respiratory compromise through continuous respiratory monitoring on the general care floor has been advocated to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is one cause of respiratory compromise on the general care floor, in part, because opioid administration remains common practice. OIRD is traditionally defined using surrogate measures, such as hypoventilation with or without oxygen desaturation, and is often a diagnosis of exclusion. Its reported incidence between 0.3% and 21% is likely an underestimation of the true incidence. Opioid-related adverse events, including OIRD, are associated with increased length of stay (mean 5 additional days), readmission (15.8% vs 9.4% in patients without events), and cost (mean increase $10,000). The earliest warning of respiratory failure due to OIRD may be subtle changes in vital signs 6–8 hours before critical cardiac and respiratory decompensation ensues. General care floor monitoring often misses these early patterns or infers incorrect patterns, which are key to preventing catastrophic events. One investigation revealed that intermittent "spot check" monitoring every 4–6 hours missed > 90% of episodes of prolonged hypoxemia on the general care floor.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: A population-based case-control study [^1173s2RU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) associated with each cause is shown in research data. Chronic congestive heart failure (CCF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory muscle weakness, and opioid use were strongly associated with the presence of HRF. The AUC values for FEV1/FVC, NT-proBNP, AHI, and SNIP max as continuous variables were 0.81, 0.74, 0.50, and 0.67, respectively. At the pre-specified cutoff, CCF had the strongest association (OR 13.4, 95% CI 1.40–128). Post-hoc analysis showed that when a lower NT-proBNP cutoff value of 35 pmol/L (296 pg/mL) was used to determine the presence of CCF, the magnitude of association was attenuated but remained statistically significant with an OR of 4.25 (95% CI 1.16–15.6).

- **Population attributable fraction (PAF)**: The PAF was determined separately for each cause, thus adding to more than 100%. The PAF was not determined when there was no significant relationship between the specified cause and hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) did not appear to be associated with an increased risk of HRF, with more controls having this condition compared with cases. There was no difference between groups based on mean AHI, using a 4% desaturation threshold.

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for lowering the risk of mechanical ventilation: Research questions and clinical potential for the future [^1113zEc4]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). High credibility.

As a result of technical improvements, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO₂R) now has the potential to play an important role in the management of adults with acute respiratory failure. There is growing interest in the use of ECCO₂R for the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. However, evidence to support its use is scarce, and several questions remain about the best way to implement this therapy, which can be associated with serious side effects.

This review reflects the consensus opinion of an international group of clinician scientists with expertise in managing acute respiratory failure and in using ECCO₂R therapies in this setting. We concisely review clinically relevant aspects of ECCO₂R and provide a series of recommendations for clinical practice and future research. **Practicalities of ECCO₂R delivery**: This includes indications for use and service delivery.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is commonly used to treat patients admitted to hospitals with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialized Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and PsycINFO, and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. This update to the original review incorporates the results of database searches up to January 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH of 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^112WUWhf]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

In specific circumstances for hypercapnic respiratory failure, particularly concerning patients with neuromuscular disease, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend involving senior staff in decision-making. This is especially important for patients with chest wall or neuromuscular disease, in conjunction with home mechanical ventilation specialists, if experience is limited, and particularly when the appropriateness of invasive mechanical ventilation is in question.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^1121x4Kx]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypercapnic respiratory failure, specifically in the context of post-extubation care, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend the consideration of prophylactic use of noninvasive ventilation. This approach provides post-extubation support for patients who have been identified with risk factors for extubation failure.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: a population-based case-control study [^1113Kqwv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In this population-based case-control study, we show that hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) is a multifactorial condition with no single disease responsible for the majority of cases. In addition to chronic health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive cardiac failure (CCF), opioid use and respiratory muscle weakness are significantly associated with HRF hospitalizations. Interventions to reduce the prevalence of these causes have the potential to substantially reduce HRF-associated hospitalizations in this and other comparable populations.

Of the hypothesized causes, COPD had the highest population attributable fraction. Most previous surveys have shown COPD to be the dominant cause of hospitalization with HRF, and COPD is also an important indication for treatment with home non-invasive ventilation therapy. A prevalence study of hypercapnic COPD exacerbations has been used to approximate the requirements for hospital non-invasive ventilation services. However, a considerable proportion of our cases did not have objective evidence of airflow obstruction, nor a history of chronic airways disease. Furthermore, we suspect the proportion of cases with COPD to be overrepresented in our study, as we have previously demonstrated that among cases of HRF, the presence of chronic airways disease is associated with a lower risk of death. Hence, whilst COPD is an important contributor to HRF, it is not the only cause, and clinician judgment is required when assessing undifferentiated patients to identify alternative diagnoses.

In this population, CCF was an important contributor to hospitalizations with HRF.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^111J3bkY]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically concerning the management of acute exacerbations involving invasive ventilation, BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the management of potential future episodes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with patients following an episode that required ventilatory support, due to the high risk of recurrence.

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^111wPiqv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

The PRODIGY trial's design is noteworthy for its inclusion of blinded, continuously monitored oximetry and capnography data and the independent clinical event committee adjudication of respiratory depression episodes, enabling the observation of the true burden of respiratory depression. The trial encompassed both surgical and medical patients transferred to various general care floors across Europe, the United States, and Asia, enhancing the generalizability of the findings. While the potential survival benefit of universal continuous monitoring for general care floor patients remains uncertain, our data indicates that screening using the user-friendly PRODIGY score, alongside continuous monitoring for patients at high risk of respiratory depression, could prevent individual patient harm.

For instance, a 72-year-old male with chronic heart failure who is opioid naive faces a > 2-fold risk of respiratory depression (PRODIGY score = 30; high risk) compared to a 67-year-old female with diabetes and chronic kidney disease who has previously received opioids (PRODIGY score = 8; intermediate risk) after undergoing a similar surgical procedure, when both receive opioids on the general care floor. It is likely that this high-risk patient would benefit from continuous capnography and oximetry monitoring, in addition to the careful administration of opioids.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^116dqaez]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypercapnic respiratory failure, particularly in patients with restrictive lung disease, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend considering noninvasive ventilation for patients with chest wall or neuromuscular disease when vital capacity is at 20, even if the patient is normocapnic.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^111hePup]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hypercapnic respiratory failure, more specifically with respect to extracorporeal CO₂ removal, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend considering extracorporeal CO₂ removal when 'lung protective ventilation' is needed, but hypercapnia is contraindicated, such as in patients with coexistent brain injury.

### The evidence base for oxygen for chronic refractory breathlessness: Issues, gaps, and a future work plan [^1174pfC4]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Breathlessness, or "shortness of breath", medically termed dyspnea, is a common and distressing symptom that features prominently in advanced lung, cardiac, and neuromuscular diseases. Its prevalence and intensity increase as death approaches. Despite the advancing understanding of the genesis of breathlessness and a growing portfolio of treatment options, breathlessness remains challenging to manage. It engenders feelings of helplessness in caregivers and healthcare professionals and fear in patients.

While hypoxemia does not appear to be the dominant driver for breathlessness in advanced disease, the belief that oxygen is critical for the relief of acute, chronic, and acute-on-chronic shortness of breath is firmly embedded in the minds of patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. This article presents an understanding of the use of oxygen for treating refractory breathlessness in advanced disease. The objective is to highlight what is still unknown, set a research agenda to resolve these questions, and address methodological issues for consideration in planned studies.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111uZTNY]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

From an economic and societal perspective, chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD carry a poor prognosis. In a query of electronic medical records among 491 patients with compensated hypercapnia of various causes, including 170 (35%) with COPD, each 5 mm Hg increase in PaCO2 was associated with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.16).

Over the course of a year, these patients accounted for 1,030 hospital admissions, with 218 (44.4%) having two or more hospital admissions. Implementing non-invasive ventilation could reduce healthcare use and costs. In a retrospective study of the Medicare Limited Data Set (2012–18), patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure who received non-invasive ventilation treatment experienced a reduced risk of mortality (relative risk reduction 39%) and fewer hospital admissions (17%) compared to a matched cohort without reductions. Furthermore, a cost-effectiveness analysis, based on the results of a randomized controlled trial, showed a favorable incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year of $50,856 (£42,406, €49,818) in the United States.

Clearly, the burden of evidence suggests a beneficial effect for non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD. In the following sections, we provide general recommendations for some unresolved issues surrounding non-invasive ventilation implementation.

### Timing of noninvasive ventilation failure: Causes, risk factors, and potential remedies [^113abTk4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Miscellaneous risk factors of NIV failure, including a delay between admission and NIV use, the number of fiberoptic bronchoscopies performed, the duration of NIV use, an increase in radiographic infiltrates within the first 24 hours, and the causal diagnosis (as de novo) of ARF. Age has been demonstrated to be a risk factor (with a low OR) only in a minority of studies.

- **Hypercapnic respiratory failure**: The utilization of NIV in hypercapnic ARF, as well as the risk factors for its failure, has probably been more intensively studied compared to its use in hypoxic ARF. Although hypercapnic ARF covers ARF due to neurological disorders (such as neuromuscular disorders) or other acute or chronic lung disorders (such as restrictive lung disease), most of the studies done in this field have involved patients with COPD exacerbations.

### Percocet [^115qp44n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Life-threatening respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including Percocet, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and the use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see OVERDOSAGE]. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

While serious and potentially fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Percocet, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Proper dosing and titration of Percocet are essential to reduce the risk of respiratory depression [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Overestimating the Percocet dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.

Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Percocet, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. It is crucial to educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or seeking emergency medical help immediately in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia.

### Non-invasive ventilation after extubation in hypercapnic patients with chronic respiratory disorders: Randomised controlled trial [^114SNLGQ]. Lancet (2009). High credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation can prevent respiratory failure after extubation in individuals at increased risk of this complication, and enhanced survival in patients with hypercapnia has been recorded. We aimed to assess prospectively the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation after extubation in patients with hypercapnia, and as rescue therapy when respiratory failure develops.

- **Methods**: We undertook a randomised controlled trial in three intensive-care units in Spain. We enrolled 106 mechanically ventilated patients with chronic respiratory disorders and hypercapnia following a successful spontaneous breathing trial. We randomly allocated participants by computer to receive after extubation either non-invasive ventilation for 24 hours (n = 54) or conventional oxygen treatment (n = 52). The primary endpoint was avoidance of respiratory failure within 72 hours after extubation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT00539708.

- **Findings**: Respiratory failure after extubation was less frequent in patients assigned non-invasive ventilation than in those allocated conventional oxygen therapy (8 [15%] vs. 25 [48%]; odds ratio 5.32 [95% CI 2.11–13.46]; p < 0.0001). In patients with respiratory failure, non-invasive ventilation as rescue therapy avoided reintubation in 17 of 27 patients. Non-invasive ventilation was independently associated with a lower risk of respiratory failure after extubation (adjusted odds ratio 0.17 [95% CI 0.06–0.44]; p < 0.0001). Ninety-day mortality was lower in patients assigned non-invasive ventilation than in those receiving conventional therapy.

### Beyond the guidelines for non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure: Implications for practice [^1154cnW7]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation is standard therapy in the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of various causes. The evidence base for its use and when and how it should be used has been reviewed in two recent guidelines. In this Series paper, we look beyond the guidelines to explore what is happening in everyday clinical practice in the real world, how patient selection can be refined to maximize the chances of a successful outcome, and emerging alternative therapies.

Real-world application of non-invasive ventilation diverges from guideline recommendations, particularly with regard to patient selection and timing of initiation. To improve patient outcomes, education programs need to stress these issues, and the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation delivered needs to be monitored by regular audit.

### Opioid-induced respiratory depression increases hospital costs and length of stay in patients recovering on the general care floor [^112x8kmM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 1,495 prospectively enrolled PRODIGY patients, 1,335 underwent continuous capnography and pulse oximetry monitoring and received opioids on the general care floor, including 769 patients in the United States. This sub-analysis of healthcare utilization data, prospectively collected during the trial, was performed using the 769 United States patients, while 566 patients outside of the United States were excluded.

Within the United States patient cohort of 769, retrospectively collected cost data was unavailable for 349 patients, resulting in a final patient cohort of 420. The cost differences between patients with and without ≥ 1 respiratory depression episode were analyzed for these 420 United States PRODIGY patients. Although provision of cost data was not a requirement for site participation in the trial, cost data for the 420 patients was collected from five United States PRODIGY trial sites: Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI; Buffalo General Medical Center, Buffalo, NY; Emory University, Atlanta, GA; MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; and The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH.

Due to confounding factors such as differences in healthcare policies affecting patient length of stay and readmission procedures between countries, differences in healthcare cost and reimbursement systems, and limited sample sizes when considering PRODIGY results on a country-specific level (N = 28 to N = 213), the cost analysis focused solely on United States PRODIGY patients, who represent the largest cohort within the hospital cost analysis.

### Prone position for acute respiratory failure in adults [^113dDWRH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Acute hypoxaemia de novo or on a background of chronic hypoxaemia is a common reason for admission to intensive care and for provision of mechanical ventilation. Various refinements of mechanical ventilation or adjuncts are employed to improve patient outcomes. Mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the main contributors to the need for mechanical ventilation for hypoxaemia, remains approximately 40%. Ventilation in the prone position may improve lung mechanics and gas exchange and could improve outcomes.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review are (1) to ascertain whether prone ventilation offers a mortality advantage when compared with traditional supine or semi-recumbent ventilation in patients with severe acute respiratory failure requiring conventional invasive artificial ventilation, and (2) to supplement previous systematic reviews on prone ventilation for hypoxaemic respiratory failure in an adult population.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 31 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 31 January 2014), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 31 January 2014), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1992 to 31 January 2014) in Ovid MEDLINE for eligible randomized controlled trials. We also searched for studies by handsearching reference lists of relevant articles, by contacting colleagues, and by handsearching published proceedings of relevant journals. We applied no language constraints.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: A population-based case-control study [^113pi9HY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

**Methods**: This prospective study was conducted in the City of Liverpool, a metropolitan area within Sydney, Australia. The study population was limited to individuals aged 40 years and over. A case-control study design was utilized, where cases were identified as individuals with hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF). In contrast, controls were randomly selected from the source population who did not have HRF. Non-English speaking participants were excluded if an interpreter was unavailable. Nursing home residents were also excluded due to challenges in obtaining informed consent and accurate study measurements. Participants received a gift card valued at $40 AUD as compensation for their time. The study procedures received approval from the South Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written, informed consent.

### Percocet [^111FZt5x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, emphasizing that this risk is greatest when starting Percocet or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression]. Educate patients and caregivers on recognizing respiratory depression and stress the importance of calling 911 or obtaining emergency medical assistance immediately in the event of a known or suspected overdose.

Inform patients that accidental ingestion, particularly by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see WARNINGS].

- **Interactions with benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants**: Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Percocet is used with benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Patients should not use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

- **Patient access to naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose**: Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Percocet. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression].
