## Question

Anastrazole

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anastrozole's role across prevention, adjuvant, and metastatic settings, including mechanism, efficacy, safety, dosing, and guideline positioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and mechanism to anchor downstream decisions. Then, I should verify labeled indications and key trials by setting. Next, I will appraise efficacy data and quantify benefits. After that, I need to review safety, especially bone and cardiovascular effects, and how guidelines mitigate them. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, including dosing, sequencing, and special populations, and close with a concise clinical take-home message.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and mechanism, because everything else hinges on this. Anastrozole is a third-generation, nonsteroidal, reversible aromatase inhibitor that blocks conversion of androgens to estrogens, producing profound estradiol suppression in postmenopausal women; this is the foundation for both treatment and prevention effects in estrogen receptor–positive disease.

> I need to check the labeled indications to avoid overextending beyond evidence. The FDA label restricts anastrozole to postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive disease in three settings: adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer, first-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease, and treatment of advanced disease progressing after tamoxifen; importantly, it is not indicated for premenopausal women or for primary prevention in the United States, though prevention data exist and are reflected in guidelines, which I should distinguish carefully from labeling [^115VtB1S] [^116WATRw] [^113kksPF].

> Next, I should review the pivotal prevention evidence and quantify benefit. The IBIS-II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in high-risk postmenopausal women showed a 53% reduction in incident breast cancer with 5 years of anastrozole 1 mg daily versus placebo, with benefit confined to ER-positive tumors and no excess of fractures, other cancers, or cardiovascular events on long-term follow-up; the number needed to treat fell to 29 over extended follow-up, supporting a durable preventive effect [^115b7XJM] [^112zTAmj]. Hold on, I should verify guideline uptake: ASCO recommends discussing anastrozole as a prevention option for postmenopausal women at increased risk, aligning with these data, even though this remains off-label in the U.S [^114jX9mW] [^115aVNwV].

> Now, adjuvant therapy. I will examine the ATAC trial and its long-term outcomes because this shapes upfront choices. In 9,366 postmenopausal women with early breast cancer, anastrozole improved disease-free survival versus tamoxifen and reduced contralateral breast cancer, with a carryover benefit persisting after 5 years; however, fractures were more frequent during treatment, and there was no statistically significant overall survival advantage in the initial analyses, though meta-analytic data later suggested mortality benefits for AIs versus tamoxifen [^115NrzJZ] [^1148ZV5H] [^1117JPx1]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: the 10-year breast cancer mortality reduction with AIs versus tamoxifen is about 15% in pooled analyses, which is clinically meaningful even if OS differences in single trials are modest or not statistically significant [^1117JPx1].

> I should confirm sequencing strategies and extended therapy data, because practice often involves switching or extension. Switching from tamoxifen to an AI after 2–3 years improves outcomes compared with tamoxifen alone, and extended AI therapy after 5 years of tamoxifen reduces recurrence in node-positive patients; however, extending AI after 5 years of prior AI has mixed results, with AERAS showing improved DFS for 10 total years of AI but DATA showing no DFS or OS benefit for 6 versus 3 years of anastrozole after tamoxifen, so I need to individualize extension decisions by nodal status and risk [^116VVPAx] [^112XN5zM] [^114WuEP7] [^1129BeA9]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse extension selectively: ASCO supports extended AI in node-positive disease and considers it in selected node-negative patients based on risk, which matches this evidence landscape [^112XN5zM] [^116yJDU9].

> For metastatic disease, I need to check first-line data and combinations. Anastrozole is effective first-line in hormone receptor–positive advanced disease, with randomized trials showing superiority to tamoxifen in time to progression in some studies and noninferiority in others; importantly, the combination of anastrozole plus fulvestrant improved progression-free and overall survival versus anastrozole alone in untreated metastatic disease, establishing a standard combination option in selected patients [^1161yvDK] [^1139jDDW] [^112W3F9R]. Let me reconsider whether this applies broadly: the benefit is most compelling when fulvestrant dosing is adequate and in patients without prior endocrine exposure, so sequencing and prior therapy matter [^112W3F9R].

> I will now examine safety, starting with bone health, because this drives monitoring and mitigation. Aromatase inhibitors accelerate bone loss and increase fracture risk compared with tamoxifen; ATAC showed more fractures with anastrozole during treatment, and IBIS-II prevention data confirmed increased musculoskeletal symptoms and a need for proactive bone protection, though fracture risk normalizes after therapy ends in some analyses [^1148ZV5H] [^117PmPKZ] [^115ADzDY]. I should double-check guideline directives: ASCO advises baseline fracture risk assessment, BMD testing, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, exercise, and consideration of bisphosphonates or denosumab in those with moderate bone loss; severe osteoporosis is a relative contraindication, and IBIS-II excluded women with T scores less than −4 or multiple vertebral fractures [^1132wSX7] [^117KhWKD] [^1172tDwu].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular and lipid effects, and I need to be careful not to over-attribute causality. Anastrozole is associated with higher rates of hypercholesterolemia than tamoxifen in some trials, but this largely reflects tamoxifen's lipid-lowering properties rather than a detrimental effect of AIs; nonetheless, I should monitor lipids and manage per cardiovascular risk guidelines, and I should remember that patients with preexisting ischemic heart disease had more ischemic events on anastrozole in subgroup analyses, so vigilance is warranted in that population [^114JmY7b] [^114moJb1]. Hold on, I should verify that this is framed as risk modification rather than a class prohibition: guidelines emphasize individualized risk assessment and mitigation rather than avoiding AIs outright in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity [^114JmY7b].

> Let me consider other adverse effects and adherence, because tolerability influences real-world effectiveness. Vasomotor symptoms, arthralgias, and vaginal dryness are more common with AIs than tamoxifen, whereas endometrial cancer and thromboembolism are less frequent; adherence in IBIS-II was lower with anastrozole than placebo, largely due to musculoskeletal and gynecologic symptoms, underscoring the need for anticipatory guidance and symptom management to preserve benefit [^117PmPKZ] [^1117JPx1]. I should confirm that guidelines recommend counseling on these effects and shared decision-making to sustain adherence over the 5-year course [^114SFPiA] [^1132wSX7].

> I need to ensure dosing and administration are precise. The standard dose is 1 mg orally once daily for 5 years in prevention and adjuvant settings, with or without food; missed doses should not be doubled, and therapy should continue until completion or intolerance, with periodic reassessment of benefit–risk during treatment [^111ag4jT] [^115aVNwV]. But wait, what if there is inadequate estrogen suppression? Emerging data suggest a subset of patients on anastrozole have incomplete estrogen suppression and may benefit from dose escalation or switching strategies, though this remains investigational and not standard of care pending validation of biomarker thresholds and outcomes [^114rhvcN] [^116iWzxL].

> Next, I should review special populations and contraindications to avoid misapplication. Anastrozole is not indicated for premenopausal women because it does not reliably suppress ovarian estrogen synthesis; in carefully selected premenopausal contexts with ovarian suppression, AI therapy has been explored, but this is not standard outside trials or specific protocols, and ASCO prevention guidelines explicitly advise against AI use in premenopausal women [^117BZYA3] [^1156jZYo] [^111WDHNm]. I should also confirm reproductive counseling: anastrozole is contraindicated in pregnancy and can impair fertility, so effective contraception is required during therapy and for a short period after completion [^113cpqUt].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach. For prevention in high-risk postmenopausal women, discuss anastrozole 1 mg daily for 5 years as an alternative to tamoxifen or raloxifene, with explicit counseling on musculoskeletal effects and bone protection planning; for adjuvant therapy, consider anastrozole upfront or after 2–3 years of tamoxifen, and extend AI therapy to a total of 7–10 years in node-positive or higher-risk node-negative patients; for metastatic disease, anastrozole alone or combined with fulvestrant are evidence-based first-line options, chosen based on prior endocrine exposure, comorbidities, and patient preference; throughout, monitor bone density, lipids, and adherence, and manage symptoms proactively to preserve benefit [^114jX9mW] [^116VVPAx] [^112XN5zM] [^112W3F9R] [^1132wSX7]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with major guidelines: ASCO, NCCN, and ESMO endorse these strategies with minor variations, reinforcing the centrality of individualized risk–benefit discussions and longitudinal toxicity surveillance [^116VVPAx] [^114C7Nhz] [^114NivtP].

---

Anastrozole is a **third-generation aromatase inhibitor** that reduces estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women, lowering the risk of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer recurrence and new primary tumors [^1117JPx1]. It is indicated for **adjuvant therapy in early-stage disease** [^115VtB1S], first-line treatment of advanced disease [^116WATRw], and prevention in high-risk women [^notfound]. Compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole improves disease-free survival [^1148ZV5H] and reduces contralateral breast cancer [^116Ja4p4], but increases fracture risk and musculoskeletal symptoms [^1117JPx1]; it does not increase endometrial cancer or thromboembolism [^1117JPx1]. Standard dosing is 1 mg orally once daily for 5 years [^115aVNwV]; bone health should be monitored and managed proactively [^1132wSX7].

---

## Mechanism of action

Anastrozole **irreversibly inhibits aromatase**, the enzyme responsible for converting androgens to estrogens, thereby reducing circulating estrogen levels in postmenopausal women [^1115qWZJ]. This estrogen deprivation slows the growth of estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast tumors [^1117JPx1].

---

## Clinical indications

Anastrozole is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

- **Adjuvant treatment**: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive early breast cancer [^115VtB1S].
- **First-line treatment**: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive or unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer [^116WATRw].
- **Advanced breast cancer**: Postmenopausal women with disease progression following tamoxifen therapy [^113kksPF].

Additionally, anastrozole is **recommended for breast cancer prevention** in high-risk postmenopausal women [^112pN9FM] [^114jX9mW].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Adjuvant therapy

In the ATAC trial (n = 9,366), anastrozole **significantly improved disease-free survival** compared with tamoxifen (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.73–0.94; p = 0.0049) [^115NrzJZ] and reduced contralateral breast cancer incidence (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42–0.85; p = 0.004) [^116Ja4p4]. Long-term follow-up (median 120 months) confirmed sustained benefits [^1148ZV5H].

---

### Advanced breast cancer

Anastrozole is **effective as first-line therapy** in advanced breast cancer, with clinical trials demonstrating significant improvements in time to progression and overall response rates compared with tamoxifen [^1161yvDK] [^1139jDDW].

---

### Breast cancer prevention

The IBIS-II trial (n = 3,864) showed that anastrozole **reduced breast cancer incidence by 53%** in high-risk postmenopausal women (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32–0.68; p < 0.0001) [^112pN9FM], with benefits persisting beyond the treatment period [^115b7XJM].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Anastrozole is **generally well tolerated**, but adverse effects include:

- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: Arthralgia, joint stiffness, and myalgia are common [^1117JPx1].
- **Bone health**: Increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures due to estrogen deprivation [^117Gw5P9] [^1117JPx1].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Possible increase in ischemic cardiac events, particularly in patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease [^114moJb1].
- **Hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms**: Common but generally manageable [^1117JPx1].

Notably, anastrozole **does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer or thromboembolic events**, unlike tamoxifen [^1117JPx1] [^117XeZx8].

---

## Comparison with other aromatase inhibitors

Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane have similar efficacy in the adjuvant and metastatic settings [^1171dAnu]. Letrozole may provide **more potent aromatase inhibition** [^116f9zGr], but clinical differences are modest, and agent selection is often based on patient-specific factors and tolerability [^1171dAnu].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from ASCO, NCCN, and ESMO recommend anastrozole as a **standard option** for adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer [^116VVPAx] [^114C7Nhz] [^114NivtP]. It is also recommended for breast cancer prevention in high-risk postmenopausal women [^114jX9mW] [^115b7XJM].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Anastrozole is **appropriate for postmenopausal women** with ER+ breast cancer, particularly those with:

- **High risk of recurrence**: Node-positive disease or large tumor size [^notfound].
- **Contraindications to tamoxifen**: History of thromboembolism or endometrial cancer [^notfound].
- **High risk of developing breast cancer**: Family history or genetic predisposition (e.g. BRCA mutation) [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management of side effects

Regular monitoring and management of side effects are essential:

- **Bone health**: Baseline and periodic bone mineral density assessments; calcium and vitamin D supplementation; bisphosphonates or denosumab for osteoporosis [^1132wSX7] [^117KhWKD].
- **Cardiovascular health**: Monitor lipid profiles and manage cardiovascular risk factors [^114JmY7b].
- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: Encourage physical activity, analgesics, and dose adjustments if necessary [^notfound].

---

## Current research and future directions

Ongoing research explores **extended adjuvant therapy** [^114WuEP7], combination regimens (e.g. with CDK4/6 inhibitors) [^notfound], and biomarker-driven strategies to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity [^116iWzxL].

---

Anastrozole is a **highly effective aromatase inhibitor** [^1117JPx1] with a favorable safety profile, particularly regarding endometrial and thromboembolic risks [^117XeZx8]. It is a cornerstone of endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer, offering significant benefits in adjuvant, metastatic, and preventive settings [^114NivtP].

IBIS-II anastrozole for primary breast cancer prevention — adherence, subgroup effects, adverse events, and survival are summarized as follows: Five-year adherence was lower with anastrozole versus placebo (68% v 72%), and reporting gynecologic symptoms at 6 months was associated with lower long-term adherence (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88). Reduction in invasive breast cancer risk was limited to estrogen receptor–positive and/or progesterone receptor–positive tumors (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71; P = 0.001), with little difference by age < 60 years or > 60 years or body mass index; risk reduction was clear for women with no prior hormone replacement therapy but not for women with prior hormone replacement therapy. By data cutoff there were 35 deaths (17 placebo, 18 anastrozole) with no specific causes more common between groups (P = 0.836). Vasomotor and musculoskeletal symptoms were significantly increased with anastrozole, with increased frequency of hypertension and dry eyes. There is no evidence for a survival advantage for anastrozole in primary prevention, and there are no data for women with germ line breast cancer predisposition mutations or for men; trial follow-up was reported as median 5 years (range, 3.0 to 7.1 years).

The Femara anastrozole clinical evaluation trial (FACE)

Although the ATAC and BIG 1–98 trials have provided an extensive data set for anastrozole and letrozole in early breast cancer, no head-to-head trial of these two AIs has been conducted in this setting. The ongoing FACE trial was designed to prospectively address potential efficacy and safety differences. This phase III open-label, randomised, multicenter study includes node-positive patients randomised to receive either early adjuvant letrozole or anastrozole. The primary objective is to compare DFS at 5 years. Secondary objectives are to assess safety, OS, time to DM, and time to contralateral breast cancer. The trial was designed to differentiate between the two drugs in the shortest possible time by enrolling patients at increased risk of early recurrence of breast cancer, so that the number of events required to initiate analysis will be obtained more quickly. The results may help refine treatment strategies for PMW with breast cancer.

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^112nV2ay]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

What is first-line endocrine treatment for breast cancer?

First-line treatment for breast cancer is the easiest to define in terms of a new diagnosis, whether a new primary or initial systemic relapse. However, these events do not necessarily equate to first-line endocrine therapy because the patient may have already been exposed to raloxifene for osteoporosis or tamoxifen for chemoprevention. There are unfortunately only limited data to guide the clinical management of these patients. The recommendation to use an adjuvant AI in selective oestrogen receptor modulation (SERM)-exposed patients stems from advanced disease trials in which patients either relapsing on or after tamoxifen therapy still have a reasonable chance of responding to AIs. Similarly, a patient with newly diagnosed hormone receptor-positive advanced disease is highly likely to have already been treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. If the relapse occurred on tamoxifen or within 6 months to 1 year of stopping tamoxifen, then the patient is considered to be in a 'second-line endocrine therapy' category, and the standard recommendation is an AI. Patients who relapse after an interval of more than 1 year are traditionally considered 'first-line' endocrine therapy candidates, as the standard of care was to reintroduce tamoxifen therapy. However, a recent large study demonstrated that this is a relatively ineffective strategy, with an odds ratio favouring letrozole treatment approaching 4 in this subgroup. Perhaps, any patient who has completed a course of adjuvant tamoxifen could really be considered to be a candidate for second-line endocrine therapy upon relapse, regardless of how long ago the exposure to tamoxifen was.

### Risk-reducing medications for primary breast cancer: a network meta-analysis [^117XeZx8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).

Main Results

We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).

### Use of anastrozole for breast cancer prevention (IBIS-II): long-term results of a randomised controlled trial [^115JAc58]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

IBIS-II is an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Detailed study design and inclusion and exclusion criteria have previously been reported. In brief, high-risk postmenopausal women aged 40–70 years were recruited between Feb 2, 2003, and Jan 31, 2012, in 153 breast cancer treatment centres across 18 countries (appendix p 3). Specific risk criteria for entry were broad and have previously been reported. They were designed to include women aged 45–60 years who had a relative risk of breast cancer that was at least twice as high as that in the general population, those aged 60–70 years who had a risk that was at least 1.5 times higher, and those aged 40–44 years who had a risk that was at least four times higher. The exclusion criteria were being premenopausal, previous breast cancer including ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed more than 6 months before trial entry, current or previous tamoxifen, raloxifene, or other SERM use for more than 6 months, or participation in IBIS-I, unless off-trial therapy for at least 5 years, intention to continue using oestrogen-based hormone replacement therapy, or previous or planned prophylactic mastectomy.

The trial was approved by the UK North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee and was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1996 revision), under the principles of good clinical practice. All participants provided written, informed consent to join the study, provide baseline and follow-up blood samples, and have their past and future health records examined, including access to mammograms and pathology material.

Randomisation and masking

Consenting eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1) to either anastrozole (1 mg per day, oral) or matching placebo daily for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by country. All participants and medical personnel were blinded to treatment allocation, which was only held by the central study statistician. Unblinding was only permitted if the participant developed breast cancer, when a clinician considered there to be valid medical or safety reasons, or the participant requested unblinding. Treatment allocation still remains largely blinded for investigators and participating women who have not developed breast or any other cancer (81.3% anastrozole vs 76.7% placebo, p = 0.0053). A further analysis was planned to take place around 5 years after the last report, and this analysis is provided 6 years after that report. The decision to analyse the data was made without looking at the results beforehand.

Anastrozole — risk reduction option and dosing in postmenopause: Anastrozole (1 mg/day orally for 5 years) should be discussed as an alternative to tamoxifen, raloxifene, or exemestane to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk of developing breast cancer.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^1115qWZJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy has an important role in postmenopausal women (PMW) with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. Efficacy of anti-hormonal treatment of early breast cancer is based on the fact that estrogens may stimulate the growth of residual cancer cells or contribute to the initiation of a new primary cancer over time.

Selective estrogen-receptor (ER) modulators, such as tamoxifen, have been the gold standard of care for women with HR+ breast cancer for the last 30 years. Tamoxifen therapy for 5 years can reduce the odds of recurrence and death by 47 and 26%, respectively.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have now replaced tamoxifen as the standard of care for adjuvant endocrine therapy in the treatment of PMW with hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Three generations of AIs have been developed during the last 3 decades. Of these, the third-generation AIs have more favorable tolerability profiles and are more selective and/or potent compared with first- and second-generation agents. There are two broad categories of third-generation AIs. The reversible non-steroidal agents include anastrozole and letrozole (triazole derivatives). The third agent, exemestane, is an androstenedione derivative that functions as an irreversible steroidal inhibitor (or inactivator). The triazole derivatives bind to the cytochrome P-450 component of the aromatase enzyme, whereas the steroidal compound exemestane binds to the substrate-binding pocket of the aromatase enzyme, leading to its degradation (Figure 1). AIs are now widely used as first-line therapy for PMW with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer, as first-line therapy for metastatic disease, and as second-line agents in cases of tamoxifen resistance. This review emphasises the potency and emerging efficacy differences between third-generation AIs and places particular emphasis upon comparisons between anastrozole and letrozole.

### The current status of aromatase inhibitors in the management of breast cancer [^113NAiTZ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The third generation of specific AIs have made a very exciting contribution to the management of hormone responsive breast cancer. We can now state with confidence that their role in advanced breast cancer has overtaken that of tamoxifen, which should be relegated to a second-line treatment. Indeed, as a recent publication confirmed that first-line anastrozole followed by tamoxifen is an effective treatment sequence, this sequence may be considered the best choice for treating patients with hormone receptor-positive ABC. As far as the primary disease is concerned, the ATAC data certainly suggest that there is an alternative to tamoxifen in selected postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive disease. With more mature follow-up the study might even show that after a passage of nearly 20 years tamoxifen has lost its lead position in the adjuvant stakes as well.

### Reducing the risk of early recurrence in hormone-responsive breast cancer [^1111Titp]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Following primary treatment for early breast cancer, systemic adjuvant therapy is given to reduce the risk of recurrence by targeting any undetectable micrometastatic deposits. Adjuvant systemic treatment may include endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and antibody therapy, depending on the presence or absence of hormone receptors, HER2 status and the estimated risk of relapse. In recent years, an increasing number of tumor characteristics have been identified that influence the risk of relapse and the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome with a given therapy. Hence, choosing the optimum therapy for early breast cancer is becoming an increasingly complicated task. Decision tools have been developed that can be used by physicians to select the most appropriate therapy on an individual basis. Treatment recommendations are, therefore, based on available data from a large number of sources. Hormone-receptor positivity (HR+) is the primary factor when considering whether or not patients should receive adjuvant endocrine therapy. For several decades, tamoxifen has been the gold standard of endocrine therapy, and has significantly reduced recurrences and deaths among the millions of women with HR+ breast cancer worldwide. However, prolonged use of tamoxifen is associated with potentially life-threatening side effects, and resistance is a common problem. In fact, many women will experience disease relapse while on tamoxifen. In particular, the peak of early relapses that occurs in the first 2–3 years after surgery is not prevented by tamoxifen. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs), letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane, have recently been shown to significantly improve outcomes compared with tamoxifen in large, randomized, controlled trials; however, how the AIs should be incorporated into adjuvant therapy to optimize outcomes requires further investigation. Clinical differences between the AIs, and whether tumor estrogen/progesterone receptor status and HER2 overexpression affect the response to AI therapy, are among the questions that remain to be answered. Ongoing and future studies will help to address these questions and, together with improved patient and disease profiling, will help physicians to optimize adjuvant treatment for individual patients.

### Use of anastrozole for breast cancer prevention (IBIS-II): long-term results of a randomised controlled trial [^115b7XJM]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, these updated results show a continuing long-term effect of 5 years of anastrozole treatment in preventing breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. No new major adverse events were identified. Overall, our data substantially strengthen the findings from our initial report after 5 years of follow-up. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has now recommended the use of anastrozole for breast cancer prevention in high-risk postmenopausal women, and in the USA, the US Preventive Services Task Force has also supported its use. The benefits of anastrozole, in terms of the reduction in risk of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women, extend beyond the 5-year treatment period.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology technology assessment on the use of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: status report 2002 [^112HLhFm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct an evidence-based technology assessment to determine whether the routine use of anastrozole or any of the aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant breast cancer setting is appropriate for broad-based conventional use in clinical practice. POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS: Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane.

Outcomes

Outcomes of interest include breast cancer incidence, breast cancer-specific survival, overall survival, and net health benefit.

Evidence

A comprehensive, formal literature review was conducted for relevant topics and is detailed in the text. Testimony was collected from invited experts and interested parties. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)-prescribed technology assessment procedure was followed. BENEFITS/HARMS: The ASCO panel recognizes that a woman and her physician's decision regarding adjuvant hormonal therapy is complex and will depend on the importance and weight attributed to information regarding both cancer and non-cancer-related risks and benefits.

Conclusion

The panel was influenced by the compelling, extensive, and long-term data available on tamoxifen. Overall, the panel considers the results of the Arimidex (anastrozole) or Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial and the extensive supporting data to be very promising but insufficient to change the standard practice at this time (May 2002). A 5-year course of adjuvant tamoxifen remains the standard therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The panel recommends that physicians discuss the available information with patients, and, in making a decision, acknowledge that treatment approaches can change over time. Individual health care providers and their patients will need to come to their own conclusions, with careful consideration of all of the available data. (Specific questions addressed by the panel are summarized in Appendix 3.)

Validation

The conclusions of the panel were endorsed by the ASCO Health Services Research Committee and the ASCO Board of Directors.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1132wSX7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Anastrozole for breast cancer risk reduction — recommendations 4.4–4.6 advise that discussions between patients and health care providers should include both the benefits and risks of anastrozole along with the other approved drugs for risk reduction based on menopausal status. Prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor, clinicians should evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density, should use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss and consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitors, should encourage regular exercise and adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements for all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, and should recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication; in IBIS-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < –4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded and other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women. Clinicians should also inform women of the possibility of joint stiffness, arthralgias, vasomotor symptoms, hypertension, dry eyes, and vaginal dryness while taking anastrozole, and this is labeled as Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong.

### Sequencing of aromatase inhibitors [^111uwSTN]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Since the development of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs), anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane, these agents have been the subject of intensive research to determine their optimal use in advanced breast cancer. Not only have they replaced progestins in second-line therapy and challenged the role of tamoxifen in first-line, but there is also evidence for a lack of cross-resistance between the steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs, meaning that they may be used in sequence to obtain prolonged clinical benefit. Many questions remain, however, as to the best sequence of the two types of AIs and of the other available agents, including tamoxifen and fulvestrant, in different patient groups.

### Interpreting the results of noninferiority trials-a review [^111W5pL1]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Superior noninferior treatments

By definition, conventionally superior treatments are also noninferior. However, conventional trials typically do not specify a noninferiority boundary, and the issue of wanting to declare superiority from a noninferiority trial is rarely encountered. One nice example of this occurrence is the ATAC trial (Anastrozole, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination). This was a three-arm trial in which tamoxifen alone (the standard treatment) was compared with anastrozole alone or tamoxifen and anastrozole in combination in 9366 women with early breast cancer. Two co-primary comparisons were specified, namely: is the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole better than tamoxifen alone; and is anastrozole alone noninferior to tamoxifen alone. Noninferiority was based on the requirement that the 90% two-sided upper confidence limit of the hazard ratio for disease-free survival of anastrozole vs tamoxifen was less than 1.25. In fact anastrozole alone was significantly better than tamoxifen (P = 0.013), so that the noninferiority question was overtaken by the finding of a conventionally superior outcome. In fact, the combination treatment turned out to be slightly worse than tamoxifen, and significantly worse than anastrozole alone (P = 0.0006). Superiority of anastrozole to tamoxifen in terms of efficacy has been confirmed in additional long-term follow-up studies extending up to 10 years.

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^117GRbT5]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Until recently, endocrine therapy for breast cancer was relatively simple. If the tumour expressed hormone receptors, regardless of stage and age, tamoxifen was indicated. While this largely remains the case for premenopausal women, clinical trials in postmenopausal women have broadened our choice to include one of three selective aromatase inhibitors (AIs), the nonsteroidal agents anastrozole or letrozole and the steroidal agent exemestane. Comparative data concerning the efficacy, toxicity, tolerability and cost of AI vs tamoxifen continues to evolve with over 40 000 women slated to be involved in clinical trials. Currently, tamoxifen remains an appropriate choice for adjuvant treatment, and will remain so unless a clear survival advantage emerges for adjuvant AI therapy. However, anastrozole is widely seen as a useful alternative, with particular merit for patients prone to the development of serious tamoxifen side effects. For endocrine therapy naïve advanced disease, several trials have provided evidence that a nonsteroidal AI has replaced tamoxifen as optimal treatment. In the neoadjuvant setting, letrozole was also more effective than tamoxifen, both in terms of response rates and the incidence of breast-conserving surgery, and so AI therefore also dominates this evolving indication. The ongoing adjuvant clinical trials ask all the relevant questions regarding tamoxifen and AI in combination, sequence and duration, except for 5 years of an AI vs a longer period. For both the advanced and early-stage disease, resistance remains the key obstacle to overcome, and trials that combine endocrine agents with signal transduction inhibitors such as HER1 and HER2 kinase inhibitors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors as well as COX2 inhibitors are being developed in a concerted attempt to address this problem.

### Sequencing of aromatase inhibitors [^1149PMxh]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

What is the optimal sequence for hormonal therapy in breast cancer? Until recently, the antioestrogen tamoxifen was the only agent approved for adjuvant therapy. At the time of relapse, postmenopausal patients with tamoxifen-resistant disease (progressing during adjuvant tamoxifen or within 1 year from its discontinuation) were generally offered an aromatase inhibitor (AI), followed by a progestin (usually megestrol acetate) when they further progressed. This paradigm needs to be reconsidered in the light of recent developments following the early results of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) study, with anastrozole becoming an alternative to tamoxifen in the early adjuvant setting (years 0–5). Moreover, early results of the MA17 trial and of the Intergroup Exemestane Study suggest that a sequence of tamoxifen followed by an AI may be beneficial in the early or in the extended adjuvant setting (years 5–10), respectively.

### Effect of anastrozole and tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer: 10-year analysis of the ATAC trial [^1148ZV5H]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Background

The Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of anastrozole (1 mg) with tamoxifen (20 mg), both given orally every day for 5 years, as adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. In this analysis, we assess the long-term outcomes after a median follow-up of 120 months.

Methods

We used a proportional hazards model to assess the primary endpoint of disease-free survival, and the secondary endpoints of time to recurrence, time to distant recurrence, incidence of new contralateral breast cancer, overall survival, and death with or without recurrence in all randomised patients (anastrozole n = 3125, tamoxifen n = 3116) and hormone-receptor-positive patients (anastrozole n = 2618, tamoxifen n = 2598). After treatment completion, we continued to collect data on fractures and serious adverse events in a masked fashion (safety population: anastrozole n = 3092, tamoxifen n = 3094). This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN18233230.

Findings

Patients were followed up for a median of 120 months (range 0–145); there were 24,522 woman-years of follow-up in the anastrozole group and 23,950 woman-years in the tamoxifen group. In the full study population, there were significant improvements in the anastrozole group compared with the tamoxifen group for disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–0.99; p = 0.04), time to recurrence (0.84, 0.75–0.93; p = 0.001), and time to distant recurrence (0.87, 0.77–0.99; p = 0.03). For hormone-receptor-positive patients, the results were also significantly in favour of the anastrozole group for disease-free survival (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.95; p = 0.003), time to recurrence (0.79, 0.70–0.89; p = 0.0002), and time to distant recurrence (0.85, 0.73–0.98; p = 0.02). In hormone-receptor-positive patients, absolute differences in time to recurrence between anastrozole and tamoxifen increased over time (2.7% at 5 years and 4.3% at 10 years) and recurrence rates remained significantly lower on anastrozole than tamoxifen after treatment completion (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67–0.98; p = 0.03), although the carryover benefit was smaller after 8 years. There was weak evidence of fewer deaths after recurrence with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen treatment in the hormone-receptor-positive subgroup (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74–1.02; p = 0.09), but there was little difference in overall mortality (0.95, 95% CI 0.84–1.06; p = 0.4). Fractures were more frequent during active treatment in patients receiving anastrozole than those receiving tamoxifen (451 vs 351; OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15–1.55; p < 0.0001), but were similar in the post-treatment follow-up period (110 vs 112; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74–1.30; p = 0.9). Treatment-related serious adverse events were less common in the anastrozole group than the tamoxifen group (223 anastrozole vs 369 tamoxifen; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.48–0.69; p < 0.0001), but were similar after treatment completion (66 vs 78; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60–1.19; p = 0.3). No differences in non-breast cancer causes of death were apparent and the incidence of other cancers was similar between groups (425 vs 431) and continue to be higher with anastrozole for colorectal (66 vs 44) and lung cancer (51 vs 34), and lower for endometrial cancer (six vs 24), melanoma (eight vs 19), and ovarian cancer (17 vs 28). No new safety concerns were reported.

Interpretation

These data confirm the long-term superior efficacy and safety of anastrozole over tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer.

### Are all aromatase inhibitors the same? A review of controlled clinical trials in breast cancer [^113CGwpM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Five years of tamoxifen therapy has been the standard of care for the adjuvant treatment of estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer for many years and was the first hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic disease. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole offer new treatment options, although their efficacy has not been compared directly in randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in any breast cancer treatment setting.

Objective

The goal of this article was to review the results of recent randomized, controlled clinical trials of the AIs in the settings of neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and advance d/metastatic breast cancer.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for descriptions of randomized, controlled clinical trials published from 1990 to 2005 using the terms breast cancer, aromatase, aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole. Abstracts from the proceedings of several oncology meetings held between 2001 and 2005 were searched to capture relevant emerging data.

Results

In 2 Phase III trials comparing an AI with tamoxifen for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, disease-free survival was significantly improved with anastrozole and letrozole compared with tamoxifen as initial adjuvant treatment (P = 0.01 and P = 0.003, respectively). A switch to either anastrozole (2 Phase III trials) or exemestane (1 Phase III trial) after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy was more effective in reducing the risk of recurrence than continued tamoxifen therapy (P = 0.006, P < 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively); data on switching to letrozole are expected soon. In another Phase III trial, letrozole was found to improve disease-free survival in the extended adjuvant setting (P ≤ 0.001) and was the only AI consistently more effective than tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting. In 3 Phase III studies (1 letrozole vs tamoxifen, 2 anastrozole vs tamoxifen), both anastrozole and letrozole were more efficacious than tamoxifen in the first-line setting, and some patients receiving letrozole had better overall response rates compared with those receiving anastrozole in the second-line setting (19.1% vs 12.3%, respectively; P = 0.013). In a patient-preference study, those receiving letrozole reported fewer adverse events than those receiving anastrozole (43% vs 65%; P < 0.003), and more patients preferred letrozole to anastrozole (68% vs 32%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Currently, anastrozole and letrozole are associated with the most complete data over the breast cancer care continuum, with efficacy in early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic disease. In-direct comparisons suggest stronger evidence for the use of letrozole compared with other AIs for breast cancer in postmenopausal women who require estrogen-deprivation therapy. Data from randomized, double-blind comparative studies will help clarify the differences between AIs.

### Anastrozole for prevention of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women (IBIS-II): an international, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial [^112pN9FM]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Aromatase inhibitors effectively prevent breast cancer recurrence and development of new contralateral tumours in postmenopausal women. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole for prevention of breast cancer in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of the disease.

Methods

Between Feb 2, 2003, and Jan 31, 2012, we recruited postmenopausal women aged 40–70 years from 18 countries into an international, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. To be eligible, women had to be at increased risk of breast cancer (judged on the basis of specific criteria). Eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1) by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or matching placebo every day for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by country and was done with blocks (size six, eight, or ten). All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation; only the trial statistician was unmasked. The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed breast cancer (invasive cancers or non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ). Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN31488319.

Findings

1920 women were randomly assigned to receive anastrozole and 1944 to placebo. After a median follow-up of 5.0 years (IQR 3.0–7.1), 40 women in the anastrozole group (2%) and 85 in the placebo group (4%) had developed breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.32–0.68, p < 0.0001). The predicted cumulative incidence of all breast cancers after 7 years was 5.6% in the placebo group and 2.8% in the anastrozole group. 18 deaths were reported in the anastrozole group and 17 in the placebo group, and no specific causes were more common in one group than the other (p = 0.836).

Interpretation

Anastrozole effectively reduces incidence of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. This finding, along with the fact that most of the side-effects associated with oestrogen deprivation were not attributable to treatment, provides support for the use of anastrozole in postmenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer.

### Aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer: different structures, same effects? [^114iLVKU]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have become the first-choice endocrine drugs for postmenopausal breast cancer patients since they are associated with superior activity and better general tolerability when compared with tamoxifen both in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. As a consequence, the question is no more if a postmenopausal patient should have AIs as part of her adjuvant treatment, but when should it be started or which one should be preferentially used. Newer compounds, generally defined as third-generation AIs, are biochemically more selective and potent when compared with older ones, and they also show superior clinical activity. As yet, no large randomised study has been published comparing the three third-generation AIs on the market. Nevertheless, both laboratory and clinical data suggest that the steroidal (exemestane) and non-steroidal (anastrozole, letrozole) AIs may have slightly different toxicity profiles, probably due to the low androgenic action of the formers. While waiting for randomised data on clinical efficacy of third-generation AIs, such differences may help select the best drug in elderly patients with a low cumulative risk of relapse and a significant amount of co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer: evolution of NCCN, ASCO, and ST gallen recommendations [^114FWSSJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

Endocrine therapy has a firm role in adjuvant treatment of women with hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer. Until recently, tamoxifen was the most commonly used adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Several randomized clinical trials have studied the third-generation selective aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) as adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women. These studies compared therapy with an AI alone versus tamoxifen alone; 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen followed by switching to an AI versus continuation of tamoxifen; or extended therapy with an AI after approximately 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. No statistically significant differences in overall survival were observed. A single trial using extended treatment with an adjuvant AI suggests a small, statistically significant survival advantage in women with axillary lymph node-positive disease while showing no statistically significant decrease in survival with the use of an AI. The toxicities of the AIs are generally acceptable, with fewer endometrial cancers, gynecologic complaints, and thromboembolic events, but more bone fractures and arthralgias compared with tamoxifen alone. Three widely disseminated treatment guidelines, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Breast Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology Technology Assessment on the Use of Aromatase Inhibitors, and the St Gallen International Expert Consensus on the Primary Therapy of Early Breast Cancer, now incorporate AIs in the adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.

The Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial (median follow-up, 68 months) has shown that adjuvant anastrozole has superior efficacy and better tolerability than tamoxifen. However, anastrozole reduces circulating estrogen, and low estradiol levels are associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. It is therefore important to understand the effects of long-term aromatase inhibitor therapy on BMD.

Patients and Methods

This prospective substudy of the ATAC trial assessed BMD changes in postmenopausal women with invasive primary breast cancer receiving anastrozole (1 mg/d) or tamoxifen (20 mg/d) as adjuvant therapy for 5 years. Lumbar spine and total hip BMD were assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, and 5 years.

Results

One hundred ninety-seven women from the monotherapy arms of the ATAC trial were recruited onto the bone substudy, and 108 were included in the primary analysis. Among anastrozole-treated patients, there was a decrease in median BMD from baseline to 5 years in lumbar spine (-6.08%) and total hip (-7.24%) compared with the tamoxifen group (lumbar spine, +2.77%; total hip, +0.74%). No patients with normal BMD at baseline became osteoporotic at 5 years.

Conclusion

Anastrozole is associated with accelerated bone loss over the 5-year treatment period. However, although patients with pre-existing osteopenia are likely to require monitoring and bone-protection strategies, patients with normal BMD would not appear to require monitoring beyond the recommendation for healthy postmenopausal women. The effect of anastrozole on bone should be weighed against its superior efficacy and better tolerability profile versus tamoxifen in the main ATAC trial.

### Extended adjuvant aromatase inhibition after sequential endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: follow-up analysis of the randomised phase 3 DATA trial [^1129BeA9]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The DATA study evaluated the use of two different durations of anastrozole in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were disease-free after 2–3 years of tamoxifen. We hereby present the follow-up analysis, which was performed after all patients reached a minimum follow-up of 10 years beyond treatment divergence.

Methods

The open-label, randomised, phase 3 DATA study was performed in 79 hospitals in the Netherlands (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00301457). Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were disease-free after 2–3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment were assigned to either 3 or 6 years of anastrozole (1 mg orally once a day). Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by hormone receptor status, nodal status, HER2 status, and prior tamoxifen duration. The primary outcome was adapted disease-free survival, defined as disease-free survival from 3 years after randomisation onwards. Adapted overall survival was assessed as a secondary outcome. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat design.

Findings

Between June 28, 2006, and August 10, 2009, 1912 patients were randomly assigned to 3 years (n = 955) or 6 years (n = 957) of anastrozole. Of these, 1660 patients were eligible and disease-free at 3 years after randomisation. The 10-year adapted disease-free survival was 69.2% (95% CI 55.8–72.3) in the 6-year group (n = 827) and 66.0% (95% CI 62.5–69.2) in the 3-year group (n = 833) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86; 95% CI 0.72–1.01; p = 0.073). The 10-year adapted overall survival was 80.9% (95% CI 77.9–83.5) in the 6-year group and 79.2% (95% CI 76.2–81.9) in the 3-year group (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.75–1.16; p = 0.53).

Interpretation

Extended aromatase inhibition beyond 5 years of sequential endocrine therapy did not improve the adapted disease-free survival and adapted overall survival of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Toxicity and tolerability

Differences in the side effect profile between tamoxifen and anastrozole are marked, and arguably more likely to influence the current prescribing practice than differences in efficacy. There is no difference between anastrozole and tamoxifen in terms of cataracts, ischaemic cardiovascular events, fatigue or asthenia, mood disturbances and nausea and vomiting. However, anastrozole was associated with fewer endometrial cancers, vaginal bleeding and discharge, cerebrovascular events, venous thromboembolic events and hot flushes. Tamoxifen caused fewer musculoskeletal disorders and fractures. These data have led the ASCO technical panel and the St Gallen Consensus panel to emphasise that anastrozole might have an important role for those at particular risk for severe tamoxifen side effects. On the other hand, anastrozole should be prescribed with caution in patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis. The increase in fracture risk associated with anastrozole was evident even at the first analysis, suggesting that the decline in bone strength may occur very rapidly in some patients, perhaps even before major changes in bone mineral density are detected. Arguably, all patients on adjuvant AI therapy should receive vitamin D and calcium supplements, be encouraged to exercise, and those with evidence for bone loss at baseline should also receive an oral bisphosphonate, until practice guidelines are established. The ASCO technical review and the St Gallen Consensus Panel continue to emphasise the lack of safety data regarding long-term oestrogen deprivation. For example, AIs have been reported to alter cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism with potentially deleterious effects on cardiovascular health. There are also concerns about the effects of long-term oestrogen deprivation on memory and risk for dementia. Regions of the brain such as the hippocampus and amygdala involved in learning and memory are rich in ER, as oestrogen regulates synapse formation and induces choline transferase and acetylcholinesterase, both critical to memory function. While tamoxifen has been implicated in decline in cognitive function, these data do not come from double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials, and so the issue remains controversial. The positive influence of oestrogen on the general health, vitality, mental health, depressive symptoms, or sexual satisfaction has recently been seriously questioned, and so, while these issues need careful study, the potential of AIs to be unduly toxic in the long run should not be overstated.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

At the time of the initial publication of this trial, we searched PubMed for reports published in English between Jan 1, 1980, and May 30, 2013. We used the search terms "breast cancer", "prevention", and "aromatase inhibitor". Only one other prevention trial using an aromatase inhibitor had been reported and it has been discussed. However, we identified several adjuvant trials using aromatase inhibitors in which contralateral tumours were reported. We also identified an overview of selective oestrogen receptor modulators for breast cancer prevention. Two large trials in which aromatase inhibitors are being assessed for prevention of ductal carcinoma were also identified. For this Article, we repeated the search up to Oct 30, 2019. A US Preventive Services Task Force review was found, but no new studies on breast cancer prevention with aromatase inhibitors were identified.

Added value of this study

We report results of the randomised IBIS-II trial on the extended duration of benefit of anastrozole in preventing breast cancer up to 12 years after entry and indicate for the first time a long-term benefit, which is larger than that seen for tamoxifen in this period. No excess of fractures, other cancers, cardiovascular disease, or death from any specific cause was seen in the extended follow-up. The number needed to treat to prevent one breast cancer has been reduced to 29.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our results provide additional support for the use of anastrozole as the treatment of choice for breast cancer risk reduction in most postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Its use has been supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK and the US Preventive Services Task Force. Identification of women at high risk of early symptoms of oestrogen depletion and their management remains a challenge.

A long-term term reduction of breast cancer incidence for anastrozole or any aromatase inhibitor has not been established, as it has for tamoxifen. Such a result is likely to substantially improve the benefit-risk ratio, as side-effects are uncommon after treatment cessation. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term efficacy of anastrozole for preventing breast cancer (both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ) in the post-treatment period.

Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial

This phase III multinational, randomised, double-blind trial initially comprised 9366 PMW with breast cancer. It compared anastrozole alone or in combination with tamoxifen with tamoxifen monotherapy following breast cancer surgery. Combination therapy was not significantly more beneficial than tamoxifen alone, so the combination arm was terminated early, leaving further analyses limited to 6241 patients. At a median follow-up of 68 months, treatment with anastrozole in HR+ patients revealed a significant benefit in disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.94; P = 0.005) and time to recurrence (TTR) (HR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64–0.87; P = 0.0002). However, there was no significant improvement in time to distant recurrence (TTDR; HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70–1.00; P = 0.06) or overall survival (OS; HR = 0.97) in the relevant HR+ patient population. At 100 months of follow-up, investigators observed a significant benefit in TTDR (risk of distant metastasis (DM)) in HR+ patients receiving anastrozole (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72–0.97, P = 0.022). Anastrozole also continued to provide a significant benefit in DFS (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76–0.94; P = 0.003) and TTR (HR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.67–0.87; P = 0.0001). Although there were improvements in DFS, there was still no OS benefit for anastrozole vs tamoxifen (472 vs 477 events, respectively; HR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.86–1.11; P = 0.7). The key efficacy endpoints of the ATAC trial across treatment settings are summarised in Table 2.

14.1 Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women

A multicenter, double-blind trial (ATAC) randomized 9,366 postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer to adjuvant treatment with anastrozole 1 mg daily, tamoxifen 20 mg daily, or a combination of the two treatments for five years or until recurrence of the disease.

The primary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival (i.e., time to occurrence of a distant or local recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer or death from any cause). Secondary endpoints of the trial included distant disease-free survival, the incidence of contralateral breast cancer and overall survival. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of anastrozole and tamoxifen did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with tamoxifen in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor positive subpopulation. This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial. Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the ATAC trial, tamoxifen should not be administered with anastrozole [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.].

Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar among the three treatment groups (see Table 7).

Table 7 - Demographic and Baseline Characteristics for ATAC Trial

Patients in the two monotherapy arms of the ATAC trial were treated for a median of 60 months (5 years) and followed for a median of 68 months. Disease-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was statistically significantly improved [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97, p = 0.0127] in the Anastrozole arm compared to the tamoxifen arm. In the hormone receptor-positive subpopulation representing about 84% of the trial patients, disease-free survival was also statistically significantly improved (HR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.94, p = 0.0049) in the anastrozole arm compared to the tamoxifen arm.

### The potency and clinical efficacy of aromatase inhibitors across the breast cancer continuum [^116f9zGr]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

aromatase inhibition — state of the art and way forward

Recent head-to-head data from BIG 1–98 comparing sequential treatment with monotherapy, combined with findings in the ATAC and BIG 1–98 trials that treatment with an aromatase inhibitor reduces relapses compared with tamoxifen during the first 2 years of treatment, advocate using an aromatase inhibitor upfront. While no difference in outcome was recorded between patients receiving letrozole monotherapy, and those receiving letrozole initially then switching to tamoxifen after 2 years, these data need to be interpreted carefully due to the limited duration of follow-up from the time of switching. While previous data revealed no benefit of extending tamoxifen treatment beyond 5 years in the adjuvant setting, we do not know the optimal duration of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or whether switching to tamoxifen or perhaps even estrogen treatment after a certain time period may be beneficial.

Regarding estrogen suppression, similar to what has been recorded with tamoxifen, there is reason to believe that many tumors developing acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors may still be sensitive to endocrine manipulation. Based on experimental evidence, suggesting that long-term estrogen deprivation may sensitize breast cancer cells to estrogen stimulation, we implemented treatment with diethylstilbestrol for patients developing resistance to aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting. Thirty percent of patients achieved an objective response, suggesting the potential of sequential endocrine manipulation of hormone-sensitive tumor cells.

An important question is whether one aromatase inhibitor may provide an advantage over the others. Comparing the two nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole, there is substantial evidence that letrozole causes more potent in vivo aromatase inhibition and plasma and tissue estrogen suppression. While data in the second-line metastatic setting are not straightforward, notably the one randomized study comparing letrozole versus anastrozole showed no significant differences in time to progression, the primary end point. However, letrozole was significantly superior to anastrozole in overall response rate (ORR, secondary end point) and for the two predefined covariates (visceral metastasis and ER status). No differences in ORR were shown between anastrozole and letrozole for ER-positive patients.

### Aromatase inhibitors: current indications and future prospects for treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer [^113d6NDk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2004). Low credibility.

This article provides a comprehensive review of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for geriatricians, because it appears that more elderly women will be using these drugs in the near future. Computerized literature searches of Medline were conducted through May 2003. Key words/phrases included in the literature searches were aromatase inhibitors, estrogen, and breast cancer. Limits included English language, age 65 and older, and female sex. All relevant articles were selected and reviewed. AIs suppress intratumoral and plasma estrogen levels significantly. Third-generation AIs have excellent pharmacological profiles, with no significant drug interactions and better tolerability. These drugs have shown superiority compared with conventional therapies. The results of anastrozole, tamoxifen, and combination trials favors anastrozole over tamoxifen for adjuvant treatment, but further follow-up is required. AIs are approved for the treatment of advanced metastatic breast cancer (BC) in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed during tamoxifen therapy. Recent trials have shown that the highly selective third-generation AIs are effective when used as first-line therapy in metastatic BC. Their possible use in preventive, adjuvant, and neoadjuvant settings is also being explored.

14.2 First-Line Therapy in Postmenopausal Women with Advanced Breast Cancer

Two double-blind, controlled clinical studies of similar design (0030, a North American study and 0027, a predominately European study) were conducted to assess the efficacy of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen as first-line therapy for hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. A total of 1,021 patients between the ages of 30 and 92 years old were randomized to receive trial treatment. Patients were randomized to receive 1 mg of anastrozole once daily or 20 mg of tamoxifen once daily. The primary endpoints for both trials were time to tumor progression, objective tumor response rate, and safety.

Demographics and other baseline characteristics, including patients who had measurable and no measurable disease, patients who were given previous adjuvant therapy, the site of metastatic disease and ethnic origin were similar for the two treatment groups for both trials. The following table summarizes the hormone receptor status at entry for all randomized patients in trials 0030 and 0027.

Table 11 — Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics

For the primary endpoints, trial 0030 showed that anastrozole had a statistically significant advantage over tamoxifen (p = 0.006) for time to tumor progression; objective tumor response rates were similar for anastrozole and tamoxifen. Trial 0027 showed that anastrozole and tamoxifen had similar objective tumor response rates and time to tumor progression (see Table 12 and Figures 5 and 6).

Table 12 below summarizes the results of trial 0030 and trial 0027 for the primary efficacy endpoints.

Figure 6 - Kaplan-Meier probability of time to progression for all randomized patients (intent-to-treat) in Trial 0027

Results from the secondary endpoints were supportive of the results of the primary efficacy endpoints. There were too few deaths occurring across treatment groups of both trials to draw conclusions on overall survival differences.

### Postoperative adjuvant anastrozole for 10 or 5 years in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: AERAS, a randomized multicenter open-label phase III trial [^114WuEP7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years is the standard treatment for postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. We investigated the effects of extending this treatment to 10 years on disease-free survival (DFS).

Patients and Methods

This prospective, randomized, multicenter open-label phase III study assessed the effect of extending anastrozole treatment for an additional 5 years in postmenopausal patients who were disease-free after treatment with either 5 years of anastrozole alone or 2–3 years of tamoxifen followed by 2–3 years of anastrozole. Patients were allocated randomly (1:1) to continue anastrozole for an additional 5 years or stop anastrozole. The primary end point was DFS, including breast cancer recurrence, second primary cancers, and death from any cause. This study is registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network, Japan (UMIN) clinical trials registry (UMIN000000818).

Results

We enrolled 1,697 patients from 117 facilities between November 2007 and November 2012. Follow-up information was available for 1,593 patients (n = 787 in the continue group, n = 806 in the stop group), who were defined as the full analysis set, including 144 patients previously treated with tamoxifen and 259 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery without irradiation. The 5-year DFS rates were 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) in the continue group and 86% (95% CI, 83 to 88) in the stop group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.82; P < .0010). Notably, extended anastrozole treatment reduced the incidence of local recurrence (continue group, n = 10; stop group, n = 27) and second primary cancers (continue group, n = 27; stop group, n = 52). There was no significant difference in overall or distant DFS. Menopausal or bone-related all-grade adverse events were more frequent among patients in the continue group than those in the stop group, but the incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events was < 1% in both groups.

Conclusion

Continuing adjuvant anastrozole for an additional 5 years after 5 years of initial treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen followed by anastrozole was well tolerated and improved DFS. Although no difference in overall survival was observed as in other trials, extended anastrozole therapy could be one treatment choice in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

14.1 Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women

A multicenter, double-blind trial (ATAC) randomized 9,366 postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer to adjuvant treatment with anastrozole tablets 1 mg daily, tamoxifen 20 mg daily, or a combination of the two treatments for five years or until recurrence of the disease.

The primary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival (i.e., time to occurrence of a distant or local recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer or death from any cause). Secondary endpoints of the trial included distant disease-free survival, the incidence of contralateral breast cancer and overall survival. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of anastrozole tablets and tamoxifen did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with tamoxifen in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor positive subpopulation.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^1155Wk9W]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to these findings, the Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen trial did not find any significant benefit with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen. Postmenopausal women with ER+ invasive breast cancer were randomised to one of three treatment groups: neoadjuvant anastrozole (n = 113), tamoxifen (n = 108), or anastrozole plus tamoxifen (n = 109) (2005). There were no significant differences in clinical objective response rates (caliper) across treatment groups (P = 0.87; anastrozole vs tamoxifen).

The outcome of patients in need of neoadjuvant therapy may also be altered by the frequency of complete pathological responses during therapy with an AI. Although complete pathological responses have been observed in a study published by Dixon et al, these were not found in the corresponding group of patients treated with anastrozole.

Breast cancer — aromatase inhibitor (AI) use and comparative evidence: In postmenopausal early-stage disease, studies have used AIs as initial adjuvant therapy, as sequential therapy following 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen, or as extended therapy following 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen; AIs are not active in patients with functioning ovaries and should not be used when ovarian function cannot be reliably assessed owing to treatment-induced amenorrhea. Two prospective randomized trials provided evidence of an overall survival (OS) benefit for initial tamoxifen followed sequentially by anastrozole (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28–0.99; P = 0.045) or exemestane (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.00; P = 0.05 [excluding patients with ER-negative disease]) compared with tamoxifen alone. The NCIC-CTG MA-17 trial demonstrated a survival advantage with extended letrozole versus placebo in ALN-positive (but not lymph node-negative), ER-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen and AIs have different side-effect profiles: both contribute to hot flashes and night sweats and may cause vaginal dryness; AIs are more commonly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased rate of bone fracture, whereas tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk for uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis. The ATAC trial demonstrated that anastrozole is superior to tamoxifen or the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole for adjuvant endocrine therapy of postmenopausal patients with HR-positive breast cancer.

### Effect of anastrozole and tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer: 100-month analysis of the ATAC trial [^116Ja4p4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

Little data exist on whether efficacy benefits or side-effects persist after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. We aimed to study long-term outcomes in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial that compares anastrozole with tamoxifen after a median follow-up of 100 months.

Methods

We analysed postmenopausal women with localised invasive breast cancer. The primary endpoint disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints time to recurrence (TTR), incidence of new contralateral breast cancer (CLBC), time to distant recurrence (TTDR), overall survival (OS), and death after recurrence were assessed in the total population (intention to treat; ITT: anastrozole, n = 3125; tamoxifen, n = 3116; total 6241) and the hormone-receptor-positive subpopulation, the clinically important subgroup for which endocrine treatment is now known to be effective (84% of ITT: anastrozole, n = 2618; tamoxifen, n = 2598; total 5216). After treatment completion, fractures and serious adverse events continued to be collected blindly (safety population: anastrozole, n = 3092; tamoxifen, n = 3094; total 6186). This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN18233230.

Findings

At a median follow-up of 100 months (range 0–126), DFS, TTR, TTDR, and CLBC were improved significantly in the ITT and hormone-receptor-positive populations. For hormone-receptor-positive patients: DFS hazard ratio (HR) 0.85 (95% CI 0.76–0.94), p = 0.003; TTR HR 0.76 (0.67–0.87), p = 0.0001; TTDR HR 0.84 (0.72–0.97), p = 0.022; and CLBC HR 0.60 (0.42–0.85), p = 0.004. Absolute differences in time to recurrence increased over time (TTR 2.8% [anastrozole 9.7%vs tamoxifen 12.5%] at 5 years and 4.8% [anastrozole 17.0%vs tamoxifen 21.8%] at 9 years) and recurrence rates remained significantly lower on anastrozole compared with tamoxifen after treatment completion (HR 0.75 [0.61–0.94], p = 0.01). The fewer deaths after recurrence (anastrozole 245 vs tamoxifen 269) was not significant (HR 0.90 [0.75–1.07], p = 0.2), and no effect was noted for OS (anastrozole 472 vs tamoxifen 477) HR 0.97 [0.86–1.11], p = 0.7). Fracture rates were higher in patients receiving anastrozole than in those receiving tamoxifen during active treatment (number [annual rate]: 375 [2.93%] vs 234 [1.90%]; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.55 [1.31–1.83], p < 0.0001), but were not different after treatment was completed (off treatment: 146 [1.56%] vs 143 [1.51%]; IRR 1.03 [0.81–1.31], p = 0.79). We did not note any significant difference in risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality between anastrozole and tamoxifen treatment groups.

Interpretation

These data show long-term safety findings and establish clearly the long-term efficacy of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen as initial adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive, early breast cancer, and provide statistically significant evidence of a larger carryover effect after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen.

Future directions

There are accumulating data that anastrozole results in IES in a substantial proportion of patients. Further study is required to validate the proper threshold for estrogen suppression in patients taking anastrozole across the spectrum of prevention, (neo)adjuvant, and metastatic breast cancer settings. In line with this, additional research is needed to determine the best approach to managing patients with IES, either by increasing the dose of anastrozole or switching to a different AI, and whether these approaches are associated with better suppression of tumor proliferation and growth and/or lead to a decrease in breast cancer recurrence.

### Off-treatment bone mineral density changes in postmenopausal women receiving anastrozole for 5 years: 7-year results from the IBIS-II prevention trial [^115ADzDY]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

A strength of this study is that this is the only analysis looking at the off-treatment effects on BMD changes in the breast cancer prevention setting. We included a large proportion of women with normal BMD or osteopenia, with long-term follow-up (7 years). Women included in this analysis come from a large prevention study with excellent clinical records and good quality controls for DXAs. For the primary objective, only women who were either randomised to or did not receive risedronate were included. Limitations of our study include that we did not have a complete DXA data set for all follow-up timepoints (for our primary analysis set 509/1008 (50.5%)). The main reason for noncomplete datasets were withdrawal from the main study in most cases due to anastrozole-related side effects. However, we only included women in this analysis who had a full set of DXA scans (baseline, 5 and 7 years) and hence all women finished their allocated treatment. Therefore anastrozole-induced BMD changes during this time period are the true effect and no selection bias was introduced. A small number of women were treated with bisphosphonates after 5 years, but we cannot be sure whether this represents the true number of women who have taken a bisphosphonate and therefore this may introduce some bias.

In conclusion, this study is the first to quantify the long-term impact on BMD in women at increased risk of developing breast cancer. Bone loss associated with anastrozole use is partially reversible after stopping treatment, particularly at the lumbar spine. For patients who have been given risedronate for osteoporosis prevention, bone mineral density improved only at the lumbar spine but not the total hip. Anastrozole-related bone loss seems to be manageable and any risk to bone health should be weighed against overall efficacy and tolerability for the preventive treatment of at high-risk women.

Anastrozole

Anastrozole has shown clear advantages over megestrol acetate as second-line therapy for advanced breast cancer and to be at least as good as tamoxifen for first-line therapy. It is also being used increasingly in the adjuvant setting. Preliminary results from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial have been published. The study included over 9000 postmenopausal patients who had completed primary therapy for breast cancer and who were eligible for endocrine therapy. Patients were randomised equally between anastrozole, tamoxifen or a combination of both. Results published after a median follow-up of 33.3 months found that anastrozole improved disease-free survival, time to disease recurrence and incidence of contralateral primary breast cancer compared with both tamoxifen and the combination of drugs. Updated results confirmed these early observations.

From the perspective of adverse events, anastrozole was better tolerated except for the occurrence of musculoskeletal side effects and the incidence of fractures, mainly of the spine and wrist. After a median follow-up of 37 months, the incidence of all fractures was 7.1% in the anastrozole group and 4.4% in the tamoxifen group (P < 0.0001) (Table 2). Although the fracture rate in anastrozole-treated women appeared to plateau after around 18 months, with no progressive increase in fracture risk (Table 3), the increased fracture risk seen in the anastrozole patients still remained significant (P < 0.0001). The fracture rate per 1000 women years was 21.55 with anastrozole compared with 13.44 with tamoxifen. A population of healthy women of similar median age would be expected to have a fracture rate per 1000 women years of 19.10.

The bone subprotocol of the ATAC trial investigated 308 patients and assessed them for any changes in BMD and bone turnover markers. After 2 years treatment with anastrozole, the BMD had fallen on average by 4.0% in the lumbar spine and 3.2% in the hip. There was also a 15% increase in the bone resorption marker N-terminal telopeptide (NTX) and a 21% increase in bone alkaline phosphatase, a bone formation marker. At this early stage, this is clear evidence that anastrozole reduces BMD in postmenopausal women and does not have the bone protective effects of tamoxifen.

### Aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen in early breast cancer: patient-level meta-analysis of the randomised trials [^1117JPx1]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal ways of using aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen as endocrine treatment for early breast cancer remains uncertain.

Methods

We undertook meta-analyses of individual data on 31,920 postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive early breast cancer in the randomised trials of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 5 years of tamoxifen; of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 2–3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5; and of 2–3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5 versus 5 years of tamoxifen. Primary outcomes were any recurrence of breast cancer, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, and trial, yielded aromatase inhibitor versus tamoxifen first-event rate ratios (RRs).

Findings

In the comparison of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 5 years of tamoxifen, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors significantly during years 0–1 (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52–0.78) and 2–4 (RR 0.80, 0.68–0.93), and non-significantly thereafter. 10-year breast cancer mortality was lower with aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen (12.1% vs 14.2%; RR 0.85, 0.75–0.96; 2p = 0.009). In the comparison of 5 years of aromatase inhibitor versus 2–3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors significantly during years 0–1 (RR 0.74, 0.62–0.89) but not while both groups received aromatase inhibitors during years 2–4, or thereafter; overall in these trials, there were fewer recurrences with 5 years of aromatase inhibitors than with tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitors (RR 0.90, 0.81–0.99; 2p = 0.045), though the breast cancer mortality reduction was not significant (RR 0.89, 0.78–1.03; 2p = 0.11). In the comparison of 2–3 years of tamoxifen then aromatase inhibitor to year 5 versus 5 years of tamoxifen, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors significantly during years 2–4 (RR 0.56, 0.46–0.67) but not subsequently, and 10-year breast cancer mortality was lower with switching to aromatase inhibitors than with remaining on tamoxifen (8.7% vs 10.1%; 2p = 0.015). Aggregating all three types of comparison, recurrence RRs favoured aromatase inhibitors during periods when treatments differed (RR 0.70, 0.64–0.77), but not significantly thereafter (RR 0.93, 0.86–1.01; 2p = 0.08). Breast cancer mortality was reduced both while treatments differed (RR 0.79, 0.67–0.92), and subsequently (RR 0.89, 0.81–0.99), and for all periods combined (RR 0.86, 0.80–0.94; 2p = 0.0005). All-cause mortality was also reduced (RR 0.88, 0.82–0.94; 2p = 0.0003). RRs differed little by age, body-mass index, stage, grade, progesterone receptor status, or HER2 status. There were fewer endometrial cancers with aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen (10-year incidence 0.4% vs 1.2%; RR 0.33, 0.21–0.51) but more bone fractures (5-year risk 8.2% vs 5.5%; RR 1.42, 1.28–1.57); non-breast-cancer mortality was similar.

Interpretation

Aromatase inhibitors reduce recurrence rates by about 30% (proportionately) compared with tamoxifen while treatments differ, but not thereafter. 5 years of an aromatase inhibitor reduces 10-year breast cancer mortality rates by about 15% compared with 5 years of tamoxifen, hence by about 40% (proportionately) compared with no endocrine treatment.

### Switching to anastrozole versus continued tamoxifen treatment of early breast cancer. updated results of the Italian tamoxifen anastrozole (ITA) trial [^111BPRuF]. Annals of Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tamoxifen, for many years the 'gold standard' in the adjuvant setting for the management of endocrine sensitive early breast cancer, is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and other life-threatening events. Moreover, many women relapse during or after tamoxifen therapy due to the development of resistance. This provided the rationale for a switching trial with anastrozole, the updated results of which are reported here.

Patients and Methods

This trial investigated the efficacy of switching to anastrozole for women already receiving tamoxifen. After 2–3 years of tamoxifen treatment, postmenopausal, node-positive, ER-positive patients were randomized to receive either anastrozole 1 mg/day or to continue tamoxifen, 20 mg/day, giving a total duration of 5-years treatment. The primary end point was disease-free survival and secondary endpoints were event-free survival, overall survival and safety.

Results

A total of 448 patients were enrolled. At a median follow-up time of 64 months (range 12–93), 63 events had been reported in the tamoxifen group compared with 39 in the anastrozole group [HR 0.57 (95% CI 0.38–0.85) P = 0.005]. Relapse-free and overall survival were also longer in the anastrozole group [HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.35–0.89) P = 0.01 and 0.56 (95% CI 0.28–1.15) P = 0.1]. However, the latter difference was not statistically significant. Overall more patients in the anastrozole group experienced at least one adverse event (209 versus 151: P = 0.000). However, numbers of patients experiencing serious adverse events were comparable (37 versus 40, respectively: P = 0.7).

Conclusions

Switching to anastrozole after the first 2–3 years of treatment was confirmed to improve event-free and relapse-free survival of postmenopausal, node-positive, ER-positive early breast cancer patients already receiving adjuvant tamoxifen.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Clinical studies in pediatric patients included a placebo-controlled trial in pubertal boys of adolescent age with gynecomastia and a single-arm trial in girls with McCune-Albright Syndrome and progressive precocious puberty. The efficacy of anastrozole in the treatment of pubertal gynecomastia in adolescent boys and in the treatment of precocious puberty in girls with McCune-Albright Syndrome has not been demonstrated.

Gynecomastia Study

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study enrolled 80 boys with pubertal gynecomastia aged 11 to 18 years. Patients were randomized to a daily regimen of either anastrozole 1 mg or placebo. After 6 months of treatment there was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of patients who experienced a ≥ 50% reduction in gynecomastia (primary efficacy analysis). Secondary efficacy analyses (absolute change in breast volume, the percentage of patients who had any reduction in the calculated volume of gynecomastia, breast pain resolution) were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis. Serum estradiol concentrations at Month 6 of treatment were reduced by 15.4% in the anastrozole group and 4.5% in the placebo group.

Adverse reactions that were assessed as treatment-related by the investigators occurred in 16.3% of the anastrozole-treated patients and 8.1% of the placebo-treated patients with the most frequent being acne (7% anastrozole and 2.7% placebo) and headache (7% anastrozole and 0% placebo); all other adverse reactions showed small differences between treatment groups. One patient treated with anastrozole discontinued the trial because of testicular enlargement. The mean baseline-subtracted change in testicular volume after 6 months of treatment was + 6.6 ± 7.9 cm3in the anastrozole-treated patients and + 5.2 ± 8.0 cm3in the placebo group.

14.2 First-Line Therapy in Postmenopausal Women with Advanced Breast Cancer

Two double-blind, controlled clinical studies of similar design (0030, a North American study and 0027, a predominately European study) were conducted to assess the efficacy of anastrozole tablets compared with tamoxifen as first-line therapy for hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. A total of 1021 patients between the ages of 30 and 92 years old were randomized to receive trial treatment. Patients were randomized to receive 1 mg of anastrozole tablets once daily or 20 mg of tamoxifen once daily. The primary endpoints for both trials were time to tumor progression, objective tumor response rate, and safety.

Demographics and other baseline characteristics, including patients who had measurable and no measurable disease, patients who were given previous adjuvant therapy, the site of metastatic disease and ethnic origin were similar for the two treatment groups for both trials. The following table summarizes the hormone receptor status at entry for all randomized patients in trials 0030 and 0027.

For the primary endpoints, trial 0030 showed that anastrozole tablets had a statistically significant advantage over tamoxifen (p = 0.006) for time to tumor progression; objective tumor response rates were similar for anastrozole tablets and tamoxifen. Trial 0027 showed that anastrozole tablets and tamoxifen had similar objective tumor response rates and time to tumor progression (see Table 12 and Figures 5 and 6).

Table 12 below summarizes the results of trial 0030 and trial 0027 for the primary efficacy endpoints.

Results from the secondary endpoints were supportive of the results of the primary efficacy endpoints. There were too few deaths occurring across treatment groups of both trials to draw conclusions on overall survival differences.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1172tDwu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

### Should aromatase inhibitors be used as initial adjuvant treatment or sequenced after tamoxifen? [^112UdGLt]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

A number of trials have studied the value of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for the adjuvant treatment of early hormone-responsive postmenopausal breast cancer. Three different AIs have been used and they have been compared as initial treatment (two trials) or after 2–3 years of tamoxifen (four trials), in both cases against a standard arm of 5 years of tamoxifen. In addition, two trials have evaluated AIs against no treatment after 5 years of tamoxifen. In all circumstances, the AIs have demonstrated superior efficacy. However, no results are currently available for the key question, that is - is it better to start initially with an AI or use it sequentially after 2 years of tamoxifen? Here, we review the trial results and present two models, which address this issue. The models clearly show that early treatment with an AI is superior to using it after 5 years of tamoxifen. They also favour an upfront strategy to sequencing after 2 years of tamoxifen, but in this case the differences are small and model-dependent. A key question is whether AIs have substantially better efficacy than tamoxifen for ER-positive-PgR-negative tumours, where the data are currently contradictory. A mechanism explaining why greater efficacy might be so is proposed. Further results from ongoing trials will be needed to resolve this issue.

### Sequencing of aromatase inhibitors [^111KN6iW]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

SELECTION OF THE OPTIMAL SEQUENCE OF AIs

If sequential application of AIs enables prolonged hormonal treatment, in which order should these agents be given? The main choice would appear to be whether to give a steroidal AI before a nonsteroidal AI, or vice versa. As yet, clear clinical differences between these two types have not emerged, nor is it known whether their efficacy varies in different patient groups. There may, however, be differences in side effect profiles between the steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs, which may become clearer with further clinical trial results. The main adverse events are hot flushes, gastrointestinal (e.g. nausea and vomiting) and musculoskeletal events. In addition, effects have been reported on bone density, lipid levels and thromboembolic events with hormonal treatments. In the ATAC trial, there was a significantly lower incidence of hot flushes, vaginal bleeding and discharge and venous thromboembolism with anastrozole than tamoxifen, but anastrozole was associated with more musculoskeletal symptoms and fractures. In addition, letrozole has been associated with an increase in bone-resorption markers in plasma and urine. By contrast, early results from animal models and postmenopausal volunteers suggest the steroidal AI, exemestane, may have a bone-sparing effect compared with nonsteroidal agents. There is also evidence that exemestane does not adversely affect blood lipids, whereas this may not be the case with the nonsteroidal AIs. More discussion of effects on bone and lipids is presented elsewhere in the supplement.

The current practice is to use anastrozole or letrozole before exemestane. This is based on the magnitude of the available database and clinical experience with anastrozole and letrozole compared with exemestane. Some evidence, however, suggests that the opposite sequence is equally valid.

14.1 Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women

A multicenter, double-blind trial (ATAC) randomized 9,366 postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer to adjuvant treatment with ARIMIDEX 1 mg daily, tamoxifen 20 mg daily, or a combination of the two treatments for five years or until recurrence of the disease.

The primary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival (i.e., time to occurrence of a distant or local recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer or death from any cause). Secondary endpoints of the trial included distant disease-free survival, the incidence of contralateral breast cancer and overall survival. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of ARIMIDEX and tamoxifen did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with tamoxifen in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor positive subpopulation. This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial. Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the ATAC trial, tamoxifen should not be administered with anastrozole [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar among the three treatment groups (see Table 7).

Patients in the two monotherapy arms of the ATAC trial were treated for a median of 60 months (5 years) and followed for a median of 68 months. Disease-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was statistically significantly improved [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97, p = 0.0127] in the ARIMIDEX arm compared to the tamoxifen arm. In the hormone receptor-positive subpopulation representing about 84% of the trial patients, disease-free survival was also statistically significantly improved (HR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.94, p = 0.0049) in the ARIMIDEX arm compared to the tamoxifen arm.

### Combination anastrozole and fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer [^112W3F9R]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aromatase inhibitor anastrozole inhibits estrogen synthesis. Fulvestrant binds and accelerates degradation of estrogen receptors. We hypothesized that these two agents in combination might be more effective than anastrozole alone in patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Methods

Postmenopausal women with previously untreated metastatic disease were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either 1 mg of anastrozole orally every day (group 1), with crossover to fulvestrant alone strongly encouraged if the disease progressed, or anastrozole and fulvestrant in combination (group 2). Patients were stratified according to prior or no prior receipt of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Fulvestrant was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 14 and 28 and monthly thereafter. The primary end point was progression-free survival, with overall survival designated as a prespecified secondary outcome.

Results

The median progression-free survival was 13.5 months in group 1 and 15.0 months in group 2 (hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.94; P = 0.007 by the log-rank test). The combination therapy was generally more effective than anastrozole alone in all subgroups, with no significant interactions. Overall survival was also longer with combination therapy (median, 41.3 months in group 1 and 47.7 months in group 2; hazard ratio for death, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.00; P = 0.05 by the log-rank test), despite the fact that 41% of the patients in group 1 crossed over to fulvestrant after progression. Three deaths that were possibly associated with treatment occurred in group 2. The rates of grade 3 to 5 toxic effects did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

The combination of anastrozole and fulvestrant was superior to anastrozole alone or sequential anastrozole and fulvestrant for the treatment of HR-positive metastatic breast cancer, despite the use of a dose of fulvestrant that was below the current standard.

### Should aromatase inhibitors be used as initial adjuvant treatment or sequenced after tamoxifen? [^113ngckV]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

METHODS

End points

Several end points could be used in evaluating the different strategies. Recurrence is the most sensitive endpoint for evaluating efficacy, and includes distant recurrence, local recurrence and contralateral tumours. This is preferable to disease-free survival (DFS), which would also include intercurrent deaths without recurrence. These latter events rightfully belong in the safety or overall analysis, but are not relevant for efficacy, where they dilute real differences in efficacy with events unrelated to breast cancer. Using only distant recurrences would provide a better surrogate for death from breast cancer, but their use requires longer follow-up, and it is too early to use this end point at this stage.

The use of recurrence rates gives equal weight to early and late recurrences. It is clear that an early recurrence is more detrimental than a late one, and integrating the recurrence curves to give the per cent of 'time lost to recurrence' is probably the best summary measure of efficacy in this context. Thus a recurrence at year 1 would lose 90% of the first 10 years to recurrence, but a recurrence at year 9 would only lose 10%. For a 10-year window, the actual number of years lost is just the percentage multiplied by 10, and this gives a useful measure for comparing strategies. We will evaluate both measures, but focus on this latter outcome measure below.

Carryover

One key question is how long the effect will be maintained after treatment is stopped. The EBCTCG overview has shown that the effect of tamoxifen on recurrence is maintained for about 5 years after stopping 5 years of treatment. The only data on AIs come from the ATAC trial where the same magnitude of reduction was seen in year 6 as in previous years.

Carryover is a consequence of curing a proportion of patients, and not simply holding tumours in check. If treatment is curative, then all future recurrences are prevented, so the hazard ratio will remain below unity even after treatment has stopped. This is expected for chemotherapy, but the long-term results from the overview strongly suggest that tamoxifen is also curing a proportion of patients, and that its action is more than cytostatic. A reasonable assumption is that the early superiority of AIs over tamoxifen will result in a higher cure rate and that the reduction in recurrence rates will also be maintained for 5 years after the treatment ceases. This assumption is used in our base case model. However, given the importance of this parameter and the paucity of data, models with a 2-year carryover are also evaluated.

### Fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg for the first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer: overall survival analysis from the phase II FIRST study [^1129Khk2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The primary study end point was clinical benefit rate; secondary end points included objective response rate, TTP, duration of clinical benefit, and duration of response. These primary and secondary end points have been reported previously.

The follow-up analysis assessed OS, defined as the time from being randomly assigned to death from any cause. A log-rank test (unadjusted model with treatment factor only) was performed for the primary analysis of OS. HRs with 95% CIs were used to compare fulvestrant 500 mg with anastrozole; no adjustments were made for multiplicity. A statistical significance level of.05 was used to indicate a difference in OS between the treatment groups. For patients for whom follow-up responses could not be obtained, data were censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive.

Exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted using the log-rank test to compare OS for the following prespecified patient subgroups: less than 65 years of age versus 65 years of age or greater; not positive for both ER and progesterone receptor versus positive for both ER and progesterone receptor; no visceral involvement versus visceral involvement; no previous chemotherapy versus previous adjuvant chemotherapy; no measurable disease versus measurable disease; and no previous endocrine therapy versus previous endocrine therapy.

Two sensitivity analyses were performed to examine any potential impact of nonparticipation on OS results: a Kaplan-Meier OS analysis was performed in which the censoring indicator was reversed; and baseline covariates were assessed for patients censored greater than 3 months before data cutoff and for those censored 3 months or less before data cutoff, which corresponds to patients who did not participate in the OS follow-up and to those who did, respectively.

Tolerability was assessed by serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring. All SAEs were coded in compliance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and recorded in an internal AstraZeneca database for evaluation. SAEs were monitored for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of fulvestrant 500 mg or for 30 days after the last dose of anastrozole.

### Aromatase inhibitors and fracture prevention-do 2017 guidelines work in real world? [^111EsLNu]. BJC Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of breast cancer has been steadily rising and represents the most common cancer in women. Over two million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide every year. This accounts for over 30% of female neoplasms. Lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in women has been shown to be nearly one in eight with the 5-year overall survival estimated to be 80% or higher in high-income countries.

Early diagnosis and the employment of efficacious personalised treatments such as endocrine therapies have conferred significant mortality benefit. Considering 80% of breast cancers are oestrogen receptor positive in women aged over fifty years, this makes drugs such as aromatase inhibitors (AIs) a highly attractive option. Both steroidal (exemestane) and non-steroidal (anastrozole and letrozole) AIs achieve over 98% aromatase inhibition in post-menopausal women with 80–90% resultant drop in peripheral oestradiol level. This is crucial in delivering improved survival for these patients.

Whilst conveying major benefits, the oestrogen deficiency induced by AIs leads to a significant increase in bone resorption and accelerated bone loss, especially at the trabecular bones. The effects of adjuvant therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) have been quantified by several studies that have reported an annual bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women of 1–2% per year, while AIs therapy alone causes 2–3% BMD loss per year, greater during the first year, and progressively lower in the following years. This translates into higher fracture risk with up to one in five women prescribed AIs reported to sustain a clinical fracture and nearly a third with incident vertebral fracture on morphometric analysis.

To address the AIs associated bone health concerns, a consensus statement of seven international bone and cancer societies was published in 2017 proposing an algorithm based on clinical risk factors and different BMD threshold for bone active therapeutic intervention. Our study aims to determine the real-world impact of the 2017 consensus guidelines on AIs induced bone loss and whether bone sparing therapy utilising proposed risk stratification model is effective in fracture prevention compared to the 2008 UK recommendations.

### Anastrozole tablets (anastrozole) [^114JmY7b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal women with early breast cancer scheduled to be treated with anastrozole should have their bone status managed according to treatment guidelines already available for postmenopausal women at similar risk of fragility fracture.

Cholesterol

During the ATAC trial, more patients receiving anastrozole were reported to have an elevated serum cholesterol compared to patients receiving tamoxifen (9% versus 3.5%, respectively).

A post-marketing trial also evaluated any potential effects of anastrozole on lipid profile. In the primary analysis population for lipids (anastrozole alone), there was no clinically significant change in LDL-C from baseline to 12 months and HDL-C from baseline to 12 months.

In secondary population for lipids (anastrozole + risedronate), there also was no clinically significant change in LDL-C and HDL-C from baseline to 12 months.

In both populations for lipids, there was no clinically significant difference in total cholesterol (TC) or serum triglycerides (TG) at 12 months compared with baseline.

In this trial, treatment for 12 months with anastrozole alone had a neutral effect on lipid profile. Combination treatment with anastrozole and risedronate also had a neutral effect on lipid profile.

The trial provides evidence that postmenopausal women with early breast cancer scheduled to be treated with anastrozole should be managed using the current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines for cardiovascular risk-based management of individual patients with LDL elevations.

How should I take anastrozole tablets?

- Take anastrozole tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it.

- Continue taking anastrozole tablets until your healthcare provider tells you to stop.

- Anastrozole tablets can be taken with or without food.

- If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Take your next regularly scheduled dose. Do not take two doses at the same time.

If you take too much anastrozole tablets, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

What are the possible side effects of anastrozole tablets?

Anastrozole tablets may cause serious side effects including:

- See " What is the most important information I should know about anastrozole tablets? "

- bone thinning or weakness (osteoporosis). Anastrozole tablets lower estrogen in your body, which may cause your bones to become thinner and weaker. This may increase your risk of fractures, especially of your spine, hip and wrist. Your healthcare provider may order a bone mineral density test before you start and during treatment with anastrozole tablets to check you for bone changes.

- increased blood cholesterol (fat in the blood). Your healthcare provider may do blood tests to check your cholesterol while you are taking anastrozole tablets.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^116p3z3q]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer — aromatase inhibitor (AI) adjuvant strategies and outcomes in postmenopausal patients include use as initial adjuvant therapy, as sequential therapy following 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen, or as extended therapy following 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen, and the AIs are not active in patients with functioning ovaries and should not be used in patients whose ovarian function cannot reliably be assessed owing to treatment-induced amenorrhea. Results from two prospective, randomized trials provided evidence of an OS benefit for patients receiving initial endocrine therapy with tamoxifen followed sequentially by anastrozole (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28–0.99; P = 0.045) or exemestane (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.00; P = 0.05) [excluding patients with ER-negative disease]) when compared with tamoxifen as the only endocrine therapy, and NCIC-CTG MA-17 demonstrated a survival advantage with extended letrozole compared with placebo in patients with ALN-positive (but not lymph node-negative), ER-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen and AIs have different side effect profiles, with AIs more commonly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased rate of bone fracture, while tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk for uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis.

### Neoadjuvant anastrozole versus tamoxifen in patients receiving goserelin for premenopausal breast cancer (STAGE): a double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial [^111WDHNm]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Aromatase inhibitors have shown increased efficacy compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal early breast cancer. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in premenopausal women receiving goserelin for early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.

Methods

In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study, we enrolled premenopausal women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, operable breast cancer with WHO performance status of 2 or lower. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive goserelin 3.6 mg/month plus either anastrozole 1 mg per day and tamoxifen placebo or tamoxifen 20 mg per day and anastrozole placebo for 24 weeks before surgery. Patients were randomised sequentially, stratified by centre, with randomisation codes. All study personnel were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was best overall tumour response (complete response or partial response), assessed by callipers, during the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period for the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was analysed for non-inferiority (with non-inferiority defined as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in overall response rates between groups being 10% or less); in the event of non-inferiority, we assessed the superiority of the anastrozole group versus the tamoxifen group. We included all patients who received study medication at least once in the safety analysis set. We report the primary analysis; treatment will also continue in the adjuvant setting for 5 years. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00605267.

Findings

Between Oct 2, 2007, and May 29, 2009, 204 patients were enrolled. 197 patients were randomly assigned to anastrozole (n = 98) or tamoxifen (n = 99), and 185 patients completed the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period and had breast surgery (95 in the anastrazole group, 90 in the tamoxifen group). More patients in the anastrozole group had a complete or partial response than did those in the tamoxifen group during 24 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment (anastrozole 70.4% [69 of 98 patients] vs tamoxifen 50.5% [50 of 99 patients]; estimated difference between groups 19.9%, 95% CI 6.5–33.3; p = 0.004). Two patients in the anastrozole group had treatment-related grade 3 adverse events (arthralgia and syncope) and so did one patient in the tamoxifen group (depression). One serious adverse event was reported in the anastrozole group (benign neoplasm, not related to treatment), compared with none in the tamoxifen group.

Interpretation

Given its favourable risk-benefit profile, the combination of anastrozole plus goserelin could represent an alternative neoadjuvant treatment option for premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^111dfYrc]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Adverse events (AE) of AI therapy

Because of the extended duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy, patient tolerability issues and their potential influence on compliance and therapeutic outcome are important themes. All in all, third-generation AIs seem to have very similar toxicity profiles. Most side effects are explained by the general estrogen deprivation, predictable and similar to those of natural menopause. They may include hot flashes, arthralgia, osteoporosis, fractures, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular events (see Table 3 for an overview). Side effects like thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer that are well established for antiestrogen therapy, are rarely seen during therapy with aromatase inhibitors. Although novel antiestrogens like raloxifene are less toxic compared with tamoxifen when tested head-to-head in women at increased risk for development of breast cancer, raloxifene has recently been shown to be less effective in preventing breast cancer, too. Although adverse events of third-generation AIs have been reviewed extensively in the available literature, this issue will only be briefly discussed here.

Lipid metabolism and cardiovascular symptoms

Blood cholesterol was comprehensively and systematically measured in the BIG 1–98 trial under non-fasting conditions every 6 months. At a mean follow-up of 25.8 months, there was more hypercholesterolemia in the letrozole arm (43.6, vs 19.2% in the tamoxifen arm), but this AE was predominantly low grade. Importantly, median changes in cholesterol levels remained stable at 6, 12, and 24 months (0, 0, and −1.8%) in the letrozole group but decreased in the tamoxifen group at each assessment (−12.0, −13.5, and −14.1%). These results support a greater lipid-lowering effect of tamoxifen rather than a detrimental effect of letrozole. Safety analysis at a median of 60.5 months confirmed earlier results. Although there was an increased lipid impairment vs tamoxifen, hypercholesterolemia was predominantly of low grade.

In contrast, hypercholesterolemia was not a predefined AE in the ATAC trial; however, results indicated a significantly greater rate of hypercholesterolemia in the anastrozole arm than in the tamoxifen arm (9 vs 3% odds ratio 2.73; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, blood lipids seem to be slightly and equally increased during therapy with all third-generation AIs (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) when compared directly with tamoxifen, because of the lipid-lowering effects of tamoxifen and not because of a lipid-increasing effect of AIs.

### Anastrozole versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer: a prospective, randomized, phase III study [^114thEmv]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

A prospective phase III trial comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal, hormone-dependent, advanced breast cancer (ABC). Patients were randomized to anastrozole 1 mg daily (n = 121) or tamoxifen 40 mg daily (n = 117). Efficacy and tolerability were evaluated after 3 months' therapy, and survival was evaluated at median time of follow-up. At a median follow-up of 13.3 months, clinical benefit (CB) was achieved in 83% and 56% of anastrozole and tamoxifen patients, respectively (p < 0.001); median time to disease progression (TTP) in patients achieving CB was 18.0 months and 7.0 months, respectively, (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.08–0.20, p < 0.01). At data cutoff, 89% of tamoxifen patients had died, compared with 60% of anastrozole patients; median time to death was 17.4 months and 16.0 months, respectively (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.47–0.86, p = 0.003). Therapy was well tolerated in both groups. Anastrozole showed significant advantages over tamoxifen for CB, median TTP in patients gaining CB, and survival. These data further support routine use of anastrozole as first-line treatment for postmenopausal hormone-dependent ABC.

### Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole – of clinical importance? [^111UKfAq]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Influence on distant metastasis

Indirect information from the ATAC and BIG 1–98 trials indicates that differences in clinical efficacy exist between anastrozole and letrozole in the initial adjuvant setting. Both AIs improve DFS compared with tamoxifen in patients with HR+ disease. The most common type of recurrence seen 2 to 3 years post surgery is DM, a well-recognised predictor of breast cancer survival. Only letrozole has been shown to significantly reduce early DM events (30% reduction in the risk of DM at 2 years). A significant reduction in DM events was also seen with anastrozole in HR+ patients but only at 100 months of follow-up. In contrast, exploratory analysis of the ATAC trial confirmed that most of the early benefit with anastrozole was not in the prevention of distant disease; at 2.5 years, there was a 7% benefit in the prevention of DM.

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^1123kX92]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Formulating a view on the relative merits of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and tamoxifen requires an examination of the available evidence regarding four major issues – efficacy, toxicity, tolerability/quality of life and cost. Each of these factors must be considered in the context of three major indications for endocrine treatment – neoadjuvant, adjuvant and advanced disease. While prevention is a fourth potential indication, there are no data yet from prevention trials to discuss. However, the arimidex, tamoxifen alone or in combination (ATAC) trial supports the hypothesis that AIs have chemopreventive properties, and clinical trials are now ongoing. For this review, 'antioestrogen' is synonymous with tamoxifen, because the two other approved antioestrogens either have no comparative data with AIs (toremifene) or published comparisons with AIs were not conducted in the first-line setting (fulvestrant).

### Extended adjuvant aromatase inhibition after sequential endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: follow-up analysis of the randomised phase 3 DATA trial [^115Cqz5Y]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common subtype of breast cancer in women, accounting for 75% of all breast cancers. Although the relative survival has increased over the past decades and is considered rather good, patients remain at risk of recurrence for many years after diagnosis. In patients who received 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy without signs of disease recurrence, the 20-year risk of developing distant recurrences ranged from 13% for patients with T1 disease and no lymph nodes involved to 41% for patients with T2 disease and 4 to 9 nodes involved. Furthermore, more than half of all distant recurrences occurred beyond the first 5 years of endocrine therapy.

Considering the long-term risk of recurrence, several studies have evaluated the use of extended endocrine therapy beyond 5 years of treatment. In patients who received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, extended endocrine therapy with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor resulted in an improved outcome. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors, either upfront or sequentially after 2–3 years of tamoxifen for a total duration of 5 years, have shown to improve 10-year breast cancer and all-cause mortality rates by an average absolute benefit of 2% when compared with 5 years of tamoxifen. However, in patients who already received an aromatase inhibitor as part of the initial 5 years of endocrine therapy, the benefit of extended treatment with an aromatase inhibitor still remained to be elucidated. Therefore, trials investigating the extended use of aromatase inhibitors in this group of patients were initiated.,

One of these studies was the DATA study. In the DATA study, postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer with no signs of disease recurrence after 2–3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen were randomly assigned to either 3 or 6 years of anastrozole treatment. Of 1860 eligible patients, 1660 were disease-free at 3 years after randomisation, corresponding to the moment of treatment divergence. At the primary analysis, the 5-year adapted disease-free survival beyond treatment divergence was 83.1% in the 6-year treatment group and 79.4% in the 3-year treatment group with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–1.02; p = 0.066).

Here, we present the follow-up analysis of the DATA study, which was performed after all patients reached a minimum adapted follow-up of 10 years beyond treatment divergence, corresponding to 13 years beyond date of randomisation and about 15–16 years beyond date of primary breast cancer diagnosis.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal breast cancer [^112SFFHe]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen has a clearly established benefit in postmenopausal women with resected early breast cancer that expresses the estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor. Whereas there is a vast and long experience with tamoxifen, the major focus of clinical trials over the past 6 years has involved the study of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors. Recently published data from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial, which involved only postmenopausal women and is the largest adjuvant trial ever conducted, has demonstrated superior efficacy for anastrozole over tamoxifen alone or in combination with anastrozole. These data have engendered a great deal of discussion as to whether they provide a sufficient basis for changing the standard of practice in terms of choice of agent. Currently, a case can be made that further maturation of the ATAC trial is necessary and that tamoxifen should remain the standard of endocrine adjuvant therapy for most women, with anastrozole being used in those with a contraindication or intolerance to tamoxifen. However, close attention must be paid to new information as it develops not only related to efficacy but also to other end organ effects.

### Anastrozole dose escalation for optimal estrogen suppression in postmenopausal early-stage breast cancer: a prospective trial [^116iWzxL]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

The aromatase inhibitors (AI), including anastrozole, are the most efficacious endocrine therapies for postmenopausal women with breast cancers that express estrogen receptor-α. The pharmacodynamic effect of AI is the inhibition of aromatase, which converts androgen precursors to estrogens [estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2)]. E1 and E2 are therefore logical biomarkers for AI efficacy, and they have been associated with anastrozole efficacy in the prevention and adjuvant settings. In this trial, we found that 30% of women treated with anastrozole had E1 and E2 levels above thresholds previously associated with an elevated risk of early breast cancer recurrence. Importantly, high-dose anastrozole (10 mg/day) led to suppression of E1 and E2 below these thresholds in the majority (76%) of women adherent to therapy. The use of readily available biomarkers (E1 and E2) offers the potential to individualize anastrozole dosing and improve outcomes for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-α–positive breast cancer.
