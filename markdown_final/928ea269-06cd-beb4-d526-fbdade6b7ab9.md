## Question

What causes dimples

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes dimples. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "dimples" are being discussed across medical and aesthetic contexts. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies: congenital/developmental, acquired/traumatic, aesthetic/surgical, and pathological. Next, I will examine representative mechanisms with supporting evidence and note key modifiers like genetics, hormones, and anatomy. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically oriented answer that distinguishes benign from concerning dimples and highlights when evaluation is warranted.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't conflate different entities. "Dimples" in this corpus include facial cheek dimples, congenital skin dimples/pits, cellulite dimples, traumatic or postsurgical depressions, and even retinal "dimples" after ILM peeling; I should keep these distinct because their causes and implications differ substantially, even though they share a surface depression phenotype [^33faa7cf] [^6f81a1b7] [^21115534] [^df98b7ee] [^e886ceb1].

> I will now examine congenital and developmental dimples. Facial cheek dimples are classically due to a fascial defect or aberrant insertion of the buccinator muscle that creates a dermal tether, producing a depression with smiling; this is the anatomical rationale behind surgical dimple creation techniques that suture dermis to muscle, mimicking the natural defect [^33faa7cf] [^b06f0315]. Wait, let me verify the broader congenital skin dimple category: neonatal skin dimples can arise from early fixation of skin with insufficient subcutaneous tissue, intrauterine mechanical factors like persistent big-toenail friction, maternal infections, or metabolic disease; many are benign variants, but some signal syndromic associations or spinal dysraphism risk, so I need to flag red flags such as location, depth, and associated stigmata [^70af2761] [^6f81a1b7] [^10867dd4] [^74d85d76].

> Hold on, I should verify the spinal dysraphism link because it changes management. Simple, low-lying coccygeal dimples are common and usually benign, whereas atypical dimples (large, deep, cranial to the gluteal cleft, multiple, or with other cutaneous anomalies) carry a higher risk of occult spinal dysraphism and warrant ultrasound or MRI evaluation; professional society parameters emphasize these risk features and the low yield of screening for simple dimples [^fb893774] [^ac1d37cc] [^74d85d76].

> Next, I should review acquired and traumatic dimples. Blunt trauma can displace subcutaneous tissue and create a tethered depression; a buried guide suture technique has been described to correct traumatic facial dimples by repositioning and fixing subcutaneous tissue through a concealed incision, reflecting the pathophysiology of soft-tissue loss and adhesion [^df98b7ee]. Let me consider iatrogenic causes too: thread-lift dimpling results from cog or anchor engagement with the dermis or overly superficial placement; most resolve with massage or subcision, but persistent dimpling beyond about 3–4 weeks is considered a complication and may require intervention [^15e35eac] [^81c92246].

> I need to check postsurgical dimpling outside aesthetics. After closed proximal humerus fractures, skin dimpling can indicate incarceration of skin at the fracture site and mandates urgent reduction to prevent necrosis; this is a classic orthopedic emergency sign that I should not miss [^a61b701e]. But wait, what if the "dimple" is actually a scar phenotype? Congenital ulcers or deep lesions can heal with scarred depressions that resemble dimples, so I should correlate with history and evolution to distinguish true dimples from scar-related contour defects [^92cc48d2].

> Now, I will examine aesthetic/surgical dimple creation. Surgical dimples are produced by creating a subcutaneous tether from dermis to underlying muscle (typically buccinator) using sutures or open techniques; satisfaction is high when appropriately planned, but complications include fading, asymmetry, and rare infections such as actinomycosis, underscoring the need for sterile technique and patient selection [^33faa7cf] [^b06f0315] [^69960010]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "no tissue is removed" in all techniques; let me correct that — some open methods do involve tissue modification, so I should specify that many modern approaches minimize excision and rely on suture fixation to reduce morbidity [^41e0b428].

> Let me consider cellulite dimples, since patients often ask about them. Cellulite dimpling is primarily due to vertically oriented, thickened fibrous septae that tether the dermis to deeper fascia, allowing fat lobules to herniate and creating surface depressions; this is amplified by hormonal and genetic factors and explains why treatments that sever or remodel septae (subcision, laser/microblade, collagenase) improve contour, with durable results reported for vacuum-assisted subcision in particular [^21115534] [^15544e80] [^3d9e8801]. I should double-check that the necessity of septal targeting is supported: yes, clinical data indicate durable efficacy only with strategies that address septa, reinforcing their causal role in dimpling [^15544e80].

> But wait, what about retinal "dimples"? I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. After ILM peeling for macular holes or ERM, inner retinal dimples are common on en face OCT and correspond to small pitting defects; they are generally benign and not linked to short-term visual acuity loss, though their long-term functional significance remains under study, so I should frame them as expected postoperative changes rather than pathological dimples in the skin sense [^e886ceb1] [^2ec9fbbb] [^075224d3].

> I should also review other pathological dimples to complete the spectrum. Dupuytren's disease can produce palmar dimpling as early disease expression due to fascial cord formation and skin tethering, often preceding overt contracture; recognizing this helps with early referral and counseling about progression and treatment options [^021ca3fd]. Injection-site dimpling can occur with subcutaneous medications like depo-subQ provera, reflecting local tissue atrophy or lipodystrophy; counseling and technique optimization can mitigate this adverse effect [^9ba97585] [^b7c08cdc].

> Let me synthesize the causal themes so the answer is clinically actionable. Dimples reflect a localized defect in the normal interface between skin and deeper structures: either a congenital tether (fascial/muscular, septal, or sinus tract), an acquired displacement or adhesion (trauma, surgery, scarring), or a pathological process that alters subcutaneous architecture (cellulite septae, palmar fibromatosis, injection-related atrophy). The key modifiers include genetics, hormones, mechanical forces, and iatrogenic factors, which explains why some dimples are familial, some are sex-linked and hormone-responsive, and some are procedure-related [^33faa7cf] [^21115534] [^15544e80] [^021ca3fd].

> Finally, I should confirm when dimples warrant evaluation versus reassurance. Simple, low-lying coccygeal dimples in otherwise normal infants are common and low risk, whereas atypical dimples or those with associated cutaneous stigmata merit spinal ultrasound; traumatic or postsurgical dimpling that persists or causes deformity may benefit from corrective techniques; and new-onset palmar dimpling should prompt assessment for Dupuytren's disease. By mapping the dimple to its anatomic context and associated features, I can align the explanation with the most likely etiology and guide next steps [^fb893774] [^ac1d37cc] [^df98b7ee] [^021ca3fd].

Dimples are caused by **genetic variation** that creates a defect in the facial muscle (usually the buccinator), allowing the skin to indent when smiling [^notfound]. They are inherited as a **dominant trait**, so a child has a 50% chance if one parent has dimples. Dimples can also result from **trauma or surgery** that creates a similar tether, and some medical conditions (e.g. cellulite, Dupuytren's) produce dimpling via fibrous septae or tissue loss [^21115534] [^021ca3fd]. Most dimples are benign and require no treatment, though cosmetic procedures can create or remove them [^33faa7cf].

---

## Genetic factors

- **Muscle defect**: Dimples arise from a congenital defect in the buccinator or zygomaticus muscles, creating a dermal tether that indents the skin during smile [^notfound].
- **Dominant inheritance**: Dimples are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; each child of a parent with dimples has ~50% risk.
- **Variable expressivity**: Dimples may be unilateral or bilateral, and can fade with age as muscle tone and fat distribution change.

---

## Environmental and developmental factors

Environmental and developmental factors can also contribute to dimple formation. For example, **intrauterine positioning** may cause localized pressure or friction (e.g. a big toenail abutting the skin), producing a congenital skin dimple [^6f81a1b7]. Additionally, **trauma or surgery** can create dimples by damaging subcutaneous tissue and forming adhesions that tether the skin [^df98b7ee].

---

## Medical conditions associated with dimpling

Certain medical conditions can cause dimpling of the skin, including:

| **Medical condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cellulite | - Hormonal and structural factors cause fibrous septae to tether skin <br/> - Creating dimpled appearance on thighs and buttocks [^21115534] [^15544e80] |
| Dupuytren's contracture | Palmar fibromatosis causes skin dimpling and contractures of the hand [^021ca3fd] |
| Pilonidal disease | Gluteal cleft dimples or pits from sinus tracts and chronic infection [^634424ed] |
| Facial trauma | Blunt trauma can displace subcutaneous tissue, causing dimpling [^df98b7ee] |

---

## Clinical significance and treatment

Most dimples are **benign and require no treatment**. Cosmetic procedures can create or enhance dimples (e.g. transcutaneous sutures, open techniques) [^33faa7cf] [^41e0b428], while traumatic dimples can be corrected with subcutaneous repositioning and fixation [^df98b7ee].

---

Dimples are primarily due to a **genetic muscle defect** that tethers the skin, with contributions from trauma, surgery, and certain diseases; they are usually harmless and can be created or removed cosmetically if desired.

### High-speed atomic force microscopy highlights new molecular mechanism of daptomycin action [^f7f49a78]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In addition to the oligomers and dimples, at slightly longer times after exposure to Dap, another type of deformation, previously unreported in the literature, that we named 'elongated-humps' formed on top of the POPG bilayer surface (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 1), and presented rather uniform widths and heights, with 4 nm and 2 nm, respectively, but variable lengths ranging from several to tens of nanometres.

Significantly, due to the fast imaging speed of the HS-AFM, we could determine the process of fusion between the elongated-humps and the dimples that ended in the formation of toroidal-shaped pores (Fig. 4, 2f). In this process, never observed nor proposed for Dap molecular activity, an elongated-hump embraces the dimple forming a ring protruding 2 nm above the membrane, which then develops into a toroidal membrane pore.

Müllerian agenesis — defining success and continuation of dilation — although some studies define success anatomically by a length of 6 cm or longer, the best definition of success is a vagina that is functional for comfortable sexual activity, and there is no starting length associated with functional success so even patients with a flush vaginal dimple should be encouraged to dilate as first-line therapy; based on expert opinion, patients who successfully use dilation therapy may require continuation of dilation on an intermittent basis if they are not regularly engaging in vaginal intercourse, patients who have stopped dilating should be reassured that they will not cause themselves harm but may need to resume dilation before sexual activity in the future, and the patient should be empowered to determine when she is ready to start dilation and encouraged to proceed with dilation at her own rate.

### Congenital ulcer of the buttock [^92cc48d2]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

We present the case of a congenital, deep ulcer of the buttock in an otherwise healthy newborn girl. Histopathology excluded any specific cause of ulceration. The ulcer healed spontaneously at 4 weeks of age, leaving a scar. Because the patient also had symmetrical pits on her knees and because the ulcer was located in an area typically affected by dimples, we interpret this unique manifestation as a congenital defect in the spectrum of congenital dimples.

The predominant hypothesis is that Dap antibacterial action is caused by toroidal pores that induce the depolarisation measured in bacteria –. The process of formation is believed to happen as follows: Dap monomers would oligomerize –; the large local positive curvature strain created in the outer membrane leaflet could result in dimples, also named half-toroidal pores, that would locally reduce the thickness of the membrane through where some Dap molecules would translocate to the inner leafletwhere they would oligomerize and in turn form similar dimples in the inner leaflet; finally, inner and outer dimples would fuse and produce the transmembrane toroidal pores. Nevertheless, in the last six years, two other models of Dap action have been proposed, both based on optical microscopy (OM) observations. First, in 2014, the lipid extraction model was proposed in which Dap is suggested to cause ejection of material from the membrane. Unfortunately, these observations were performed on membranes with a rather un-natural composition of 70% DOPC. Second, in 2016, in the membrane protein delocalisation model, it was proposed that Dap delocalises the glycotransferase enzyme MurG hampering bacterial cell wall formation.

Dimpled Chin

A dimpled chin is caused by contraction of the mentalis muscle, and the IBA noted they prefer to inject only patients with active dimpling (eg, they dimple while speaking). Combination therapy with fillers is often appropriate because loss of collagen and subcutaneous fat in this region is a significant contributor to the formation of a dimpled chin.

The IBA recommended a 1- to 3-point injection at the bony jaw line close to the central midline (Figure 5B). Injections should be deep with an aboBoNT-A RTU dose of 5 to 10 U per injection point adjusted according to the mentalis muscle mass. Injecting laterally and at a higher-than-recommended dose may affect the depressor labii inferioris, causing mouth asymmetry. Injections can be supplemented with some subdermal injections into the dimples as required. The IBA noted that when the dimpled chin and drooping mouth corners (depressor anguli oris) are treated together, 1 central injection point of 5 to 10 U might be sufficient. Safety concerns mainly relate to using higher-than-recommended doses which may affect the depressor labii inferioris and the orbicularis oris, causing drooling, speech impairment, and mouth asymmetry.

After a few tens of minutes of exposure, the observable structures change. Our imaging observed 'dimples', circular zones of decreased membrane thickness, as proposed by Zhang et al. diffusing on the membrane along with the oligomers (Fig. 4a) with an instantaneous speed (0.7 ± 0.5 µm/s, Fig. 4b, c) that is roughly six times slower than that of the Dap oligomers; still the AFM speeds from 6 to 60 µs/pixel that the dimples required for their imaging were too fast for the conventional AFM rates of 200to 1000 – µs/pixel. The dimples had slightly variable diameters of 7 ± 2 nm and depths of 0.9 ± 0.3 nm (88 measurements) suggesting little variations in the number of molecules forming them. From the swinging trajectories of diffusing dimples, it was clear that the membrane tension they generated resulted in attractive forces (Fig. 4b and Supplementary movie 2). It was also clear that the dimples of the same leaflet can fuse and give yield to dimples of larger size in that same leaflet (Fig. 4b, last frame); not be confused with the fusion of dimples from opposite membrane leaflets that is proposed in the existing model of Dap pore formation. In more detail, their energy profile (Fig. 4b right, from n = 120 dimple-dimple distance measurements) shows a similar pattern that the oligomers, two minima appear at d ~ 5 nm, where the dimples are in a side-by-side contact, and at d ~ 13 nm, where they interact by the stress field they generate in the bilayer. In agreement with the attraction between dimples, we were able to observe clusters of dimples (Fig. 4c), not previously described in the literature, slightly reminiscent of cubic phases, located statically on the membrane, although with internal dynamic rearrangements on the time scale of several seconds (Fig. 4d).

### Benign breast disease [^0f5eeafa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Benign breast disease includes all nonmalignant conditions of the breast, including benign tumors, trauma, mastalgia, mastitis, and nipple discharge. Benign tumors include pathologic changes that do not increase a patient's risk for developing cancer, lesions that confer a slightly increase risk, and lesions that are associated with an up to 50% risk of developing breast cancer. Both benign and malignant breast disorders can present with a palpable mass; skin dimpling, thickening, or erythema; pain; nipple discharge and inversion or distortion; or an abnormal screening mammogram with no clinical findings. Tools available to investigate breast problems include clinical breast examination, mammogram, and ultrasound. This article discusses the gynecologist's role in maintaining breast health, the clinical evaluation of breast problems, and management of benign breast disease.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 728: Müllerian agenesis: diagnosis, management, and treatment [^398ef28a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Müllerian agenesis — background and typical presentation summarize incidence, anatomic features, and common evaluation context. Müllerian agenesis has an incidence of 1 per 4,500–5,000 females and is caused by embryologic underdevelopment of the müllerian duct with resultant agenesis or atresia of the vagina, uterus, or both. The vaginal canal is markedly shortened and may appear as a dimple below the urethra; a single midline uterine remnant may be present or uterine horns (with or without an endometrial cavity) may exist. The ovaries are typically normal in structure and function, though they may be found in atypical locations. Patients usually are identified when evaluated for primary amenorrhea with otherwise typical growth and pubertal development, and it is one of the most common causes of primary amenorrhea in patients with typical thelarche and adrenarche. On physical examination, patients have normal height, breast development, body hair, and external genitalia; the vagina is present and may appear as a small flush dimple, or longer, without a cervix at the vaginal apex. The differential diagnosis for primary amenorrhea with a shortened lower vagina includes obstructing vaginal or uterine anomalies such as imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, or cervical atresia, and 46, XY differences (or disorders) of sex development may present with primary amenorrhea and absent uterus, including androgen insensitivity syndrome.

### Bilateral acromial dimples: a case report and review of the literature [^808f84c7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Bilateral acromial dimples are uncommon in pediatric dermatology. They are usually found as a sporadic finding with limited clinical symptoms but may cause concern for parents. They can occur spontaneously or be inherited. Bilateral acromial dimples may occasionally be present as part of more complex syndromes. This article reports an 18-month-old girl with congenital bilateral acromial dimples and presents a classification of this unusual entity. A literature review of English and non-English publications was performed. We report the second case of bilateral acromial dimples seen in the context of maternal cocaine use during pregnancy. Our case is probably sporadic and nonsyndromal. We suggest that bilateral acromial dimples be classified as syndromal or nonsyndromal and that nonsyndromal cases be subdivided into inherited and sporadic. Although bilateral acromial dimples can be seen in 18q deletion syndrome, Apert syndrome, Say syndrome, and a recently described syndrome in Brazil, our review of the literature does not support the association with trisomy 9 syndrome. Dermatologists need to be aware of this unusual cutaneous finding and potential syndromal associations. The significance of the association with fetal exposure to cocaine during pregnancy has yet to be determined. The biological mother was not available for assessment for bilateral acromial dimples.

### Bi-acromial dimples: a series of seven cases [^1d00ad2e]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Seven patients with bi-acromial dimples are reported, with a family history in only one. This skin condition presented as an anatomic peculiarity without associated abnormalities. Although it has been previously documented as a finding in malformation syndromes such as the 18q syndrome, we point out that it may be found quite frequently in isolation and without morbidity. Therefore, it should be mainly considered as an anatomic variation without pathologic significance.

### Evaluating inner retinal dimples after inner limiting membrane removal using multimodal imaging of optical coherence tomography [^b5287aaf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, inner retinal dimples were frequently found after ILM peeling. En face OCT imaging combined with B-scan OCT imaging is highly recommended to evaluate inner retinal dimples after ILM peeling, due to the comprehensive information that these scans can provide to clinicians. High myopic eyes might develop more severe, "scattered" inner retinal defects after ILM peeling. Inner retinal dimples after surgery do not seem to compromise visual function in the short-term.

### Angiographic dimple of profound significance in cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: report of 2 cases [^37b51c62]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

The occurrence of an angiographic dimple or irregularity due to indentation of the contrast column by an intraluminal thrombus at the dome of a ruptured aneurysm is not uncommon and does not draw much clinical attention. However, an angiographic dimple at the base of the ruptured aneurysm or division of the parent artery can signify a rupture point close to the dimple and an intraluminal thrombus, which has utmost clinical significance as it is close to the parent artery and necessitates a different treatment strategy from rupture of the aneurysm dome. The author reports on 2 cases of an angiographic dimple following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subsequent surgical exploration. In the first patient, a 57-year-old-woman, angiography revealed a basal dimple in a superiorly directed anterior communicating artery aneurysm. A pterional craniotomy was performed, which revealed a bilobed aneurysm harboring a superiorly directed unruptured lobule and inferiorly directed ruptured lobule. An intraluminal thrombus in the inferiorly directed lobule apparently obscured the lobule and caused the appearance of the basal dimple on the angiograms. In the second patient, a 40-year-old man who had been transferred to the author's institution because of an angiographic evaluation that did not show any aneurysm despite SAH in the basal cisterns, initial angiography revealed a subtle dimple on the superior wall of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA). On follow-up angiography, a very small aneurysm was seen at the site of the dimple. A craniotomy then revealed a very small ruptured and thrombosed aneurysm on the superior wall of the ACoA.

### Paired unilateral scapular pits in a neonate [^70af2761]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Skin pits, or skin dimples, are cutaneous depressions most commonly found on the cheeks or chin. They are thought to arise secondary to early fixation of skin with insufficient formation of subcutaneous tissue. Skin pits may be seen in association with metabolic abnormalities, trauma, and maternal infection. We present a case of non‐syndromic, paired unilateral scapular pits in a neonate.

### Skin dimpling after a closed proximal humerus fracture [^a61b701e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Skin dimpling, also known as skin puckering, is a rare occurrence after closed proximal humerus fractures. This finding is suggestive of incarceration of the skin at the fracture site and may lead to necrosis and conversion to an open fracture.

Objectives

Our goal is to describe our experience with skin dimpling after a proximal humerus fracture to increase awareness and recognition of this clinical presentation in the Emergency Department (ED).

Case Report

We report a case of a 46-year-old woman who presented to the ED with left shoulder pain and swelling after a fall. She was found to have skin dimpling over the anterior aspect of the shoulder on further examination and was diagnosed with a proximal humerus fracture after imaging.

Conclusion

Skin dimpling is an uncommon sign associated with proximal humerus fractures that can help in diagnosis and determining course of treatment. Devastating soft tissue injury can occur if the fracture is not immediately reduced. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians be able to promptly identify the clinical presentation to prevent unwanted sequelae.

### High-speed atomic force microscopy highlights new molecular mechanism of daptomycin action [^de5c833e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The HS-AFM imaging correlated with EM and OM enabled unprecedented assessment of structures and dynamics of the activity Dap on the membranes of living bacteria and mimic bilayers. We provided visual proof of previously hypothetical models, quantified interactions, and found unexpected new phenomena. Based on our findings, we discuss next our view on the activity of Dap on membranes (schematized in Fig. 8).

Fig. 8
Schematics of the action pathways of Dap on Gram+ membranes.

The timescale is indicated. The insertion of Dap molecules in the membrane rises the pressure. The pressure relief drives Dap actions: Left, When the membrane does not contain CL, the formation of Dap oligomers is followed by the formation of dimples in the membrane, followed by the formation of elongated-humps. The dimples favour the translocation of Dap to the inner membrane leaflet by the flip-flop mechanism. When Dap is present in the inner and outer leaflets toroidal pores form, the membrane is permeated, and the bacteria die. Alternatively, Dap can also induce ejection of material from the membrane by the formation of tubulations; equally destabilising the membrane and killing the bacteria. Right, Concerning the bacteria containing a high content of CL in the membrane (> 20% molar), Dap action is drastically modified. In this case, the Dap flip-flop does not take place and the dimples are not formed. Instead, the membrane buckles but it does not break. Hence, despite Dap insertion, the membrane still separates the cytoplasm from the exterior. In the improbable case that some Dap molecules reach the inner leaflet of the membrane, pores form as in the case CL is present. The particularity of the pores formed under high CL content is that they are able of ejecting material out of the membrane. These pores behave 'like geysers', and relief the pressure built on the outer leaflet by the insertions of Dap molecules in cycles of activity. Both CL-related processes maintain the membrane integrity and the bacteria alive.

### Evaluating inner retinal dimples after inner limiting membrane removal using multimodal imaging of optical coherence tomography [^ba2da8d8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Müller cell footplates are reported to play a significant part in maintaining the homeostasis of the retinal milieu. The damaged footplate function after ILM peeling may be followed by secondary physiologic derangements of the inner retina. Thus, the effects of trauma to the Müller cells, along with their regenerative growth after surgical removal of the ILM, could explain the formation of inner retinal dimples. The relationships of ERM and LHEP, which are involved in the proliferation of glial cells, with inner retinal defects formation were evaluated. However, in this study, eyes with LHEP or conventional ERM in the inner retinal dimples group were not significantly different from eyes in the control group. The results suggest that the formation of inner retinal dimples may be influenced by several factors apart from Müller cells, that are yet to be explored. In addition, LHEP was found adjacent to the edges of macular holes, far away from the ILM peeling boundaries which were close to the vascular arcade in most eyes in this study. Therefore, a large portion of ILM peeling area was not covered by LHEP. Due to the small sample size of our study, the results need to be verified by further studies.

In this study, we failed to identify a relationship between inner retinal dimples formation and different vitreomacular interfaces due to high myopia in the current study. Sakimoto et al. described inner retinal defects after ILM peeling in high myopic eyes and found that different ILM-retinal adhesions in different fundus areas influenced the development of inner retinal defects. However, only one eye with ILM detachment was included in our study, which had no evident inner retinal dimples observed on both OCT scans (en face and B-scan) after surgery. However, we did found that a large portion of the eyes with longer axial length and posterior staphyloma formed "scattered" inner retinal dimples. These inner retinal defects were related to significant thinning of inner retinal layers. We speculated the globe deformation of posterior staphylomas in highly myopic eyes led to different ILM retina adhesion, thus the different type of inner retinal defects. In addition, the choroid plays an important role in offering nutrient and oxygen to the retina in the macular area. Therefore, we speculate that the nerve fiber layer was susceptible to surgical manipulation in the high myopic eyes due to myopic chorioretinal atrophy. Further, the decreased level of neutrophic factor in high myopic eyes may compromise healing after ILM peeling in these eyes.

### Practice bulletin no. 164: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^3095d455]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Benign breast disorders — evaluation of mastalgia (breast pain) emphasizes that the evaluation should include a history to elicit timing, frequency, severity, and location and attention to activities or trauma; mastalgia associated with breast cancer is more likely to be unilateral, intense, noncyclic, and progressive. A clinical breast examination should be performed and the chest wall evaluated separately; if a palpable abnormality is identified, then imaging should be performed, and breast imaging should be considered for focal mastalgia without an obvious cause, particularly if the pain is of new onset. Mondor disease is described as a rare cause of noncyclic breast pain with a palpable cord and linear skin dimpling, and because an association with breast cancer has been reported, age-appropriate breast imaging should be performed to rule out a nonpalpable underlying cancer.

### A new simple technique for making facial dimples [^33faa7cf]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

In Asia, especially in China, women think a dimple is an important part of a beautiful smiling face. The dimple can make them more confident. Unfortunately, not all women have dimples. Hence, with the development of the Chinese economy, there is an increasing demand among Chinese women for the creation of dimples. Most women hope the impairment of the operation will be slight and the period of recovery short so they can go to work as quickly as possible. Some of them want to have dimples only when they smile. The authors have used a new simple technique to form 56 dimples for 36 women. During the operation, they use a syringe needle to guide a monofilament nylon suture through the dermis and the active facial muscles (usually the buccinator). A sling is formed between the skin and the buccinator muscle. The knot is tied, and the dimple is created. After the operation, patients have been satisfied with the shape of the dimples. Furthermore, hematoma and infection never occurred. As a result, on the basis of their experience, the authors conclude that this technique is simple and easy to duplicate. Moreover, this technique has many benefits. For example, with this procedure, it is easy to adjust the bulk of dimples by adjusting the tension of the knot and the amount of dermis tissue the injection needle sutures. Because no tissue is resected, there is mild postoperative swelling. Consequently, patients can return to work or other activities 2 days after the operation.

### Newborn skin: part II. birthmarks [^b0ac2de0]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Birthmarks in newborns are common sources of parental concern. Although most treatment recommendations are based on expert opinion, limited evidence exists to guide management of these conditions. Large congenital melanocytic nevi require evaluation for removal, whereas smaller nevi may be observed for malignant changes. With few exceptions, benign birthmarks (e.g., dermal melanosis, hemangioma of infancy, port-wine stain, nevus simplex) do not require treatment; however, effective cosmetic laser treatments exist. Supernumerary nipples are common and benign; they are occasionally mistaken for congenital melanocytic nevi. High- and intermediate-risk skin markers of spinal dysraphism (e.g., dermal sinuses, tails, atypical dimples, multiple lesions of any type) require evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography. Family physicians should be familiar with various birthmarks and comfortable discussing disease prevention and cosmetic strategies.

### Improved surgical access for facial dimple creation [^41e0b428]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2010). Low credibility.

As an alternative to blind coring of the soft tissue from the buccal mucosa to the dermis or the placement of transcutaneous sutures, both of which can be associated with untoward side effects, the authors describe a safe and effective method for creating dimples through an open technique that replicates the anatomical basis of a natural dimple.

### Spinal congenital dermal sinus in a chick embryo model. laboratory investigation [^638b69f9]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Object

The origin of spinal congenital dermal sinuses is not known. A local nondisjunction of the closing neural tube and the epidermal ectoderm is thought to be the cause of this malformation. In this experimental study, a nondisjunction was mimicked in chick embryos to create an animal model for the dermal sinus.

Methods

A piece of amniotic tissue was implanted in the closing neural tube in ovo in chick embryos at 2 days of incubation. A total of 50 embryos were manipulated. After a further incubation time of 2–7 days, the embryos were macroscopically and histologically evaluated.

Results

Dermal sinus-like anomalies were induced in 24 embryos. The induced abnormalities varied from superficial, epidermal lesions to epidermal dimples continuing as a strand of tissue toward the neural tube. This strand invariably was of nonneuronal origin. Additionally, in 3 embryos a split cord malformation was noted, most likely caused by damage to the neural tube during implantation.

Conclusions

Implantation of donor amniotic tissue in the closing chick neural tube does result in a dimple, from which a strand of tissue continues to the neural tube in various cases, indicating that formation of a dermal sinus-like anomaly can be successfully induced by experimental continuation of the connection between neural tube and surface ectoderm. This finding strengthens the hypothesis that a human dermal sinus arises after nondisjunction of neural tube and surface ectoderm.

### Strong and ductile titanium-oxygen-iron alloys by additive manufacturing [^99b575a0]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

The above understanding corresponds well to the fracture features of each alloy (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f). For example, the fracture surface of the Ti–0.34O–3.25Fe alloy consisted of large, deep dimples (extensive dislocation multiplication) and a portion of facets with small, shallow dimples (less ductile). Conversely, the fracture surface of the Ti–0.67O–3.30Fe alloy exhibited notable facets with a size comparable with the prior-β grain size, indicative of inter-(prior-β)-granular fracture, and only a fraction of large, deep dimples (localized dislocation multiplication). The fracture characteristics of the other alloys could be understood similarly.

The relative phase fractions and grain sizes also play an important role in the strengthening mechanisms. The increase in the β-phase volume fraction with increasing O stems from the strong partitioning of O and Fe in each phase. For instance, at 800 °C (in the green zone of Fig. 1c), CALPHAD predicts substantially more β-phase in the Ti–0.14O–3Fe alloy (53.5 vol%) than in the Ti–0.67O–3Fe alloy (39.5 vol%) (Supplementary Note 5). The lower the β-phase fraction, the higher the average Fe content in the β-phase and the more stable the β-phase will be. This leads to more retained β-phase. In this particular case, the β-phase in the Ti–0.67O–3Fe alloy contained 7.30% Fe versus 4.85% Fe in the β-phase of the Ti–0.14O–3Fe alloy. In terms of the increase in the α-lath thickness with increasing O, we ascribe this to the higher formation temperature of the α-phase, which accelerates diffusion while reducing strain energy from the formation of the α-phase.

### Deep mutation, insertion and deletion scanning across the enterovirus A proteome reveals constraints shaping viral evolution [^5c49c755]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Main

Genetic variation in RNA viruses arises through substitution, insertion and deletion. The influence of each of these mutational forces on the evolution of viral populations is determined by the rate at which they occur and their phenotypic impact, or fitness effect. Although single-nucleotide variants are the primary mechanism of adaptation to selective pressures on short evolutionary timescales, rarer insertions and deletions (InDels) can access evolutionary solutions inaccessible by substitution alone, sometimes dramatically altering protein structure and function. Both types of mutation have combined to set the tempo of the host–virus arms race and create the diversity of viruses and viral proteins we observe today. Here, we use emerging methods in mutational scanning to define the global mutational tolerance of a viral genome to substitutions and InDels.

Direct experimental measurement of mutational fitness effects (MFE) is now possible with deep mutational scanning (DMS), a transformative technology allowing measurement of the fitness effects of all possible non-synonymous, amino acid (AA)-changing mutations across cellular proteins. In viral proteins, DMS studies have identified the constraints shaping mutational tolerance – and the mutational pathways available to escape immune pressures. However, conventional DMS approaches use PCR-based methods, which are largely limited to single-residue substitutions. Studies experimentally examining the effects of InDels on viral fitness have relied on high-fidelity population sequencingor random transposon insertion mutagenesis. Deep InDel scanning approaches that use synthetic oligo libraries encoding deleted or inserted peptide sequences have recently been developed to overcome these limitations –. Specifically, Saturated Programmable Insertion Engineering (SPINE) and Deep Indel Missense Programmable Library Engineering (DIMPLE), have been used to explore InDel tolerance in cellular proteins.

### The buried guide suture method: a novel technique to correct traumatic facial dimples [^df98b7ee]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Facial dimpling, frequently occurring after blunt trauma, presents as soft-tissue depression, which is particularly apparent during facial expression. The displacement of subcutaneous tissue can be detected and measured by high-frequency ultrasound. Limited surgical methods have been applied in these closed-injury cases. Repositioning the subcutaneous tissue without incisions on unscarred skin is challenging. The authors propose a novel three-dimensional technique to suture and fix the subcutaneous tissue at a distance through a concealed incision. The buried guide suture method was used in the treatment of 22 patients with traumatic facial dimples on the cheek. All patients showed great improvement in their depressed deformity with minor complications. This technique provides an option to correct soft-tissue depression without leaving a visible scar, especially for mimetic rupture caused by blunt trauma.

### Actinomycotic sinus of the buccal mucosa: a rare complication of cheek dimple creation [^69960010]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Even though actinomyces are common oral commensals, actinomycosis is an uncommon oral infection. Cheek dimple creation is a common surgical procedure with rare complications. Bacterial infection with abscess formation and foreign body reaction were reported. We report a rare example-and, to our knowledge, the first-of oral actinomycosis after cheek dimple creation. A young woman complained of a chronic tender nodule of the right buccal mucosa with pus discharge after surgery for cheek dimple creation. Histologic examination showed a sinus tract with actinomyces microorganisms. This complication can be mimicked by other oral or dental sinus-forming lesions, can be chronic and insidious, and could therefore clinically be missed or mistreated. This might delay the diagnosis and cause scarring and disfigurement. The treatment of choice is early recognition and complete surgical excision to avoid irreversible complications and prevent recurrence. Awareness of this potential complication by aesthetic surgeons, oral clinicians, and dentists is important. Patients' adherence to preventive measures and plastic surgeons' application of inclusion criteria and contraindications, as well as their choice of best technique per patient, should help minimize such a problem in a simple and safe aesthetic procedure.

### INTERNAL LIMITING MEMBRANE PEELING VERSUS NONPEELING TO PREVENT EPIRETINAL MEMBRANE DEVELOPMENT IN PRIMARY RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT: a swept-source optical coherence tomography study with a new postoperative classification system [^2ec9fbbb]. Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Internal limiting membrane peeling does not seem to have a detrimental effect on postoperative visual acuity, although the real impact on the quality of vision remains unclear. Internal limiting membrane peeling may induce microscotoma formation. In our study, inner retinal dimples were detected in more than 40% of eyes in the ILM peeling group versus none of the eyes in the nonpeeling group. The statistical analysis showed that the presence of these dimples does not seem to affect visual acuity, which was similar among eyes with and without inner retinal dimples.

### Innocent pits and dermal sinus tracts: an oft-misdiagnosed distinction… [^f0353007]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Midline craniospinal dimples or pits are relatively common, but confusion abounds regarding which are clinically significant and which can be ignored. Generations of pediatricians have been taught that "good dimples" have a skin-covered bottom whereas "bad dimples" are those whose bottoms can't be seen. In fact, the depth of the tract is irrelevant; it is the craniocaudal location of the dimple that is important. Coccygeal dimples are present in 4% of the population. These dimples are located at or near the tip of the coccyx within the gluteal cleft and are visible only when the buttocks is parted. A fingertip placed on the dimple can be "rolled around" the tip of the coccyx. They have no associated abnormalities, and the gluteal cleft is normal. According to a study by Weprin and Oakes, only seven of 1, 000 coccygeal dimples were associated with an underlying spinal..

### Evaluating inner retinal dimples after inner limiting membrane removal using multimodal imaging of optical coherence tomography [^e886ceb1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate inner retinal dimples after peeling of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) for macular holes (lamellar macular hole [LMH] and full-thickness macular hole [FTMH]) via multiple imaging modes of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to assess their relationship with preoperative vitreoretinal interface conditions.

Methods

The data of 38 eyes in 35 patients who underwent surgery for LMH, and FTMH were retrospectively studied. The presence of postoperative inner retinal dimples was judged by a combination of en face OCT layer images and cross-sectional images. The demographic and clinical characteristics of eyes with and without inner retinal defects were compared to identify factors involved in the formation of the defects.

Results

Inner retinal defects were found in 26 eyes (68%) after surgery. They appeared on the en face OCT ILM layer images as multiple dark spots limited to the ILM peeling area, and corresponded to dimples or pitting of inner retinal layers on cross-sectional OCT images. In 5 cases (19%), apparent progression of inner retinal defects was observed on the en face OCT images as increasing numbers and sizes of the dark spots, which seemed to follow an eccentric growth pattern starting from the central macula. In addition, highly myopic eyes were found to be associated with the formation of more severe inner retinal defects.

Conclusions

Multiple imaging modes of en face spectral-domain OCT provide comprehensive information about the appearance of inner retinal dimples. High myopic eyes seem to develop more severe inner retinal defects after ILM peeling.

### Optical coherence tomographic findings of dissociated optic nerve fiber layer appearance [^13262eff]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the features of optical coherence tomographic (OCT) findings of dissociated optic nerve fiber layer (DONFL) appearance.

Design

Case-control study.

Methods

Twenty-four eyes undergoing vitrectomy for idiopathic epiretinal membrane or macular hole were examined postoperatively using OCT.

Results

Thirteen of the 24 eyes exhibited the DONFL appearance. In these 13 eyes, the OCT images indicated dimples in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) corresponding to each stria. The RNFL thickness (mean ± SD) at the dimple site was 38.1 ± 9.3 microm. The depth of each dimple was 28.6 ± 8.0 microm. The depths of all the dimples were limited to the RNFL thickness. In the other 11 eyes without the DONFL appearance, OCT images showed no distinct dimples.

Conclusions

The DONFL appearance is caused by dimples the depths of which are limited to the RNFL thickness.

### Screening for spinal dysraphisms in newborns with sacral dimples [^b8f31cc2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Sacral dimples are common physical examination findings among newborns and are rarely associated with spinal dysraphism. Screening ultrasonography for simple sacral dimples in the absence of other physical findings leads to unnecessary health care costs and undue stress on families. This study was a retrospective chart review of infants with a sacral dimple on examination who underwent spinal ultrasonography in the first week of life. The documented indication for ultrasonography was compared to standard guidelines. Among 151 infants in the study, 80% had a normal spinal ultrasound. Of infants with abnormal ultrasonography, 7 (5%) had abnormal spinal magnetic resonance imaging and 2 infants (1%) required neurosurgical intervention. Our study revealed that nearly one-third of infants who underwent spinal ultrasonography had a simple sacral dimple and low likelihood of spinal dysraphism according to existing guidelines. Among patients who underwent spinal ultrasonography in accordance with guidelines, only a small percentage required neurosurgical intervention indicating that guidelines may need to be revised. Larger studies involving multiple centers are necessary to assess this need.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 728: Müllerian agenesis: diagnosis, management, and treatment [^ef4deea2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Müllerian agenesis — assessing readiness for vaginal elongation — Nonsurgical or surgical vaginal elongation should wait until the patient is emotionally mature and expresses the desire to proceed with therapy. There are multiple risks of failure of dilation, most of which are not anatomic and may predict poor adherence to postoperative dilation, with cognitive issues that affect adherence including limited comprehension of the diagnosis and anatomy, young age, underlying learning disability, and inadequate knowledge of the dilation process. Logistical barriers to successful dilation include lack of privacy and limited ability to travel to clinic for close follow-up, and in a study of adolescent girls and women in whom müllerian agenesis was diagnosed, respondents reported lack of motivation, uncertainty that dilation would be successful, and the perception of dilation as a negative experience as barriers to use. Finally, anatomic considerations include discomfort and pain, scar from prior procedures, the absence of dimple, and the presence of multiple congenital anomalies, and the patient should be encouraged to wait to start dilation until she feels emotionally and physically ready to begin the process.

### Hearing assessment in infants, children, and adolescents: recommendations beyond neonatal screening [^8b3a5c4e]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Physical examination and related findings — key components of pediatric hearing evaluation are specified. "This includes developmental screening of language and auditory communication milestones, questioning caregivers regarding concern about hearing, recent medical history to assess for newly acquired risks (eg, trauma, infection, noise), and physical examination with knowledge of potential risk factors (Tables 1 and 2)." "A thorough physical examination is an important part of evaluating a child's hearing status." Findings that "may be associated with being D/HH include heterochromia of the irises, malformation of the auricle or ear canal, dimpling or skin tags around the auricle, cleft lip or palate, asymmetry or hypoplasia of the facial structures, and microcephaly." "Dense cerumen impactions should be removed before diagnostic testing because they can decrease hearing and also prevent accurate examination of the middle ear." Middle ear assessment is aided as "Visualization of the eardrum and observation of mobility using pneumatic otoscopy or automated tympanometry can provide information about middle ear status." "A temporary change in hearing thresholds has been demonstrated during episodes of acute otitis media." "Another leading cause of acquired hearing change is otitis media with effusion (OME)." Children "with repeated or chronic OME may experience temporary or permanent conductive hearing change leading to impacts on language acquisition, academics, and socioemotional development, and should be referred to audiology to undergo a thorough hearing evaluation."

### Continuation of injectable contraception when self-injected vs. administered by a facility-based health worker: a nonrandomized, prospective cohort study in Uganda [^5a47f426]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

The results of this study of women using self-injection in a low-resource setting align with recent studies from Malawi and the United States that found similarly elevated 1-year continuation rates for self-injectors relative to those receiving DMPA injections from health workers. Collectively, these studies, which have comparable rates of unintended pregnancy between groups and lack serious adverse events related to study participation, add to the now considerable evidence that women from many walks of life can self-inject safely. The findings suggest that self-injection may improve outcomes for younger women, who are subject to high rates of discontinuation.

The findings also suggest that early adopters of self-injection may be more educated, be more empowered and have more familial support than those who choose DMPA-IM from health workers. Appreciating the contribution of a supportive husband or partner for longer injectable use will be important for the family planning program in Uganda.

The prominence of forgetting or lateness as a reason for discontinuation for DMPA-IM users may be addressed by providing complete information about the WHO reinjection window, which permits reinjection up to 4 weeks late. It is not the customary practice in Uganda to inform women of the full window, possibly due to fears that women will postpone their return visit. This is counterproductive if women who miss their appointment date discontinue rather than travel to the facility after the date has passed. For self-injectors, mechanisms to support women who are self-injecting at home may reduce discontinuation caused by challenges with injection technique and forgotten or mistimed reinjection.

That women who self-inject DMPA-SC may experience more ISRs than DMPA-IM users has implications for program planners. The predominant type of reaction among DMPA-SC users (dimple) and the nonseverity of ISRs suggest that the difference may be due to the type of injection (subcutaneous) rather than the practice of self-injection. Indeed, the original clinical trials for DMPA-SC also found higher frequency of ISRs among those receiving DMPA-SC from a provider compared with those administered DMPA-IM. Nonetheless, as more programs integrate DMPA-SC into their method mix, planners will need to address concerns over ISRs, lest self-injectors wrongly attribute the ISR to faulty technique and discontinue use.

### The influence of different light angles during standardized patient photographic assessment on the aesthetic perception of the face [^ddfd3465]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Inconsistency in pre- and post-aesthetic intervention 2D photography can obscure outcome assessment and thus potentially patient and clinician procedural satisfaction. Perhaps more seriously, inconsistent photography could prove deleterious should any medicolegal considerations arise. It is well known that changing light angles affects the contours of the face and body. For instance, when performing pre-treatment photography of cellulite dimples on the buttock and thighs, higher light angles (overhead light) accentuate the depth of the depressions and facilitate identification of more subtle surface irregularities that could be thus targeted with interventions. Similarly, during minimally invasive facial soft tissue filler injections, overhead light accentuates contours of the face and facilitates identification of light and shadow prior to intervention. In contrast, lower light angles used in fashion photography seeks to avoid the creation of shadows (i.e. sites like infraorbital hollows) which could connote fatigue/advanced age.

### Paired unilateral scapular pits in a neonate [^10867dd4]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

3 DISCUSSION

We present a case of paired unilateral scapular pits in a neonate. Prior case studies have explored possible associations between skin pitting and maternal infection, invasive testing, and metabolic disorders. A case series of five infants with congenital rubella noted dimples in the patellar and iliac spine regions. Amniocentesis has been associated with skin pitting of the thighs, abdomen, and back. Tibial dimples have been noted in a patient with hypophosphatasia, an inborn error of metabolism.

In this case, there was no history of intrauterine infection, mechanical trauma, or family history of similar findings and the patient was otherwise developing normally, thus an idiopathic benign anatomic variant was favored. Nevertheless, it is important for clinicians to be aware of associations and have a framework for additional clinical inquiry and work‐up should a patient present with such cutaneous findings. A thorough clinical history should be obtained including intrauterine infection, invasive procedures resulting in mechanical trauma, metabolic derangements, and the use of ultrasound for further investigation may be indicated.

### Bilateral congenital pits of the upper lip [^d9acef18]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Congenital sinuses, fistulas, dimples, or pits of the lips are uncommon congenital malformations. In the upper lip they are extremely rare, and only one third of them are placed laterally. The authors present a patient with bilaterally placed upper lip pits associated with speech disorders, a short and everted upper lip with an orbicularis muscle defect in the midline, slight hypertelorism, and low-set ears. Orbicularis muscle repair and tubercle augmentation were performed. No further treatment was administered to the upper lip pits because of lack of symptoms. This is the third bilateral case of the sinus or pit of the upper lip reported in the literature.

### Incidence of occult spinal dysraphism among infants with cutaneous stigmata and proportion managed with neurosurgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^74d85d76]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The pooled incidence of OSD in the patients with an atypical dimple in our included studies was significantly higher than that in patients with a simple dimple (8.8% vs 0.6%). This result was in accordance with that of a previous study, which reported atypical dimple as a high-risk factor for OSD. It is generally accepted that further evaluations via radiologic imaging and early neurosurgical referrals are required when atypical dimples exist. The most commonly used criteria for defining simple dimples are a small size (ie, < 5 mm) with a midline placement within 2.5 cm of the anus and no association of other cutaneous stigmata. An atypical dimple is larger than 5 mm and located within 25 mm of the anus. Other criteria for an atypical dimple include deep dimple, dimples located cranially to the gluteal crease or outside the midline, and multiple dimples. Therefore, clinicians involved in the referral and management of infants with a sacral dimple need to be well informed about the characteristics of atypical dimples, and careful examinations should be performed to ascertain the atypical features of such lesions in clinical practice.

### Evaluation of dorsal midline discolorations with physical examination and ultrasound [^c9abf737]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between dorsal midline skin discolorations, tethering of the spinal cord, and the role of ultrasound screening of these stigmata, focusing specifically on vascular lesions.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective observational study of infants < 6 months of age with suspicious dorsal midline skin stigmata. All were evaluated by physical examination and ultrasound scan. A subset also had a magnetic resonance imaging examination. We examined the association between small, red-shaded discolorations and their respective imaging findings.

Results

Among 100 cases with discolorations of vascular types, either isolated or combined with low-risk simple dimples or deviated gluteal folds, none had clinically significant pathologic findings requiring surgical intervention.

Conclusions

Midline lumbar discolorations are more benign than previously thought. Despite the very low association of this group of stigmata with surgical implications, we still recommend the routine use of ultrasound scanning.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, therefore adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below reflect exposure to depo-subQ provera 104 in five clinical trials involving 2325 women including 2043 women who received treatment for contraception (1780 treated up to 1 year and 263 treated for up to 2 years) and 282 women for endometriosis for up to 6 months. In these pooled trials, 9% of women discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction and the most common reason for discontinuation was dysfunctional uterine bleeding (3%).

Adverse Reactions in the Contraception Adult Studies

Table 1 presents frequently reported adverse reactions (> 1%) in the contraception pooled studies. In these studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions (> 5%) were dysfunctional uterine bleeding (e.g., irregular, increased, decreased, or spotting), headache, increased weight, amenorrhea, and injection site reactions (e.g., pain/tenderness, nodule/lump, persistent atrophy/indentation/dimpling or lipodystrophy).

The frequency reported is based on the all-causality incidence in the pooled results of the three contraception studies. Closely related "Adverse Reaction" terms were grouped but individual patients reporting two or more grouped events were only counted once.

Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding

Differences in the number, thickness, orientation, and interrelatedness of septae in cellulite skin have been identified.– Based on pathology studies, the septae of men are oriented at 45° angles to the skin in a crisscrossing pattern, whereas women have septae that are oriented perpendicularly to the skin.– A biopsy study of cellulite reported in 2000 that there was uneven thickness of the septae across samples and that the septae were fibrosclerotic. Authors concluded that fat protrusion into the dermis was a secondary event — the result of continuous and progressive tension placed on the septae, creating dimples and depressions characteristic of cellulite. Additionally, an MRI study in 30 women reported a significant increase in the mean (SD) thickness of septae in skin with cellulite (2.2 [0.9]) versus noncellulite skin (0.3 [0.6]; p < .001) of the buttocks; however, there was no relationship between septae thickness and cellulite severity. A 2019 anatomical study of the buttocks from cadavers of 10 men and 10 women demonstrated that the number and type of septae play a key role in the development of cellulite, and the force needed to break the septae in men was significantly greater than in women (p = .02).

### ACOG committee opinion no. 728: Müllerian agenesis: diagnosis, management, and treatment [^01265c53]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Müllerian agenesis — initial evaluation and exclusion of obstructive anomalies outlines key examination and imaging steps. The initial evaluation of an adolescent patient with primary amenorrhea includes a physical examination to assess for signs of appropriate or delayed puberty. In patients with müllerian agenesis, thelarche and adrenarche will be appropriate for age, but genitourinary examination will reveal a distal vagina that may be shortened without a palpable cervix, and imaging will not identify a typical midline uterus. An evaluation to exclude obstructive anomalies, including imperforate hymen, distal vaginal atresia, transverse vaginal septum, and cervical atresia, should be performed. On physical examination, the imperforate hymen with hematocolpos will appear as a bluish-colored bulging membrane without the typical hymenal fringe; distal vaginal atresia may appear as a pink vaginal dimple and may be bulging without a hymenal fringe; and a low transverse vaginal septum usually will have a normal hymen with more proximal obstruction of the vaginal canal. A rectal examination often will identify a bulging of the proximal vagina; imaging studies are indicated to delineate internal anatomic structures, and postpubertal pelvic imaging usually will reveal hematocolpos, or hematometra, or both.

### Multicenter pivotal study demonstrates safety and efficacy of a new cellulite procedure: final results at 12 months [^15544e80]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

See the Commentary on this article.

Occurring primarily in the buttocks and thighs, cellulite affects 80%to 90% of post-pubertal women across all races and ethnicities and, for some, can cause embarrassment and emotional distress, negatively impacting quality of life. Females are more prone to cellulite due to the hormone-driven differences in septal arrangement in men and women, which are thought to arise in utero. Although the prevalence and severity of cellulite is influenced by sex-based anatomical differences, cellulite is a multifactorial condition also influenced by weight, hormones, age-based changes in skin, genetic influences, and lifestyle factors. The multifactorial nature is reflected in findings from histological studies that show that changes in septa, dermis, and adipose are each associated with the presence of visible cellulite. However, although the skin and subcutaneous fat certainly contribute to the appearance of cellulite, the force imposed on the dermis by fibrous septal bands appears to be both sufficient and necessary to cause the skin dimpling characteristic of cellulite. In support of this concept, a comprehensive review of clinical data revealed that durable efficacy was achieved only with strategies targeting septa, further implicating the focal tension imposed on the dermis by this fibrous tissue as the primary cause of cellulite.

### Invited discussion on: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the incidences of complications following facial threadlifting [^81c92246]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
a Preoperative (front view) — the sagging jowls and convex contour of the face with an absence of a distinct Ogee line are apparent. b Postoperative 6 days — bruising, swelling, surface irregularities and denting with traction lines are seen. c Postoperative 21 days — a more pronounced and attractive Ogee curve of the face is apparent with elevation of the malar mounds and cheeks, eradication of the visible jowls, a narrower lower face and improved jawline. The facial contour is now more consistent with that of a younger face.

If a dissolvable suture has been used, the dimpling will invariably disappear as the barbs or cones dissolve and the holding power of the thread diminishes. But if a permanent thread has been used and there is postoperative dimpling, then the time frame must be examined to see whether it constitutes a complication or not. If the dimpling spontaneously resolves within 4 weeks, it should not be considered a complication, but if the dimpling persists beyond that time and becomes visually unacceptable, requiring manual massage, manipulation or even a subcision, then this should be considered as a complication and duly recorded.

### INNER MACULAR CHANGES AFTER VITRECTOMY WITH INTERNAL LIMITING MEMBRANE PEELING FOR RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT: similarity with Alport syndrome [^938e8508]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The internal limiting membrane (ILM), the innermost basement membrane of the retina, is peeled occasionally during vitreous surgery. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ILM loss on the retina.

Methods

We used optical coherence tomography to retrospectively evaluate retinal changes in 26 eyes (11 ILM-peeled and 15 ILM-unpeeled eyes) of 26 patients after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. In addition, we studied six eyes of three patients with Alport syndrome, in which ILM is genetically impaired.

Results

We observed significant inner retinal displacement of the foveal pit toward the optic disk with inner retinal thickening in the nasal area (fellow, 191.9 ± 24.3 μm vs. affected, 210.3 ± 31.4 μm; P = 0.048), inner retinal thinning in the temporal area (fellow, 174.3 ± 18.3 μm vs. affected, 142.2 ± 23.6 μm; P < 0.001), foveal thickening (ILM-unpeeled, 217.0 ± 39.4 μm vs. ILM-peeled, 302.0 ± 86.2 μm; P = 0.006), inner retinal dimples predominantly in the temporal area, and deviation between the foveal pit and foveal bulge. Eyes with Alport syndrome exhibited similar findings.

Conclusion

Internal limiting membrane loss seems to cause characteristic inner retinal changes of the macula in both congenital and acquired conditions.

### Expanding the clinical spectrum of phenotypes caused by pathogenic variants in PLOD2 [^a9e61db6]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a strikingly heterogeneous group of disorders with a broad range of phenotypic variations. It is also one of the differential diagnoses in bent bone dysplasias along with campomelic dysplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia and can usually be distinguished by decreased bone mineralization and bone fractures. Bent bone dysplasias also include syndromes such as kyphomelic dysplasia (MIM:211350) and mesomelic dysplasia Kozlowski-Reardon (MIM249710), both of which have been under debate regarding whether or not they are a real entity or simply a phenotypic manifestation of another dysplasia including OI. Bruck syndrome type 2 (BRKS2; MIM:609220) is a rare form of autosomal recessive OI caused by biallelic PLOD2 variants and is associated with congenital joint contractures with pterygia. In this report, we present six patients from four families with novel PLOD2 variants. All cases had multiple fractures. Other features ranged from prenatal lethal severe angulation of the long bones as in kyphomelic dysplasia and mesomelic dysplasia Kozlowski-Reardon through classical Bruck syndrome to moderate OI with normal joints. Two siblings with a kyphomelic dysplasia-like phenotype who were stillborn had compound heterozygous variants in PLOD2 (p. Asp585Val and p. Ser166*). One infant who succumbed at age 4 months had a bent bone phenotype phenotypically like skeletal dysplasia Kozlowski-Reardon (with mesomelic shortening, camptodactyly, retrognathia, cleft palate, skin dimples, but also with fractures). He was homozygous for the nonsense variant (p. Trp561*). Two siblings had various degrees of Bruck syndrome caused by the homozygous missense variant, p. His687Arg. Furthermore a boy with a clinical presentation of moderate OI had a possibly pathogenic homozygous variant p. Trp588Cys. Our experience of six patients with biallelic pathogenic variants in PLOD2 expands the phenotypic spectrum in the PLOD2-related phenotypes. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Importance of colposcopy impression in the early diagnosis of posthysterectomy vaginal cancer [^89a56934]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Colposcopy is essential for the early detection of vaginal cancer. When the pathology of colposcopy-directed biopsy showed vaginal HSIL whereas the colposcopy impression is suspicion of cancer, up to 30.2% of cases were confirmed as having cancer by vaginectomy in our study. For the early detection of VaIN or invasive cancers, suturing the vagina transvaginally help sufficiently inspect vaginal epithelia through colposcopy. In the laparoscopic and abdominal suturing of the vagina, the 2 ends of the vaginal apex should not be sutured to the cardinal ligaments stump to avoid the formation of vaginal dimples that are difficult to inspect and biopsy in colposcopy (see Figure 2).

### Clinical phenotype of FOXP1 syndrome: parent-reported medical signs and symptoms in 40 individuals [^16b4454a]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The first studies on patients with forkhead-box protein P1 (FOXP1) syndrome reported associated global neurodevelopmental delay, autism symptomatology, dysmorphic features and cardiac and urogenital malformations. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of congenital abnormalities in an unbiased cohort of patients with FOXP1 syndrome and to document rare complications.

Methods

Patients with FOXP1 syndrome were included, mostly diagnosed via whole-exome sequencing for neurodevelopmental delay. A parent-report questionnaire was used to assess medical signs and symptoms, including questions about features rated as most burdensome by patients and their family.

Results

Forty individuals were included, 20 females and 20 males. The mean age at assessment was 13.2 years (median 8.5 years; range 2–54 years; ≥ 18years n = 7). Seven adults were included. All patients had developmental problems, including cognitive, communication, social-emotional and motor delays. The most prevalent medical signs and symptoms include delayed bladder control, sleeping problems, hypermetropia, strabismus, sacral dimple, undescended testes, abnormal muscle tone and airway infections. The most burdensome complaints for patients with FOXP1 syndrome, as perceived by parents, include intellectual disability, impaired communication, behaviour problems, lack of age-appropriate self-reliance, attention problems and anxiety. According to parents, patients have quite similar reported symptoms, although incontinence, obsessions and a complex sensory profile have a higher ranking.

Conclusion

The results of this study may be used to further guide medical management and identify patient priorities for future research targeted on those features of FOXP1 syndrome that most impair quality of life of patients and their families.

### Insights into the pathophysiology of cellulite: a review [^1ae9cac0]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Subcision

One of the first studies of manual subcision was a retrospective study of 232 women with Grade-2 or Grade-3 cellulite of the buttocks and thighs, with improvement assessed by photographs. After 1 treatment session, 183 (78.9%) participants reported being satisfied with the improvement, and 47 (20.3%) participants had "reasonable results." The improvement in cellulite appearance was reported to be persistent (> 2 years) in 9.9% (n = 23) of participants. However, the size of the cohort available for evaluation at that post-treatment interval (≥ 2 years) and the percentage of patients available for long-term follow-up who had persistent improvement were unclear. If there was evidence of durable improvement in 9.9% of patients at > 2 years, then these results are consistent with historical anecdotal experience indicating that manual subcision often has late recurrence. Also, improvements were not quantified according to the cellulite grading scale used to score pretreatment cellulite severity. In a multicenter study of 200 women who underwent 1 procedure with a manual subcision device for cellulite, mean improvement of 8.1 (range, 7.3–9.4) on a 10-point scale was reported at 6 months postprocedure, based on photographic evidence (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table S1). A study of manual subcision in 2 women evaluated anatomical changes with MRI imaging in addition to quantifying cellulite severity using the CSS for up to 7 months post-treatment; MRI imaging demonstrated that baseline dimple location correlated with the presence of thick fibrous septae located beneath the dimple. Following manual subcision, MRI imaging confirmed the septae were no longer present beneath the dimple at 7 months post-treatment, and more importantly, cellulite severity was improved.

### New reconstruction technique in combined tibial and fibular hemimelia [^0e4c9f64]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tibial deficiency is a congenital lower limb deficiency that can lead to a range of tibial abnormalities, from hypoplastic to an entirely absent tibia. The fibula appears and can either be normal or dysplastic. It affects approximately one per million live births in the United States. - This occurrence can be sporadic or may be connected to a familial history. The anomaly might be unilateral or bilateral, present as an isolated deformity, or be a symptom of a malformation syndrome. It most commonly appears as one leg being shorter than the other. Knee and ankle disorders are likely, as well as cutaneous signs the skin like dimples above the head of the fibula or at the end of the tibia.

There are several classification systems for tibial hemimelia. The diagnosis is divided into four presentations established by radiographic findings based on the 1978 Jones classification, which is often used in clinical practice. Kalamchi and Daweupgraded it in 1985, and Webercreated an MRI-based classification in 2008. Paley shaped the most recent classification system in 2003, which was updated again in 2016.

Treatment options for tibial hemimelia are still controversial. The benchmark for severe cases of total tibial hemimelia is through-knee amputation and prosthetic fitting. - Successful cases of amputation during infancy have been reported in the literature. Although families frequently oppose it, the functional outcomes of amputation, the most traditional method of treatment for tibial hemimelia, are remarkable. The treatment method varies depending on the presence of the proximal tibia, the presence of the patella, and the quadriceps mechanism.

We hereby present two cases of tibial hemimelia that are not included in any classification system, alongside a new surgical technique that will pave the way for alternative treatment methods.

### Possible genetic correlation of an occipital dermal sinus in a mother and son. case report [^04d62884]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Occipital dermal sinuses (ODSs) are congenital lesions located in the midline and characterized by a cutaneous pit or dimple. The intracranial extension as well as the associated symptoms are variable. To date, a familial occurrence of these lesions has not been reported. In this paper the authors report on a 2-year-old boy with an ODS and intracranial hypertension. The boy's mother had a similar lesion but did not have any complaints. Following their experience with this case and a literature review, the authors suggest that there may be a genetic basis in certain instances of ODS.

### Invited discussion on: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the incidences of complications following facial threadlifting [^c5ccdd5e]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In the APTOS procedure or the Woffles Threadlift, every patient has some dimpling or surface undulations at the conclusion of the operation. If there is no dimpling at all, the result will neither be significant nor long lasting. Most of these dents will have ironed themselves out within a week or two (due to facial movements and mastication), failing which they may need gentle finger manipulation to massage free, the points of puckering. Rarely have we encountered dimpling beyond three weeks (See Figs. 1 a-c, 2 a-c).

Case presentation

The proband is an 8-year-old female patient with an unknown family history who experienced intrauterine growth restriction. She was born prematurely at 28 weeks, with a birth weight of 1700 g (99.6th percentile). At six months after birth, she presented with hypothyroidism and received appropriate pharmaceutical treatment. At seven months of age, she developed status epilepticus, requiring eight days of intensive care; she was also diagnosed with congenital heart disease, characterized by persistent truncus arteriosus (type II) and interatrial communication (ostium secundum type). Surgical correction of the cardiac abnormalities was performed at nine months of age.

At 4 years old, she underwent her initial evaluation by clinical genetics, presenting with a height, weight, and head circumference of 87 cm (-3.79 SD), 8.65 kg (− 4.5 SD), and 43.5 cm (-4.1 SD), respectively. The physical examination revealed profound developmental delay, absence of speech, thick and coarse hair, a triangular forehead hair pattern, thick eyebrows, synophrys, microcephaly, facial asymmetry, a thin nasal bridge, a bifid nasal tip, dysmorphic ears, strabismus, low set and posteriorly rotated ears with prominent antihelix, micrognathia, and a right equinovarus deformity that was correctable both actively and passively. Additional findings included bilateral dimples on the elbows and knees, sacral dimples, a unique right palmar crease, bilateral camptodactyly, brachydactyly of the third and fourth finger on the right hand and the fourth finger of the left hand, hypotonia, pectus excavatum, well-defined musculature, aggression and disorganized movements (Fig. 1).

### Comparison of cellulite severity scales and imaging methods [^ddb89bba]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

DiBernardo Scoring System

DiBernardo et al developed a photonumeric scale in which the number of evident dimples and the severity of linear undulations (contour irregularities) are graded from 0 to 4 (Figures 3 and 4). This scale combines elements of both the general (qualitative) Nürnberger-Müller staging and the more detailed (quantitative) CSS.

Figure 3.
The DiBernardo scoring system for evaluating cellulite dimples in women. The number of evidence dimples are rated on a 0 to 4 scale. Each photo is marked with 5 circles, which may or may not contain a dimple. This ensures that the evaluator is not confused by nondimpling irregularities and avoids bias by not being explicitly told where dimples are located. Photos show (A) score 0 (no dimples); (B) score 1 (1 dimple); (C) score 2 (2 dimples); (D) score 3 (3 dimples); (E) score 4 (4 or more dimples). Reprinted with permission from DiBernardo et al.

### A simple technique to create cheek dimples [^b06f0315]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cheek dimple is a commonly requested aesthetic procedure, especially in the Arabian Gulf area.

Aim

This work describes the authors' experience in creation of cheek dimples using simple rapid technique.

Patients and Methods

This study included 116 dimples in 74 patients. The dimple is done through an intraoral stab incision and prolene suture to fix the dermis of the cheek skin to the underlying buccinator muscle.

Results

Eighty-six percent of patients had satisfactory results. The most common complications were fading or complete disappearance of the dimple in 14 dimples and infection in 5 patients.

Conclusions

This technique is very simple, very rapid, easy to execute, and gives satisfactory results in up to 86% of patients. This article also highlights the important information that must be discussed with the patients preoperatively.

### Infantile transient smooth muscle contraction of the skin in a 1-month-old girl [^0f694e17]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 1-month-old healthy girl presented to the pediatric dermatology clinic with a history of episodic dimpling and rippling of the bilateral lower extremities, lasting for approximately 30 seconds and occurring several times each day. On occasion, the upper extremities were also involved. Her mother reported that these episodes began at birth and often coincided with shifting temperature, especially during diaper changes. In between these episodes, the infant's skin appeared normal. On physical examination, the skin of the patient's bilateral lower extremities appeared rippled and subtly blanched with no other pigmentary change or hypertrichosis (see Fig 1 and Supplementary Video 1, available via Mendeley at). The history and physical exam suggested a diagnosis of infantile transient smooth muscle contraction of the skin. Three years later, the patient's episodes had significantly decreased in frequency over time but were still occurring occasionally on the lower extremities. At the time of follow up, the patient continued to grow and develop normally.

### On the early identification and characterization of pear blister canker viroid, apple dimple fruit viroid, peach latent mosaic viroid and chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid [^18c3861d]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The conclusive evidence that PBCVd is the causal agent of PBC disease was achieved by the fulfillment of Koch's postulates. Since PBCVd does not induce the typical PBC symptoms in young pear seedlings, buds of the indicator A20 were grafted on pear 'Fieudiere' seedlings that were previously inoculated with purified PBCVd RNA preparations. One-two years later, PBC characteristic symptoms were observed on the A20 branches developed from the grafted buds, and PBCVd RNA was recovered from symptomatic tissues. The same authors also provided the first insights into the genetic variability of PBCVd through the identification of different sequence variants (using conventional Sanger sequencing) that revealed the quasiespecies nature of this viroid, as previously proposed for RNA viruses. A high number of point mutations affecting the PBCVd CCR have been reported, and many complete viroid variants from different isolates, hosts and geographic origin have been characterized, allowing the identification of 115 polymorphic positions distributed along the viroid genome and showing that the viroid size may range from 312 to 317 nt. Interestingly, most polymorphic positions map at loops and/or are compensatory mutations preserving the secondary structure foreseen for PBCVd (Fig. 2 A) (and data not shown). In this regard, a refined secondary structure, more closely related to the rod-like one proposed for other pospiviroids, was later on proposed for PBCVd based on data obtained by the SHAPE technology.

### Validated assessment scales for cellulite dimples on the buttocks and thighs in female patients [^243cfbd6]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New treatment methods for cellulite require globally accepted scales for aesthetic research and patient evaluation.

Objective

To develop a set of grading scales for objective assessment of cellulite dimples on female buttocks and thighs and assess their reliability and validity.

Materials and Methods

Two photonumeric grading scales were created and validated for dimples in the buttocks in female patients: Cellulite Dimples-At Rest, and Cellulite Dimples-Dynamic. Sixteen aesthetic experts rated photographs of 50 women in 2 validation sessions. Responses were analyzed to assess inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.

Results

Overall inter-rater reliability and intra-rater reliability were both "almost perfect" (≥ 0.81, intraclass correlation efficient and weighted kappa) for the At Rest scale. For the Dynamic scale, inter-rater reliability and intra-rater reliability were "substantial" (0.61–0.80). There was a high correlation between the cellulite scales and body mass index, age, weight, and skin laxity assessments.

Conclusion

Consistent outcomes between raters and by individual raters at 2 time points confirm the reliability of the cellulite dimple grading scales for buttocks and thighs in female patients and suggest they will be a valuable tool for use in research and clinical practice.

### The cochlear dimple: a novel landmark for cochlear protection during middle fossa surgery – A cadaveric laboratory investigation [^f40afa96]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cochlear safety is paramount during middle fossa surgery because of the proximity of the cochlea to adjacent potential surgical targets such as the internal auditory canal (IAC). Several proposed methods are based on general anatomical relationships and distance averages between the cochlea and adjacent structures or reconstruction of lines drawn between other structures around the cochlea. We assessed the feasibility and safety of using the cochlear dimple as a direct cochlear localization landmark during a middle fossa approach to the IAC.

Methods

The middle fossa approach was simulated in 13 fresh cadaveric temporal bone specimens and 2 intact heads (4 sides). The middle fossa rhomboid was drilled to expose the anterior and superior aspects of the IAC and the cochlear dimple.

Results

The cochlear dimple was identified as a triangular depression in the distal dura of the anterior IAC with a mean distance of 3.2 mm from the laterally located cochlea. In no specimen did exposure of the cochlear dimple violate the cochlea. The cochlear dimple was identifiable in all specimens, and it was created by the divergence of the distal intracanalicular course of the facial and cochlear nerves near the IAC fundus.

Conclusion

The cochlear dimple is a direct anatomical landmark that can be used to localize the cochlea. It is the only landmark whose establishment is not contingent on the identification of any other structure. It may be used as an additional measure to protect the cochlea during middle fossa surgery.

### The 2023 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for mechanical circulatory support: a 10-year update [^2bd58105]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Left ventricular coring procedure for LVAD inflow — The left ventricle is exposed to access the apex by placing several sponges into the pericardial cavity, or by placing posterior pericardial sutures, with the apex identified by palpating the dimple and marked as an inflow site, and some surgeons favor an inflow site located slightly anterior to the left apical dimple of the left ventricle. Appropriate positioning of the inflow cannula guided by the mitral valve alignment needs to be confirmed using transesophageal echocardiogram regardless of the pump type, and the apical ventriculotomy created with a manufacture-provided coring knife can precede ("core-then-sew") or follow ("sew-then-core") the placement of the inflow sewing ring. The left ventricular cavity is then inspected for trabeculations, prominent trabeculations are excised, any thrombus is removed, and when mobile left ventricular thrombi exist it may be prudent to carefully open the apical area and excise myocardium in a circular fashion for the inflow instead of coring, with aortic cross clamp and induction of cardioplegic myocardial arrest considered as well. The coring knife might not work in special circumstances such as an existing left ventricular patch or extensive endocardial calcification, and alternative LVAD inflow sites, such as the left ventricular inferior wall (diaphragmatic surface), have been reported without widespread use.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum-aaes injections for volumetric change of cellulite dimples and gluteal contouring [^714d1aa8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Collagenase clostridium histolyticum-aaes (CCH) is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe cellulite.

Objective

This is a retrospective image review of subjects previously enrolled in Cohort 2 of the EN3835-305 trial to determine the effects of CCH on volumetric changes of cellulite dimples and overall gluteal contouring.

Methods

In this retrospective analysis, photographs from Day 90 and Day 180 were superimposed on baseline images and the volumetric change of each treated cellulite dimple was quantified. Side-by-side photographs of the buttocks were also evaluated for change in gluteal contour using the Physician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (PGAIS).

Results

Fifty-eight female subjects and 403 cellulite dimples were evaluated. Three-dimensional imaging analysis revealed a significant improvement in total negative dimple volume at both Day 90 and Day 180 of 27% and 26%, respectively (p < .001 and p = .002, respectively). At Day 90, the overall gluteal contour, as signified by the mean PGAIS among the 3 blinded dermatologists, was rated as +1 (improved) in 27% (n = 17) of the subjects. At Day 180, the mean PGAIS was +1 (improved) or +2 (very much improved) in 39% (n = 26) of the subjects.

Conclusion

CHH is an effective tool for treating cellulite dimples and improving gluteal contour.

### Mapping causal links between prefrontal cortical regions and intra-individual behavioral variability [^c3d8a0b7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Inactivation studies using chemicals such as GABA agonizts (e.g. Muscimol) or neurotoxic compounds (e.g. Ibotenic acid) may allow localized inactivation or death of neurons at the injection sites, but cannot mimic the effects of complete disruption of large cortical regions, which were targeted in this study. Increasing the concentration or volume of injections for making complete lesions would cause certain involvement of nearby cortical areas, which would prevent proper interpretation of the lesion effects on cognitive functions. In addition, new molecular-genetic techniques for controlled inactivation/activation of neuronal populations (e.g. DREADD or optogenetics), which have been used in rodent models, are still being developed for primates. The success rate in transferring the genetic codes to primate neurons is still low and therefore not feasible for complete and bilateral inactivation of deep and large cortical areas, which were targeted in this study. In this study, we used visually-guided aspiration lesion technique, which is still one of the most suitable and currently-available procedure in macaque monkeys to address the goal of this project. Although, the possibility of damage to the immediately underlying white matter cannot be ruled out, we made utmost care during surgery to avoid any deep damage to the underlying white matter and therefore, the possibility of any significant damage to major fascicles was very low.

Intended extent of lesions within different brain regions

Supplementary figures S6 and S7 include the details of lesion extent for individual monkeys in each lesion group.

Anterior cingulate sulcus (ACCs) lesion

The extent of intended lesions in the ACC group (Figs. 1b, S 6) covered the cortex in the dorsal and ventral banks and depth of the anterior cingulate sulcus, which correspond to cytoarchitectonic areas 24c, 24c'. The posterior border of the lesion in the cingulate sulcus started at an imaginary line passing through the midpoint of the precentral dimple and the lesion extended anteriorly (rostrally) to include the entire extent of the cingulate sulcus. For the two out of the four ACC-lesioned monkeys, the lesions were complete and as intended, however in another ACC-lesioned monkey the lesion extent was larger than intended in one hemisphere, and in the other monkey, the lesion did not extend as far posteriorly as in the other three monkeys to avoid cutting the ascending branches of the anterior cerebral artery.

Discussion

WDSTS morbidity ranges from 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 250,000 people. According to a summary of the clinical phenotypes of 260 children, the most common symptoms were growth retardation, intellectual disability, delayed motor or speech development, and distinctive facial features (including hypertelorism, wide nasal bridge, down-slanting palpebral fissures, and hirsutism). Rare phenotypes include sparse hair, ectropion of the lateral third of the lower eyelids, wide thumbs, absent palmar creases, pancytopenia, and increased number of eosinophils. The majority of clinical presentations in the five patients in our study were consistent with these common phenotypes. Rare phenotypes in the five patients included neck webbing in patients 1 and 2, and multiple facial nevi in patient 3. In addition, clinical phenotypes varied with age. In neonates and infants, growth retardation, hypotonia, delayed motor or speech development, feeding difficulties, recurrent infections, and accompanying malformations, such as cardiac disorders and sacral dimples, were predominant, while short stature, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, hirsutism, and mental behavioral disorders were predominant in older children. Genetic testing is necessary for early diagnosis because of the complex clinical phenotypes. Several severe phenotypes, such as abnormal fetal heart tracing accompanying acidosis, persistently poor spontaneous respiratory effort, third-degree atrioventricular block, and immune defects, have been reported. Thus, early diagnosis and symptomatic treatment are critical for avoiding poor prognosis.

### Prevalence, incidence, and treatments of dupuytren's disease in the United States: results from a population-based study [^021ca3fd]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

Dupuytren's Disease Symptoms and Family History

Table 4 presents the weighted estimates of the disease symptoms among the Dupuytren's patients (definition 4). The most commonly reported symptom at the time of the survey was a hard bump on one or both hands (69%), followed by dimpling in one hand (30%) and a ropelike growth (cord) in one hand (23%, Table 4). More than one third of Dupuytren's patients indicated that their fingers were bent to the extent that it interfered with everyday activities, such as picking up items, putting on gloves, buttoning a shirt, or washing hands or face (data not shown in table).

Table 4
Summary of current Dupuytren's disease symptoms among Dupuytren's patients

Percents are weighted averages of the stratum-specific estimates

The first hand symptom noticed was most commonly a bump or a knot that had developed on the palm or at the base of the fingers (61%). A substantially lower percentage of Dupuytren's patients reported that a ropelike growth was the first symptom noticed, followed by fingers bent toward the palm or dimpling (Table 4). Nearly all Dupuytren's patients (82%) indicated that the first symptom noticed appeared only in one hand.

Eighteen percent of Dupuytren's patients reported that an immediate family member had one or more symptoms consistent with Dupuytren's: hard bump (10%), bent fingers (9%), dimpling (5%), and a ropelike growth (5%). Only 3% of patients indicated that an immediate family member had a diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease, Dupuytren's contracture, or palmar fibromatosis.

### Complications of thread lift about skin dimpling and thread extrusion [^15e35eac]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Thread lift is known to be a minimally invasive procedure for facial rejuvenation. Barbed absorbable threads become the mainstream of thread lift, including cog threads and cone threads. The efficacy of thread lift depends on three factors: fixation point, vector, and exit point. The main target layer of threads is subcutaneous layer. How to design thread numbers, positions, depth, and vector is an art. We report three patients with complications of thread lift about dimpling and thread extrusion. We treated skin dimpling with manual therapy and subcision, and removed thread when thread extrusion occurred.

The satisfaction level of thread lift from patients and surgeons increased over time. Recent research results show that thread lift for facial rejuvenation was safe, effective, and has fewer complications. 1 Initial use of nonabsorbable threads produced side effects and had a frequent complication and revision rate. Newer published methods using absorbable sutures have shown safer and more effective. 2 The complications of silhouette thread included temporal pain, visible dermal pinching, hematoma, asymmetry, and suture palpability. 3 The complications of polydioxanone (PDO) thread included dimpling, bruise, asymmetry, thread extrusion, and malar eminence accentuation. 4
Case 1: A 29‐year‐old woman presented to our department with thread extrusion on left face for 1 week after she went abroad for thread lift with unknown threads. We found that these barbed threads was too thick to be absorbed. We removed the threads in the direction opposite that of placement (Figures 1 and 2).
Case 2: A 40‐year‐old woman accepted barbed thread lift and had skin dimpling. These depressions were caused by the cogs of threads. The cogs were not strong. Manual therapy was applied on her face to release the tension of cog threads in the direction opposite that of placement (Figures 3 and 4).
Case 3: A 39‐year‐old woman accepted barbed thread lift. Anchoring method of the exit point of thread was applied to her face and resulted in the severe skin dimpling on her left face. The dimpling was due to dermis hooked by thread anchor and manual therapy was in vain. We treated the skin dimpling by 18‐G needle subcision (Figure 5). After three times therapies in 3 months, the threaded areas returned to normal skin appearance.

### Study of a new controlled focal septa release cellulite reduction method [^b07ed884]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Cellulite is the dimpled skin appearance that commonly occurs on the buttocks and thighs of 80% to 90% of postpubertal women. Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated that cellulite depressions are associated with underlying thickened fibrous septa that tether the dermis to the underlying superficial fascia, resulting in the characteristic dimpled appearance of the skin. Increased tension on these septa from sitting, squeezing, or muscle contraction worsens their clinical appearance. Risk factors for cellulite include genetic predisposition, female gender, ethnicity, advancing age, obesity and weight change, and sedentary lifestyle.

The unattractive appearance of cellulite can have a significant negative impact on affected individuals, adversely affecting self-esteem and social activity and causing many to seek medical attention. Common treatments for moderate or severe cellulite are surgical and involve severing the fibrous septa, referred to as subcision. One method of subcision is performed by inserting a hypodermic needle through the skin into the superficial layer between the dermis and superficial fascia to cut the fibrous septa below the dimples seen on the skin surface. Another method of subcision employs a tissue-stabilized, guided device comprised of a motorized reciprocating cutting blade inserted through the skin that is moved through the superficial layer between the dermis and superficial fascia to cut the fibrous septa. A third method is laser-based, where a cannula is inserted through the skin into the superficial layer between the dermis and superficial fascia. A side-firing laser is inserted through the cannula, which cuts the fibrous septa and liquefies local fat. These are procedures that often require numerous incisions with inaccurate targeting of the thickened fibrous septa and can result in bruising, discomfort, ecchymosis, and edema.

### Insights into the assembly of the neovaginal microbiota in mayer-rokitansky-Küster-hauser (MRKH) syndrome patients [^47f72516]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Despite the temporal increase in the similarity with the pre-surgery dimple microbiota on the cohort-level (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Fig. 1c), within-individual similarities were not consistently observed across the patients (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 8). Given that the dimple and the fecal microbiota both significantly contributed to the species pool for colonizing the neovagina, we tested the impact of the respective pre-surgery status of individual species (presence/absence or relative abundance) in the dimple or the stool on their relative abundance in the neovagina. Notably, all significant correlations showed a positive relationship and most were associated with the prior status in the dimple (10 solely with dimple, 3 solely with stool and 3 with both) (geeglm, P adjust < 0.1) (Fig. 6b). Thus for L. crispatus, prior colonization in the dimple not only largely determined acquisition of this species in the neovagina, especially in the 1st post-surgery year (Supplementary Fig. 9a), but also significantly affected its post-surgery relative abundance (Fig. 6b). For other species, such as U. parvum, P. bivia, and A. vaginae, although strain sharing were detected with both the dimple and the stool, their relative abundances in the neovagina were only significantly correlated with their prior status in the dimple (Figs. 4 and 6b, and Supplementary Fig. 9b, c). Interestingly, such an association pattern was even observed for some species with only stool-neovagina strain sharing events, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Figs. 4 and 6b). Of the six species exhibiting significant association with the pre-surgery levels in the stool, including L. iners, P. corporis, P. copri, Peptoniphilus duerdenii, Anaerococcus vaginalis, and Anaerococcus prevotii, L. iners was most intriguing (Fig. 6b). It was highly prevalent and most abundant at both PRE and P2/4Y, and also showed higher rate of putative transmission from the dimple. Nonetheless, its relative abundance in the neovagina was not correlated with its prior status in the dimple (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 9d).

### Insights into the pathophysiology of cellulite: a review [^fb23f16e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A subdermal laser technique using a 1440-nm Nd:YAG laser combined with a side-firing fiber and temperature-sensing cannula can effectively treat cellulite through a combination approach. This approach initiates thermal damage to adipocytes, severing fibrous septae via thermal subcision, and targeting the dermis using the thermal energy of the laser to stimulate an increase in collagen. Four observational studies (n = 107) evaluated the efficacy of the minimally invasive 1440-nm Nd:YAG laser (Cellulaze; Cynosure, Westford, MA) for the treatment of cellulite. – In a study of 10 women with moderate-to-severe cellulite who received a single treatment, significant improvement in skin thickness (ultrasound) and elasticity was demonstrated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment (1, 3, and 6 months, p < .001; 12 months, p ≤ .02) in the treated thigh versus the untreated thigh; however, no significant improvement was seen in cellulite severity. In a subsequent multicenter study of a larger participant population (n = 57), single treatment of bilateral thighs and/or buttocks with the 1440-nm Nd:YAG laser resulted in significant mean improvement from baseline in both dimples and contour scores (5-point scales), as observed via digital photography, at 2 months (dimple: 1.4, p < .001; contour: 1.0, p < .001), 3 months (dimple: 1.4, p < .001; contour: 0.9, p < .001), and 6 months (dimple: 1.5, p < .001; contour: 1.1, p < .001) versus the untreated area. The ≥ 1-point improvement recorded at 6 months was maintained at 12 months in 90% of the treatment sites (46 of 51 treatment areas in 30 patients). A study of 15 women with Grade-2 or Grade-3 cellulite in the thighs and buttocks reported significant improvement after a single treatment in both mean dimple appearance (0–5 scale; baseline, 2.2; 6 months, 1.2; p < .005) and mean contour irregularities (0–5 scale; baseline, 1.9; 6 months, 1.0; p < .005) with the use of 1440-nm Nd:YAG laser, as observed by blinded investigators reviewing 2-D photography. Furthermore, 3-D photography demonstrated that overall mean dimple depth improved by 42% (p = .0002) and 49% (p = .0003) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Using DermaLab Elasticity Module (Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark), 25 women with Grade-2 or Grade-3 posterior or lateral thigh cellulite (Nürnberger-Müller scale) identified significant improvements from baseline in skin elasticity after a single treatment (p < .01) at 2, 3, 6, and 24 months post-treatment with the 1440-nm Nd:YAG laser. Improvements in cellulite severity and dermal thickness were also reported but were not quantified.

### Mosaic structural variation in children with developmental disorders [^e0e908e5]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Female patient 258956 had a number of congenital abnormalities, including a sacral meningocele, polydactyly, bilateral talipes, atrial and ventricular septal defects, pulmonary stenosis, EEG epileptiform activity, facial asymmetry, hirsuitism and hypomelanosis of Ito. At birth, she required neonatal intensive care for apnoea and nasogastric feeding for 10 days. Clinical aCGH (Agilent 8 × 60 K oligoarray) testing performed on blood was normal. The DDD aCGH results from blood and saliva showed upward deviation in the data from assayed saliva tissue, only. Our mosaicism analysis on saliva identified a 44-Mb duplication on chromosome 3q in ∼55% of assayed cells. Thus, it is likely that this event is tissue-limited. Duplications of 3q are associated with joint contractures, talipes, feeding difficulties, hirsuitism and heart defects, including ASD and VSD. There are several patients also present in the DECIPHER database who have duplications overlapping this large duplication in the child, including 280 551, with hirsuitism, feeding difficulties and global developmental delay; 283 584, with sacral dimple and low set ears; 1561, with frontal bossing and sacral dimple. Several examples of duplications of 3q have meningocele [p.145]. Given the consistency of phenotypes with the proband and these patients, the mosaic mutation was considered very likely pathogenic.

Female patient 261373 had intrauterine growth retardation with a birth weight of 2.0 kg (first centile). She had moderate developmental delay, severe speech delay, a high-arched palate and prognathism. An array on blood lymphocytes was performed and identified no abnormalities. Our SNP mosaicism analysis on saliva identified a gain of 12p in an estimated 44% of assayed cells, suggesting tissue-specific mosaicism as the cause. The event was detected also by confirmatory aCGH from saliva, and interphase FISH on buccal DNA of 100 cells identified a triplication of 12p in 12% of cells. Triplications of 12p (tetrasomy 12p) are the cause of the clinical syndrome known as Pallister–Killian mosaic syndrome, which is consistent with many of her phenotypic features and the diagnosis was conveyed to the family.

### Characteristics of the retinal surface after internal limiting membrane peeling in highly myopic eyes [^075224d3]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To document the characteristics of the retinal surface using en face optical coherence tomography (OCT) after internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for myopic macular diseases.

Design

Retrospective, interventional case series.

Methods

We examined 20 eyes of 20 patients with high myopia who underwent PPV with ILM peeling. The patients were followed for at least 6 months postoperatively, and OCT images were examined using spectral-domain OCT. To assess the incidence and patterns of the retinal dimple sign, we reconstructed en face OCT images and quantified the number of dimples during the follow-up period.

Results

We identified 3 retinal dimple signs (ie, foveal-centered pattern, linear pattern, and paravascular pattern). The total numbers of retinal dimples at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively were 0, 31.8 ± 23.7, 47.95 ± 29.5, and 54.6 ± 30.7, respectively. There were significantly more dimples temporal to the macula compared to the other 3 quadrants at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively (P = 0.025, P = 0.0021, and P = 0.0060, respectively). However, the retinal sensitivities assessed by microperimetry were not correlated with the number of dimples.

Conclusion

Development of the retinal dimple sign after PPV and ILM peeling in highly myopic eyes was seen in all cases on en face OCT images. Although retinal dimples are benign, care should be taken after ILM peeling in highly myopic eyes.

### Ultrasonography of the spine in neonates and young infants with a sacral skin dimple [^59392962]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2002). Low credibility.

The relationship between a sacral skin dimple and an underlying intraspinal abnormality was assessed in 50 consecutive neonates and young infants who were referred to the authors' institution for ultrasonography of the spine because of the presence of a sacral skin dimple. There were 24 girls and 26 boys, with a mean age of 32 days (range 1–151). All the patients were neurologically normal. Of the 50 patients, 2 had a concomitant hairy patch. No patient with a sacral skin dimple demonstrated an intraspinal lesion by ultrasonography. Ultrasonography of the spine is not indicated as a routine study for a neurologically intact infant with an isolated sacral skin dimple.

### Biallelicvariant p. (arg114Leu) causes meier-Gorlin syndrome with craniosynostosis [^a064da7e]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A 2-month-old girl was referred for genetic evaluation due to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), short stature, microcephaly and facial dysmorphisms. She was the only child of a non-consanguineous healthy Portuguese couple with an unremarkable family history. During pregnancy, IUGR was diagnosed at the 29th week of gestation. Fetal structural abnormalities, infections and teratogens were excluded. She was born at 37 +5 gestational weeks, by eutocic delivery with Apgar scores 9 and 10, at first and fifth minutes. At birth, her weight was 2260 g (1st centile; −2.2 SD), her length was 47 cm (~10th centile) and her head circumference (HC) was 30.5 cm (< 1st centile; −3 SD). She had neonatal jaundice and mild hypotonia. Poor suction and feeding difficulties were noticed and gastro-oesophageal reflux was diagnosed. Newborn metabolic screening was normal. Newborn hearing screening failed, but auditory-evoked potentials at age of 10 days were within the normal electrophysiological limits.

She presented with craniofacial dysmorphic features, which evolved with age (figure 1). Her head was microcephalic and brachycephalic and her neck was short. At 6 months, her face was round with a narrow forehead and a low hairline, mid-face hypoplasia and microretrognathia. Ears were small, low set and posteriorly rotated with an atretic external auditory canal. Eyes were prominent and palpebral fissures were downslanted. Her nose was short with a wide, depressed nasal bridge, a convex nasal ridge, hypoplastic nares, low insertion of the columella and long philtrum. Her mouth was small with downturned corners, full lips and a high narrowed palate. She also had short and tapering fingers, short toes, a sacral dimple, an anteriorly placed anus and hypopigmented macules on the abdomen and upper back. At 6 years of age, hypopigmented macules were also observed on the arms and legs.

### The philtrum in cleft lip: review of anatomy and techniques for construction [^1866bd8d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The philtrum is imperfectly formed in both unilateral and bilateral cleft lip. Surgical construction of this exquisite feature in the upper lip is challenging and often takes a back seat to construction of Cupid's bow and the nose. However, the philtrum is one of the defining features of a normal lip. The purpose of this review is to compile information on philtral anatomy and techniques for construction to guide the reader on his or her own quest to optimize cleft lip repair. In this article, we review the normal anatomy of the philtral dimple and ridges, with particular attention to pars peripheralis configuration. We also review methods for philtral construction during primary labial repair and secondary labial revision. For unilateral cleft lip, eversion of orbicularis oris muscle is necessary to build a philtral ridge. For bilateral cleft lip, emphasis is on proper design of the philtral flap and efforts to simulate a dimple and ridges. For secondary philtral correction, techniques include complete labial revision with various types of muscular re-repair and autologous philtral ridge augmentation. Objective methods are needed to document the efficacy of the many techniques for philtral construction and reconstruction.

Ethical statement

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Children's Hospital (Grant No. 2022R043-E01), and the family of the patient provided written informed consent for access to clinical data and genetic analysis.

Case report

A 6-month-old female patient, born to non-consanguineous healthy parents, presented with nystagmus and hypothyroidism detected during newborn metabolic screening. Ophthalmic evaluation revealed optic disc hypoplasia and retinal abnormalities. During hospitalization in the ophthalmology department, abnormal facial features, developmental delays, and feeding difficulties were observed. Consequently, a multidisciplinary consultation involving the neurology and rehabilitation medicine departments was initiated to perform a comprehensive physical examination and evaluate her neurological development.

The patient is the second child, delivered through the cesarean section at full term, with a birth weight of 2.48 kg, and without complications during delivery. Prenatal anomalies comprised increased fetal nuchal translucency and intrauterine growth restriction. External fixation osteosynthesis was performed for bilateral auricular protrusion on the third day after birth. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacral and coccygeal regions revealed a sacral dimple, which led to the diagnosis of a spinal meningocele at one month. No surgical intervention was performed, and she continued to require diapers at the age of 3 and a half years despite the absence of urinary or bowel problems.

### Pediatric congenital buttock sinus tract: 10-year experience in a single institution [^a09d95a9]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The etiology, clinical characteristics, management and prognosis of pediatric congenital buttock sinus tract are rarely documented in the literature, and this is the first consecutive case study up to the present.

After retrospectively analyzing the clinical data, we found that congenital buttock sinus tract had an obvious female predominance in the morbidity; the male to female ratio was 1:1.75. Most of the patients had recurrence and complex buttock and perianal infection; invasive treatment was performed several times with no cure, and the situation was always treated as fistula-in-ano. The overall prior treatment time was 11 months. The reasons for an inaccurate diagnosis may be as follows. First, compared with the common fistula-in-ano, pediatric congenital buttock sinus tract has a relatively low morbidity. The clinical manifestations are extremely similar and nonspecific; both of the diseases could manifest as buttock and postanal redness and swelling, ulceration and suppuration, without difficult in defecation or constipation. Besides, a few patients with fistula-in-ano also had recurrence after appropriate management, due to unfavorable nursing and hygiene habits. However, unlike fistula-in-ano, which has a male predominance, congenital buttock sinus tract has a female predominance. Second, compared with rectum duplication which exhibits a congenital dimple-like external orifice in the postanal area and may have defecation excrete or early infection, pediatric congenital buttock sinus tract has dimple without infection at the beginning, and latter turned on infection through the dimple around 42 months of age; and the postanal area dimple has lower incidence than the buttock dimple in pediatric congenital buttock sinus tract. Third, different from currarino syndrome which has retrorectal neoplasm, sacrum and anorectal malformation, pediatric congenital buttock sinus tract patients have no sacrum or anorectal malformation, and the retrorectal neoplasm is always dermoid or epidermoid cyst, with no difficult in defecation, and the cyst is impalpable through DER. Exact diagnosis is of great significance, which include a congenital dimple on the buttock and/or postanal area since birth, latter turned on infection through the dimple including, no difficult in defecation, and no sacrum or anorectal malformation. In addition, radiology results, especially MRI, contribute greatly to the accurate diagnosis, as it may disclose a definite retrorectal cyst connected to the dimple through a sinus tract.

### Nasofrontal dermoid sinus cyst: report of two cases [^6e4e9786]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Nasofrontal dermoid sinus cysts are rare. The embryological origin, presentation, treatment, and genetic associations of two cases of these cysts are discussed. Emphasis is placed on physical findings and the importance of addressing both the intracranial and extracranial components.

Clinical Presentation

The first patient, a 33-year-old woman, sought care for chemical meningitis. As a child, she was differentiated from her identical twin sister by a dimple on the tip of her nose. The second patient, a 34-year-old man, sought care for new-onset seizures. Since birth, he had a dimple on the tip of his nose. As a child, he had undergone resection of a nasal cyst. Imaging studies in both patients indicated a midline anterior cranial base mass within the falx and a defect in the crista galli.

Intervention

Both patients underwent biorbitofrontal nasal craniotomy. A bifrontal craniotomy was performed first, then removal of the orbitonasal ridge. The dermoid and involved falx were resected. The sinus tract was followed through the crista galli and resected up to the osteocartilaginous junction in the nose. The remainder of the tract was resected via a small incision through the nares. The dura was closed primarily by mobilizing the dura along the sides of the crista galli. After surgery, both patients still possessed their sense of smell.

Conclusion

Nasofrontal dermoid sinus cysts have a unique embryological origin. A midline basal frontal dermoid associated with a dimple on the nasal surface with or without protruding hair and sebaceous discharge is the pathognomonic presentation. It is important to address both the intracranial and extracranial component surgically. Although concomitant anomalies and familial clustering have been described, most cases are spontaneous occurrences.

Treatments of complications of thread lift are highly valued. Suture removal is necessary when displacement of the barbed threads happen. Bertossi et al advised the patient to massage the thread three times a day for 6 days, and the threads subsequently were extracted by the surgeon in the direction opposite that of placement. Mild skin dimpling, erythema, infection, and temporary facial stiffness that happened occasionally. 5

Lee et al published a study about PDO thread for Asians. The complications included swelling, bruising, skin dimpling, and asymmetry. 6 Sarigul Guduk and Karaca published a study about 148 patients. The most common complication was skin dimpling and irregularity. The other complications were ecchymosis, suture extrusion, pain, hematoma, infection, and suture migration. 7 Guida et al published a study about poly‐‐lactic acid traction thread treatment for mild‐moderate degree of skin laxity of jawline and neck angle. The complications included edema, swelling, temporary skin contour irregularities, and paresthesia. 8 Archer and Garcia published a study about silhouette instalift thread. The complications includes minor pain, swelling, rippling, dimpling, bruising, bleeding at the entry or exit sites, edema, asymmetry, dysesthesia, skin irregularities, and inflammatory reactions. 9

In these three cases, Case 3 had the severe dimpling complication. The anchor of the thread hooked the dermis too tight. We used 18‐G needle to cut the thread in the dermis. During subcision, a needle cut these thread thereby releasing the tension of the dermis, allowing the skin to rise. Other than dimpling, prevention of severe complications is very important. Doctors should avoid injuring the superficial temporal artery, zygomatico‐orbital artery, transverse facial artery, facial nerve, and parotid duct.

### Insights into the pathophysiology of cellulite: a review [^3d9e8801]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

To improve the reproducibility of the manual procedure, a vacuum-assisted system was introduced to provide precise control of the procedure area and user-selected treatment depth. In a randomized clinical trial, 55 women with moderate-to-severe cellulite (CSS score) underwent a single procedure and reported a significant reduction in mean (SD) CSS score of 2.1 (0.7, p < .0001) and 2.0 (0.8, p < .0001) at the 3- and 12-month follow-up, respectively, via blinded investigator-assessment of photographs (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table S1). At 3 and 12 months postprocedure, 92.7% (51/55) and 94.0% (47/50) of participants achieved ≥ 1-point improvement in CSS score, respectively. At 3 years postprocedure, the mean (SD) reduction in CSS score from baseline remained significant (2.0 [1.0]; p < .0001) for 45 participants from the original study, and 91.1% (41/45) had achieved ≥ 1-point improvement in CSS score. At 5 years postprocedure, the mean reduction in CSS score was maintained (1.8; p < .0001) by 37 participants from the original study, and 87% had achieved ≥ 1-point improvement in CSS score. In a separate study of 16 women, in addition to cellulite improvement (CSS score), a mean improvement of 67.4% in negative volume and 58.4% in minimum dimple height, determined by 3-D imaging 6 months postprocedure, was reported following vacuum-assisted subcision. In a subsequent retrospective study of vacuum-assisted subcision, 23 women with mild-to-moderate cellulite severity reported mean improvement from baseline of 2.9 (buttocks) and 2.8 (thighs), based on photographic assessment (score range, 0–4), using a limited release technique. Overall mean cellulite improvement from baseline was reported as 3.1. Both manual and vacuum-assisted subcision have been efficacious in smoothing the skin topography through the release of the collagen-rich subdermal septae, although durability of this effect has been demonstrated only for vacuum-assisted subcision.

### Fetal phenotype and diagnosis of autosomal dominant robinow syndrome due to novel DVL1 variant [^e482972d]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to abnormal prenatal ultrasound findings of femoral shortening and flattened facial profile, a G2P0 pregnant patient underwent an amniocentesis at 15 weeks of gestation for proband-only exome sequencing. Bioinformatic filtering for genes included on the laboratory's extended skeletal dysplasia panel identified a heterozygous, likely pathogenic, frameshift variant in DVL1 NM_001330311.2:c.1575_1582dup; (p. Pro528ArgfsTer149). Pathogenic variants in DVL1 are associated with autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome (ADRS), a genetic disorder characterized by skeletal dysplasia with genital and craniofacial abnormalities. Prenatal ultrasound in the third trimester noted shortened long bones (first percentile for gestational age), macrocephaly with frontal bossing, short and upturned nose with a wide nasal root, triangular mouth, low pedal arches concerning for rocker-bottom feet, and ambiguous genitalia. A postnatal exam by Medical Genetics confirmed the prenatal findings in addition to hypertelorism, brachydactyly with broad thumbs and halluces, clinodactyly of second fingers, rigid gums with a frontal frenulum, and a sacral dimple. This case describes a novel variant in DVL1 identified in a fetus with prenatal and postnatal phenotypic features consistent with ADRS. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a prenatal molecular diagnosis of the dominant form of Robinow syndrome and the third case to describe prenatal ultrasound findings associated with this diagnosis.

### Towards improved genetic diagnosis of human differences of sex development [^450c692c]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2021). High credibility.

Despite being collectively among the most frequent congenital developmental conditions worldwide, differences of sex development (DSD) lack recognition and research funding. As a result, what constitutes optimal management remains uncertain. Identification of the individual conditions under the DSD umbrella is challenging and molecular genetic diagnosis is frequently not achieved, which has psychosocial and health-related repercussions for patients and their families. New genomic approaches have the potential to resolve this impasse through better detection of protein-coding variants and ascertainment of under-recognized aetiology, such as mosaic, structural, non-coding or epigenetic variants. Ultimately, it is hoped that better outcomes data, improved understanding of the molecular causes and greater public awareness will bring an end to the stigma often associated with DSD.
