## Question

What does aldosterone do to serum potassium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what aldosterone does to serum potassium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology of aldosterone on the distal nephron. Then, I should verify the directionality of its effect on serum potassium. Next, I will consider the magnitude of change and the clinical contexts that modify it, including medications and kidney function. After that, I should review counterregulatory or feed-forward mechanisms that complicate the picture. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology. Aldosterone binds mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal nephron, driving sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion into the urine via ENaC and ROMK channels, which directly lowers serum potassium when aldosterone is appropriately secreted in response to potassium load or volume status, and this is why aldosterone is a key regulator of external potassium balance.

> Wait, let me verify the directionality so I don't overstate it. The canonical effect is that higher aldosterone increases renal potassium excretion and lowers serum potassium, whereas lower aldosterone activity reduces potassium excretion and raises serum potassium; this is precisely why mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and aldosterone synthase inhibitors increase serum potassium by blocking or suppressing aldosterone, respectively [^11655Jfy] [^115p4enL].

> I should confirm the magnitude in real-world settings. In CKD, short-term potassium chloride supplementation increased plasma potassium by about 0.4 mmol/L and simultaneously increased plasma aldosterone, illustrating the feed-forward stimulation of aldosterone by potassium and the system's attempt to maintain balance; conversely, MRAs typically raise potassium by roughly 0.1–0.3 mmol/L on average, with risk rising in CKD or when combined with other RAAS blockade [^1175f6ED] [^115p4enL] [^1155wSxQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about linearity or universality. The effect size depends on baseline potassium, kidney function, sodium delivery to the distal nephron, and concurrent drugs; in primary aldosteronism, excess aldosterone can drive hypokalemia, yet many patients are normokalemic, underscoring that renal and dietary factors modulate the phenotype, and in heart failure or CKD, impaired distal sodium delivery and RAAS blockade blunt kaliuresis and amplify hyperkalemia risk even when aldosterone is high [^113qwjZo] [^115zcqHu] [^1157By8d].

> I need to check counterregulatory and feed-forward mechanisms. Rising serum potassium directly stimulates aldosterone secretion, which then enhances kaliuresis; potassium also inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter, increasing distal sodium delivery and facilitating aldosterone-mediated potassium secretion, and there is evidence for a gastrointestinal-renal kaliuretic axis that can acutely increase potassium excretion independent of aldosterone, which helps explain why modest potassium loads do not always cause overt hyperkalemia in intact systems [^114BmfEW] [^116vCiJh].

> But wait, what if aldosterone is blocked or synthesis is inhibited. I should double-check that both MRAs and aldosterone synthase inhibitors predictably raise serum potassium by removing aldosterone's kaliuretic drive; indeed, finerenone and vicadrostat increase potassium by about 0.2–0.3 mmol/L on average, and clinical guidance emphasizes routine potassium and renal function monitoring when initiating or uptitrating these therapies, especially in CKD or when combined with ACEi/ARB/SGLT2i [^11655Jfy] [^1174EP4u] [^116aq76K].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications so I don't miss practical points. Hyperkalemia risk rises with reduced eGFR, diabetes, concomitant RAAS blockade, and older age, whereas hypokalemia is more typical with loop/thiazide diuretics or primary aldosteronism; careful medication reconciliation, volume optimization, and lab monitoring 1–2 weeks after changes are standard, and in patients with CKD or HF, newer potassium binders can mitigate hyperkalemia to preserve RAASi/MRA therapy that improves outcomes [^1155wSxQ] [^111r5wu5] [^117FVX6D].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Aldosterone lowers serum potassium by increasing renal potassium excretion; when aldosterone is deficient or its receptor is blocked, serum potassium rises, and the magnitude of change is typically modest but clinically meaningful in the right context, so monitoring and risk stratification are essential whenever aldosterone signaling is perturbed [^1144kANq] [^11655Jfy].

Aldosterone increases **renal potassium excretion** by stimulating sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion in the distal nephron, thereby **lowering serum potassium** [^112XawKj]. When aldosterone is blocked or deficient, potassium excretion falls and serum potassium rises, which is why mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone, finerenone) and aldosterone synthase inhibitors can cause **hyperkalemia** [^11655Jfy] [^116SmjEQ]. Clinically, aldosterone excess (e.g. primary aldosteronism) often causes hypokalemia, whereas aldosterone blockade or deficiency increases hyperkalemia risk, especially in patients with CKD or on RAAS inhibitors [^113qwjZo] [^1155wSxQ].

---

## Physiological mechanism of aldosterone on potassium homeostasis

Aldosterone acts on the distal nephron to **increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion**, thereby lowering serum potassium [^112XawKj]. Key features include:

- **Principal cells**: aldosterone increases ENaC-mediated sodium reabsorption, creating a negative lumen potential that drives potassium secretion via ROMK channels [^1144kANq].
- **Intercalated cells**: aldosterone upregulates pendrin, enhancing bicarbonate secretion and further promoting potassium excretion [^112sXaJe].
- **Feed-forward regulation**: rising serum potassium directly stimulates aldosterone secretion, increasing kaliuresis [^114BmfEW].

---

## Clinical evidence of aldosterone's effect on serum potassium

Multiple clinical studies show that **aldosterone lowers serum potassium**:

- **Primary aldosteronism**: excess aldosterone causes hypokalemia via increased renal potassium wasting [^113qwjZo].
- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**: spironolactone, eplerenone, and finerenone raise serum potassium by blocking aldosterone, with average increases of ~0.2–0.3 mmol/L [^11655Jfy] [^115p4enL].
- **Aldosterone synthase inhibitors**: vicadrostat and lorundrostat increase potassium by ~0.2–0.3 mmol/L via reduced aldosterone synthesis [^11655Jfy] [^116SmjEQ].

## Factors influencing the magnitude of aldosterone's effect on serum potassium

The effect of aldosterone on serum potassium is **modulated by**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on aldosterone's potassium-lowering action** |
|-|-|
| Renal function | Impaired GFR reduces potassium excretion, amplifying hyperkalemia risk with aldosterone blockade [^1157By8d] |
| Dietary sodium intake | High sodium increases distal sodium delivery, enhancing aldosterone-mediated potassium secretion |
| Medications | RAAS inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, and NSAIDs increase hyperkalemia risk with aldosterone blockade [^1155wSxQ] |
| Age | Older adults have reduced renal potassium excretion, increasing hyperkalemia risk [^113JwUf2] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Understanding aldosterone's effect on potassium guides **clinical decisions**:

- **Hyperkalemia risk**: monitor potassium closely when initiating MRAs or aldosterone synthase inhibitors, especially in CKD or with RAAS inhibitors [^1174EP4u] [^116SmjEQ].
- **Hypokalemia management**: in primary aldosteronism, MRAs or adrenalectomy correct hypokalemia by reducing aldosterone excess [^116PE1Kd] [^1161uEox].
- **Balanced therapy**: use potassium binders or adjust concomitant drugs to maintain normokalemia while preserving RAAS blockade benefits [^117FVX6D] [^112fsf33].

---

Aldosterone **lowers serum potassium** by increasing renal potassium excretion; blocking or reducing aldosterone raises potassium, so clinicians must monitor and manage potassium when modulating the aldosterone pathway.

### Effects of potassium supplementation on plasma aldosterone: a systematic review and meta-analysis in humans [^116ePGSM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Effects of potassium supplementation on blood pressure (BP) may be offset by an increase in plasma aldosterone. The magnitude of potassium-dependent regulation of aldosterone secretion in humans is not fully characterized; it is not clear whether this is mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), as a result of a reduction in BP or other mechanisms. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials assessing effects of potassium on plasma aldosterone and renin in adult individuals.

Methods

This was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Three databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. Titles were firstly screened by title and abstract for relevance before full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. The keywords used included "aldosterone", "potassium" and "RAAS".

Results

6395 articles were retrieved and after title/abstract screening, 123 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Thirty-six met the prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria (of which 18/36 also reported systolic BP). Potassium supplementation caused a significant decrease in systolic BP (mean difference [95% CI] -3.69mmHg [-4.91, -2.46], P < 0.001) and increase in serum potassium (+0.37 [0.23, 0.52] mmol/l, P < 0.001). There was an increase in plasma aldosterone (standardized difference 0.426 [0.299, 0.553], P < 0.001) but not in plasma renin activity. Meta-regression showed a significant positive correlation between change in plasma aldosterone and change in serum potassium (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Potassium supplementation increases plasma aldosterone concentrations, which correlates with the increase in serum potassium concentration which does not appear to be mediated by an increase in plasma renin activity.

### The cardiovascular implications of hypokalemia [^116wBXWL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The role of potassium in the progression of cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial. Animal and human data suggest that increases in dietary potassium, decreases in urinary potassium loss, or increases in serum potassium levels through other mechanisms have benefits in several disease states. These include the treatment of hypertension, stroke prevention, arrhythmia prevention, and treatment of congestive heart failure. Recently, the discovery that aldosterone antagonists not only decrease sodium reabsorption and decrease potassium secretion in the nephron, but also decrease pathological injury of such nonepithelial tissues as the myocardium and endothelium, has generated great controversy regarding the actual mechanisms of benefit of these agents. We review the available data and draw conclusions about the relative benefits of modulating potassium balance versus nonrenal effects of aldosterone blockade in patients with cardiovascular disease.

### Potassium homeostasis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors [^1155wSxQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key strategy in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors) increase the risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L). This review evaluates the effects on serum potassium levels of RAAS inhibitors. Using PubMed, we searched for clinical trials published up to December 2008 assessing the effects on serum potassium levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, alone and in combination, in patients with hypertension, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD); 39 studies were identified. In patients with hypertension without risk factors for hyperkalemia, the incidence of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitor monotherapy is low (≤ 2%), whereas rates are higher with dual RAAS inhibition (approximately 5%). The incidence of hyperkalemia is also increased in patients with HF or CKD (5% to 10%). However, increases in serum potassium levels are small (approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), and rates of study discontinuation due to hyperkalemia are low, even in high-risk patient groups (1% to 5%). Patients with HF or CKD are at greater risk of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors than those without these conditions. However, the absolute changes in serum potassium are generally small and unlikely to be clinically significant. Moreover, these patients are likely to derive benefit from RAAS inhibition. Rather than denying them an effective treatment, electrolyte levels should be closely monitored in these patients.

### A randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of potassium supplementation on vascular function and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [^111353vH]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence on the effect of potassium supplementation on the vasculature in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. Potassium increases aldosterone and there is a strong association of hyperaldosteronism with poor cardiac outcomes. We aimed to determine whether potassium supplementation has a significant medium-term effect on aldosterone levels and, if so, what the overall effect of this is on vascular function in patients at moderate cardiovascular disease risk. Forty patients at moderate cardiovascular disease risk were included in a randomised placebo-controlled crossover study. Patients were assigned to 64mmol potassium chloride or placebo for 6 weeks. Vascular function was assessed using pulse-wave analysis including the detection of a change in augmentation index to salbutamol and nitroglycerine-induced vasodilation. There was no change in augmentation index with potassium vs placebo (25.2 ± 1.4 vs. 26.0 ± 1.3%, respectively). Potassium improved brachial systolic blood pressure (131.8 ± 2.2 vs. 137.1 ± 2.4mmHg; P = 0.013), central systolic blood pressure (123.2 ± 2.3 vs. 128.4 ± 2.3mmHg; P = 0.011) and central diastolic blood pressure (80.3 ± 1.3 vs. 83.7 ± 1.4mmHg; P = 0.019). Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone both increased with potassium (P = 0.001 and P = 0.048 respectively). We found that potassium supplementation had no effect on endothelial function or pulse-wave analysis. It lowered brachial systolic and central blood pressure. It was associated with increased plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^111Xpr2x]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Potassium is essential for normal cellular function and alterations in its regulation can lead to gastrointestinal, neuromuscular and cardiac abnormalities, some of which can be life‐threatening. 1 The treatments used in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) commonly cause potassium disturbances; hypokalaemia is induced by loop and thiazide diuretics, and hyperkalaemia results from the use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. 2, 3 Although the clinical significance, and even the definition, of hyperkalaemia is a matter of debate, higher potassium concentrations often lead to the withholding or withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors, which are life‐saving therapies in patients with HFrEF. 4 However, hypokalaemia may be of as much concern as hyperkalaemia in HFrEF because in other groups of individuals (e.g. the general population and patients with myocardial infarction, hypertension and chronic kidney disease 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) the relationship between potassium concentration and clinical outcomes is U‐shaped, and both low and high potassium levels are associated with worse outcomes. 10, 11, 12

The effects of sacubitril–valsartan on potassium have not been described in detail and may differ from those of enalapril as sacubitril–valsartan reduces aldosterone, a key regulator of potassium. 13 The sacubitril–valsartan combination probably lowers aldosterone because natriuretic peptides are powerful inhibitors of aldosterone secretion and neprilysin inhibition (sacubitril) increases natriuretic peptide levels. 14, 15 The Prospective Comparison of ARNI with an ACE‐Inhibitor to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure trial (PARADIGM‐HF) 13 represents one of the largest and most contemporary HFrEF cohorts, in which most patients received each of the aforementioned drugs known to affect potassium levels.

The aims of the present study were to examine the range of plasma potassium concentrations found in patients with HFrEF, the relationships between potassium concentration and outcomes, and the effect of sacubitril–valsartan on potassium.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115E2NtR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, initial testing, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to measure serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with patients seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening. Obtain potassium levels to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone, as low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone.

### What is the optimal serum potassium level in cardiovascular patients? [^115fZ5rc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Humans are prone to sodium overload and potassium depletion. This electrolyte imbalance is important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death. Avoiding hypokalemia is beneficial in several cardiovascular disease states including acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hypertension. The evidence highlighting the importance of potassium homeostasis in cardiovascular disease and possible mechanisms explaining potassium's benefits are reviewed. Targets for serum potassium concentration are suggested.

### Diurnal urinary aldosterone excretion and potassium intake during pregnancy are associated with high normal blood pressure in early childhood [^115j5uxc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Higher potassium and lower sodium intakes are associated with lower BP in adolescentsand adults, but there is no available data on any programming effect of maternal intake of potassium and sodium on offspring cardiovascular health including offspring blood pressure (OBP).

The third‐trimester is considered a window of sensitivity for fetal exposure to endogenous and exogenous hormones; the maturing effects of cortisol are well known, but there are fewer data on aldosterone. Diurnal urine aldosterone gives the best integrated estimate for aldosterone status compared with plasma aldosterone, as plasma aldosterone is influenced by circadian rhythm, physical activity, and postural changes.

To our knowledge, the concentration of maternal aldosterone and intake of potassium and sodium in association with OBP has not been investigated previously. However, a prospective study in adolescents demonstrated a sexual dimorphic positive association between levels of aldosterone and BP, where a single serum aldosterone measured at age 17 years was predictive of higher future systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in women at age 27 years; in men, cross‐sectional data at age 17 years showed that serum aldosterone was associated significantly with higher SBP.

We aimed to investigate the associations between maternal third‐trimester 24‐hour urine aldosterone, potassium, and sodium intakes and offspring SBP and DBP from age 3 months to 5 years. We hypothesized that maternal 24‐hour urine aldosterone levels were positively associated with OBP, and maternal intake of potassium and sodium may influence the association; we also tested the hypothesis that the relation may be affected by offspring sex.

### Serum potassium is a predictor of incident diabetes in African Americans with normal aldosterone: the Jackson heart study [^115wygaL]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Low-normal potassium is a risk factor for diabetes and may account for some of the racial disparity in diabetes risk. Aldosterone affects serum potassium and is associated with insulin resistance.

Objectives

We sought to confirm the association between potassium and incident diabetes in an African-American cohort, and to determine the effect of aldosterone on this association.

Design

We studied participants from the Jackson Heart Study, an African-American adult cohort, who were without diabetes at baseline. With the use of logistic regression, we characterized the associations of serum, dietary, and urinary potassium with incident diabetes. In addition, we evaluated aldosterone as a potential effect modifier of these associations.

Results

Of 2157 participants, 398 developed diabetes over 8 y. In a minimally adjusted model, serum potassium was a significant predictor of incident diabetes (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.92 per SD increment in serum potassium). In multivariable models, we found a significant interaction between serum potassium and aldosterone (P = 0.046). In stratified multivariable models, in those with normal aldosterone (< 9 ng/dL, n = 1163), participants in the highest 2 potassium quartiles had significantly lower odds of incident diabetes than did those in the lowest potassium quartile [OR (95% CI): 0.61 (0.39, 0.97) and 0.54 (0.33, 0.90), respectively]. Among those with high-normal aldosterone (≥ 9 ng/dL, n = 202), we found no significant association between serum potassium and incident diabetes. In these stratified models, serum aldosterone was not a significant predictor of incident diabetes. We found no statistically significant associations between dietary or urinary potassium and incident diabetes.

Conclusions

In this African-American cohort, we found that aldosterone may modify the association between serum potassium and incident diabetes. In participants with normal aldosterone, high-normal serum potassium was associated with a lower risk of diabetes than was low-normal serum potassium. Additional studies are warranted to determine whether serum potassium is a modifiable risk factor that could be a target for diabetes prevention. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00415415.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1116pwfn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Recommendation 1 (screening in hypertension) states that in all individuals with hypertension, we suggest screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This is a conditional recommendation, with implementation depending on contextual factors such as available resources, local expertise, and healthcare system capacity, which may affect feasibility and prioritization. The recommendation emphasizes care that is informed and guided by screening, with a positive screening result serving as the critical first step in the care process for individuals with PA, and PA screening consists of measurements of serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity) with determination of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR); potassium is also assessed — not for screening itself — but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone.

### Effect of exercise training on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: a meta-analysis [^1153C4AR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The two main electrolytes assessed in the present study were urinary sodium and potassium excretion. The analyses of both 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion in exercise vs control groups was unchanged. The reason for this cannot be explained even though our meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in aldosterone, although there was decreased statistical power due to low number of studies included (that is, for sodium and potassium excretion: 4 and 3 studies, respectively) in the analyses. However, the slight increase in sodium excretion versus the reduction in potassium excretion might suggest improved sodium/potassium exchange following the cumulative effects of chronic exercise training which may have lowered aldosterone level. Aldosterone plays a major role in the regulation sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. During prolonged exercise, the body loses water and electrolytes as sweat. Sweating is influenced by several factors that increase in proportion to the rate of workload (including intensity, volume, duration per session or type of exercise) and the environmental temperature, humidity and there is individual variability. Studies have shown that intracellular and plasma (or serum) sodium are higher in hypertensives than their normotensives counterparts. The electrolyte responses to exercise training in hypertensives and normotensives may be different due to genetic abnormalities in body fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis.

Limitations

This study had limitations including the small sample sizes in the included studies for some measurements which may have been underpowered. In addition, we could not establish a relationship between exercise-induced changes in BP and changes in outcome measures of interest. We acknowledge that only included studies that measured markers of RAAS as well as BP and HR were included in the review, indicating that the impact of exercise training on systemic hemodynamics is likely not reflected by this study. This analysis was also limited by the varied health and medication status of participants. Another possible limitation of included studies is that none of the studies controlled participants' dietary intake (e.g. sodium).

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^1121x4me]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of mild hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population were slightly more frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. As expected, these episodes were more common in patients receiving loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics both in patients taking dapagliflozin and placebo, with no relevant difference between the groups. Few AEs of hypokalemia were reported in either group (0.4% with dapagliflozin vs. 0.2% with placebo), and did not lead to discontinuation. There were no reports of severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population.

A trend towards increased hypokalemia risk could be consistent with dapagliflozin's mild diuretic effect; however, a lack of any difference between the groups when used with typical diuretics is both reassuring and somewhat unexpected. Renal potassium excretion is a complex process that is primarily determined by the serum aldosterone concentration and driven by the sodium concentration in the distal nephron. Due to the co-transportation of sodium and glucose, transient increases in urinary sodium excretion are seen for a few days upon initiation of dapagliflozin, after which levels tend to normalize. Thus, unlike typical diuretics, long-term treatment with dapagliflozin should not affect sodium delivery to the distal nephron. However, it should be acknowledged that in a previous small exploratory study, dapagliflozin treatment increased median plasma renin activity relative to placebo, to approximately a quarter of the hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg effect, and increased median serum aldosterone activity to a similar extent as hydrochlorothiazide. A potential trend for hypokalemia does not seem to be explained by dapagliflozin's mechanism of action, which is not reported to promote kaliuresis, neither is it consistent across the SGLT2 inhibitor class, as the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia risk with canagliflozin was greater in patients with moderate renal impairment or receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics, and was more pronounced with the canagliflozin 300 mg dose than the 100 mg dose.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117TkvYt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Screening for primary aldosteronism in individuals with hypertension — recommendation and technical steps: We recommend primary aldosteronism (PA) screening with serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity). Screen for PA by measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with individuals seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening. Potassium should be measured alongside renin and aldosterone — not for screening itself, but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone — as a low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone; if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, potassium should be corrected to within the laboratory reference range and screening should be repeated. Manage interfering medications depending on individual safety and feasibility, and the Guideline Development Panel outlined both minimal-withdrawal and no-withdrawal strategies of interfering medications before screening. A positive screen meets both of the following in most circumstances: renin is low/suppressed and aldosterone is inappropriately high relative to renin.

### Biomarkers to guide medical therapy in primary aldosteronism [^116PE1Kd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is an endocrinopathy characterized by dysregulated aldosterone production that occurs despite suppression of renin and angiotensin II, and that is non-suppressible by volume and sodium loading. The effectiveness of surgical adrenalectomy for patients with lateralizing PA is characterized by the attenuation of excess aldosterone production leading to blood pressure reduction, correction of hypokalemia, and increases in renin-biomarkers that collectively indicate a reversal of PA pathophysiology and restoration of normal physiology. Even though the vast majority of patients with PA will ultimately be treated medically rather than surgically, there is a lack of guidance on how to optimize medical therapy and on key metrics of success. Herein, we review the evidence justifying approaches to medical management of PA and biomarkers that reflect endocrine principles of restoring normal physiology. We review the current arsenal of medical therapies, including dietary sodium restriction, steroidal and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, epithelial sodium channel inhibitors, and aldosterone synthase inhibitors. It is crucial that clinicians recognize that multimodal medical treatment for PA can be highly effective at reducing the risk for adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes when titrated with intention. The key biomarkers reflective of optimized medical therapy are unsurprisingly similar to the physiologic expectations following surgical adrenalectomy: control of blood pressure with the fewest number of antihypertensive agents, normalization of serum potassium without supplementation, and a rise in renin. Pragmatic approaches to achieve these objectives while mitigating adverse effects are reviewed.

### Serum ACE2, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels are unchanged in patients with COVID-19 [^114YG7QE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controversially discussed. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and activity of the RAAS may affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcome of patients with COVID-19.

Methods

In this prospective single-center study, we determined the serum levels of ACE2, angiotensin II, and aldosterone in patients with COVID-19 compared with control patients presenting with similar symptoms in the emergency unit.

Results

We analyzed serum samples from 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 61 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 positive and control patients did not differ in baseline patients characteristics, symptoms, and clinical presentation. Mean serum concentrations of ACE2, angiotensin II, and aldosterone did not differ between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the control group. In line with this, serum potassium as surrogate parameter for RAAS activity and blood pressure were similar in both groups.

Conclusions

In summary, we did not find evidence for altered RAAS activity including angiotensin II, aldosterone, or potassium levels, and blood pressure in patients with COVID-19.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111FakZw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — special populations and medication effects on renin with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy: Achieving an increase in renin with MRA therapy is challenging in individuals with CKD, and the ability to produce and secrete renin may be impaired with advanced CKD and higher MRA doses, which may increase the risk for hyperkalemia, so targeting an increase in renin in CKD may not always be a feasible or practical clinical objective. It is reasonable to treat individuals with PA and CKD with MRAs as long as serum potassium is monitored, and when encountering hyperkalemia in CKD, the use of loop diuretics, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) inhibitors, and potassium binders has been shown to mitigate the risk of MRA-induced hyperkalemia in RCTs. The use of some concurrent medications may confound the interpretation of renin, as β-Adrenergic blockers can lower renin secretion; high dietary sodium intake can lower renin, whereas a sodium-restricted diet can increase renin; and diuretics are a confounder as they increase renin.

### ASN kidney health guidance on potassium and phosphorus food additives [^114XbkSR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Potassium additives — clinical relevance and homeostasis — Higher potassium consumption is shown to be associated with cardiovascular and kidney health, but as kidney function declines the risk of hyperkalemia increases and potassium additives are often overlooked as a source of potassium intake. There is strong evidence that dietary potassium can acutely raise serum potassium levels in the postprandial period, and once absorbed, potassium is shifted into the cells in an insulin-dependent and aldosterone-dependent process. Ingested potassium stimulates an acute kaliuretic response through feed-forward and feedback mechanisms with natriuretic effects, but these regulatory mechanisms are impaired as kidney function declines and are further blunted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Increased spironolactone dosing in acute heart failure alters potassium homeostasis but does not enhance decongestion [^1179nU2a]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The ATHENA-HF (Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy in Heart Failure) clinical trial found no improvements in natriuretic peptide levels or clinical congestion when spironolactone 100 mg/day for 96 hours was used in addition to usual treatment for acute heart failure.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of ATHENA-HF to determine whether spironolactone treatment induced any detectable pharmacodynamic effects and whether patients with potentially greater aldosterone activity experienced additional decongestion. Trial subjects previously treated with spironolactone were excluded. We first examined for changes in renal potassium handling. Using the baseline serum potassium level as a surrogate marker of spironolactone activity, we then divided each treatment arm into tertiles of baseline serum potassium and explored for differences in laboratory and clinical congestion outcomes.

Results

Among spironolactone-naïve patients, the change in serum potassium did not differ after 24 hours or 48 hours but was significantly greater with spironolactone treatment compared to placebo at 72 hours (0.23 ± 0.55 vs 0.03 ± 0.60 mEq/L; P = 0.042) and 96 hours (0.32 ± 0.51 vs 0.13 ± 0.72 mEq/L; P = 0.046). Potassium supplementation was similar at treatment start and at 24 hours, but spironolactone-treated patients required substantially less potassium replacement at 48 hours (24% vs 36%; P = 0.048), 72 hours (21% vs 37%; P = 0.013), and 96 hours (11% vs 38%; P < 0.001). When the treatment arms were divided into tertiles of baseline serum potassium, there were no differences in the 96-hour log N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, net fluid loss, urine output, or dyspnea relief in any of the potassium groups, with no effect modification by treatment exposure.

Conclusions

Spironolactone 100 mg/day for 96 hours in patients receiving intravenous loop diuresis for acute heart failure has no clear added decongestive ability but does meaningfully limit potassium wasting.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: a clinical and scientific call to action [^115KejBM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Importantly, hyper‐ and hypokalemia have been shown to independently contribute to mortality in several observational studies. Collins and colleagues published data in 2017 from > 900 000 patients demonstrating that all‐cause mortality continuously increased with potassium values above or below the 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L range. 5 As well, in a large meta‐analysis of population‐based evaluations of dietary sodium and potassium intake, reduced potassium intake associates significantly with patient mortality. With all of these concerns, how do we rectify the competing risks and benefits of RAASi therapy and hyperkalemia in CHF and CKD patients?

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116chHki]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) screening — Recommendation 1 applies to all individuals with hypertension and states: In all individuals with hypertension, we suggest screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This is a conditional recommendation, with implementation depending on contextual factors such as available resources, local expertise, and healthcare system capacity, which may affect feasibility and prioritization. This recommendation emphasizes care that is informed and guided by screening, with a positive screening result serving as the critical first step in the care process for individuals with PA. PA screening includes measurement of serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity), with determination of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR), and potassium is also assessed — not for screening itself — but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone.

### Treatment with patiromer decreases aldosterone in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors [^111y8BL2]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated serum aldosterone can be vasculotoxic and facilitate cardiorenal damage. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors reduce serum aldosterone levels and/or block its effects but can cause hyperkalemia. Patiromer, a nonabsorbed potassium binder, decreases serum potassium in patients with chronic kidney disease on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Here we examined the effect of patiromer treatment on serum aldosterone, blood pressure, and albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with hyperkalemia (serum potassium 5.1–6.5 mEq/l). We analyzed data from the phase 3 OPAL-HK study (4-week initial treatment phase of 243 patients; 8-week randomized withdrawal phase of 107 patients). In the treatment phase, the (mean ± standard error) serum potassium was decreased concordantly with the serum aldosterone (-1.99 ± 0.51 ng/dl), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (-5.64 ± 1.04 mm Hg/-3.84 ± 0.69 mm Hg), and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (-203.7 ± 54.7 mg/g), all in a statistically significant manner. The change in the plasma renin activity (-0.44 ± 0.63 μg/l/hr) was not significant. In the withdrawal phase, mean aldosterone levels were sustained with patiromer (+0.23 ± 1.07 ng/dl) and significantly increased with placebo (+2.78 ± 1.25 ng/dl). Patients on patiromer had significant reductions in mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (-6.70 ± 1.59/-2.15 ± 1.06 mm Hg), whereas those on placebo did not (-1.21 ± 1.89 mm Hg/+1.72 ± 1.26 mm Hg). Significant changes in plasma renin activity were found only in the placebo group (-3.90 ± 1.41 μg/l/hr). Thus, patiromer reduced serum potassium and aldosterone levels independent of plasma renin activity in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.

### Dose doubling, relative potency, and dose equivalence of potassium-sparing diuretics affecting blood pressure and serum potassium: systematic review and meta-analyses [^115p4enL]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Potassium-sparing diuretics (PSDs) are valuable antihypertensives with additional benefits unrelated to control of systolic blood pressure (SBP). However, their key parameters affecting SBP and serum potassium are poorly defined, fostering underutilization.

Method

Consequently, we conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses, yielding 3668 articles and ultimately 84 randomized comparisons.

Results

For office SBP, overall placebo-adjusted changes were triamterene -1.9 (low dose only), amiloride -9.9, spironolactone -13.2, and eplerenone -9.2. Differences in antihypertensive effect were due to potency rather than efficacy. Doubling amiloride, eplerenone, and spironolactone doses reduced SBP (95% confidence limits) on average by -2.3 (-3.1, -1.5). Relative antihypertensive potencies were spironolactone > amiloride > eplerenone. Spironolactone had significantly greater antihypertensive potency than amiloride, -4.0 (-7.4, -0.6), and eplerenone, -5.5 (-7.4, -3.6). Dose equivalencies were eplerenone-spironolactone 4.5-to-1 (e.g., eplerenone 125∼spironolactone 25), amiloride-spironolactone 3.3-to-1, and eplerenone-amiloride 1.4-to-1. Increases in serum potassium from amiloride and spironolactone at commonly used doses averaged 0.14–0.29mEq/l; the dose doubling effect was 0.16 (0.10, 0.22). Spironolactone caused greater hyperkalemia than amiloride across their dose ranges: 0.14, P = 0.043. Seven features make important bias unlikely: a comprehensive literature search, adjustment for covariates, all models explaining 95–100% of the between-study variability, similar dose doubling effects among PSDs, two different methods giving the same potency sequence, similar results from double blind comparisons, and similar results for eplerenone versus spironolactone from analysing direct comparison data (i.e., no meta-regression) for office and 24-h SBP.

Conclusion

This synthesis accomplishes for PSDs what has already been achieved for thiazide-type diuretics and other antihypertensives and can guide the application of these underutilized medicines.

### Potassium and its discontents: new insight, new treatments [^112XawKj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is common in patients with impaired kidney function or who take drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. During the past decade, substantial advances in understanding how the body controls potassium excretion have been made, which may lead to improved standard of care for these patients. Renal potassium disposition is primarily handled by a short segment of the nephron, comprising part of the distal convoluted tubule and the connecting tubule, and regulation results from the interplay between aldosterone and plasma potassium. When dietary potassium intake and plasma potassium are low, the electroneutral sodium chloride cotransporter is activated, leading to salt retention. This effect limits sodium delivery to potassium secretory segments, limiting potassium losses. In contrast, when dietary potassium intake is high, aldosterone is stimulated. Simultaneously, potassium inhibits the sodium chloride cotransporter. Because more sodium is then delivered to potassium secretory segments, primed by aldosterone, kaliuresis results. When these processes are disrupted, hyperkalemia results. Recently, new agents capable of removing potassium from the body and treating hyperkalemia have been tested in clinical trials. This development suggests that more effective and safer approaches to the prevention and treatment of hyperkalemia may be on the horizon.

### Aldosterone regulates pendrin and epithelial sodium channel activity through intercalated cell mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent and-independent mechanisms over a wide range in serum potassium [^112sXaJe]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aldosterone activates the intercalated cell mineralocorticoid receptor, which is enhanced with hypokalemia. Whether this receptor directly regulates the intercalated cell chloride/bicarbonate exchanger pendrin is unclear, as are potassium's role in this response and the receptor's effect on intercalated and principal cell function in the cortical collecting duct (CCD).

Methods

We measured CCD chloride absorption, transepithelial voltage, epithelial sodium channel activity, and pendrin abundance and subcellular distribution in wild-type and intercalated cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mice. To determine if the receptor directly regulates pendrin, as well as the effect of serum aldosterone and potassium on this response, we measured pendrin label intensity and subcellular distribution in wild-type mice, knockout mice, and receptor-positive and receptor-negative intercalated cells from the same knockout mice.

Results

Ablation of the intercalated cell mineralocorticoid receptor in CCDs from aldosterone-treated mice reduced chloride absorption and epithelial sodium channel activity, despite principal cell mineralocorticoid receptor expression in the knockout mice. With high circulating aldosterone, intercalated cell mineralocorticoid receptor gene ablation directly reduced pendrin's relative abundance in the apical membrane region and pendrin abundance per cell whether serum potassium was high or low. Intercalated cell mineralocorticoid receptor ablation blunted, but did not eliminate, aldosterone's effect on pendrin total and apical abundance and subcellular distribution.

Conclusions

With high circulating aldosterone, intercalated cell mineralocorticoid receptor ablation reduces chloride absorption in the CCD and indirectly reduces principal cell epithelial sodium channel abundance and function. This receptor directly regulates pendrin's total abundance and its relative abundance in the apical membrane region over a wide range in serum potassium concentration. Aldosterone regulates pendrin through mechanisms both dependent and independent of the IC MR receptor.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, initial testing, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to correct potassium to within the laboratory reference range if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, then repeat screening.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^116uEiHT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following: (1) a careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea; (2) physical examination, including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate; and (3) measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes. Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Aldosterone antagonists: silver bullet or just sodium excretion and potassium retention? [^112bka74]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

ACE inhibitors or AT(1) antagonists are powerful therapeutic strategies to slow the progression of renal disease. However, they provide only imperfect protection since they cannot always prevent end-stage renal failure. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with chronic kidney disease off dialysis. Blockade of the aldosterone pathway may prove to be such a beneficial therapeutic concept.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on adrenal cortical and cardiovascular responses to angiotensin II: a randomized crossover study [^114BmfEW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Increased potassium intake decreases blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension, 1 but increased potassium intake also increases plasma concentrations of the BP‐raising hormone aldosterone. 2, 3 This apparent paradox is not fully understood, but reports dating back to 1935 suggest that potassium acts as a diuretic. 4, 5 In line with this suggestion, newer studies have shown that a single oral load of 100 mmol of potassium‐chloride and 5 days on a fixed low potassium run‐in diet, followed by 5 days on the fixed diet but including a 100 mmol/day potassium‐chloride supplementation, lead to significant increases in urinary sodium excretion, 3, 6 and that potassium inhibits the sodium‐chloride cotransporter (a thiazide‐like effect) in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney leading to increased natriuresis. 5 Further, studies of longer duration (≥ 4 weeks) have observed that increased potassium intake also leads to rises in plasma renin concentration and plasma renin activity, 7, 8, 9 which provides some indirect support for a diuretic action of potassium. 10

Besides its well‐known renal effects, 2 aldosterone is also believed to have vascular effects, acting through mineralocorticoid receptors present in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, although mineralocorticoid receptors‐independent actions are also thought to be involved. 11, 12

Aldosterone is primarily secreted from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex, 2 but there are studies suggesting that aldosterone can be synthesized outside the adrenal cortex. 11, 12 The 2 most important physiological stimuli of aldosterone secretion are rises in extracellular potassium and angiotensin II (AngII), 2 although adrenocorticotropic hormone can also stimulate aldosterone secretion. 2 Several short‐term studies (≤ 10 days) in normal subjects have shown that increased potassium intake potentiates the aldosterone stimulating properties of AngII and adrenocorticotropic hormone, 13, 14, 15, 16 whereas increased intake of potassium does not influence the BP‐raising effect of AngII. 13, 14, 15 However, none of these studies performed a comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular responses to AngII. 13, 14, 15

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^116aq76K]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Adverse effects of aldosterone: beyond blood pressure [^114jkR9i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone, and Elevated BP

The primary and evolutionary role of aldosterone is to facilitate potassium excretion and sodium retention, allowing for expansion of circulating volume and maintenance of BP in the face of renally sensed hypoperfusion or volume depletion. It is well established that overt primary aldosteronism (PA), a condition of chronic and maladaptive aldosterone production that is relatively independent of its usual regulatory pathways, is a cause of often severe or resistant hypertension. However, epidemiologic evidence across multiple populations has demonstrated that even in the general population, greater aldosterone concentrations are associated with higher BP and the future risk of incident hypertension. In the Framingham Heart Study, each quartile increase in aldosterone was associated with a 16% to 17% increase in the risk of rising BP and incident hypertension. Similarly, a greater aldosterone‐to‐renin ratio was associated with a higher incidence of progression of BP category and incident hypertension in Framingham, and greater aldosterone levels in the context of renin suppression were associated with greater incidence of new‐onset hypertension, as well as greater urinary potassium excretion, among normotensive participants in the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, implicating both greater aldosterone production and MR activity in the development of hypertension. In the Jackson Heart Study, higher aldosterone concentrations and lower renin activity were associated with higher ambulatory BP measurements and adverse BP profiles, again recapitulating the pathophysiology of PA and its characteristic chronic excess activity of the aldosterone–MR axis. Concordantly, in resistant hypertension, treatment with MR antagonists has been demonstrated to reduce BP and mitigate treatment resistance, especially when aldosterone concentrations are elevated. Thus, there is highly consistent evidence across community populations supporting the role of aldosterone and MR activation in the development and propagation of elevated pressure. Though actions of aldosterone as an agonist of MR in the renal collecting duct epithelium and the resulting sodium and volume retention are known to cause elevated BP, and hypertension is a well‐established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal outcomes, the widespread tissue distribution of the MR and evidence from preclinical models and human disease states have made it clear that aldosterone–MR activity has pathologic consequences over and above those caused by hypertension alone.

### Varying influences of aldosterone on the plasma potassium concentration in blacks and whites [^111T5pUn]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aldosterone acts to restrain the extracellular potassium (K+) concentration. Blacks have on average lower plasma aldosterone concentrations (PACs) than Whites. Whether this ethnic difference is associated with similar changes in the concentration of K+ is unclear.

Methods

Subjects were Blacks and Whites from an observational study of blood pressure regulation. PAC was known to be significantly lower in Blacks than Whites. We sought to test the hypothesis that the concentration of K+ remains constant despite variability in PAC. Initial enrollment took place in childhood in 1986. Some of the original enrollees were studied again in adulthood: 160 healthy Blacks and 271 healthy Whites (ages 5 to 39 years; all were studied as children and as adults).

Results

Plasma renin activity [a biomarker of angiotensin II and, more proximally, extracellular fluid volume (ECFV)] and PAC were lower in Blacks (P < 0.0354 and P < 0.001, respectively, for all ages). At the same time no ethnic difference in levels of K+ was observed regardless of age. Plasma K+ concentration and PAC associated differently based on ethnicity: PAC increased in Blacks by 1.5–2.0 and in Whites by 2.3–3.0 ng/dl per mmol/l increase in K+ (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Lower aldosterone levels in Blacks did not translate into higher K+ concentrations. We speculate that reaching the right concentration of K+ was an endpoint of aldosterone production in the presence of varying levels of ECFV and angiotensin II.

### The potential for improving cardio-renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease with the aldosterone synthase inhibitor vicadrostat (BI 690517): a rationale for the EASi-KIDNEY trial [^11655Jfy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3:
Effect of vicadrostat (BI 690517) 10 mg once daily versus placebo on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) when given in combination with empagliflozin overall (Fig. 3A) and by diabetes status (Fig. 3B) from the phase II CKD trial (1378–0005 post-hoc analyses). Linear mixed models for repeated measures analyses were used to estimate the difference in log transformed uACR from baseline to 14 weeks. Dotted lines are for active vicadrostat, solid lines are for placebo.

The effect of vicadrostat on UACR was similar irrespective of initial allocation to empagliflozin, but interestingly the effect on BP was augmented by the presence of empagliflozin. In combination with empagliflozin, systolic BP was 7.8 mmHg lower with vicadrostat 10 mg versus placebo. Vicadrostat caused a reversible acute eGFR dip in addition to the dip resulting from initiation of empagliflozin. Vicadrostat caused a dose-dependent reduction in aldosterone exposure, with the largest difference reaching a ∼60% reduction. There was no meaningful difference in mean serum cortisol levels between groups during the 14 weeks of treatment. The incidence of a morning cortisol < 83 nmol/L (< 3 mcg/dL) was 3.7% (16/436) in participants in the active vicadrostat groups versus 2.7% (4/147) in the placebo vicadrostat groups.

Effects of aldosterone inhibition on serum potassium

Both MRAs and ASi's increase serum potassium levels. The FIDELITY meta-analysis showed that finerenone increased potassium by 0.21 (SD 0.47) mmol/L from baseline, compared with 0.02 (SD 0.43) mmol/L with placebo. Similarly, in the phase II CKD trial of vicadrostat, serum potassium was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.13, 0.50) mmol/L and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.08, 0.41) higher respectively, compared with placebo, for the 10 and 20 mg doses (when used in combination with empagliflozin). The effect of vicadrostat on potassium was similar in size when assessed separately by baseline level of potassium (i.e. the effect on potassium was no larger in those with high baseline potassium, Fig. 4).

### Effect of increased potassium intake on adrenal cortical and cardiovascular responses to angiotensin II: a randomized crossover study [^1133w7a1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Increased Potassium Intake and Lower BP

Based on meta‐analysis data, increased potassium intake lowers BP in patients with hypertension, 1, 28 whereas increased potassium intake does not lower BP significantly in normotensive subjects, 1 although an increased dietary potassium intake is associated with a lower risk of incident hypertension. 29 So, how do we interpret our principal finding that potassium supplementation potentiated AngII‐stimulated aldosterone secretion in this perspective? Based on the medical literature, increased potassium intake lowers BP because potassium apparently acts as a diuretic (a thiazide‐like effect). 5 However, when exploring the diuretic effect of increased potassium intake, it is important to split the studies into short‐term and medium‐/long‐term studies, because during medium‐/long‐term studies adaptive mechanisms could be activated to offset potassium‐induced sodium and water loss, for example through activation of all renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system components. Along this line, in an acute study of 7 healthy people, a single oral load of 100 mmol of KCl led to a ≈2.5‐fold increase in plasma aldosterone and a ≈3.5‐fold increase in urinary excretion of potassium and sodium, whereas plasma renin activity did not change. 3 This is in contrast to medium‐/long‐term studies, 7, 8, 9, 15 including our study, 17 where increased potassium intake led to increases not only in plasma aldosterone but also in plasma renin activity without change in urinary excretion of sodium. We believe that these observations are the consequence of compensatory renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system activation to sodium and water loss, as it is also observed after initiation of diuretic treatment. 10, 30 In connection with the discussion of a possible diuretic effect of increased potassium intake, it is relevant that sodium restriction in humans has been shown to potentiate AngII‐stimulated aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, 31, 32 just as we found higher potassium intake did it in our study. Further, along this line, a study showed that treatment of healthy normotensive research subjects with the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone for 14 days, which led to significant increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone, also potentiated AngII‐stimulated aldosterone secretion. 33 Thus, higher potassium intake seems to produce a state that mimics sodium depletion, and therefore the principal finding of our study that potassium supplementation potentiated AngII‐stimulated aldosterone secretion, although indirectly, further points towards a diuretic action of increased potassium intake. 5

### Genetics of primary aldosteronism [^113qwjZo]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is physiologically produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. By binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor, it activates signaling cascades leading to increased renal salt and water reabsorption, as well as increased potassium and proton secretion. The production of aldosterone is normally tightly regulated. Angiotensin II (the main product of the renin-angiotensin system) and elevated serum potassium levels are the main stimuli of aldosterone production; adrenocorticotropic hormone can also temporarily increase aldosterone levels. In primary aldosteronism (PA), levels of aldosterone are inappropriate for salt, volume, and/or potassium status. This excess production causes variable degrees of hypertension, possible hypokalemia, and disproportionately high levels of cardiovascular disease.PA is considered the most important cause of secondary hypertension. An Italian study of 1672 primary care patients with hypertension, following the Endocrine Society guidelines for diagnosis, reported an overall prevalence of 5.9%, ranging from 3.9 in stage 1 hypertension to 11.8% in stage 3 hypertenson. Recently, using urinary aldosterone for diagnosis, even higher prevalence estimates for biochemically overt PA were reported, from 11.3% in normotension to 22.0% in stage 3 hypertension.

Traditionally, several subforms of PA were distinguished: bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, also known as idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (about 60% of cases), aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs; about 30% of cases), unilateral hyperplasia (less common), malignancy, and familial hyperaldosteronism (FH; both very rare). Recent histological and genetic studies have challenged this concept and will be discussed in this review. The diagnosis of PA is complicated, based upon the aldosterone/renin ratio as screening parameter and subsequent confirmatory testing. Of clinical importance is the distinction between unilateral and bilateral forms because unilateral forms are amenable to potentially curative surgery, whereas bilateral forms are treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Until 2011, the molecular mechanisms underlying autonomous aldosterone production in PA were largely unknown. Discoveries made over the last decade, their potential future impact on clinical PA management and open questions in the field of PA genetics will be covered in this review.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1162h5y3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### Changes in serum aldosterone are associated with changes in obesity-related factors in normotensive overweight and obese young adults [^112SJvcH]. Hypertension Research (2013). Low credibility.

Recent data suggest excess circulating aldosterone promotes cardiometabolic decline. Weight loss may lower aldosterone levels, but little longitudinal data is available in normotensive adults. We aimed to determine whether, independent of changes in sodium excretion, reductions in serum aldosterone are associated with favorable changes in obesity-related factors in normotensive overweight/obese young adults. We studied 285 overweight/obese young adult participants (body mass index ≥ 25 and < 40 kgm⁻², age 20–45 years) in a clinical trial examining the effects of a 1-year diet and physical activity intervention with or without sodium restriction on vascular health. Body weight, serum aldosterone, 24-h sodium and potassium excretion and obesity-related factors were measured at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. Weight loss was significant at 6 (7%), 12 (6%) and 24 months (4%; all P < 0.0001). Decreases in aldosterone were associated with decreases in C-reactive protein, leptin, insulin, homeostasis assessment of insulin resistance, heart rate, tonic cardiac sympathovagal balance and increases in adiponectin (all P < 0.05) in models adjusting for baseline age, sex, race, intervention arm, time since baseline, and sodium and potassium excretion. Weight loss and reductions in thigh intermuscular fat (intermuscular adipose tissue area; IMAT) were associated with decreases in aldosterone in the subgroup (n = 98) with metabolic syndrome (MetS) at baseline (MetS × weight loss, P = 0.04; MetS × change in IMAT, P = 0.04). Favorable changes in obesity-related factors are associated with reductions in aldosterone in young adults with no risk factors besides excess weight, an important finding, given aldosterone's emergence as an important cardiometabolic risk factor.

Potassium measurement factors and mechanisms — causes and implications are detailed for pseudohyperkalemia, shifts, impaired excretion, diurnal/postprandial effects, and sample type. Pseudohyperkalemia occurs when "in vivo serum potassium is normal and commonly GFR preserved, but during the process of drawing blood or clotting, there has been a release of intracellular potassium", with causes including "Tight tourniquet", "Hand/arm exercising or clenching at the time of blood draw", and "Hemolysis due to vigorous shaking of blood vial/inappropriate blood draw equipment/inappropriate storage of samples"; if suspected, "blood should be retaken and analyzed in the appropriate manner and time frame", and "take plasma potassium as serum potassium may be falsely increased". Hyperkalemia may reflect shifting due to "Increase in plasma osmolality… ", "β-adrenergic blockade", "Insulin deficiency", "Aldosterone blockade", or "Nonorganic acidosis", and also "Disruption in the release of insulin… " or "Disruption to the release of aldosterone… " Decreased excretion causes include "Advancing CKD resulting in inability to excrete excessive potassium", "Constipation: in advancing CKD, the gut assumes a much more important role… by increasing the excretion of potassium", and "Medications: blocking the RAAS pathway and other medication resulting in the inability to excrete excessive potassium (Table 26)". There is "Diurnal variation in potassium excretion with most excretion in humans occurring close to noon", and "Note the 0.24–0.73 mmol/l variation in K+ values within individuals over a 24-hour period". "Potassium values differ between serum and plasma values with serum values being typically higher. Healthcare providers need to be aware of the right reference values for the sample". In chronic kidney disease (CKD), "As kidney function declines in CKD, there is a corresponding decline in the ability of the kidneys to increase kaliuresis postprandially, eventually becoming insufficient to maintain external potassium balance".

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116dXDd6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — saline suppression test: After sitting for 1 hour, blood should be drawn to mark t = 0. Two liters of normal saline are infused over 4 hours (500 mL/h for 4 hours) while maintaining a seated position, after which blood should be drawn; plasma aldosterone and serum potassium are measured at t = 0 and t = 4 hours. Plasma aldosterone < 162 pmol/L (5.8 ng/dL) via LC–MS/MS assay makes PA unlikely, and plasma aldosterone < 217 pmol/L (7.8 ng/dL) via immunoassay makes PA unlikely. Because hypokalemia may cause false-negative interpretations, serum potassium should be normalized before the study protocol; interpretation of results should be considered to be probabilistic as the evidence to support a singular diagnostic threshold is not firm. The protocol requires an in-person visit, space and staff to accommodate the procedures, and intravenous (IV) infusion of saline, and it should not be performed if baseline BP is uncontrolled, or in patients at high risk for pulmonary edema such as heart failure or advanced chronic kidney disease.

### Potassium homeostasis [^112aMnj7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Potassium homeostasis is essential for maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of excitable cells. Yet daily dietary potassium typically far exceeds total extracellular potassium, thus the body has elegant strategies to shift potassium into cells promptly after a meal and then the kidneys efficiently excrete potassium. Potassium excretion depends on adequate kidney perfusion and filtration, sodium delivery to the distal nephron and aldosterone action on the distal nephron. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia have been associated with an increase in mortality. In this piece, we share 5 challenging cases to explore normal potassium homeostasis and disorders that can lead to derangements in potassium balance or excretion.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1157By8d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia-or the fear of hyperkalemia-contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Primary aldosteronism, a common entity? the myth persists [^1147UM59]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Primary aldosterone excess or hyperaldosteronism is an important cause of hypertension which, when associated with an aldosterone secreting adenoma, is amenable to surgical cure. The biochemical hallmarks of the condition are a relative excess of aldosterone production with suppression of plasma levels of renin (a proxy for angiotensin II, the major trophic substance regulating aldosterone secretion). This combination of a high aldosterone and a low renin is however more commonly associated with 'nodular hyperplasia' of the adrenal glands, a condition not improved by surgery and variably responsive to the effects of the mineralocorticoid antagonist, spironolactone. Until recently the prevalence of either form of secondary hypertension has been thought to be low such that few clinicians 'hunted' for it in the absence of hypokalaemia (the traditional clue for the syndrome). This view has been challenged, firstly by the realisation that no more than 50% of such patients will have a low plasma potassium and secondly by the assumption that a 'normal' plasma aldosterone is in fact inappropriately elevated if the renin level is low. A single measurement of the ratio of aldosterone to renin levels is claimed to be highly predictive of patients who will have primary aldosterone excess. This paper examines the logic behind such claims and presents evidence from the literature that an abnormal ratio is simply a different description of the low renin state and that such patients do not necessarily have mineralocorticoid hypertension. Most patients 'discovered' by this test will have what many call low-renin hypertension, a condition not amenable to specific therapy. Claims that they are peculiarly sensitive to the hypotensive effects of spironolactone have not been tested in controlled trials. The test would however be expected to pick up those individuals with true Conn's syndrome but such patients remain too few in number to justify widespread use of an expensive screening test.

### Efficacy of add-on aldosterone receptor blocker in uncontrolled hypertension [^115aMcwb]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Uncontrolled hypertension (UH) may be caused by hyperaldosteronism, and some experts recommend the routine use of aldosterone antagonists in this condition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this approach and to characterize those who respond effectively to an add-on aldosterone antagonist.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the effectiveness of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, used as add-on therapy, compared with a standard add-on treatment, in patients referred to a hypertension clinic with UH despite the use of two or more antihypertensive drugs.

Results

A total of 340 patients (186 male) with an average age of 63 ± 14 years were followed for at least 3 months. Of the patients, 42 received add-on spironolactone and 298 received an additional antihypertensive drug other than spironolactone. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly in both groups. In patients who received spironolactone, BP decreased by 23.2/12.5 mm Hg from 165 ± 27/94 ± 15 to 142 ± 25/81 ± 9 mm Hg, whereas in patients who received other add-on therapy BP decreased by 7.6/5.8 mm Hg from 160 ± 24/91 ± 12 to 152 ± 20/85 ± 11 mm Hg (P < .05). Patients who received spironolactone had lower serum potassium levels than those who did not receive spironolactone 3.8 ± 0.4 v 4.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L respectively (P < .001). Potassium levels < 4 mmol/L were associated with a greater reduction in BP.

Conclusions

Add-on spironolactone is a highly effective add-on treatment in UH, mainly in patients with low serum potassium levels. Further studies assessing serum potassium as a marker for treatment approach are needed to establish the role of aldosterone antagonists in the management of UH.

### Assessment of the novel selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone using ambulatory and clinical blood pressure in patients with systemic hypertension [^113dsCh6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Eplerenone is a highly selective aldosterone blocking agent, which was recently approved for the treatment of hypertension and has also been shown to reduce mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients with heart failure. To assess its usefulness in patients with essential hypertension, we performed a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, fixed-dose study over a range of doses using clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (BP). After single-blind placebo therapy for 3 to 4 weeks to obtain baseline measures, 400 patients were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 4 doses of eplerenone (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg once daily). In addition, changes from baseline in serum potassium, active renin activity, and serum aldosterone were assessed. After 12 weeks of therapy, reductions in clinic BP showed a significant dose response in which 25 mg of eplerenone achieved statistical significance compared with placebo for systolic BP; maximum clinic BP reduction was achieved with the 100 mg dose. Ambulatory BP monitoring showed that all doses of eplerenone (25 to 200 mg/day) lowered BP significantly greater than placebo with a significant dose response. The 24-hour mean BP reductions ranged from 6.4/4.4 to 10.3/5.7 mm Hg on eplerenone compared with 1.3/0.8 mm Hg on placebo. One patient on placebo and 1 patient on 200 mg of eplerenone had episodes of elevated serum potassium levels (> 5.5 mEq/L). Increases in serum aldosterone were related to dose but not to reductions in 24-hour BP. Side effects and withdrawal rates attributed to eplerenone were similar to those of placebo. These data show that eplerenone is an effective antihypertensive agent at doses as low as 25 mg/day. The top effective dose in stage 1 to 3 hypertension based on clinic and ambulatory BP was 100 mg once daily. The incidence of elevated serum potassium levels was not increased across doses of eplerenone in this study.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Recommendations concerning aldosterone antagonists — scope, thresholds, and combination cautions — state that "the addition of low-dose aldosterone antagonists should be considered" in carefully selected patients with moderately severe or severe heart failure or "LV dysfunction early after MI". Trial enrollment generally excluded patients with creatinine "in excess of 2.5 mg per dL", and "few patients were actually enrolled with serum creatinine levels over 1.5 mg per dL"; in the MI trial, the "average serum creatinine" was "1.1 mg per dL, above which there was no demonstrable benefit for survival". To minimize life-threatening hyperkalemia, patients "should have initial serum creatinine less than 2.0 to 2.5 mg per dL" and "serum potassium less than 5.0 mEq per dL". For some with mild to moderate symptoms, "it may be reasonable to consider" adding aldosterone antagonists to loop diuretics, but the committee notes "insufficient data or experience to provide a specific or strong recommendation", and "it is not currently recommended" to give aldosterone antagonists without other concomitant diuretic therapy in chronic HF. Use with both ACEIs and ARBs is cautioned, as "this combination cannot be recommended".

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Primary aldosteronism: molecular medicine meets public health [^1177xRtW]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The pathogenesis of hypertension in PA can be ascribed to a combination of inappropriate sodium retention by epithelial cells of the kidneys (and consequent extracellular fluid volume expansion), together with the vasoconstricting actions of aldosterone. The word 'inappropriate' is important; high levels of aldosterone are homeostatically logical in states of sodium depletion, but in the context of sodium excess can cause tissue injury, especially in the heart and kidney, as has been reviewed elsewhere. In addition to ANGII, other determinants of aldosterone secretion under physiological conditions are extracellular potassium and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH).

The definition of PA as outlined by the Endocrine Society emphasizes the inappropriateness of aldosterone production for total body sodium status and for the prevailing levels of ANGII and blood potassium. In practice it is not easy or routine to measure total body sodium status or ANGII concentrations, and blood potassium concentrations are not always a reliable indicator of total body potassium levels. Indeed, the measurement of aldosterone itself is also not without controversy, and much higher prevalence figures for PA might be obtained if 24-h urine measurements were routinely used to avoid diurnal fluctuations in secretion. However, the definition is pertinent to our hypothesis that the pathogenesis and frequency of PA relates – at least in part – to a maladaptive response to high sodium intake.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^11628net]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — screening test interpretation and patient preparation — relies on combined interpretation of plasma aldosterone concentration, renin activity, and the aldosterone to renin activity ratio as the most accurate and reliable screening approach. Patients with primary aldosteronism typically have suppressed renin activity (< 1 ng/mL/h), most data support that the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive, and the most commonly used aldosterone to renin activity ratio cutoff is 30 (with plasma aldosterone in ng/dL and plasma renin activity in ng/mL/h), although some data support alternative thresholds (20 or 40). Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and ideally, MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone) withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing, and additional evaluation may be indicated if the renin activity is suppressed; low screening rates may be due to barriers such as older medication-withdrawal guidance, which has since been disputed by growing evidence supporting screening despite treatment with most medications.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11575zoP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Recommendation 3 (screening tests and thresholds) states that in individuals with hypertension, we suggest primary aldosteronism (PA) screening with serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity) (2 | ⊕⊕OO). Technical remarks specify to screen for PA by measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with individuals seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening, to measure potassium alongside renin and aldosterone — not for screening itself but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone — as low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone, and to manage the timing and withdrawal of interfering medications before screening depending on individual safety and feasibility. A positive screen meets both of the following conditions in most circumstances: renin is low/suppressed with plasma renin activity (PRA) ≤ 1 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration (DRC) ≤ 8.2 mU/L AND serum/plasma aldosterone concentration ≥ 10 ng/dL (≥ 277 pmol/L) when measured by immunoassay or ≥ 7.5 ng/dL (≥ 208 pmol/L) when measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); and the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) is elevated, indicative of PA if the aldosterone [ng/dL] to PRA [ng/mL/h] ratio is ≥ 20 or aldosterone [pmol/L] to DRC [mU/L] ratio is ≥ 70 when aldosterone is measured by immunoassay, with the ARR indicative of PA about 25% lower when aldosterone is measured by LC-MS/MS; if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, potassium should be corrected to the laboratory reference range and screening repeated.

Mortality and Hyperkalemia: Complex Relationships

The benefits of adherence to RAASi therapy in patients with CKD and CHF are profound. Therapy with RAASi reduces all‐cause mortality in patients with CHF with reduced ejection fraction. 2 In the management of CKD, RAASi use has been shown to reduce proteinuria and slow estimated glomerular filtration rate decline. 3 However, because of RAASi mechanisms of action through either reduction in aldosterone production or inhibition of aldosterone activity, RAASi use increases the risk for the development of hyperkalemia. In the setting of CKD and CHF without RAASi, hyperkalemia can also occur, particularly during acute reduction in kidney function or when acute changes in dietary potassium take place. Given the life‐threatening nature of hyperkalemia, this is a significant component of management in these complicated patients. With the overarching concern for patient safety as it relates to hyperkalemia, stopping RAASi tends to receive more attention than timely restarting of RAASi medications in these vulnerable patient populations.

In CKD, urinary potassium excretion is reduced as estimated glomerular filtration rate declines. In patients with normal kidney function, 90% of dietary potassium is excreted by the kidney. In contrast in individuals with advanced CKD, the kidney excretes only 70% with the remainder being excreted by the gastrointestinal tract. Despite reduction in total body potassium in patients with advanced CKD, internal homeostasis of potassium becomes dysregulated in a variety of conditions that are also present in many CKD and CHF patients, increasing the risk of hyperkalemia. Most significant, diabetes mellitus, particularly insulin requiring, can result in larger fluctuations in serum potassium concentration because of poor intracellular potassium uptake in the absence of insulin. In CHF, decreased effective arterial blood volume promotes proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, which will decrease sodium delivery to the distal tubules and impair the secretion of potassium. 4 Although aldosterone is the key regulator of external potassium homeostasis and urinary potassium excretion, in decompensated CHF where effective arterial blood volume is significantly reduced, the prerenal state and avid sodium retention results in inadequate distal sodium delivery to exchange with potassium. Although increases in serum creatinine consistent with prerenal azotemia can occur in this setting, no change in serum creatinine is required for inadequate sodium–potassium exchange distally.

### Evidence for a gastrointestinal-renal kaliuretic signaling axis in humans [^116vCiJh]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

A gastrointestinal-renal kaliuretic signaling axis has been proposed to regulate potassium excretion in response to acute potassium ingestion independent of the extracellular potassium concentration and aldosterone. Here we studied this presumed axis in 32 individuals in our clinical pharmacology unit while on a 20mmol sodium and 60mmol potassium diet. The serum potassium concentration, potassium excretion, aldosterone, and insulin were measured following either a 35mmol oral potassium load, a potassium- and sodium-deficient complex meal, or a potassium-deficient complex meal plus 35mmol potassium. This design allowed determination of the component effects on potassium handling of the meal and potassium load separately. The meal plus potassium test was repeated following aldosterone blockade with eplerenone to specifically evaluate the role of aldosterone. In response to the potassium-deficient meal plus 35mmol potassium, the serum potassium did not increase but the hourly mean potassium excretion increased sharply. This kaliuresis persisted following aldosterone blockade with eplerenone, further suggesting independence from aldosterone. Thus, a gastrointestinal-renal kaliuretic signaling axis exists in humans mediating potassium excretion independent of changes in the serum potassium concentration and aldosterone. The implication of this mechanism is yet to be determined but may account for a significant component of potassium excretion following a complex potassium-rich meal.

2 REGULATION OF POTASSIUM HOMEOSTASIS

Potassium is a very important electrolyte for the maintenance of the physiologic cell function. Approximately 2% of total‐body K+ is in extracellular fluid, whereas 98% of K+ is in the intracellular compartment. Cellular Na + ‐K + ‐ATPase plays a key role in this homeostasis by pumping Na + out of the cell and K + into the cell and this process leads to a K + gradient across the cell membrane which is vitally important for normal cellular function. The body has developed numerous mechanisms for maintaining serum K + in a narrow range and kidney is the organ with the primary responsibility of this and adjustments in renal K + excretion occur over several hours. Serum potassium homeostasis is usually preserved until GFR is reduced substantially.

There are several mechanisms regulating potassium secretion and potassium reabsorption. K + is freely filtered across the glomerulus and then reabsorbed by the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the kidney. The shift in lumen potential from negative to positive in the proximal tubule provides a driving force for K + reabsorption. In the thick ascending limb, K + reabsorption is mediated mostly by the Na + ‐K + ‐2Cl − cotransporter located on the apical membrane while a small proportion is reabsorpted through the paracellular pathway. Important factors for this regulation include luminal sodium delivery and flow rate, plasma potassium concentration, circulating aldosterone and arginine vasopressin, and acid‐base status. Αldosterone, angiotensin II, distal delivery of Na + and water are key factors in the renal excretion of K +. Angiotensin II‐mediated stimulation of aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland control renal blood flow and GFR and therefore potassium balance. Decreased renal excretion of K + can be due to a decreased distal delivery of Na +, mineralocorticoid deficiency, and/or abnormal cortical collecting tubule function. In addition, catecholamines through β 2 ‐stimulation regulate extracellular K + concentration. K + homeostasis mechanisms are also modulated in the gut and ranges according to potassium intake through diet.

Primary aldosteronism — oral sodium suppression test: Individuals are instructed to consume 4–5 g of sodium per day for 3–4 days, then collect a 24-h urine on the final day of high sodium intake, measuring urinary aldosterone, sodium, and creatinine. Adequacy targets include 24-h urine sodium should ideally be > 200 mEq/ 24 hours, and 24-h urine creatinine is used to assess adequacy of urine collection. Oral sodium can be provided via sodium chloride tablets or sodium rich foods, and because hypokalemia may cause false-negative interpretations, serum potassium should be normalized before the study protocol.

### Effect of oral glucose administration on serum potassium concentration in hemodialysis patients [^117S8EGJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Extrarenal potassium disposal is particularly critical in patients with end-stage renal disease. Exogenous insulin stimulates this disposal by enhancing potassium uptake into cells in hemodialysis (HD) patients and healthy subjects. However, the effect of physiological levels of endogenous insulin on this disposal in these patients or healthy subjects is unknown.

Methods

Effects of an oral glucose tolerance test (37.5, 75, and 150 g) on serum potassium levels were determined in 13 HD patients and 7 healthy controls. Serum potassium and insulin levels and plasma aldosterone and epinephrine levels were measured before and after glucose loads.

Results

In HD patients and controls, serum insulin levels increased to a similar magnitude in parallel with increased serum glucose levels, but serum potassium levels decreased significantly only in HD patients. In HD patients, plasma aldosterone or epinephrine levels were not changed significantly after a glucose load. In HD patients, the decrease in serum potassium levels was dependent on the increase in serum insulin levels and was more prominent when 150 g of glucose was administered. In HD patients, the decrease in serum potassium levels correlated negatively (r = -0.45; P < 0.001) with the increase in serum insulin levels, and maximal decrease in serum potassium levels correlated negatively (r = -0.54; P < 0.001) with maximal increase in serum insulin levels.

Conclusion

Endogenous production of physiological concentrations of insulin in response to exogenous glucose administration decreases serum potassium levels only in HD patients, independently of plasma aldosterone and epinephrine levels.

### Primary aldosteronism and its various clinical scenarios [^114gDm3H]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism is the most frequent endocrine cause of secondary hypertension. Aldosterone excess damages the cardiovascular system.

Objectives

We compared biochemical; morphological, and cardiovascular risk differences among hypokalemic and normokalemic primary aldosteronism. We evaluated either both presentations correspond to two different entities or a unique disease in different evolutive stage.

Material and Methods

This is a retrospective study including 157 patients with primary aldosteronism divided into two groups: typical presentation (serum potassium < 3.5mmol/l, n = 87) and atypical presentation (serum potassium > 3.5mmol/l, n = 70).

Results

The typical presentation group showed higher family background of ischemic heart disease (P = 0.028), plasmatic aldosterone levels (P = 0.001), and cardiovascular added risk (P = 0.013). Although kalemia was corrected in the hypokalemic group after specific treatment, typical presentation maintained lower levels. Predictors of typical presentation were the highest tertile of aldosterone level, baseline DBP, and a longer evolution of hypertension. Aldosterone serum levels increased along time in primary aldosteronism and it can be considered as the most discriminative factor for the type of presentation.

Conclusion

Primary aldosteronism presentation along with normokalemia or hypokalemia could be the same disease at different evolution stages. Adequate detection of normokalemic primary aldosteronism deserves an early and intentional diagnostic attitude.

### The association between dual RAAS inhibition and risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia in patients with diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115LX4Ao]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The findings of dual therapy increasing the risk of hyperkalemia are not surprising. RAAS inhibition decreases aldosterone production which reduces the secretion of aldosterone. Potassium excretion is regulated by serum aldosterone; therefore, low levels of aldosterone cause an increase in serum potassium levels that may develop into hyperkalemia. Patients with DKD are even more prone to hyperkalemia since their RAAS activity is already suppressed because of an impaired conversion of pro-renin to renin or suppression of plasma renin activity. Furthermore, RAAS inhibitors also increase resistance to aldosterone, which necessitates even higher levels be produced to regulate potassium in the blood. Some believe MRAs act as another class of RAAS inhibitors as they are aldosterone antagonists and block the interaction between aldosterone and the MR. Serum aldosterone levels typically rise with the addition of an MRA; however, the ability to bind/activate the MR is reduced.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (technical considerations), ES 2025 guidelines recommend to repeat the test on a different day if the patient's initial screen is negative and factors such as hypokalemia or medications could have led to a false-negative result. Correct hypokalemia where present and withdraw interfering medications if safe and feasible. Withdraw mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, epithelial sodium channel inhibitors (such as amiloride and triamterene) and other diuretics for 4 weeks, and ACEis and ARBs for 2 weeks, as these medications raise renin or lower aldosterone. Measure plasma potassium in blood collected slowly with a syringe and needle, preferably not using a vacuum-sealed blood collection tube, for accurate potassium determination. Avoid fist clenching during collection, wait at least 5 seconds after tourniquet release to insert the needle, and ensure separation of plasma from cells within 30 minutes of collection.

### Key developments in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition [^116mxr4v]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was initially thought to be fairly simple. However, this idea has been challenged following the development of RAAS blockers, including renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, type 1 angiotensin II (AT(1))-receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. Consequently, new RAAS components and pathways that might contribute to the effectiveness of these drugs and/or their adverse effects have been identified. For example, an increase in renin levels during RAAS blockade might result in harmful effects via stimulation of the prorenin receptor (PRR), and prorenin-the inactive precursor of renin-might gain enzymatic activity on PRR binding. The increase in angiotensin II levels that occurs during AT(1)-receptor blockade might result in beneficial effects via stimulation of type 2 angiotensin II receptors. Moreover, angiotensin 1–7 levels increase during ACE inhibition and AT(1)-receptor blockade, resulting in Mas receptor activation and the induction of cardioprotective and renoprotective effects, including stimulation of tissue repair by stem cells. Finally, a role of angiotensin II in sodium and potassium handling in the distal nephron has been identified. This finding is likely to have important implications for understanding the effects of RAAS inhibition on whole body sodium and potassium balance.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — screening methodology and thresholds — relies on the combined interpretation of the plasma aldosterone concentration, renin activity, and aldosterone to renin activity ratio, which is currently the most accurate and reliable means of screening. Patients with primary aldosteronism typically have suppressed renin activity (< 1 ng/mL/h), and most data support that the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive. The most commonly used cutoff value for the aldosterone to renin activity ratio is 30 when plasma aldosterone concentration is reported in ng/dL and plasma renin activity in ng/mL/h, although some data support alternative thresholds (20 or 40). Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and ideally mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing.

### Is spironolactone safe for dialysis patients? [^117RQVdb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone is useful in heart failure, but is not given to dialysis patients for fear of hyperkalaemia. This study evaluated the safety of spironolactone administration in haemodialysis patients.

Methods

Fifteen haemodialysis outpatients with mean serum potassium < 5.6 mEq/l over the preceding 4 months were treated with spironolactone 25 mg daily for 28 days. Serum potassium was measured before every haemodialysis during the study. Aldosterone and renin were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Patients were monitored for side effects. Data were examined with a paired t-test, with patients serving as their own controls and P < 0.05 considered significant. A sample size of 14 was required to achieve a power of 0.8 and a P = 0.05 to detect a potassium difference of 0.5 ± 0.6 mEq/l. All patients were analysed as intention-to-treat.

Results

The mean potassium level was 4.6 ± 0.6 mEq/l at baseline and 4.9 ± 0.9 mEq/l at study completion (P = 0.14). Thirteen patients completed the trial with no potassium levels > 6.0 mEq/l. Four patients had potassium levels between 5.5 and 6.0 mEq/l. One patient was withdrawn at day 20 after developing hyperkalaemia (7.6 mEq/l). Another patient was withdrawn at day 25 after missing a dialysis treatment. There were no differences in either baseline or 28 day aldosterone or renin levels (16.8 ± 28.8 vs 11.7 ± 6.1 ng/dl and 3.5 ± 3.9 vs 3.5 ± 3.5 ng/ml/h, respectively). Infrequent side effects included dry mouth, nosebleed, pruritus, gynecomastia and diarrhoea. No significant leukopenia or anaemia was noted.

Conclusions

Spironolactone may be considered as a treatment option for selected chronic haemodialysis patients with heart disease.

### Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide [^116jeKWn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

As a result of its diuretic effects, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium. Administration of enalapril maleate blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.

In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide was usually sustained for at least 24 hours.

Concomitant administration of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide has little, or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities.

Mechanism of Action

Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilat, inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Although the latter decrease is small, it results in small increases of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate alone for up to 48 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of approximately 0.2 mEq/L were observed. In patients treated with enalapril maleate plus a thiazide diuretic, there was essentially no change in serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.

ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which enalapril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, enalapril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although enalapril was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to enalapril maleate monotherapy than non-black patients. In contrast, hydrochlorothiazide was more effective in black patients than enalapril. Concomitant administration of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide was equally effective in black and non-black patients.

### Aldosterone-targeted therapies: early implementation in resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^116SmjEQ]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone synthase inhibition

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were associated with a reactive increase in aldosterone which may have MR-independent effects and exert much rapid effects by an alternative receptor. Aldosterone synthase inhibitor can limit aldosterone-related adverse effects by suppressing an hormone synthesis rather than blocking the MR(Figure 1).

In the BrigHTN trial including 248 patients with TRH and an eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, baxdrostat vs placebo reduced systolic BP dose-dependently over 12 weeks and decreased serum and urine aldosterone levels, without affecting serum cortisol. In two patients from the baxdrostat group, serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L was observed but did not recur after the drug withdrawal and reinitiation. However, in the HALO trial including 249 patients with uncontrolled hypertension, baxdrostat (0.5–2 mg/day) did not significantly reduce BP compared with placebo. A large placebo effect and low adherence to the study drug at some sites may impact its efficacy (Bhatt, unpublished data). Lorundrostat, another ASI agent, was studied in the Target-HTN trial, which included 200 patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Their results showed that lorundrostat vs placebo dose-dependently and consistently reduced systolic BP over 8 weeks regardless of baseline plasma renin activity. Severe hyperkalaemia (potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L) was uncommon. Blood pressure–lowering effects of ASI are summarized in Table 2.

Aldosterone synthase inhibitor may also have reno-protective effect. In a Phase 2 trial including 586 people with CKD (eGFR 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR 200–5000 mg/g) on an ACEi/ARB, BI690517 significantly and dose-dependently reduced UACR levels compared with placebo despite concurrent empagliflozin use. Further comparative studies will be needed to determine whether ASIs are equivalent or superior to MRAs in terms of clinical outcomes. Additionally, despite the distinct molecular and hormonal mechanisms between ASIs and MRAs targeting the aldosterone pathway, monitoring serum potassium and creatinine after the initiation of ASIs will remain necessary, as is the case with MRA therapy.

### A systematic review to compare adrenalectomy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism [^1161uEox]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, no systematic review has examined whether adrenalectomy (ADX) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment is more effective in patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism (uPA). Comparing clinical and biochemical data before and after treatment, we performed a systematic review to determine whether either ADX or MRA treatment is superior to the other in patients with uPA. Article search was performed using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ICHUSHI electronic databases. A comparative analysis was performed when at least 3 articles were available in each outcome. The collected data were used to calculate the effect measures represented as mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR). Our search strategy identified 526 abstracts, of which 7 research papers were finally included in the analysis. ADX for uPA patients significantly reduced the incidence of cerebro-cardiovascular disease (OR 0.63 [95% confidence interval 0.46, 0.85]), lowered the systolic BP (-8.78mmHg [-11.61, -5.95]), and increased the serum potassium levels (0.43mmol/L [0.35, 0.51]) compared to MRAs. In conclusion, ADX is more effective than MRA treatment in patients with uPA, but with higher risk of increased serum potassium levels.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism: practical clinical perspectives [^114d3Hy6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA), the most common form of secondary hypertension, can be either surgically cured or treated with targeted pharmacotherapy. PA is frequently undiagnosed and untreated, leading to aldosterone-specific cardiovascular morbidity and nephrotoxicity. Thus, clinicians should perform case detection testing for PA at least once in all patients with hypertension. Confirmatory testing is indicated in most patients with positive case detection testing results. The next step is to determine whether patients with confirmed PA have a disease that can be cured with surgery or whether it should be treated medically; this step is guided by computed tomography scan of the adrenal glands and adrenal venous sampling. With appropriate surgical expertise, laparoscopic unilateral adrenalectomy is safe, efficient and curative in patients with unilateral adrenal disease. In patients who have bilateral aldosterone hypersecretion, the optimal management is a low-sodium diet and lifelong treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist administered at a dosage to maintain a high-normal serum potassium concentration without the aid of oral potassium supplements.

### Effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159TJvP]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), which commonly co-exist, are both established risk factors for cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. When both are present, the risk for cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease significantly increases. With intensive reduction in blood pressure (BP) in patients with DM, cardiovascular events, especially stroke, occur less often. Therefore, strict BP control is important to reduce the cardiovascular risk in patients with DM.

Because they reportedly protect renal function, renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), are recommended as first-line antihypertensive therapy for DM. However, BP control using monotherapy is often difficult in patients with DM; treatment with multiple drugs with different mechanisms for BP reduction is necessary.

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid and final product of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone blockade by selective and non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone or eplerenone, lowers BP and improves renal function. MRAs might also be effective in patients with resistant hypertension already treated with ⩾3 antihypertensive medications, including RAS inhibitors. Because aldosterone production is largely dependent on regulation by the upstream factor angiotensin II, it is possible that RAS inhibitors might, at least partly, attenuate the BP-lowering effects of MRAs due to a reduction in the angiotensin II-dependent production of aldosterone. However, many patients experience the 'aldosterone breakthrough' phenomenon, which is characterized by serum aldosterone levels returning to or exceeding baseline levels after the initiation of pharmacological blockade of the RAS. Therefore, MRAs might be effective in patients already treated with RAS inhibitors. However, both RAS inhibitors and MRAs can increase serum potassium levels. Their concomitant use could further increase the risk of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with reduced renal function, including patients with DM. However, the effect of combination MRA and RAS inhibitor treatment on BP and hyperkalemia risk in patients with DM has not been assessed in a large population.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the antihypertensive effect and safety, indicated by serum potassium levels, of MRAs and RAS inhibitors used in combination to treat hypertensive patients with DM.

### The spectrum of subclinical primary aldosteronism and incident hypertension: a cohort study [^114csv8n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism is recognized as a severe form of renin-independent aldosteronism that results in excessive mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation.

Objective

To investigate whether a spectrum of subclinical renin-independent aldosteronism that increases risk for hypertension exists among normotensive persons.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

National community-based study.

Participants

850 untreated normotensive participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) with measurements of serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA).

Measurements

Longitudinal analyses investigated whether aldosterone concentrations, in the context of physiologic PRA phenotypes (suppressed, ≤ 0.50 µg/L per hour; indeterminate, 0.51 to 0.99 µg/L per hour; unsuppressed, ≥ 1.0 µg/L per hour), were associated with incident hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, or initiation of antihypertensive medications). Cross-sectional analyses investigated associations between aldosterone and MR activity, assessed via serum potassium and urinary fractional excretion of potassium.

Results

A suppressed renin phenotype was associated with a higher rate of incident hypertension than other PRA phenotypes (incidence rates per 1000 person-years of follow-up: suppressed renin phenotype, 85.4 events [95% CI, 73.4 to 99.3 events]; indeterminate renin phenotype, 53.3 events [CI, 42.8 to 66.4 events]; unsuppressed renin phenotype, 54.5 events [CI, 41.8 to 71.0 events]). With renin suppression, higher aldosterone concentrations were independently associated with an increased risk for incident hypertension, whereas no association between aldosterone and hypertension was seen when renin was not suppressed. Higher aldosterone concentrations were associated with lower serum potassium and higher urinary excretion of potassium, but only when renin was suppressed.

Limitation

Sodium and potassium were measured several years before renin and aldosterone.

Conclusion

Suppression of renin and higher aldosterone concentrations in the context of this renin suppression are associated with an increased risk for hypertension and possibly also with increased MR activity. These findings suggest a clinically relevant spectrum of subclinical primary aldosteronism (renin-independent aldosteronism) in normotension.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1144kANq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia from defective potassium excretion in the distal nephron

Ninety percent of excreted potassium exits via the kidneys and the kidneys have a remarkable capacity to increase potassium excretion in the face of potassium excess. Consequently hyperkalemia is almost never encountered clinically in the context of normal renal function and a normal adrenal–kidney axis.

Physiological control of potassium excretion is exercised in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (reviewed in McDonough and Youn and Welling). An understanding of the molecular pathways of potassium excretion can help in understanding the clinical insults that induce hyperkalemia. Potassium is secreted through renal tubular cells via the sodium–potassium pump in the basolateral membrane and at least four different types of ion channels in the apical membrane. The most well-studied of these are the ROMK channel and the BK channel.

### Factors influencing the efficacy and safety of esaxerenone in hypertensive patients: a pooled analysis of five clinical studies on different comorbidities [^115PNbKK]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A previous pooled analysis of seven phase 3 clinical trials investigated background factors associated with the antihypertensive effect of esaxerenone. In that study, the office BP-lowering effect of esaxerenone after 12 weeks of treatment was found to be associated with female sex, low body weight, low plasma aldosterone concentration, short duration of hypertension, no history of antihypertensive medication, low UACR, and non-smoker status. Additionally, the study investigated factors associated with an increase in serum potassium levels during esaxerenone treatment. Elevated serum potassium levels are a well-known class adverse effect of esaxerenone. High serum potassium, low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and high UACR were associated with an increase in serum potassium levels with esaxerenone administration, which are already included in the package insert. However, there is a lack of studies evaluating factors associated with the home BP-lowering effect of esaxerenone, as well as other potential factors related to safety concerns of serum potassium elevation in real clinical conditions.

We hypothesized that there is a subgroup of hypertensive patients who can significantly improve home BP control with esaxerenone treatment in real clinical conditions. By evaluating a hypertensive population with background factors more similar to real clinical conditions, we may identify patients who could benefit more from esaxerenone treatment within real-world settings.

This study aimed to identify background factors associated with a strong home BP-lowering effect of esaxerenone and the incidence of elevated serum potassium levels in hypertensive patients treated with esaxerenone.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: a clinical and scientific call to action [^111r5wu5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Approach for Monitoring

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed (eg, trimethoprim or β‐blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over‐the‐counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history and comorbidities but at a minimum at least every 4 months.

### Distinguishing the antihypertensive and electrolyte effects of eplerenone [^1112kDQp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

In two clinical trials on the antihypertensive effects of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone 397 essential hypertensives were dose titrated (50, 100, and 200 mg/d) over successive 4-wk periods until they reached target blood pressure levels. Of the total, 44% reached target on 50 mg/d, 17% on 100 mg/d, and 19% on 200 mg/d, with 20% failing to do so despite stepwise dose increases. At each dose level, those who reached target (responders) were compared with those who did not (nonresponders), with three major findings. First, at each dose level, the blood pressure fall in responders (systolic, 16–20 mm Hg; diastolic, approximately 15 mm Hg) was markedly more than mean values in nonresponders (systolic, 2–5 mm Hg; diastolic, 1–3 mm Hg). Second, sensitivity to eplerenone varied widely across the population studied in terms of blood pressure reduction. Third, there was no difference in plasma [K+] levels between responders and nonresponders at any dose level. We interpret these data as evidence for the major antihypertensive effect of eplerenone being via mechanisms other than those involving epithelial electrolyte and fluid transport. The modest (≤ 0.2 mEq/liter at 200 mg/d) mean elevation in plasma [K+] suggests that titration to effect rather than forced titration may minimize the risk of hyperkalemia, even where relatively high (100–200 mg/d) doses of the specific mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone may ultimately be required.

Screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) in hypertension — recommendation and implementation: The panel "suggests PA screening for individuals with hypertension based on the high prevalence of PA, its underdiagnosis, and the potential to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through targeted treatment", emphasizing that "this is a conditional recommendation". Evidence gaps are noted as "No direct comparative studies between screening and no screening were identified for critical clinical outcomes". Implementation is context dependent: "This is a conditional recommendation, and its implementation will vary depending on contextual factors at both the health-care system and clinician–patient levels". Resource constraints are highlighted: "Availability of laboratories to conduct aldosterone, renin, and potassium testing, as well as capacity for downstream evaluations such as aldosterone suppression testing, adrenal imaging, or AVS, varies widely", and "In settings where advanced diagnostics or specialist services are limited, alternative approaches — such as empiric MRA therapy following a positive screening result — may be appropriate".

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in ≈9% of patients admitted for acute HF, 1 and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. 2 Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. 3, 4 Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was ≈16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. 5 Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19 194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. 6 Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) and RASi as major risk factors for hyperkalemia. Given that 5.7 million people in the United States alone have HF and this number is increasing, there is an overwhelming number of patients at risk for hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. 7 Patients with HF are at a particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely reflective of their medical comorbidity, including renal dysfunction. In addition, several of the current medical therapies for the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) add to this risk. These include cornerstone therapies, such as the following: (1) RASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor inhibitors with or without neprilysin inhibition; and (2) MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Whether a consequence of a real or perceived risk of hyperkalemia, evidence supports that these therapies are underused, and when used there is suboptimal dose titration. 8, 9 Although there are data to support that mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5–5.5 mmol/L) in the setting of RASi and MRA therapy might not be associated with poor clinical outcomes, hyperkalemia in HF remains a major clinical dilemma. 3, 10

### Gastrointestinal potassium binding-more than just lowering serum [K (+)]: patiromer, potassium balance, and the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis [^112fsf33]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia limits the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (RAAS) blockers in patients with renal insufficiency. This can be managed by efforts to increase kaliuresis and by gastrointestinal potassium binding with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, a relatively ineffective agent. Now with the availability of patiromer, RAAS blockers can be used more liberally. In addition, potassium reduction decreases aldosterone, which may be beneficial. Adverse nonepithelial aldosterone effects such as endothelial dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis may be ameliorated.

### Effect of aldosterone antagonists on blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension: a meta-analysis [^117HKRRz]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

There is currently limited data on which drug should be used to improve blood pressure (BP) control in patients with resistant hypertension (RH). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies evaluating the anti-hypertensive benefit of aldosterone antagonists (AA) as an add-on therapy in patients with RH. A systematic literature search for eligible studies was conducted until June 2014, using literature databases and hand search. Studies were stratified according to controlled vs uncontrolled design and analyzed using random-effect models. We identified 13 eligible studies involving a total of 2640 patients, consisting of 3 randomized controlled trials, and 10 observational studies without a control group. In controlled studies, there was a reduction in mean systolic and diastolic BP of -16.5 (95% confidence interval (CI), -30.0 to -3.0) and -4.1 (95% CI, -7.8 to -0.32) mmHg, respectively, compared with control. In uncontrolled studies, there was a reduction in mean systolic and diastolic BP of -19.7 (95% CI, -23.2 to -16.2) and -9.1 (95% CI, -10.3 to -7.8) mmHg, respectively, compared with pre-AA therapy. Subgroup analysis showed that the systolic BP change was more pronounced in patients with baseline systolic BP > 150mmHg (weighted mean difference (WMD), -23.1mmHg) than in patients with ≤ 150mmHg (WMD, -15.4mmHg) (between groups P < 0.001), suggesting that the baseline systolic BP was a predictor of the BP response to AA treatment. Furthermore, AA demonstrated a mild increase in serum potassium and creatinine (for both, P < 0.001). The findings suggest that AA as an add-on therapy was effective for lowering systolic and diastolic BP in patients with RH.

### Effects of short-term potassium chloride supplementation in patients with CKD [^1175f6ED]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies suggest that adequate dietary potassium intake (90–120 mmol/day) may be renoprotective, but the effects of increasing dietary potassium and the risk of hyperkalemia are unknown.

Methods

This is a prespecified analysis of the run-in phase of a clinical trial in which 191 patients (age 68 ± 11 years, 74% males, 86% European ancestry, eGFR 31 ± 9 ml/min per 1.73 m b2, 83% renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, 38% diabetes) were treated with 40 mmol potassium chloride (KCl) per day for 2 weeks.

Results

KCl supplementation significantly increased urinary potassium excretion (72 ± 24 to 107 ± 29 mmol/day), plasma potassium (4.3 ± 0.5 to 4.7 ± 0.6 mmol/L), and plasma aldosterone (281 [198–431] to 351 [241–494] ng/L), but had no significant effect on urinary sodium excretion, plasma renin, BP, eGFR, or albuminuria. Furthermore, KCl supplementation increased plasma chloride (104 ± 3 to 105 ± 4 mmol/L) and reduced plasma bicarbonate (24.5 ± 3.4 to 23.7 ± 3.5 mmol/L) and urine pH (all P < 0.001), but did not change urinary ammonium excretion. In total, 21 participants (11%) developed hyperkalemia (plasma potassium 5.9 ± 0.4 mmol/L). They were older and had higher baseline plasma potassium.

Conclusions

In patients with CKD stage G3b-4, increasing dietary potassium intake to recommended levels with potassium chloride supplementation raises plasma potassium by 0.4 mmol/L. This may result in hyperkalemia in older patients or those with higher baseline plasma potassium. Longer-term studies should address whether cardiorenal protection outweighs the risk of hyperkalemia. Clinical trial number: NCT03253172.

### Mechanisms of impaired potassium handling with dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade in chronic kidney disease [^115DXsrN]. Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The combination of an aldosterone receptor antagonist added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular and renal end points in hypertensive humans but can produce hyperkalemia in the common clinical setting of impaired renal function. We investigated the effects of dual therapy on acute and chronic potassium handling in hypertensive humans with renal impairment by conducting a randomized crossover clinical trial of 4 weeks of 40 mg lisinopril/25 mg spironolactone versus placebo in 18 participants with a glomerular filtration rate of 25 to 65 mL/min. Study end points, following an established protocol, were hourly determinations of dynamic renal potassium excretion (mmol/h) and serum potassium (mmol/L) after 35 mmol oral potassium challenge in addition to ambulatory potassium concentration. After 4 weeks, ambulatory potassium concentration was 4.87 mmol/L with lisinopril/spironolactone versus 4.37 with placebo (P < 0.001). Lisinopril/spironolactone produced only a modest 0.44 mmol/h reduction in stimulated potassium excretion (P = 0.03) but a substantial 0.67 mmol/L increase in serum potassium (P < 0.001) in response to 35 mmol potassium; these findings are consistent with impaired extrarenal/transcellular potassium disposition. We found the increase in serum potassium after an oral potassium challenge to be a strong predictor of the increase in ambulatory potassium with lisinopril/spironolactone. Our study suggests that dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade may impair extrarenal/transcellular potassium disposition in addition to reducing potassium excretion in humans with renal impairment, and that acute changes in dynamic potassium handling are predictive of chronic changes in ambulatory potassium concentration with dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade.

### Safety and tolerability of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist BAY 94–8862 in patients with chronic heart failure and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease: a randomized, double-blind trial [^116p35zS]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The plasma half-life of BAY 94–8862 is ∼2 h in healthy humanscompared with > 12 h for spironolactone in healthy volunteers (> 24 h in patients with HF) owing to the generation of active metabolites. Although the half-life of BAY 94–8862 is relatively short, there does not seem to be any advantage in twice-daily administration in the present study. The relatively long duration of action of BAY 94–8862 despite its relatively short plasma half-life is similar to that of eplerenone, which has a plasma half-life of 4–6 h in patients with HFbut is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for HF at doses of 25 or 50 mg q.d. The duration of the effect of an MRA may depend on the biological half-life of the MR in producing its downstream effects in different tissues, such as sodium retention in the kidney or stimulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression, rather than the plasma elimination half-life of the MRA itself. Moreover, the effects of an MRA on pharmacological downstream targets in the kidney, such as the epithelial sodium channel (for sodium excretion) and the renal outer medullary potassium channel (for potassium retention), may take place over longer time frames.

As a consequence of receptor blockade by an antagonist, the serum concentrations of the receptor ligand are expected to rise. The magnitude of this rise is usually associated with the degree of receptor blockade. In ARTS, serum concentrations of the MR ligand aldosterone increased as expected in all BAY 94–8862 groups, and to a greater extent in the spironolactone group. Levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, and albuminuria were reduced by BAY 94–8862 5 and 10 mg q.d. to at least the same degree as spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d. despite the lower compensatory rises in aldosterone induced by BAY 94–8862. The finding that spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d. resulted in a greater increase in serum aldosterone levels than any dose of BAY 94–8862 may have several reasons (all of which will require further investigation), including: differences in plasma half-life; the effect of the differences in serum potassium concentration on the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland; and differences in the tissue distribution of the non-steroidal MRA BAY 94–8862 and the steroidal MRA spironolactone.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^113JwUf2]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level of greater than 5.5 mmol/L, is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes increased cardiac depolarization and can lead to rapid electrocardiographic changes and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Conversely, hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mmol/L (mild) or less than 2.5 mmol/L (severe) and can lead to an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition to the risk associated with serum potassium outside the normal range (i.e. below or above normal levels), maintaining stable serum potassium values within physiological levels is important, as high serum potassium fluctuations are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hyperkalemia and diabetes is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia. In an outpatient population of patients with diabetes, the prevalence of hyperkalemia has been estimated at 4%, whereas in a separate investigation in the general population, it has been estimated to be lower (0.3%). Additionally, diabetes is associated with a high incidence of renal impairment, which in turn is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia.

Antihypertensive medications, which are frequently prescribed to these patients, can also increase serum potassium. For example, medications that reduce renal potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)], and drugs that inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (known as potassium-sparing diuretics) are associated with a greater hyperkalemia risk. The combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a potassium-sparing diuretic is likely to further increase potassium levels and has been shown to precipitate life-threatening hyperkalemia in patients with diabetes. Conversely, other diuretics such as thiazides or loop diuretics are generally associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia.

Older patients with diabetes have an increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia due to a number of factors, including an age-related decline in renal function and pharmaceutical side effects, such as those associated with ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on adrenal cortical and cardiovascular responses to angiotensin II: a randomized crossover study [^114rAmrC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In an attempt to gain additional insight into the effect of increased potassium intake and potassium‐stimulated hyperaldosteronism on the human cardiovascular system, we conducted a randomized placebo‐controlled double‐blind crossover study in 25 normotensive men, where 4 weeks treatment with a potassium supplement (90 mmol/day) was compared with 4 weeks on placebo treatment. At the end of both treatment periods, we recorded ambulatory BP, urine volume and composition, and measured plasma concentrations of potassium and of various vasoactive hormones in plasma, including renin, AngII, and aldosterone. We also performed an AngII‐infusion experiment, during which we assessed the response of plasma aldosterone and the responses of other vasoactive hormones in plasma as well as we assessed a series of hemodynamic responses. Compared with the previous studies, where the effect of increased potassium intake on AngII‐stimulated aldosterone secretion was studied in normal subjects, 13, 14, 15 our study used a randomized placebo‐controlled double‐blind crossover design, was of longer duration (4 weeks on potassium versus ≤ 10 days on potassium), and included a much more detailed assessment of the systemic cardiovascular responses. Thus, during the AngII infusions, we recorded heart rate, BP, stroke volume, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and renal artery blood flow.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^1166E1WJ]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

MR blockers, including the new agent esaxerenone, have antihypertensive activity and organ protective effects. However, a careful approach to therapy and proper management of serum potassium is required to ensure safe clinical use of these agents. This includes awareness of at-risk patient groups, choosing appropriate dosages for therapy initiation and dosage titration, and monitoring of serum potassium during therapy. It is important that physicians take these important factors into consideration to optimize MR blocker therapy in patients with hypertension.

### Effects of potassium or sodium supplementation on mineral homeostasis: a controlled dietary intervention study [^116tAEjw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial with dietary control, both potassium and sodium supplementation reduced FGF23 levels. During potassium supplementation, this reduction was accompanied by a concomitant increase of renal phosphate reabsorption and plasma phosphate levels, without an effect on PTH or 25(OH)-vitamin D 3. In contrast, during sodium supplementation, the reduction of FGF23 was accompanied by a decrease of plasma phosphate. Furthermore, potassium supplementation decreased fractional calcium excretion and sodium supplementation led to an increase of urinary and fraction calcium excretion. Together, these findings suggest that sodium and potassium intake have differential effects on mineral metabolism, even though the underlying mechanisms seem complex and are not fully elucidated by the current study.

In the original study, 4 weeks of potassium supplementation decreased blood pressure which was mitigated by vasopressin, stimulation of renin and aldosterone, and an increased heart rate. The current study shows that higher potassium intake, independent of phosphate or protein intake, decreased FGF23 levels. This is in line with findings from a previous study showing that individuals consuming a potassium-poor Western diet display higher FGF23 levels, and that potassium excretion was inversely associated with FGF23. Effects of potassium on phosphate metabolism have been reported previously in preclinical and clinical studies. Potassium supplementation was shown to stimulate phosphate reabsorption in rats, presumably dependent on PTH. Moreover, 1 study in healthy adults found that potassium bicarbonate and potassium chloride changed the set point of phosphate reabsorption, resulting in higher plasma phosphate levels. Accordingly, in our study, potassium supplementation also increased TmP/GFR, and decreased the fractional excretion of phosphate, resulting in a higher plasma phosphate level, whereas PTH and 25(OH)-vitamin D 3 remained unchanged. These findings suggest that potassium supplementation decreased plasma FGF23, resulting in increased phosphate reabsorption in the kidney and higher plasma phosphate.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Recent Findings

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Summary

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.
