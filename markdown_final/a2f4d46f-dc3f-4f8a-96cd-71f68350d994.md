## Question

Urine protein level to hold avastin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to hold (withhold) bevacizumab (Avastin) for proteinuria, how to monitor, and how to resume therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled thresholds and monitoring algorithm. Then, I should verify the rationale for using 24-hour urine protein rather than spot UPCR. Next, I will review the clinical risks of not holding at the specified threshold. After that, I should outline the monitoring cadence and practical workflow. Finally, I will consider special populations, rechallenge, and summarize a concise decision rule with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the labeled threshold for holding bevacizumab. The FDA labeling instructs to withhold bevacizumab for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and to resume when proteinuria is less than 2 grams per 24 hours, with permanent discontinuation if nephrotic syndrome develops, which aligns across multiple bevacizumab product labels and safety sections [^115G2FjR] [^1121qe9Y] [^113DAYi6] [^1172XMRy] [^1125fLjR] [^114nx2b1].

> Wait, let me verify the monitoring pathway that triggers a 24-hour collection. The label advises serial urinalyses during therapy and that a dipstick of 2+ or greater should prompt a 24-hour urine protein quantification to confirm severity before making a dosing decision, which operationalizes the threshold-based hold/resume rule [^115G2FjR] [^1121qe9Y] [^113DAYi6] [^1172XMRy] [^1125fLjR] [^114nx2b1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio instead of a 24-hour collection. I initially thought UPCR might suffice because it is convenient, but I need to check the correlation data. The FDA notes poor correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein (Pearson correlation about 0.39), so for bevacizumab-related proteinuria decisions, a 24-hour urine protein remains the reference standard despite the logistical burden [^115G2FjR] [^1121qe9Y] [^113DAYi6] [^1172XMRy] [^1125fLjR] [^114nx2b1].

> I should confirm the clinical rationale for the ≥ 2 g/24 h threshold. Proteinuria with bevacizumab reflects VEGF pathway inhibition affecting glomerular endothelial integrity and podocyte–endothelium crosstalk, with risks ranging from asymptomatic proteinuria to thrombotic microangiopathy and nephrotic syndrome; the 2 g threshold balances the need to mitigate progressive renal injury while allowing continuation in lower-grade, likely reversible cases [^113j9AeE] [^115vtvoM] [^112AWA4A].

> Next, I should review the incidence and severity to contextualize risk. Grade 3–4 proteinuria (including nephrotic syndrome) occurs in roughly 0.7% to 7% of patients on bevacizumab, with median onset around 5.6 months and incomplete resolution in a substantial subset. Importantly, about 30% of those who develop proteinuria ultimately require discontinuation, underscoring why timely holding at ≥ 2 g/24 h is prudent [^112AWA4A] [^112sCXQb] [^117TBRnq] [^114HVXBA] [^112ibwdN].

> Let me think about the monitoring cadence and practical workflow. I should confirm that urinalysis is recommended before each dose during treatment, with escalation to a 24-hour collection if dipstick is 2+ or higher; this cadence aligns with long-term safety studies and neuro-oncology guidance that emphasize routine proteinuria surveillance during bevacizumab therapy [^113GYvD1].

> I will now examine special populations and risk modifiers. Patients with renal cell carcinoma appear to have higher rates of high-grade proteinuria, and pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, and baseline proteinuria increase susceptibility; in these settings, I should maintain a lower threshold for 24-hour testing and consider earlier intervention if proteinuria accelerates, while remembering that no dose adjustment is required solely for reduced eGFR, though vigilance is warranted [^116oYZqF] [^113i8hsZ] [^1111cbuW] [^111ivGoA].

> But wait, what if the patient improves after holding — can we rechallenge. The labeling supports resuming bevacizumab once 24-hour protein is less than 2 g, yet pooled analyses show that about 48% of patients who restart after a grade 2–4 proteinuria episode experience a second episode, so I should counsel on recurrence risk, intensify monitoring after rechallenge, and be prepared to discontinue permanently if nephrotic syndrome or refractory high-grade proteinuria recurs [^112AWA4A] [^112sCXQb] [^117TBRnq] [^114HVXBA] [^112ibwdN].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision rule to ensure internal consistency. Hold bevacizumab when 24-hour urine protein is ≥ 2 g, resume when it is < 2 g, and permanently discontinue if nephrotic syndrome develops. Screen with urinalysis before each dose and confirm any dipstick ≥ 2+ with a 24-hour collection, avoiding reliance on spot UPCR for decision-making due to poor correlation. Tailor vigilance in higher-risk patients and document the plan for rechallenge with enhanced monitoring if proteinuria resolves [^115G2FjR] [^112AWA4A] [^1121qe9Y] [^113DAYi6] [^1172XMRy] [^1125fLjR] [^114nx2b1].

---

Hold bevacizumab (Avastin) when **urine protein is ≥ 2 g/24 h** [^115G2FjR] or if nephrotic syndrome develops [^notfound]. For 1–2 g/24 h, **use clinical judgment** and monitor closely; for < 1 g/24 h, continue treatment with routine surveillance. Resume bevacizumab only after proteinuria falls to **< 2 g/24 h** and nephrotic syndrome has resolved; discontinue permanently if nephrotic syndrome occurs or if proteinuria persists despite management [^115G2FjR].

---

## Recommended thresholds for holding bevacizumab

The FDA provides clear guidance on **when to hold bevacizumab** based on proteinuria severity:

| **Proteinuria level** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 2 g/24 h | Hold bevacizumab immediately [^115G2FjR] |
| Nephrotic syndrome (≥ 3.5 g/24 h with hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia) | Discontinue bevacizumab permanently [^115G2FjR] |
| 1–2 g/24 h | Use clinical judgment; monitor closely and consider holding if rapidly progressing or symptomatic [^notfound] |
| < 1 g/24 h | Continue treatment with routine monitoring [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting these thresholds

Clinical studies show that **proteinuria ≥ 2 g/24 h** is associated with a higher risk of renal injury, including nephrotic syndrome and thrombotic microangiopathy [^115G2FjR]. Holding bevacizumab at this threshold reduces the risk of irreversible renal damage [^notfound]. Nephrotic syndrome, although rare (< 1%) [^115G2FjR], can be severe and may be fatal; therefore, permanent discontinuation is recommended [^115G2FjR].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Regular monitoring of proteinuria is essential during bevacizumab therapy. The **recommended approach** includes:

- **Baseline assessment**: Perform urinalysis before starting treatment [^115G2FjR].
- **Routine monitoring**: Conduct urinalysis before each administration [^113GYvD1].
- **Quantification**: If dipstick proteinuria is ≥ 2+, perform a 24-hour urine collection to quantify protein excretion [^115G2FjR].
- **Management**: If proteinuria is ≥ 2 g/24 h, hold bevacizumab until proteinuria resolves to < 2 g/24 h [^115G2FjR]. Manage nephrotic syndrome with permanent discontinuation and appropriate medical care [^115G2FjR].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different proteinuria levels

Proteinuria correlates with clinical outcomes; **higher levels are linked to greater risks** of renal injury, hypertension, and thrombotic events [^113i8hsZ]. Proteinuria ≥ 2 g/24 h increases the risk of renal dysfunction and may necessitate dose modification or discontinuation [^115G2FjR]. Nephrotic syndrome is rare but severe and may be fatal, warranting permanent discontinuation [^115G2FjR].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

Certain clinical scenarios may require **individualized decisions**:

- **Pre-existing renal conditions**: Patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetic nephropathy may have a lower threshold for holding bevacizumab [^notfound].
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider switching to anti-VEGF agents with lower proteinuria risk, such as ramucirumab, in patients with recurrent or persistent proteinuria [^117CuF8p].
- **Clinical judgment**: For proteinuria levels between 1–2 g/24 h, consider patient-specific factors such as baseline renal function, comorbidities, and response to therapy [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Hold bevacizumab**: When urine protein is ≥ 2 g/24 h [^115G2FjR].
- **Discontinue permanently**: If nephrotic syndrome develops [^115G2FjR].
- **Resume**: Only after proteinuria resolves to < 2 g/24 h and nephrotic syndrome has resolved [^notfound].
- **Monitor**: Regularly with urinalysis and 24-hour urine collection as needed [^113GYvD1].

---

Bevacizumab should be held when **urine protein is ≥ 2 g/24 h** or if nephrotic syndrome develops, with permanent discontinuation for nephrotic syndrome. Regular monitoring and individualized management are essential to balance efficacy and safety [^115G2FjR].

### Bevacizumab-associated glomerular microangiopathy: a case report and literature review [^116yXcU6]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anti-VEGF drug-induced renal injury is a common clinical concern, necessitating prompt therapeutic intervention. Current management strategies, based on existing literature, primarily involve discontinuation of anti-VEGF agents combined with proteinuria and blood pressure control. Treatment should be stratified according to proteinuria levels: ① For PRO > 2+, immediate 24hUTP quantification is recommended; ② Anti-VEGF therapy should be suspended when 24hUTP ≥ 2 g/24 h until proteinuria improves; ③ Anti-VEGF agents are contraindicated when 24hUTP ≥ 3.5 g/24h. Although no standardized protocol exists for blood pressure management, current evidence supports dynamic BP monitoring with timely initiation of antihypertensive therapy upon detecting abnormal elevations. ACEI or ARB is preferred due to their demonstrated clinical benefits. Given the reversible nature of drug-induced hypertension, continuous BP monitoring post-drug withdrawal is essential, with appropriate adjustment of antihypertensive regimens. The management of Bmab-GMA remains poorly defined due to limited case reports, with current approaches largely extrapolated from general anti-VEGF-induced renal injury protocols. Most patients demonstrate gradual renal function recovery and proteinuria reduction following bevacizumab discontinuation.

In this case, the patient demonstrated persistent renal dysfunction and proteinuria despite bevacizumab discontinuation. Notably, elevated serum C5b-9 levels, reflecting terminal complement activation, were observed. Combined with C3 and C1q positivity on immunofluorescence, these findings suggest complement-mediated renal injury, potentially explaining the refractory proteinuria. For complement activation-associated renal injury induced by anti-VEGF agents, emerging evidence supports the therapeutic potential of anti-complement therapy in endothelial protection and renal function improvement. Eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in selected cases by blocking C5b-9 formation, thereby reducing endothelial injury and improving renal function, hematologic parameters, and proteinuria in bevacizumab-induced TMA. Given the shared endothelial injury phenotype between Bmab-GMA and TMA, early initiation of anti-complement therapy, such as eculizumab, may potentially enhance clinical outcomes in Bmab-GMA patients.

In summary, this case report contributes to the growing understanding of Bmab-GMA as a distinct clinicopathological entity associated with anti-VEGF therapy. The observed clinical course and pathological findings suggest a potential role of complement activation in disease pathogenesis, which may have therapeutic implications. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and optimal management strategies appears warranted to better characterize this emerging condition.

### Neoadjuvant FOLFIRI + bevacizumab in patients with resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer: a phase 2 trial [^112VqR7X]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Eligibility and patient evaluation

Patients aged 18 to 75 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, were eligible if they had colorectal adenocarcinoma histologically or cytologically confirmed with resectable liver metastases. Liver disease was defined resectable when the future liver remnant volume would be at least 30% of total liver volume and when two contiguous segments with their own vascularisation and biliary drainage would be preserved. Patients had to have normal organ function and urine dipstick of proteinuria < 2+ (patients with proteinuria on baseline dipstick urinalysis ⩾2+ had to undergo a 24-h urine collection and must have had ≤ 1 g of protein per 24 h). Previous adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed if completed > 6 months before the enrolment, whereas prior treatment with bevacizumab or irinotecan was not permitted. Patients with distant metastases in organs other than the liver were excluded as well as those who had diagnosis of liver metastases concomitant to the presence of primary CRC producing a stenosis of lumen or a full-thickness bowel wall invasion. Prior history of malignancy other than colorectal, bleeding diathesis, coagulation disorders, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, recent coronary artery disease, serious arrhythmias, regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin (> 325 mg day −1) and the presence of ascites were other exclusion criteria. Patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the National Cancer Institute of Naples, Naples, Italy.

Treatment

Eligible patients were assigned to receive neoadjuvant FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. FOLFIRI was administered intravenously (i.v.) every 14 days with irinotecan 180 mg m − 2 i.v. infusion on day 1, leucovorin 200 mg m − 2 i.v. infusion on day 1, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg m − 2 by i.v. bolus on day 1, 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg m − 2 46-h continuous infusion; bevacizumab was administered at 5 mg kg −1 by i.v. infusion over 90 min at the first cycle, and then, if tolerated, over 60 min. The treatment was administered every 14 days, for 7 cycles; bevacizumab was stopped at cycle 6 to prolong the bevacizumab-free interval and to reduce the risk of surgical bleeding.

After restaging, patients whose liver metastases were still confirmed as potentially resectable underwent surgery.

Following surgery, four further cycles of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab were planned, with the same dose and schedule planned.

### Bevacizumab-nwgd (Jobevne) [^1125fLjR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received bevacizumab. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab.

Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during Jobevne therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)].

5.9	Infusion-Related Reactions

Infusion-related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients.

Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion-related reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion-related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion-related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen).

### Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factors hypertension, proteinuria, and renal injury: a concise review [^113F8AkF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nearly 20 years ago, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)inhibitors (VEGFi) were adapted from systemic use from antiangiogenesis roles to intravitreal uses. Initially bevacizumab a murine immunoglobulin was injected 'off label' as a treatment for diabetic macular edema and age-related macular degeneration. Throughout the following decade aflibercept and finally ranibizumab were adapted and obtained Food and Drug Administration approval for intravitreal use. Initially systemic absorption was thought to be quite low after intravitreal injections and was quoted as being 200-fold lower than levels postulated to induce significant VEGF inhibition. Pharmacodynamic studies obtained in 2014 and again in 2017 revealed significant systemic absorption and detectable VEGF inhibition, this has since been confirmed in multiple subsequent studies.

Recent Findings

A few case reports of renal dysfunction and glomerular disease related to VEGFi were initially identified. Mixed findings on effects on blood pressure were noted in studies. More recently, 32 cases of de-novo glomerular disease and/or proteinuria exacerbation were identified. New studies have corroborated increased blood pressure, proteinuria exacerbation in patients with pre-existing nephrotic syndrome, and systemic VEGF depletion. Further, the most common lesion of systemic VEGFi nephrotoxicity, thrombotic microangiopathy, has recently been reported by our group.

Summary

We will review the pharmacokinetic, translational, and epidemiological data that year upon year establish the finite-yet real risk of intravitreal VEGFi.

### Clinical utility of routine proteinuria evaluation in treatment decisions of patients receiving bevacizumab for metastatic solid tumors [^116DuKSS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody approved for use in treatment of patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer. In the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, grades 3–4 proteinuria occurred in < 5% of patients. The manufacturer recommends monitoring for the development of proteinuria but does not provide specific recommendations, except to discontinue treatment if the patient develops nephrotic syndrome.

Objective

To determine the incidence and severity of elevated proteinuria and the frequency of changes in bevacizumab administration due to elevated proteinuria; secondary objectives included analysis of the cost of routine proteinuria monitoring and the relationship of proteinuria with other patient comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and viral hepatitis.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed at the University of Washington Medical Center, a large academic teaching hospital, and its affiliated ambulatory clinics at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Patients treated with bevacizumab and seen in the breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer clinics from June 1, 2005, to November 30, 2007, were included in the study.

Results

A total of 243 patients were included in the analysis. Only 1.6% of these patients developed grades 3–4 proteinuria. All 4 of these patients had a history of hypertension, 2 of these patients had prior chronic kidney disease, and 3 patients had prior viral hepatitis. Elevated proteinuria affected treatment decisions in 2% of patients. Over $130,000 was charged to patients for monitoring of proteinuria.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that the development of grades 3–4 proteinuria with bevacizumab is rare and affects treatment decisions in few patients with metastatic solid tumor. Furthermore, routine proteinuria monitoring is associated with high cost and may not be required before each administration.

### Safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in diabetic macular edema (RESOLVE study): a 12-month, randomized, controlled, double-masked, multicenter phase II study [^1138FVPe]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Safety

There were no imbalances in the rates of ocular and nonocular SAEs or AEs between the ranibizumab and sham arms (Table 2). The proportion of patients with ocular SAEs in the study eye was comparable between the treatment arms (ranibizumab: 4 [3.9%]; sham: 1 [2.0%]). Most of the SAEs were nonocular in origin (ranibizumab: 14 [13.7%]; sham: 8 [16.3%]). There was one occurrence of myocardial infarction (nonocular SAE) with ranibizumab that was suspected to be related to the study drug. One death from urinary bladder cancer was reported with ranibizumab, which was not suspected to be related to the study drug or procedure. Endophthalmitis (n = 2 of 102) and myocardial infarction (n = 1 of 102) led to study drug discontinuation in three patients. The most frequently reported ocular AEs (ranibizumab and sham) were conjunctival hemorrhage, intraocular pressure increase, and eye pain (Table 2). The proportion of patients reporting nonocular AEs was comparable between the ranibizumab and sham arms (64 [62.7%] and 32 [65.3%], respectively).

Table 2
Most frequent SAEs and AEs over 12 months

The incidence of hypertension and arterial thromboembolic events, both possibly due to VEGF inhibition, were comparable between ranibizumab and sham arms (hypertension: 9 [8.8%] and 5 [10.2%]; arterial thromboembolic events: 3 [2.9%] and 2 [4.1%], respectively).

There were no clinically significant differences between treatment arms at baseline for mean serum levels of HbA1C and mean blood pressure (supplementary Table 7, available in an on online appendix). The urine dipstick protein test was performed in 60% of the FAS patients. The deterioration within the categories (categories 1+, 2+, 3+, or greater) was comparable between the ranibizumab and sham groups (22.9% [n = 14 of 61] and 28.5% [n = 8 of 21], respectively), none reported as AEs by the investigators.

The formation of antibodies to ranibizumab was reported in three patients post baseline. One patient in the sham arm showed positive immunoreactivity both at baseline and post baseline.

### Evidence-based guidelines for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy in chronic kidney disease [^112iscmD]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Defining AVAN and Its Diagnostic Criteria

We characterize AVAN as the onset or worsening of kidney dysfunction that occurs between 2 and 8 weeks following the initiation of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, with no identifiable alternative causes. As outlined in Table 2, the diagnostic criteria of this novel reno-retinal syndrome necessitates fulfilment of all five criterion, namely: a clear temporal link; a measurable change in kidney function (either a drop in eGFR or an increase in proteinuria); rise in blood pressure (systolic and/or diastolic); elimination of other possible causes of AKI; and clinical improvement upon drug withdrawal or worsening upon rechallenge. By applying this systematic approach, we seek to facilitate consistent identification of AVAN in clinical practice. An increase in blood pressure is so common with anti-VEGF therapy that it is often regarded as a surrogate marker of efficacy in certain cancers.

Table 2
Diagnostic criteria for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-associated nephropathy

AKI Acute kidney injury, BP blood pressure, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor

The pathology of AVAN is diverse, with different histological variants (see Table 3) TMA is the most prevalent variant and is usually associated with bevacizumab and aflibercept therapy. Cases of MCD, FSGS (including collapsing FSGS) and membranous nephropathy have also been documented. These patterns highlight the importance of VEGF in maintaining endothelial and podocyte stability, which is disturbed by extended systemic inhibition. As observed in various studies, bevacizumab has more harmful effect than ranibizumab, with larger randomized controlled trials recommended to provide evidence that supports this trend. Many authors believe that switching patients from bevacizumab and aflibercept to ranibizumab can decrease absorption and the risk of systemic side effects, including renal dysfunction.

### Plasma soluble VEGFR-1 is a potential dual biomarker of response and toxicity for bevacizumab with chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer [^114b8ZgE]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

We explored plasma and urinary concentrations of two members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and their receptors as potential response and toxicity biomarkers of bevacizumab with neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with localized rectal cancer. The concentrations of VEGF, placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sVEGFR-1), and sVEGFR-2 were measured in plasma and urine at baseline and during treatment. Pretreatment values and changes over time were analyzed as potential biomarkers of pathological response to treatment as well as for acute toxicity in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated prospectively in 2002–2008 with neoadjuvant bevacizumab, 5-fluorouracil, radiation therapy, and surgery in a phase I/II trial. Of all biomarkers, pretreatment plasma sVEGFR-1-an endogenous blocker of VEGF and PlGF, and a factor linked with "vascular normalization"-was associated with both primary tumor regression and the development of adverse events after neoadjuvant bevacizumab and chemoradiation. Based on the findings in this exploratory study, we propose that plasma sVEGFR-1 should be further studied as a potential biomarker to stratify patients in future studies of bevacizumab and/or cytotoxics in the neoadjuvant setting.

### Phase II trial of the antiangiogenic agent IM862 in metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^111qpHXj]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Patient follow-up and study end points

The primary end point for this study was objective tumour response rate or sustained disease stabilisation. Response evaluations were performed after an initial 8 weeks of therapy and every 8 weeks thereafter. Earlier evaluations were performed in patients who experienced clinical signs or symptoms suggesting disease progression. Responses were defined according to standard WHO criteria. A complete response (CR) required the complete disappearance of all objective evidence of disease as measured on two separate occasions no less than 4 weeks apart. A partial response (PR) was defined as a more than 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of bidimensional target lesions without any progression of other lesions by more than 25% or appearance of any new lesion. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as the enlargement of any known measurable lesion by more than 25% or the development of any new metastatic lesion. When the criteria for PR or PD were not fulfilled, patients were classified as having stable disease (SD). Toxicity grading was by the NCI common toxicity criteria version 2.0. Toxicity evaluations were performed at 2 and 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks thereafter. Compliance with study medication was documented by interview, returned medication and completion of a patient's diary. Time to progression was calculated from the onset of treatment to the date of first documented disease progression or relapse. Overall survival was calculated from the onset of treatment to the date of death or time to loss of follow-up. Whenever data were censored, estimates were calculated by using the Kaplan–Meier product-limit method. A secondary objective of this study was to assess the role of urine, serum and plasma markers to monitor an antiangiogenic effect.

### A phase II trial of single agent bevacizumab in patients with relapsed, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma: southwest oncology group study S0108 [^112BUQqz]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2009). Low credibility.

This is the first report of the Southwest oncology group phase II trial of single agent bevacizumab in patients with relapsed, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Fifty-two patients in first or second relapse with diffuse large B-cell or mantle cell lymphoma were enrolled. Patients were treated with bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Therapy was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities observed. Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 16% with a response rate of 2% and median duration of response or stable disease of 5.2 months (range 3.5–72.7). Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) and VEGF receptor expression was observed in 70% and 65% of specimens, respectively. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, baseline urine VEGF and plasma vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM) levels correlated with survival. Prolonged PFS in several patients as well as biomarker studies suggest the VEGF pathway plays an important role in aggressive NHL. Clinical trials combining active chemotherapy regimens with VEGF targeted agents are currently in progress.

### Bevacizumab (Avzivi) [^112sCXQb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.

Discontinue Avzivi in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known.

5.8 Renal Injury and Proteinuria

The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2–4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2–4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2–4 proteinuria.

### A case of ramucirumab-induced renal failure with nephrotic-range proteinuria and its pathological findings [^111EJ2Yy]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 71-year-old man diagnosed with cecal cancer with lymph node metastasis underwent an ileocecal resection and received chemotherapy. He completed his therapy and remained stable for the next few years. When imaging studies showed a progressive disease, he restarted chemotherapy with folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and bevacizumab. With bevacizumab, he showed proteinuria 3+ in a dipstick test; therefore, he was closely monitored. After a year, because he presented with a progressive disease, bevacizumab was changed to ramucirumab. After 2 weeks, he was admitted to our department because of oedema exacerbation. He had high blood pressure, which was 172/83 mm Hg, although he had already been taking medication for hypertension. His blood pressure was usually controlled at approximately 150/80 mm Hg with an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a calcium channel blocker. His weight was 68 kg, although his usual weight was 61 kg. He showed pitting oedema.

### Management of treatment-associated toxicites of anti-angiogenic therapy in patients with brain tumors [^115LWYCF]. Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Anti-angiogenic therapies, including bevacizumab, are being used with increasing frequency in the management of malignant glioma. Common clinically significant toxicities include hypertension and proteinuria, poor wound healing, and the potential for thromboembolic events. Literature related to the use of bevacizumab in malignant glioma, reported toxicities in this patient population, and management of these toxicities was reviewed. Recommendations for assessment and management are provided. Anti-angiogenic therapies will continue to have a role in the treatment of malignant glioma. Further studies of the prevention, assessment, and management of these toxicities are warranted.

### A phase I study of E7080, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumours [^116feLTA]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

E7080 is well tolerated when administered by a single, oral, daily continuous dosing schedule. The DLTs were grade 3 proteinuria, observed in two patients at 32 mg, as well as febrile neutropenia, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia and hypertension/fatigue observed in one patient each at 6.4, 12.5, 12.5 and 16 mg, respectively. The MTD was defined as 25 mg once daily, a total daily dose that is comparable to the maximum daily dose determined in another recently published clinical study of E7080, in which E7080 was administered twice daily (b.i.d.) in a 2-week-on/1-week-off schedule (MTD of 13 mg b.i.d.).

Treatment-related hypertension (all grades, all cycles) was reported in 40% of patients in this study, in keeping with the incidence of hypertension reported in the other phase I study with E7080, as well as in studies of other agents that target the VEGF-signalling pathway. The incidence of treatment-related proteinuria observed in this study (all grades, all cycles; 26% of patients) was much higher than with sorafenib or sunitinib, but comparable to bevacizumab and lower than that observed for b.i.d. dosing with E7080. Hypertension was manageable in this study with the introduction of antihypertensive agents at first occurrence of diastolic blood pressure ⩾100 mm Hg, although dose reductions for proteinuria were required in 17% of patients and for hypertension in 11% of patients. Significant proteinuria was managed by dose interruption and/or modification with no indication for renal support. Recently, a management model for hypertension and proteinuria following treatment with E7080 has been developed using PK, blood pressure and urinalysis data from the study described here, and which can be applied to future studies. A clear relation between exposure and response was established, both for hypertension and for the probability of experiencing proteinuria.

### Bevacizumab – current status and future directions [^116c4GUp]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Angiogenesis is crucial to tumour initiation, survival and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most important pro-angiogenic factors in cancer development. Bevacizumab (a humanised monoclonal antibody against VEGF) has a reasonable safety profile and proven efficacy in a phase III trial in advanced colorectal cancer. Efficacy of Bevacizumab also looks promising in non small cell lung cancer, renal cancer and a variety of other solid tumours. Questions still surround optimal dosing and the appropriate selection of patients who are most likely to benefit. Future trials will address these questions and provide further translational insights.

### Renal effects of anti-angiogenesis therapy: update for the internist [^115vtvoM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Angiogenesis has become an innovative target in cancer therapy. Agents that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the most potent promoters of angiogenesis, and its receptor have significant implications for clinical practice. Bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib and other anti-VEGF drugs are frequently complicated by mild proteinuria and hypertension. Other unique renal effects, such as high-grade proteinuria and acute kidney injury, have been described. The most common histopathologic kidney lesion is thrombotic microangiopathy, with other glomerular lesions and interstitial nephritis occurring less frequently. The mechanism for anti-VEGF therapy-induced hypertension is not well understood; however, nitric oxide pathway inhibition, rarefaction, and oxidative stress may be important in its pathogenesis. Glomerular injury may develop from loss of VEGF effect on maintaining the filtration barrier. Adverse effects of anti-VEGF class of drugs are manageable but require close attention and follow-up. Understanding the fundamentals of anti-VEGF drugs' mechanism of action and their clinical implications is crucial when caring for patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy.

### Biomarkers for monitoring antiangiogenic therapy [^1131NG8o]. Clinical Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

A variety of antiangiogenic agents are currently available for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. With these exciting new therapeutic agents comes the challenge of elucidating useful biomarkers to monitor patients receiving these therapies. Although many patients benefit from antiangiogenic therapies, it is often by achieving stability of their disease. Thus, development of noninvasive biomarkers of disease response and relapse is a crucial objective to aid in the management of patients. The current technologies being explored in this field include circulating plasma proteins, cells, and nucleic acids and novel imaging techniques. Surrogate markers of angiogenesis could help with selecting patients for therapy, determining optimal dosing of therapy, deciding whether to change therapy, and assessing appropriate salvage therapy.

### Combining sunitinib and bevacizumab for the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma: a phase I / II trial [^117XvGHU]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a phases I-II trial. Patients with advanced (locally advanced unresectable or metastatic) RCC were eligible. Additional inclusion criteria included clear cell histology component, age ≥ 18 years, no prior anticancer therapy for RCC, measurable disease as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST V1.1), performance status 0–2 by Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group (ECOG) scale, adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function and signed informed consent. Patients with brain metastasis were included if they were asymptomatic. Patients were excluded if they had uncontrolled hypertension, significant baseline proteinuria and major surgery in the 4 weeks preceding the start of trial medications. Details of the protocol are available in Supplementary appendix 1.

Treatment consisted of sunitinib at 50 mg daily with 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off schedule. Bevacizumab was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a 30-minute infusion on day 29 of each sunitinib cycle. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the phase I part of the study, 3–6 patients were enrolled with a bevacizumab dose of 5 mg/kg using the 3+3 phase I design. If no dose-limiting toxicity was observed, the dose was escalated to 10 mg/kg and carried over into the phase II part of the trial. Dose reduction was performed according to the type of toxicity, and the relevant data are available in Supplementary appendix 1.

### Antivascular endothelial growth factor – A therapy: a novel personalized treatment approach for psoriasis [^1177LsNz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 Anti‐angiogenic therapy in psoriasis

Although anti‐angiogenic therapy is not licensed for psoriasis, some of the conventional treatments for psoriasis have significant anti‐angiogenic properties and decrease the levels of VEGF‐A in skin and plasma (Table 1). This mechanism of action, which is often unrecognized, undoubtedly contributes to their efficacy and deserves further investigation.

Table 1
Psoriasis treatments with anti‐angiogenic properties

In addition, there are seven case reports of patients who had improvement of psoriasis after being treated for other conditions with anti‐angiogenic drugs that specifically target the VEGF‐A/VEGFR pathway. Two patients experienced psoriasis improvement after treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin ®), a mAb to VEGF‐A. The first patient, a 60‐year‐old male with a 40‐year history of psoriasis covering 40% of his body surface, received bevacizumab treatment for metastatic colon cancer and experienced significant improvement in psoriasis (PASI reduced from 16.8 to 1.4). This improvement was maintained during the 3‐month follow‐up. The second patient, a 65‐year‐old male with a 40‐year history of psoriasis affecting 50% of his body surface area and 30‐year history of PsA, received bevacizumab and interferon (IFN)‐α for metastatic renal carcinoma. This patient experienced significant improvement in psoriasis (< 1% body surface area) and PsA. Interruption of treatment with bevacizumab treatment and replacement with sorafenib and later by sunitinib, due to proteinuria, led to recurrence of psoriasis and PsA.

### Safety of bevacizumab in patients with advanced cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111NHgq6]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We performed a meta-analysis on adverse events seen with bevacizumab to combine the existing evidence about its safety in patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify published, randomized controlled trials of bevacizumab in cancer patients with data on adverse events available. The primary endpoint was "severe adverse event", a composite of grade 3 and 4 adverse events. Secondary endpoints for the exploratory analysis were individual adverse events. We used random-effects meta-analysis to combine data.

Results

Thirteen eligible publications were identified and eight trials reported the primary endpoint. Compared with the control group, the bevacizumab group had a slightly higher risk for any severe adverse event (pooled relative risk, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01–1.19). The pooled risk difference was 7% (95% CI, 1%-13%), with a number needed to harm of 14 treated patients. Exploratory analyses showed a statistically significant higher risk for eight of the 15 evaluated secondary endpoints: bevacizumab was associated with a fourfold higher risk for hypertension, epistaxis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage/perforation; a threefold higher risk for any bleeding events; and a lower, but elevated risk for proteinuria, leukopenia, diarrhea, and asthenia. No statistically significant differences were found for any thrombotic event (arterial or venous), hemoptysis, cardiac event, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, impaired wound healing, or death related to an adverse event.

Conclusion

Treatment with bevacizumab was associated with a slightly higher risk for any severe (grade 3 or 4) adverse event in patients with cancer. The result may impact individual benefit-risk assessments and policy guidelines.

### A long-term extension study of bevacizumab in patients with solid tumors [^1118ktx9]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bevacizumab has been studied in numerous clinical trials in multiple types of cancer; however, patients may receive bevacizumab over an extended period of time. This study assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of bevacizumab among patients with solid tumors.

Materials and Methods

Patients enrolled in a Roche/Genentech-sponsored trial who had derived benefit from bevacizumab therapy as monotherapy or in combination with anticancer drugs were eligible for continuation of bevacizumab in this long-term extension (LTE) study. The primary endpoints were the incidence of adverse events (AEs) of Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) grade ≥ 3 related to bevacizumab treatment, serious AEs (SAEs), and deaths.

Results

Ninety-five patients with the following cancer types were enrolled in the LTE: ovarian cancer or peritoneal carcinoma (n = 41), non-small cell lung cancer (n = 16), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 14), breast cancer (n = 11), colorectal cancer (n = 7), or renal cell carcinoma (n = 6). The median (range) duration of bevacizumab treatment was 15.6 (0.0–81.0) months during the LTE and 57.5 (16.4–134.9) months overall (parent trial + LTE), with three patients receiving bevacizumab for > 10years. Overall, 17 patients (17.9%) experienced SAEs, and 21 (22.1%) had a bevacizumab-related AE of CTCAE grade ≥ 3 (proteinuria and hypertension were the most common). Four patients died: three from disease progression and one from an AE considered unrelated to bevacizumab.

Conclusion

The safety outcomes observed support the tolerability of long-term bevacizumab in patients with various solid tumors, with a median extended treatment duration of almost 5years overall and > 10years in some individual patients. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01588184.

Implications For Practice

In this long-term extension study of patients with solid tumors, the median duration of bevacizumab treatment (including parent trials) was just under 5years, with a long-term exposure in some patients of 7 to > 10years. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events related to bevacizumab were consistent with the established safety profile, with proteinuria and hypertension being the most common. Patients received bevacizumab over an extended period of time (beyond the length of most clinical trials), and the overall safety outcomes observed support the tolerability of long-term bevacizumab treatment in patients with solid tumors, with clinical benefit achieved over an extended period.

### A methodology for determining dosing recommendations for anticancer drugs in patients with reduced kidney function [^114gz99G]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The traditional method of guideline development requires high-level evidence, and therefore if ADDIKD's development had followed this, high powered studies linking drug pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamics with treatment outcomes would be needed. Bevacizumab was the only drug that had high certainty of evidence in ADDIKD and, interestingly, resulted in a conditional recommendation through the consensus process rather than a strong recommendation. Despite the published literature, real-life experience, and case reports on the potential kidney-related adverse events in reduced kidney function with bevacizumab remain a concern for clinicians, consequently leading to a conditional strength of the recommendation. Many anticancer drugs had no published studies applicable to Recommendation 2 however unanimous agreement was always achieved amongst the working group and experts as it was strongly believed that the standardisation of kidney function classification across medicine would improve safety and decision-making.

The novel, multistep process developed for ADDIKD's methodology incorporating the rigor of GRADE and several consensus building techniques will hopefully provide a template for other groups when developing guidelines in patient populations with limited high-level evidence. We envisage with such methodology in place, the guidance will be considered gold standard and endorsed by international cancer groups and adopted in regulatory drug processes within government and the pharmaceutical industry.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^115YsCPM]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1‒3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1–4, platelet-derived growth factor-alpha, KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib monotherapy is indicated for first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), based on results from the phase 3 REFLECT study, where lenvatinib demonstrated a treatment effect on overall survival with statistical confirmation of noninferiority to sorafenib (13.6 vs 12.3 months, respectively; hazard ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.79–1.06), along with significant improvements in progression-free survival, time to progression, and objective response rates. Lenvatinib is also indicated as monotherapy for patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC), and in combination with everolimus in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following 1 prior anti-angiogenic therapy.

### Bevacizumab-maly (Alymsys) [^114nx2b1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5,805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3,713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received bevacizumab. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab.

Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during Alymsys therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)].

5.9 Infusion-Related Reactions

Infusion-related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients.

Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion-related reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion-related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion-related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen).

### Meta-analysis of individual patient safety data from six randomized, placebo-controlled trials with the antiangiogenic VEGFR2-binding monoclonal antibody ramucirumab [^117CuF8p]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Arterial hypertension is recognized as a common adverse event associated with antiangiogenic therapies. The mechanisms of hypertension associated with VEGF inhibition are thought to include decreased production of nitric oxide in the wall of arterioles and other resistance vessels, increased activation of the endothelin-1 system, and/or capillary rarefaction. Once detected, hypertension is readily managed with antihypertensives and rarely delays or stops cancer treatment. Preexisting hypertension should be controlled before starting ramucirumab treatment, and monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during therapy. Although hypertension was common and required treatment, only 1 out of 344 ramucirumab patients in these trials discontinued therapy due to hypertension.

Proteinuria has been reported with antiangiogenic agents that block the effects of VEGF-A; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Inhibition of VEGF-dependent interactions between podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells lessens the integrity of the filtration barrier, leading to proteinuria. Most patients enrolled in our trials had adequate renal function at baseline, and the incidence of high-grade proteinuria in the ramucirumab arm was 1.1% (RR: 8.3, 95% CI 2.9–24.1) (Table 3). During ramucirumab therapy, the clinician should monitor for the development or worsening of proteinuria. In most cases, proteinuria was manageable during ramucirumab therapy. Only three (0.1%) patients in the ramucirumab arm reported nephrotic syndrome.

A meta-analysis of patients from 16 randomized trials with bevacizumab reported a proteinuria incidence of 2.2% and a significantly increased risk for high-grade proteinuria (RR: 4.79, 95% CI 2.71–8.46; P < 0.001). This same study also reported a 0.8% incidence of patients with nephrotic syndrome as well as an RR of 7.78 (95% CI 1.80–33.62; P = 0.006].

The pathogenesis of antiangiogenic-associated bleeding is not well understood. Tumor-infiltrated vascular walls or injured mucosal membranes, which exhibit high VEGF dependence, may have an enhanced propensity to bleed. Preclinical data demonstrate that capillaries with endothelial fenestrations are dependent on VEGF signaling. Thus, tumors with fenestrated capillaries, such as those arising in endocrine glands or the GI tract, may be particularly sensitive to anti-VEGF pathway agents, and more likely to develop capillary damage leading to hemorrhage.

### Bevacizumab-bvzr (Zirabev) [^112ibwdN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7	Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.

Discontinue ZIRABEV in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known.

5.8	Renal Injury and Proteinuria

The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies.

The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2–4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2–4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients.

Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2–4 proteinuria.

### Nephrotic syndrome after bevacizumab: case report and literature review [^111eUcbb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Bevacizumab, or avastin, is a monoclonal hybrid antibody that binds to and neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor. It has shown promising efficacy in the adjunctive treatment of patients with several cancers. Recent reports indicated that bevacizumab therapy often was associated with the development of proteinuria, but rarely nephrotic syndrome. In this report, we describe a patient who developed new-onset hypertension and nephrotic syndrome in association with bevacizumab treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Renal biopsy showed an immune-complex-mediated focal proliferative glomerulonephritis. Nephrotic syndrome and hypertension resolved after discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy. The mechanism of bevacizumab-induced glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome is unknown and requires additional investigation. Clinicians should be aware of the potential reversible nephrotoxicity of bevacizumab and should monitor blood pressure and urine protein excretion closely during therapy with this agent.

### Renal-limited thrombotic microangiopathy after switching from bevacizumab to ramucirumab: a case report [^1169d85n]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

It is well known that VEGF inhibitors, especially bevacizumab, can induce proteinuria and TMA. A meta-analysis comprising 12,268 patients showed that bevacizumab use was associated with 13.3% incidence of all-grade proteinuria [relative risk (RR) 2.8], 2.2% incidence of grade 3 proteinuria (≥ 3.5 g/24 h, RR 4.8), and 0.8% incidence of nephrotic syndrome. On the other hand, a recent meta-analysis of 4996 subjects revealed that ramucirumab treatment was associated with 9.4% incidence of all-grade proteinuria (RR 3.4), 1.1% incidence of grade 3 proteinuria (RR 8.3), and 0.04% incidence of nephrotic syndrome. These findings suggest that severe renal side effects may be less common in ramucirumab use compared to bevacizumab use.

The underlying mechanism of VEGF inhibitor-induced proteinuria is based upon a fact that a strict amount of VEGF expressed by podocytes is required to maintain the integrity of glomerular endothelial function and glomerular filtration barrier through VEGFR2 expressed upon endothelial cells. The regulation of susceptibility to VEGF inhibition is not understood well, and it is unknown why a patient who tolerated long-term bevacizumab therapy developed TMA soon after switching to ramucirumab.

Double contour of the glomerular basement membrane is regarded as a chronic lesion. Therefore, before administration of ramucirumab, repeated injection of bevacizumab may have already predisposed the glomeruli of the case presented here to develop nephrotic syndrome easily. Indeed, a recent work by our colleagues has shown that doubling in glomerular filtration of albumin causes only mild increase in albuminuria.

As to findings by immunofluorescence, the present case showed weak glomerular deposition of IgM, fibrinogen and C1q, consistently with some cases in a previous report of VEGF inhibitor-induced TMA. In that report, most cases showed renal dysfunction, but serum creatinine levels were less than 1 mg/dl in 20% of the cases. Of note, the current case exhibited normal renal function despite having severe occlusion of glomerular capillaries in some glomeruli of renal biopsy samples.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^112Sj9st]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria is a class effect of antiangiogenic agents, and a well-documented lenvatinib-associated adverse effect.– Rates of any-grade/grade ≥ 3 proteinuria observed in lenvatinib-treated patients were 25%/6% in the phase 3 REFLECT study in unresectable HCC,31%/10% in the phase 3 SELECT in patients with RR-DTC, and 31%/19% in a phase 2 study in patients with advanced/metastatic RCC.

Patients receiving lenvatinib are monitored regularly for proteinuria using a urine sample dipstick method. The current standard management requires a 24-hour urine protein test if a dipstick proteinuria result of ≥ 2+ is detected, with the recommendation that lenvatinib treatment should be withheld if a proteinuria level of ≥ 2 g/24 h is detected. This 24-hour urine protein test relies on patient collection of urine overnight, which is burdensome and may be influenced by patient compliance. However, the single ("spot") urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) is a simple and convenient alternative test that is often used to detect proteinuria associated with certain medical conditions, e.g. chronic kidney disease and diabetes. UPCR is calculated by dividing the level of protein (mg/dl) in a spot urine test by the creatinine level (mg/dl). This approach was first validated in 1983 by Ginsberg and colleagues. It is based on the premise that urinary creatinine excretion and the protein excretion rate in the presence of a stable glomerular filtration rate are fairly constant in a given patient. Thus, a simple ratio of the 2 in a single-void urine sample would reflect cumulative protein excretion over a day (because the ratio of 2 stable rates would cancel out the time factor).

To determine whether UPCR could be a useful and more convenient assessment for proteinuria in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between proteinuria assessment by UPCR and 24-hour urine protein in patients with HCC from the REFLECT study.

### Capecitabine and bevacizumab as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^115nfjWx]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment plan

The initial dose of capecitabine was determined according to the patient's renal function (creatinine clearance; CrCl). Patients received a capecitabine dose of 1250 mg m −2 twice daily (2500 mg m −2 total daily dose) if their CrCl > 50 mL min −1 and up to 950 mg m −2 twice daily (1900 mg m −2 total daily dose) if they had a CrCl of 30–50 mL min −1. Capecitabine was administered for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Bevacizumab was administered as a 30–90 min intravenous infusion at a dose of 7.5 mg kg −1 on day 1 of a 3-week cycle.

The Cockcroft–Gault formula was used to calculate CrCl levels between cycles. If clearance was < 30 mL min −1, treatment was stopped. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for a minimum of three per patient, unless disease progression was noted. Patients with a complete response (CR), partial response or stable disease continued receiving chemotherapy until progression or detection of unacceptable adverse events (AEs).

The administration of bevacizumab was permanently discontinued in case of grade ⩾3 thromboembolic events, grade ⩾3 bleeding or uncontrolled hypertension. In case of grade ⩾3 proteinuria, treatment was withheld until proteinuria improved to < 2 g every 24 h. Dose reductions for grade 2–4 AEs were carried out for capecitabine as previously described.

### Can inhibition of angiogenic pathways increase the efficacy of intravenous 5-fluorouracil-based regimens? [^112xMdVv]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

First-line irinotecan-containing regimens are toxic and may not be tolerated well by all patient subgroups. Trials evaluating less toxic regimens include a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (AVF2192g) assessing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) with bevacizumab. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. In arm 1, patients received LV intravenously (I.V.) over 2 hours and 5-FU I.V. over 1 hour every week for 6 weeks of an 8-week cycle, and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg was administered I.V. over 30–90 minutes every 2 weeks. In the second arm, patients received LV and 5-FU as in arm 1, and placebo I.V. over 30–90 minutes every 2 weeks. The primary objective was duration of survival. Eligible patients with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) were ≥ 65 years of age, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1/2, a serum albumin level ≤ 3.5 g/dL, or had previous radiation therapy to the pelvis or abdomen. Preliminary results indicated a median survival of 12.9 months versus 16.6 months on the placebo and bevacizumab arms, respectively (P = 0.159). Progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the placebo arm compared to 9.2 months in the bevacizumab arm. The overall response rate was 15% in the placebo arm and 26% in the bevacizumab arm. The percentages of patients experiencing toxicities typically associated with 5-FU/LV were similar in both arms. Toxicities most associated with bevacizuamb included bleeding, thrombolic events, hypertension, and proteinuria. Growing evidence indicates that bevacizumab is an effective agent in CRC when added to several chemotherapy combinations. The current study indicates that subpopulations of patients with advanced age or poor performance status could be treated successfully with 5-FU/LV in combination with bevacizumab without excessive toxicities.

### Hypertension and proteinuria as clinical biomarkers of response to bevacizumab in glioblastoma patients [^116qpSQ9]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arterial hypertension and proteinuria are common side effects of antiangiogenic treatment and might represent a biomarker of response in patients with glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these side effects in predicting therapeutic response to second line chemotherapy with bevacizumab.

Methods

We evaluated clinical and survival data of glioblastoma patients who underwent treatment with bevacizumab after progression under temozolomide, at CHUSJ between 2010 and 2017. We analysed treatment-related arterial hypertension, proteinuria grade, thrombotic and haemorrhagic events during treatment. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) under bevacizumab were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards method.

Results

We evaluated 140 patients. Arterial hypertension and proteinuria occurred in 23 (16.3%) and 17 (12.1%) patients, respectively. PFS during treatment with bevacizumab was 12 months (95% CI 7.9–16.1) in the hypertensive group and 4 months (95% CI 3.2–4.8) in the normotensive group (p = 0.005). Patients with proteinuria had a PFS of 10 months (95% CI 4.9–15.0) versus 4 months (95% CI 3.4–4.8) in patients without proteinuria (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed hypertension and proteinuria as independent prognostic factors of PFS and OS.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that hypertension and proteinuria can be effective predictors of response to antiangiogenic therapy in recurrent glioblastoma and are associated with longer disease control.

### Bevacizumab-nwgd (Jobevne) [^116Gy1J4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7	Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.

Discontinue Jobevne in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known.

5.8	Renal Injury and Proteinuria

The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2–4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2–4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2–4 proteinuria.

### Diagnosis and management of complications from the treatment of primary central nervous system tumors in adults [^113GYvD1]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Kidney

Among classical chemotherapeutic agents used in brain tumor patients, platinum-based drugs have a well-known risk to exert renal toxicity. Nephrotoxicity is more frequently associated with the use of cisplatin compared with carboplatin and elderly patients are more likely to suffer from renal toxicity. Treatment with bevacizumab may result in renal thrombotic microangiopathy which may manifest as proteinuria. The severity of the latter may range from clinically asymptomatic, transient, trace proteinuria to nephrotic syndrome. Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in up to 10.9% of treated patients. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was observed in 1.4% of treated patients. Testing for proteinuria is recommended prior to the initiation and before each administration of bevacizumab therapy. This can be done by screening using a dipstick first and in case of 2+ a 24-hour urine analysis. In clinical trials, urine protein levels of ≥ 2–3 g/24 hours led to the holding of bevacizumab until recovery to < 2 g/24 hours. Proteinuria has been reported rarely in patients treated with regorafenib. Cases of renal toxicity have also been reported upon treatment with vemurafenib ranging from creatinine elevations to acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis. Serum creatinine elevations were mostly mild (> 1–1.5× ULN) to moderate (> 1.5–3× ULN) and usually reversible.

Cardiovascular

Dose-dependent arterial hypertension has been observed in bevacizumab-treated patients. Preexisting hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting bevacizumab treatment and monitoring of blood pressure values is recommended during therapy. Bevacizumab should be permanently discontinued if significant arterial hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with antihypertensive therapy, or if the patient develops hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.

Syncope was reported in 5% of patients treated with NTRK inhibitors, sometimes associated with arterial hypotension, dehydration, or QTc prolongation. Similarly, QTc prolongation may also occur in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors.QTc prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de Pointes. Therefore, treatment with these drugs is not recommended in patients with uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities, including magnesium, long QT syndrome or in patients taking other drugs which may prolong the QTc interval. ECG and electrolytes must be monitored in all patients before and during treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Moreover, if QTc exceeds 500 ms, BRAF inhibitor treatment should be temporarily interrupted. Regorafenib has been associated with an increased incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction. Therefore, patients with a history of ischemic heart disease should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia.

### Bevacizumab (Avastin) [^115G2FjR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving Avastin across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received Avastin with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received Avastin. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received Avastin.

Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during Avastin therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)].

5.9 Infusion-Related Reactions

Infusion-related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients.

Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion-related reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion-related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion-related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen).

### Compassionate use of bevacizumab (avastin) in children and young adults with refractory or recurrent solid tumors [^1148kzEE]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and toxicity of bevacizumab (Avastin), a monoclonal antibody directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor in children and young adults.

Patients and Methods

Fifteen patients (male: n = 8; female: n = 7; median age, 14.6 years) received bevacizumab for recurrent or progressive solid tumors (carcinoma: n = 3; neuroblastoma: n = 2; astrocytoma grade III: n = 2; rhabdomyosarcoma: n = 2; nephroblastoma: n = 2; benign vascular tumors: n = 2; synovial sarcoma: n = 1; and malignant hemangiopericytoma: n = 1) on a compassionate basis. Bevacizumab was administered at 5–10 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 2–3 weeks. Most patients received chemotherapy in addition to bevacizumab. Duration of bevacizumab therapy ranged from 1.5 to 23 months.

Results

Bevacizumab-related side-effects were mild and included hypertonia (n = 2), proteinuria/hematuria (n = 2), epistaxis (n = 2), local erythema (n = 1), and defective wound healing and ascites (n = 1). Radiographic objective responses (partial responses) were observed in two patients with astrocytoma grade III and in one patient each with neuroblastoma and pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, respectively.

Conclusions

Bevacizumab seems to have a good acute safety profile and some antitumor activity in heavily pretreated children and young adults with recurrent solid tumors. Prospective clinical trials are urgently needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in pediatric patients.

### Shorter bevacizumab infusions do not increase the incidence of proteinuria and hypertension [^111wWHyc]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A previous study has shown that shorter bevacizumab infusions (0.5 mg/kg/min) can be safely administered without increasing the risk of infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). However, the risk of proteinuria and hypertension in patients receiving shorter infusions of bevacizumab is undetermined.

Patients and Methods

This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study in patients receiving < 10 mg/kg of bevacizumab infused over 0.5 mg/kg/min. Patients were observed until discontinuation of bevacizumab for progression of cancer or toxicity. The incidence of hypertension and proteinuria was compared with a prior cohort of patients who had received standard duration infusions of bevacizumab.

Results

Sixty-three patients received a total of 392 doses of shorter bevacizumab infusions. Nineteen (30.2%) patients experienced proteinuria while receiving bevacizumab. Out of 19 patients, 13 had grade 1 and 6 had grade 2 proteinuria. None of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 proteinuria. Hypertension was reported in 32 (50.8%) patients receiving bevacizumab. Twelve (19%) patients developed grade 3 or greater hypertension on bevacizumab. The incidence of proteinuria and hypertension was 38.3% and 56.6%, respectively, in patients (N = 120, 1347 infusions) receiving standard duration infusions of bevacizumab.

Conclusions

Shorter bevacizumab infusions (0.5 mg/kg/min) do not increase the risk of proteinuria and hypertension.

### A long-term extension study of bevacizumab in patients with solid tumors [^113Egx1Y]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This LTE study allowed patients with various solid tumors, including OC or PC, NSCLC, GBM, BC, CRC and RCC, who derived benefit from bevacizumab treatment in a prior parent trial to continue treatment with bevacizumab as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer drugs. The trial design allowed patients from numerous trials to continue to benefit from bevacizumab treatment while providing data on the long‐term safety of bevacizumab across multiple indications. Although bevacizumab had been investigated in each of these indications separately, results from this LTE study, in which patients received bevacizumab over an extended period of time (beyond the length of most clinical trials), add to the existing data on the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab treatment. The median total duration of treatment with bevacizumab for patients in this study, including time treated with bevacizumab during the corresponding parent trials, was just under 5 years for all patients. Some patients included in this study had a very long‐term exposure and benefit from bevacizumab; 16 patients received bevacizumab for 7–10 years and 3 patients (all with BC) received bevacizumab for > 10 years (range up to 134.9 months).

The established safety profile for bevacizumab has been primarily based on its use in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in multiple advanced malignancies. Based on clinical trial findings, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetic profile, no clinically significant interactions between bevacizumab and standard chemotherapies have been observed or are expected to occur. Studies of the combination of bevacizumab and monoclonal antibodies (such as atezolizumab) have been consistent with the known safety profile of each individual therapy.

Bevacizumab is most frequently associated with a dose‐dependent rise in hypertension and with the development of proteinuria, which can present with varied severity ranging from asymptomatic to nephrotic syndrome. Patients should be monitored closely for the occurrence of both AEs, which are generally manageable. Consistent with the established safety profile, the most frequent AESIs reported in this LTE were proteinuria (44.2%) and hypertension (15.8%); however, they were manageable when following the protocol‐specified side‐effect management plan, which was dependent on the grade of AE and may have included medical management and/or temporary discontinuation of bevacizumab.

### Mechanisms of adverse effects of anti-VEGF therapy for cancer [^113j9AeE]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Proteinuria

The common occurrence of proteinuria after inhibition of VEGF signalling reflects the importance of VEGF in normal renal function. Proteinuria was found in 23% of 1132 patients in clinical trials of bevacizumab in various types of cancer and was more common in patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy than in patients on chemotherapy alone. Proteinuria is typically asymptomatic and decreases after treatment ends. Serious impairment of renal function is rare.

The filtration barrier of the renal glomerulus is formed by endothelial cells, basement membrane, and podocytes. Vascular endothelial growth factor, which is expressed by podocytes both during development and in the adult, activates VEGFR-2 on glomerular capillary endothelial cells. Targeted heterozygous deletion of VEGF in podocytes results in renal pathology manifested by loss of endothelial fenestrations in glomerular capillaries, proliferation of glomerular endothelial cells (endotheliosis), loss of podocytes, and proteinuria in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signalling in mice also reduces endothelial fenestrations in glomerular capillaries. Inhibition of VEGF-dependent interactions between podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells disrupts the filtration barrier, which in turn leads to dose-dependent proteinuria (Figure 3H ;).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety data in Warnings and Precautions and described below reflect exposure to bevacizumab in 4,463 patients including those with mCRC (AVF2107g, E3200), non-squamous NSCLC (E4599), GBM (EORTC 26101), mRCC (BO17705), cervical cancer (GOG-0240), epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (MO22224), or other cancers at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving bevacizumab as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies at a rate > 10% were epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain, and exfoliative dermatitis.

Across clinical studies, bevacizumab was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

In Combination with bolus-IFL

The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus-IFL in patients with mCRC [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus-IFL, bevacizumab with bolus-IFL, or bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. All Grades 3–4 adverse reactions and selected Grades 1–2 adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in Table 2.

### Bevacizumab for patients with metastatic renal cancer: an update [^115fpAGn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

Most clear cell renal cell cancer (RCC) is caused by biallelic loss of the von Hippel-Lindau gene. One consequence of this loss is up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor via a pathway involving accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor, a potent angiogenic factor, is secreted by many human cancers, but clear cell RCC as a group produces particularly high levels and has a highly vascular histologic appearance. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we tested the use of a neutralizing antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, bevacizumab, in patients with metastatic RCC. At 3 or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, toxic effects were minimal, with hypertension and proteinuria the most substantial events. There were four partial responses (10% response rate) and a highly substantial prolongation of time to tumor progression in patients who received the higher dose of bevacizumab. With a crossover design and very sensitive criteria for disease progression, no difference in survival was shown. Four patients have been undergoing long-term bevacizumab therapy without tumor progression for 3 to 5 years. Three have substantial proteinuria but retain normal renal function. A small pilot trial combining bevacizumab and thalidomide showed no unexpected toxic effects. Future trials should consider combination therapies and strategies in which patients are treated through initial disease progression with antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab.

Conclusion

Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents play a crucial role in the management of DR, but their use comes with certain systemic risks. A significant but often overlooked nephrotoxic potential exists, particularly with aflibercept and bevacizumab in the context of CKD. It is vital to identify potential issues early using validated criteria, along with risk stratification and an interdisciplinary approach. For patients who demonstrate renal vulnerability, ranibizumab is the preferred therapeutic option. Additional prospective studies are necessary to enhance our understanding of the epidemiology and pathology of AVAN and the ways to mitigate it.

### Bevacizumab-maly (Alymsys) [^114HVXBA]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.7 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.

Discontinue Alymsys in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known.

5.8 Renal Injury and Proteinuria

The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2–4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2 to 4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2 to 4 proteinuria.

5.8 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) (also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [RPLS]) has been reported in < 0.1% of 2137 patients enrolled in six clinical studies with CYRAMZA. Symptoms of PRES include seizure, headache, nausea/vomiting, blindness, or altered consciousness, with or without associated hypertension.

Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging and permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms may resolve or improve within days, although some patients with PRES can experience ongoing neurologic sequelae or death [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.9 Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome

Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade proteinuria ranged from 3–34%. Grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (including 4 patients with nephrotic syndrome) incidence ranged from < 1–3% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio. If the result of the urine dipstick is 2+ or greater, perform a 24-hour urine collection for protein measurement. Withhold CYRAMZA for urine protein levels that are 2 or more grams over 24 hours. Reinitiate CYRAMZA at a reduced dose once the urine protein level returns to less than 2 grams over 24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for urine protein levels greater than 3 grams over 24 hours or in the setting of nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.10 Thyroid Dysfunction

Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of Grade 1–2 hypothyroidism ranged from < 1–3%; there were no reports of Grade 3–5 hypothyroidism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor thyroid function during treatment with CYRAMZA.

5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CYRAMZA and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

He was diagnosed with stage IIIA right lung adenocarcinoma in February 2021 and underwent surgery in March. After developing subcarinal lymph node and pleural metastases in September 2023, he received bevacizumab 500 mg every 3 weeks, subsequently developing hypertension with systolic blood pressure reaching 180 mmHg, peripheral edema, and persistent frothy urine. Serial laboratory monitoring revealed progressive renal impairment, with serum creatinine increasing from 99 µmol/L in November 2023 to 136.9 µmol/L by March 2024, accompanied by worsening proteinuria from 1 + to 2 + and decreasing serum albumin from 29.2 to 24.6 g/L. Due to these findings, bevacizumab was dose-reduced to 400 mg every 4 weeks in December 2023 and ultimately discontinued in February 2024. Investigations following hospital admission: 24 h urine total protein quantity (24hUTP) 4617.6 mg/24 h (2600 ml) (Reference range: < 150 mg/24 h), SCr 156µmol/L (Reference range: 57–97 µmol/L), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 41.27 ml/min/1.73m 2 (Reference range: ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), platelet count 135 10*9/L (Reference range: 125–350 × 10⁹/L), albumin 23.2 g/L (Reference range: 40.0–55.0 g/L), soluble complement membrane attack complex (C5b-9) 409ng/mL (Reference range: 75–219 ng/mL). The anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) profile was negative, and serum complement levels (C3: 0.84 g/L, C4: 0.17 g/L) were within normal limits (reference ranges: C3 0.7–1.4 g/L, C4 0.1–0.4 g/L).

### Non-small cell lung cancer and antiangiogenic therapy: what can be expected of bevacizumab? [^113Ki8Ry]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

There is an urgent need for new therapies to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as progress with current chemotherapy regimens has been limited. The roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in promoting tumor angiogenesis, maintaining existing vasculature, and contributing to resistance to traditional therapies, together with its negative prognostic significance in NSCLC, make it an appropriate target for therapy. Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA), a monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF, has shown promise in treating a number of different cancers. In a recent phase II trial in patients with advanced metastatic NSCLC, the addition of bevacizumab to standard carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy produced a significantly longer time to progression (32.1 versus 18.4 weeks) and greater response rate (31% versus 19% [not significant]) than chemotherapy alone. In the subset of patients with nonsquamous histologies, response rates and survival were further enhanced, with a mean survival time of 17.9 months versus 12.3 months with chemotherapy alone. Bevacizumab was generally well tolerated and did not appear to increase the incidences or severities of the nausea/vomiting, neuropathy, and renal toxicity that are typically associated with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. Adverse events in phase I and II studies included hypertension, thrombosis, proteinuria (with occasional nephrotic syndrome), and epistaxis. Serious tumor-related bleeding episodes (hemoptysis/hematemesis) appear to be the main safety concern in patients with NSCLC, with squamous cell histology as a possible risk factor. Further work is needed to identify the best way to use bevacizumab in NSCLC, including use in combination with other biologic agents and in the adjuvant setting.

### VEGF inhibition, hypertension, and renal toxicity [^116nmrwJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The use of anti-angiogenic agents as part of the therapeutic armamentarium for advanced stage solid tumors has become the standard of care in several instances, particularly for renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. These agents primarily target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or its receptors, and include bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including VEGF receptors. These therapies, as a general class of anti-angiogenic medications, have been shown to have common adverse vascular effects attributable directly or indirectly to their anti-VEGF effects, including hypertension, renal vascular injury, often manifested by proteinuria and thrombotic microangiopathy, and congestive heart failure. Knowledge of these common side effects and their underlying mechanisms may allow for more accurate and prompt diagnoses, timely clinical interventions, and the development of rational and standard treatments. These measures may minimize patient morbidity and mortality, not only by the treatment of side effects, but also by minimizing the disruption of treatment of the underlying malignancy, as well as improving patient quality of life.

### Toxicity profile of bevacizumab in the UK neurofibromatosis type 2 cohort [^116USQPi]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Bevacizumab is considered an established part of the treatment strategies available for schwannomas in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). In the UK, it is available through NHS National Specialized Commissioning to NF2 patients with a rapidly growing target schwannoma. Regrowth of the tumour on suspension of treatment is often observed resulting in prolonged periods of exposure to bevacizumab to control the disease. Hypertension and proteinuria are common events with bevacizumab use and there are concerns with regards to the long-term risks of prolonged treatment. Dosing, demographic and adverse event (CTCAE 4.03) data from the UK NF2 bevacizumab cohort are reviewed with particular consideration of renal and cardiovascular complications. Eighty patients (48 male:32 female), median age 24.5 years (range 11–66 years), were followed for a median of 32.7 months (range 12.0–60.2 months). The most common adverse events were fatigue, hypertension and infection. A total of 19/80 patients (24%) had either a grade 2 or grade 3 hypertension event and 14/80 patients (17.5%) had proteinuria. Of 36 patients followed for 36 months, 78% were free from hypertension and 86% were free of proteinuria. Logistic regression modeling identified age and induction dosing regime to be independent predictors of development of hypertension with dose of 7.5 mg/kg 3 weekly and age > 30years having higher rates of hypertension. Proteinuria persisted in one of three patients after cessation of bevacizumab. One patient developed congestive heart failure and the details of this case are described. Further work is needed to determine optimal dosing regimes to limit toxicity without impacting on efficacy.

### Bevacizumab-awwb (Mvasi) [^113DAYi6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received bevacizumab. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab.

Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during MVASI therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)].

5.9 Infusion-Related Reactions

Infusion-related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients.

Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion-related reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion-related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion-related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen).

### Combination therapy: intermittent sorafenib with bevacizumab yields activity and decreased toxicity [^11383Fw2]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Eligibility

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Institute. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrolment. Eligibility requirements were as follows: advanced solid tumours, no treatment for at least 4 weeks, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, leukocyte count ⩾3000 μ l −1, absolute neutrophil count > 1200 μ l −1, platelet count ⩾100 000 μ l −1, serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg per 100 ml, transaminases ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg per 100 ml, and normal amylase and lipase. Coagulation parameters within 1.25 × ULN and (corrected) blood pressure (BP) of ≤ 140/90 mmHg were required. Preexisting treatment-related toxicity must have recovered to grade 1 or better. Patients with brain metastases, cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment, active infection, hemoptysis, recent thrombosis, or bleeding diatheses were excluded.

Treatment plan

Three additional dose levels (DLs) incorporating b.i.d. oral S 5 days of 7 each week with every 2-week intravenous bevacizumab were tested as described in Table 1. There was a 6-week accrual pause between DLs to monitor for delayed toxicity. A history, blood pressure measurement, and urine protein/creatinine ratio were performed before each bevacizumab dose, with detailed history and physical examination every cycle. If the urine protein/creatinine ratio was greater than 1.0 but less than grade 3, bevacizumab was given and a 24-h urine was collected for measurement of protein before the next cycle. Bevacizumab was held if proteinuria exceeded 2 g per 24 h.

### Risk factors of proteinuria in renal cell carcinoma patients treated with VEGF inhibitors: a secondary analysis of pooled clinical trial data [^112FEiDc]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

There was no evidence that use of an ASI significantly reduced the risk of proteinuria following commencement of sunitinib/pazopanib, or that use of NSAID or bisphosphonate drugs significantly increased the risk. The results of the current study were discordant with a prior study reporting that use of pamidronate (a bisphosphate drug) was associated with increased risk of proteinuria with bevacizumab treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The effects of ASIs and NSAIDs on proteinuria associated with VEGF-targeted therapy have not been previously reported. It is possible that the relationship is confounded by unmeasured variables that effect both the use of these medicines and the risk of proteinuria.

Proteinuria following commencement of sunitinib/pazopanib was associated with significantly improved OS. Specifically, the higher the grade of on-therapy proteinuria the better the survival outcome. Although this association has been studied previously, these studies have been limited by much smaller sample sizes. The largest prior study included 169 patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with bevacizumab and reported that proteinuria was independently associated with improved survival. The second largest prior study included 127 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab and found a significant association with improved response rate, but not OS. This association requires further validation, but it is possible that proteinuria is highlighting individuals with greater exposure or sensitivity to pazopanib/sunitinib A potential limitation of using proteinuria as a biomarker is that grade 3/4 proteinuria often occurs relatively late after starting therapy (median time to onset of 100 days).

In conclusion, Asian ethnicity, diabetes, baseline SBP, pre-existing proteinuria and prior nephrectomy were predictors of proteinuria during sunitinib or pazopanib therapy for patients with mRCC. There was no evidence to indicate that baseline use of ASIs, other antihypertensive drugs, NSAIDs and bisphosphonates significantly altered the risk of proteinuria. Proteinuria was also observed to be a potential biomarker of improved survival following use of VEGF-targeted agents.

### A randomized trial of bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, for metastatic renal cancer [^115bDqwq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene VHL cause oversecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor by clear-cell renal carcinomas. We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate bevacizumab, a neutralizing antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, in patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, phase 2 trial was conducted comparing placebo with bevacizumab at doses of 3 and 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, given every two weeks; the time to progression of disease and the response rate were primary end points. Crossover from placebo to antibody treatment was allowed, and survival was a secondary end point.

Results

Minimal toxic effects were seen, with hypertension and asymptomatic proteinuria predominating. The trial was stopped after the interim analysis met the criteria for early stopping. With 116 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups (40 to placebo, 37 to low-dose antibody, and 39 to high-dose antibody), there was a significant prolongation of the time to progression of disease in the high-dose — antibody group as compared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.55; P < 0.001). There was a small difference, of borderline significance, between the time to progression of disease in the low-dose — antibody group and that in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.26; P = 0.053). The probability of being progression-free for patients given high-dose antibody, low-dose — antibody, and placebo was 64 percent, 39 percent, and 20 percent, respectively, at four months and 30 percent, 14 percent, and 5 percent at eight months. At the last analysis, there were no significant differences in overall survival between groups (P > 0.20 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

Bevacizumab can significantly prolong the time to progression of disease in patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer.

Regarding the use of bevacizumab IV (also known as Avastin, Alymsys, Avzivi, Jobevne, Mvasi, Vegzelma, Zirabev) in patients with eGFR 0–90 mL/min/1.73 m²:
- Use acceptable.
- No dose adjustment required.
- People with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk of proteinuria. Monitor, if proteinuria ≥ 2 to ≤ 3.5 g per 24 hours presents hold treatment and resume therapy if and when urine protein levels are < 2 g per 24 hours. Discontinue treatment if nephrotic syndrome presents.

### Long-term efficacy and toxicity of bevacizumab-based therapy in children with recurrent low-grade gliomas [^112jMUtW]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Because definitive resection or radiotherapy for pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) may be associated with severe and permanent adverse effects, medical management has taken a significant role. Bevacizumab-based therapy has demonstrated encouraging responses; however, longer-term toxicity, response durability and alternative dosing regimens have not been evaluated.

Procedure

This was a retrospective review of children with multiply recurrent, progressive LGGs treated with bevacizumab-based therapy and followed for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Toxicity was uniformly graded and imaging was centrally reviewed.

Results

All fourteen patients had failed at least two prior treatment regimens; six had dissemination. Patients received initial bevacizumab-based therapy at a median age of 5.3 years (range, 1–12 years). Median treatment duration was 12 months (range, 1–24 months). 12 patients had an objective response; 2 had stable disease. Median time to maximum response was 9 weeks (range, 7–17 weeks). No patients progressed on therapy, although 13/14 progressed after stopping bevacizumab at a median of 5 months. Four patients were re-treated with bevacizumab and all again responded or stabilized. Alternative dosing strategies were effective, including bevacizumab monotherapy and prolonging the dosing interval to 3 weeks. High-grade bevacizumab-related toxicities consisted of grade 3 proteinuria (n = 2), primary inflammatory arthritis (n = 1), and somnolence (n = 1). Toxicities resolved within 6 months of treatment cessation except one case of hypertension.

Conclusions

Bevacizumab-based therapy is successful at inducing rapid LGG response. Patients progressing off-therapy may be successfully re-treated with bevacizumab. Nearly all tumors progress once treatment is discontinued. Toxicities are not insignificant but usually reversible.

### Surrogate markers in antiangiogenesis clinical trials [^111Ln9ks]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

In a Phase I dose-escalation study of SU5416, a small-molecule inhibitor of the VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase, urinary VEGF and bFGF levels were found to vary 1–2-fold during the course of therapy but did not correlate with response or treatment dose. Interestingly, the baseline urine VEGF levels were significantly lower in the four patients that clinically responded than in the 18 nonresponders. However, bFGF levels were not significantly affected. The effects of angiogenesis inhibitors on the level of angiogenic factors may be drug- or tumour-type specific and may be dependent on the level of proteins detectable in different bodily fluids. For example, urine, serum, and plasma levels of bFGF and VEGF were measured in patients with renal cell carcinoma enrolled in a Phase II study of razoxane, an antiangiogenic topoisomerase II inhibitor derived from the chelating agent EDTA. The levels of urinary VEGF significantly increased in patients who developed progressive disease but not in those with stable disease. However, no significant increases were observed in serum VEGF after one cycle of therapy, although baseline levels of serum VEGF were significantly higher in patients who subsequently developed progressive disease than in those with stable disease. Other mediators of angiogenesis (including serum VCAM-1, vWF, and urokinase plasminogen activator soluble receptor) hypothesised to be indirect targets of razoxane were significantly higher in progressive disease patients than in stable disease patients before and after one cycle of treatment. In a Phase II study of the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide, 16 of 36 patients with recurrent, high-grade gliomas that had radiographic and clinically stable disease had either stable or decreased serum bFGF levels. Interestingly, serum bFGF levels significantly correlated to survival; patients whose serum bFGF significantly decreased (compared to baseline) survived approximately twice as long (43 weeks) than in those patients whose levels increased beyond the third week of therapy. In our Phase I study of endostatin, two of 25 patients experienced minor anticancer effects, but their serum VEGF, bFGF, VCAM-1, and E-selectin levels did not significantly change after treatment.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety data in Warnings and Precautions and described below reflect exposure to bevacizumab in 4463 patients including those with mCRC (AVF2107g, E3200), non-squamous NSCLC (E4599), GBM (EORTC 26101), mRCC (BO17705), cervical cancer (GOG-0240), epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (MO22224), or other cancers at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving bevacizumab as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies at a rate > 10% were epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain, and exfoliative dermatitis.

Across clinical studies, bevacizumab was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

In Combination with bolus-IFL

The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus-IFL in patients with mCRC [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus-IFL, bevacizumab with bolus-IFL, or bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. All Grades 3−4 adverse reactions and selected Grades 1−2 adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in Table 2.

### Proteinuria in a patient receiving anti-VEGF therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^113h9u61]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 59-year-old man who had undergone a left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma was found to have metastatic disease during a restaging examination. The patient was started on treatment with interferon alpha2b plus bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody. After 9 months of this therapy, the patient developed proteinuria, which gradually increased to over 6 g/day.

Investigations

Physical examination, urine and blood analysis, biopsy of the right kidney, and histologic evaluation of the non-neoplastic portion of the left nephrectomy specimen.

Diagnosis

Thrombotic microangiopathy and IgA immune-complex deposition in the glomerular capillary walls and mesangium.

Management

Discontinuation of interferon alpha2b and bevacizumab, control of blood pressure with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin-receptor blocker.

### A case of ramucirumab-induced renal failure with nephrotic-range proteinuria and its pathological findings [^117GtwQ1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a rare case of ramucirumab-induced severe proteinuria and renal dysfunction with just one dose. The pathology showed not only TMA lesions but also collapsing glomeruli with crescent-like lesions due to epithelial cell hyperplasia caused by podocyte injury. Given that ramucirumab can cause podocytopathy, which is uncommon in bevacizumab, the change from bevacizumab to ramucirumab should be made carefully. When ramucirumab is used, proteinuria and renal function should be strictly monitored. We also found that proteinuria and serum Cr levels decreased without corticosteroids after ramucirumab treatment was discontinued. Once ramucirumab causes renal involvement, ramucirumab should be discontinued for some time.

Learning points

Compared with other antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs, the pathology of ramucirumab-induced renal failure is still unknown. Only a few reports suggest ramucirumab can present thrombotic microangiopathy, but we found that ramucirumab can also injure podocytes.
Although rare, ramucirumab can cause severe proteinuria and renal dysfunction with just one dose. When used, we must follow-up carefully.
If ramucirumab is a possible causative agent, it should be discontinued. As with other VEGF inhibitors, proteinuria and renal impairment may improve with discontinuation.
Ramucirumab and bevacizumab may have synergistic side effects. Care must be taken when switching between both drugs.

5.7 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.

Discontinue MVASI in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known.

5.8 Renal Injury and Proteinuria

The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2–4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2–4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2–4 proteinuria.

### Risk factors of proteinuria in renal cell carcinoma patients treated with VEGF inhibitors: a secondary analysis of pooled clinical trial data [^1146MtFV]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Dose modifications amongst Asian and White participants

Exploratory analysis indicated that Asian participants in the COMPARZ study were more likely to have a dose modification (interruption or reduction) than White participants (P = 0.018, Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, dose modification due to proteinuria was more common for Asian participants than White participants (P = 0.001, Supplementary Table 1).

Association between proteinuria and overall survival

Over a median follow-up of 30 months, 690 (50%) deaths were recorded. There was a statistically significant association between grade of proteinuria and OS (adjusted HR of 0.86 for each increase in grade, P = 0.015). Notably, the adjusted OS HR was 0.53 (95% CI 0.30–0.92) for grade 3/4 proteinuria compared with no on-therapy proteinuria. Early proteinuria (first 12 weeks of therapy) had a trend towards association with improved OS (adjusted HR of 0.86 for each increase in grade, P = 0.053). Median OS was 27.8 and 33.1 months, and was not reached within the study period, for patients without proteinuria in the first 12 weeks; those with grade 1/2 proteinuria in the first 12 weeks; and those with grade 3/4 proteinuria in the first 12 weeks, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1).

### Renal-limited thrombotic microangiopathy after switching from bevacizumab to ramucirumab: a case report [^111Fw9z9]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are increasingly applied to treat a number of malignancies such as metastatic or recurrent colorectal, non-small cell lung, breast, and renal cell cancers. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against VEGF, is broadly used as the first- or second-line therapy to various malignancies. The drug often causes proteinuria in treated patients, but it is rare bevacizumab-induced proteinuria reaches to a nephrotic range. In such cases, renal pathology shows thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and, at the molecular level, inactivating VEGF signaling leads to damage of glomerular endothelial cells. Other drugs, such as VEGF Trap (anti-VEGF ligand inhibitor) or multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (including sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib) may cause proteinuria and TMA.

Ramucirumab, anti-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) monoclonal antibody, is approved for treating gastric, non-small-cell lung, and metastatic colorectal cancers as the second-line therapy. Ramucirumab also potentiates proteinuria, but it is unknown whether ramucirumab use is associated with development of TMA. Here, we report a case in which TMA occurred immediately after switching chemotherapy from bevacizumab to ramucirumab.

### Evidence-based guidelines for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy in chronic kidney disease [^116gTdKX]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline for Anti-VEGF Use in DKD

Clinical decision-making must consider renal function as a guiding principle. Table 5 provides an overview of preferred medications, monitoring intervals and dosage approaches. Ranibizumab is deemed less harmful in the early stages of CKD, while bevacizumab and aflibercept are advised for the treatment of advanced CKD stage. The recommendation for patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min is to administer single-eye injections at extended intervals alongside close renal monitoring. In patients on dialysis, any anti-VEGF agent can be administered as there is no residual renal function left to lose. It is also essential to ensure cross-talk between the ophthalmologist, nephrologist, endocrinologist and other members of the diabetes care team. In addition, treatment should be individualized depending on affordability, accessibility, efficacy and safety assessment after discussion with patient.

Table 5
Urine albumin-creatinine ratio guidelines for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use in diabetic kidney disease

BP Blood pressure, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, ESRD end-stage renal disease,

a There are no absolute contraindications specific to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy inpatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) according to current guidelines (American Association of Ophthalmic Ophthalmologists [AAO], Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] and major retina societies) even with GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2: prefer Ranibizumab

b Weekly BP monitoring; Proteinuria (urine albumin:creatinine ratio) after 2–4 weeks during treatment, then once in 6 months if CKD is present; serum creatinine before and after at 2–4 weeks (check and document eGFR) during treatment, then once in 6 months if CKD is present

Certain conditions warrant caution or temporary deferral of treatment. If severe hypertension is present, administration of treatment should be delayed until blood pressure is checked. In pregnancy, it is preferable to avoid anti-VEGF therapy. In patients with a history of recent stroke and those with coronary artery disease (CAD), ranibizumab should be the preferred agent at the lowest possible dosage, after obtaining informed consent. In patients with histological diagnosis of TMA, in cases with active TMA, anti-VEGF therapy should be stopped and further therapy be deferred. In patients with a history of TMA, after informed consent has been obtained, ranibizumab can be administered though intravitreal route with ongoing serial monitoring.

Patients and methods

Patient selection

Patients were eligible if they had histologically proven MPM and unresectable disease according to an MPM-experienced surgeon. The presence of measurable and/or evaluable lesions according to modified RECIST criteria was mandatory. Eligibility criteria included age > 18 years and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≤ 1. An adequate bone marrow reserve was required, with absolute neutrophil count ⩾1.5 × 10 9 per litre, platelets ⩾100 × 10 9 per litre and haemoglobin ⩾9 g dL −1. Creatinine clearance, calculated by the Cockroft and Gault formula, had to be ⩾50 mL min −1, bilirubin ≤ 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN), and alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2.5-fold ULN. A baseline urine dipstick with proteinuria < 2+ was required. Patients discovered to have ⩾2+ proteinuria had to undergo a 24-h urine collection and demonstrate ≤ 1 g of protein per 24 h. Prior systemic or intracavitary chemotherapy, documented brain metastases, serious comorbidities or other malignancies were not allowed. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, serious non-healing wound or ulcer, evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days before study treatment start were not eligible for the trial. Patients were also excluded if they were currently on treatment with anti-coagulants, high-dose aspirin (> 325 mg day −1) or other medications known to predispose to gastrointestinal ulceration.

The study was conducted after approval by the ethical review board of each participating centre. Recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki for biomedical research involving human subjects were also followed. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before entering the study.

Study design

The study was planned as a multicentre, open label phase II trial of the combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin and bevacizumab as front-line treatment in patients with MPM. Patients were enrolled prospectively from 10 Italian Institutions. The primary end point of the study was PFS. Secondary end points included toxicity, response rate and OS, as well as the evaluation of PFS and OS according to pretreatment serum VEGF levels. The trial was registered at, with the number NCT00407459.

### Evidence-based guidelines for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy in chronic kidney disease [^112xgbji]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy are common microvascular complications of diabetes, often occurring together. The inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is fundamental in the management of DR, particularly in cases of diabetic macular oedema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). High and/or dysregulated levels of VEGF are harmful when present in the retina; thus VEGF inhibition is needed for managing DR. However, VEGF plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of glomerular endothelial cells via podocyte-endothelium crosstalk, with VEGF isoforms VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189 and VEGF206 playing significant roles in kidney tissue survival and microvascular integrity. VEGF165, the most abundant and bioactive form of VEGF, maintains glomerular endothelial fenestration, supporting ultrafiltration. Podocytes and tubular epithelial cells constitutively produce VEGF, which acts in a paracrine fashion to preserve endothelial health, particularly during hypoxia or injury. Differential isoform binding to extracellular matrix components ensures spatially regulated VEGF activity that is crucial for both glomerular and peritubular capillary maintenance. Studies have shown that systemic absorption of intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs — especially bevacizumab and aflibercept-occurs in both animal models and humans. This raises valid concerns regarding possible nephrotoxicity, particularly among vulnerable patient group with DKD.

Recent reports have documented instances of accelerated hypertension, increased proteinuria, a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and biopsy-confirmed glomerular damage following anti-VEGF injections. This situation calls for the creation of a standardized clinical term and management approach. We suggest using the term AVAN (anti-VEGF associated nephropathy) for this renoretinal syndrome, and offer a detailed framework to assist clinicians in recognizing, categorizing and treating AVAN. Our aim in this article is to outline the diagnostic criteria, severity classifications, biopsy indications and treatment recommendations for AVAN to guide clinical practice.

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Bevacizumab increases risk for severe proteinuria in cancer patients [^116oYZqF]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent bevacizumab, a humanized mAb that neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor, can lead to proteinuria and renal damage. The risk factors and clinical outcomes of renal adverse events are not well understood. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized, controlled trials to assess the overall risk for severe proteinuria with bevacizumab. We analyzed data from 16 studies comprising 12,268 patients with a variety of tumors. The incidence of high-grade (grade 3 or 4) proteinuria with bevacizumab was 2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.3%). Compared with chemotherapy alone, bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly increased the risk for high-grade proteinuria (relative risk 4.79; 95% CI 2.71 to 8.46) and nephrotic syndrome (relative risk 7.78; 95% CI 1.80 to 33.62); higher dosages of bevacizumab associated with increased risk for proteinuria. Regarding tumor type, renal cell carcinoma associated with the highest risk (cumulative incidence 10.2%). We did not detect a significant difference between platinum- and non-platinum-based concurrent chemotherapy with regard to risk for high-grade proteinuria (P = 0.39). In conclusion, the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy significantly increases the risk for high-grade proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.

### The place of VEGF inhibition in the current management of renal cell carcinoma [^116CnrfE]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Bevacizumab

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a humanised neutralising anti-VEGF antibody which binds to all biologically active isoforms of VEGF. The original murine antibody, A.4.6.1, had been shown to have anti-tumour activity in pre-clinical models. In phase I studies, bevacizumab was shown to have a half-life of approximately 21 days. Most patients tolerated the antibody well although haemorrhage, thrombosis, bowel perforation, hypertension and proteinuria have all been reported.

A prospective randomised double-blind three-arm phase II study of low (3 mg kg −1) and high (10 mg kg −1) dose bevacizumab given 2-weekly vs placebo in metastatic RCC was the first controlled study demonstrating clinical activity of an anti-VEGF approach in RCC. A total of 116 patients with metastatic clear cell RCC were randomised with 37–40 patients on each arm. All patients had documented evidence of progression at study entry and almost all had received previous cytokine therapy. Of 116 patients, 91 were ECOG performance status 0 with the remainder being ECOG PS 1. The three treatment arms were well balanced in terms of MSKCC prognostic indicators (performance status, anaemia, hypercalcaemia, prior nephrectomy). Primary objectives were time to progression (TTP) and overall response rate. Survival was a secondary end point as patients who progressed on the placebo arm were allowed to crossover to low-dose bevacizumab or entry into a study of bevacizumab in combination with thalidomide. The drug was well tolerated with 21% of patients in the high-dose arm experiencing grade 3 hypertension and 64% in the same treatment arm experiencing asymptomatic proteinuria with no reduction in renal function. Toxicities reversed upon stopping treatment. No treatment-related deaths were seen.

The study was stopped early by the data monitoring committee according to O'Brien-Fleming rules. A highly significant improvement in TTP (HR: 2.55, P < 0.001) was seen in the high-dose arm compared to placebo. Median TTP of the high-dose arm was 4.8 months compared to 2.5 months in the placebo arm and the overall response rate in the high-dose arm was 10%. There was a non-statistically significant improvement in TTP of the low-dose arm compared to placebo. No significant survival advantage was seen although the trial was not powered for this end point.

A phase III registration study of bevacizumab vs interferon- α in the first line treatment of metastatic RCC has recently been performed and results are awaited.

Materials and methods

Study design and patients

This @Be study was an open-label, multicenter single-arm phase II study in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, according to the eighth edition of the TNM classification of malignant tumors, or recurrent NS-NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% without EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 gene alterations.

Eligible patients had histologically confirmed stage IIIB/IV or postoperative recurrent NS-NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% assessed by immunohistochemistry with Dako 22C3 monoclonal antibody (Dako North America, Carpinteria, California, USA) at local laboratories, according to standard testing practices. Other criteria included age 20–75 years at time of informed consent, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal functions, and life expectancy ≥ 3 months at time of enrollment. No previous chemotherapy for advanced disease was allowed, but postoperative adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy ≥ 6 months prior to enrollment was allowed. Previous radiotherapy was allowed, but only for non-lung lesions. Patients had to have ≥ 1 measurable lesions based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

Major exclusion criteria included confirmed EGFR mutation and ALK, ROS1 fusion positive, history/presence of hemoptysis/bloody sputum, any coagulation disorder, tumor invading or abutting major blood vessels, coexistence/history of interstitial lung disease, and previous treatment with VEGF receptor inhibitors.

Procedures

Patients were administered atezolizumab 1200 mg fixed dose followed by bevacizumab 15 mg/kg by intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (@Be regimen). Patients remained on treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until 2 years from start of treatment. Suspension of atezolizumab or bevacizumab because of adverse events (AEs) was allowed. Patients requiring suspension of atezolizumab for ≥ 105 days or bevacizumab for ≥ 42 days from the date of the previous administration, were discontinued from study treatment. Tumor lesions were assessed radiologically at baseline, every 6 weeks to 24 months, and every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1. An independent review committee comprising clinicians and radiologists reviewed all tumor images and determined tumor responses and progression status. Laboratory studies including blood and urine tests were performed at every cycle day 1 and thereafter. AEs were monitored throughout the study period, sorted by System Organ Class and Preferred Terms using MedDRA/J, and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.

### A long-term extension study of bevacizumab in patients with solid tumors [^116ajUKc]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common reasons for discontinuation of bevacizumab treatment were disease progression (30 patients [31.6%]) and AEs (25 patients [26.3%]). A total of 27 patients (28.4%) did not complete safety follow‐up, with withdrawal of consent as the most frequent reason (7 patients [7.4%]). At the termination of the trial by the study sponsor, 14 patients were still receiving study treatment. Of these 14 patients, 13 transitioned to another treatment option (Post‐Trial Access Program or licensed product) and 1 discontinued treatment at the investigator's decision.

Safety

A total of 79 patients (83.2%) experienced AEs, of which the most common were (number of patients) proteinuria (42 [44.2]), headache (15 [15.8]), asthenia (15 [15.8]), hypertension (12 [12.6]), nausea (11 [11.6]), urinary tract infection (10 [10.5]), and diarrhea (10 [10.5]). AEs assessed as related to bevacizumab treatment were reported in 54 patients (56.8%; Table 3), the most common of which were proteinuria (39 patients [41.1%]) and hypertension (10 patients [10.5%]). AEs related to bevacizumab of CTCAE grade ≥ 3 occurred in 21 patients (22.1%; 95% CI, 14.2%–31.8%; Table 3). Grade ≥ 3 AEs (related to bevacizumab) that occurred in at least one patient were proteinuria (7 [7.4%]), hypertension (5 [5.3%]), and blood pressure increase (2 [2.1%]). No grade 4 or 5 AEs related to bevacizumab were reported. AEs that led to discontinuation of bevacizumab occurred in 25 patients (26.3%). The occurrence of proteinuria led to withdrawal of bevacizumab in 15 patients (15.8%), which was the only AE leading to withdrawal for more than one patient. Of the 42 patients who had proteinuria, 15 discontinued bevacizumab; of the 15 patients who had hypertension, 1 discontinued bevacizumab.

### Incidence and relevance of proteinuria in bevacizumab-treated patients: pooled analysis from randomized controlled trials [^113i8hsZ]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This analysis evaluated the incidence of and risk factors for bevacizumab-related proteinuria and assessed for any associated clinical sequelae, including renal function changes.

Methods

Patient-level adverse event and laboratory data from a pooled safety database were used to characterize alterations in urine protein excretion following interventional therapy ± bevacizumab in 17 randomized trials across multiple tumor types. Severity of renal function change was assessed using changes in serum creatinine concentration from baseline values. Potential predictors of proteinuria and the association between proteinuria and other adverse events were also investigated.

Results

Among 14,548 patients, the incidence of any-grade proteinuria was 8.2% (733/8,917) and 4.6% (257/5,631) in the bevacizumab and control groups, respectively; rates of grade ≥ 3 proteinuria were 1.4 and 0.2%. Post-baseline proteinuria grade and bevacizumab were associated with increased rates of renal dysfunction. Patients developing proteinuria had an increased rate of any-grade infection but not thromboembolic events. History of diabetes was the only examined risk factor that appeared to have a significant association with proteinuria development.

Conclusions

This analysis confirmed a significant increase in the development of proteinuria during bevacizumab treatment. We also observed an increased rate of renal dysfunction associated with bevacizumab treatment and among subjects with proteinuria, although the dysfunction was generally mild. The development of proteinuria was also associated with a modest increase in risk of infection.

### Surrogate markers in antiangiogenesis clinical trials [^116R16Y1]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

SERUM, PLASMA, AND URINE FACTORS

Proteins thought to be important mediators of angiogenesis can be measured in serum, plasma, and urine by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A significant change in the level of angiogenic protein(s) after initiation of treatment might provide an early indication of antiangiogenic activity before clinically demonstrable reductions in tumour size. Elevated levels of angiogenic growth factors, proteases, and endothelial adhesion molecules have been detected in sera of patients with malignant disease. These important promoters of tumour angiogenesis include VEGF, bFGF, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its soluble receptor, E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and von Willebrand's factor (vWF). Of the many mediators of angiogenesis, VEGF and bFGF are thought to play the most important roles and thus have been frequently measured as potential surrogate markers of antiangiogenic activity in many Phase I/II studies.

5.8 Renal Injury and Proteinuria

The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving Avastin as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating Avastin. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of Avastin in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2–4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2–4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Avastin was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated Avastin, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2–4 proteinuria.

### Risks of proteinuria and hypertension with bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112WXL9C]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Angiogenesis inhibitors have emerged as an effective targeted therapy in the treatment of patients with many cancers. One of the most widely used angiogenesis inhibitors is bevacizumab, a neutralizing antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor. The overall risk of proteinuria and hypertension in patients with cancer on bevacizumab therapy is unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials of bevacizumab to quantify the risk of proteinuria and hypertension.

Methods

The databases MEDLINE (OVID, 1966 to June 2006) and Web of Science and abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings from 2004 through 2006 were searched to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of patients with cancer treated with bevacizumab that described the incidence of proteinuria and hypertension. Relative risk (RR) was calculated by using the fixed-effects model.

Results

A total of 1,850 patients were included in the 7 trials identified from the literature. Bevacizumab was associated with a significant increased risk of proteinuria (RR, 1.4 with low-dose bevacizumab; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 1.7; RR, 2.2 with high dose; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.9). Hypertension also was increased significantly among patients receiving bevacizumab (RR, 3.0 for low dose; 95% CI, 2.2 to 4.2; RR, 7.5 for high dose; 95% CI, 4.2 to 13.4).

Conclusion

There was a significant dose-dependent increase in risk of proteinuria and hypertension in patients with cancer who received bevacizumab.

### Meta-analysis of individual patient safety data from six randomized, placebo-controlled trials with the antiangiogenic VEGFR2-binding monoclonal antibody ramucirumab [^115sba3g]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Proteinuria

There were 259 (9.4%) patients experiencing any-grade proteinuria in the ramucirumab arm and 70 (3.1%) patients in the control arm (RR: 3.4, 95% CI 2.6–4.3) (Table 3). Thirty-one (1.1%) patients in the ramucirumab arm experienced grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (including only one grade 4 and no grade 5 events) versus one (0.04%) patient in the control arm. The NNH for grade ≥ 3 proteinuria was 1 in 92 patients (Table 4). Twenty-seven (1.0%) patients in the ramucirumab arm and one (0.04%) patient in the control arm discontinued investigational drug due to proteinuria. The NNH for proteinuria leading to discontinuation was 1 in 107 patients. Three patients (0.1%) with nephrotic syndrome, exclusively from the RAISE trial, were identified in the ramucirumab arm, all of whom were Asian patients with pre-existing hypertension treated with at least two antihypertensive medications.

Hemorrhage/bleeding

Bleeding (all grades) was reported in 1031 (37.5%) and 426 (19.0%) patients in the ramucirumab and control arms, respectively (Table 3, Figure 1) (RR: 2.0, 95% CI 1.8–2.2). Low-grade (grade 1–2) epistaxis was the most frequently reported bleeding event in the ramucirumab arm [ranging from 5% (REGARD) to 40% (ROSE)], with the exception of three grade 3 events. Grade ≥ 3 bleeding was reported in 74 (2.7%) patients in the ramucirumab arm and 62 (2.8%) patients in the control arm (RR: 1.1, 95% CI 0.8–1.5).

### Intricacies of bevacizumab-induced toxicities and their management [^111ivGoA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the serious and common toxicities of bevacizumab and describe their incidence, risk factors, presentation, pathophysiology, and management.

Data Sources

Literature for this review article was collected from PubMed, MEDLINE, and the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (2000-November 2008). The key terms used in the search were: bevacizumab, vascular endothelial growth factor, angiogenesis inhibitors, toxicity, toxicity management, and adverse event.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, preclinical studies, and all published Phase 1–3 clinical trials were reviewed. The references listed in identified articles were examined for additional publications.

Data Synthesis

The biomedical literature from 2000 to 2008 confirms that bevacizumab carries serious and potentially life-threatening toxicity risks and emphasizes the importance of early recognition, continuous monitoring, and prompt management of these toxicities. Such toxicities include hemorrhage/bleeding, wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation, arterial thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, hypertension, proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome, infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Patients at the highest risk for these toxicities are individuals with a history of hypertension, thromboembolism, bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or preexisting proteinuria, as these conditions may be exacerbated by bevacizumab use. Additionally, particular tumor types correlate with risk for individual toxicities; for example, patients with squamous non-small-cell lung cancer or rectal cancer have a higher risk of bleeding, those with renal cell carcinoma have a higher proteinuria risk, and patients with colorectal cancer have a higher risk of gastrointestinal perforation. Further investigation is warranted to develop effective management strategies for these toxicities.

Conclusions

As bevacizumab is becoming widely used in general oncology practice, it is important to understand the toxicities that can arise and to develop practice guidelines for their management.

### Rituximab, bevacizumab and CHOP (RA-CHOP) in untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetic analysis [^1167GoPJ]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2006). Low credibility.

Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with high serum VEGF levels have an inferior survival compared to patients with low VEGF levels. Bevacizumab was administered through a central line at 15 mg kg(-1) IV on day 1 followed by rituximab (R) and CHOP on day 2 for cycle 1 and day 1 for cycles 2–8. Serum levels of bevacizumab and R were measured at specified time points to assess pharmacokinetics (PK). Plasma and urine samples were also analysed for VEGF. Tumor samples were stained for VEGF, CD31 and factor VIII by immunohistochemistry. Thirteen patients with newly-diagnosed DLBCL received a total of 88 cycles (range 2–8, median 7). Best response included five CR, six PR, one SD and one PD with an overall response rate of 85% and complete response rate of 38%. The 12-month PFS is 77% and a median follow-up of 16.9 months for the surviving patients. All tumor samples stained strongly positive for VEGF and there was a marginal association between baseline plasma VEGF and response (p = 0.04). Patients with higher plasma VEGF levels were generally younger and had bulky disease. Micro-vessel density did not correlate with presenting disease characteristics, VEGF expression or response. The PK of bevacizumab and rituximab were not influenced by combined treatment. In this patient population, treatment with RA-CHOP did not result in any episodes of grade 3 or 4 proteinuria, heart failure or hemorrhage. The RA-CHOP combination was generally well tolerated and safe.

### Suppression of the nitric oxide pathway in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients receiving vascular endothelial growth factor-signaling inhibitors [^113vgz3p]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Therapies that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway cause hypertension, but the mechanism remains unknown. This cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that VEGF inhibition causes hypertension by suppressing VEGF-mediated vasodilatory pathways. Urine was collected from 80 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma from 2002 to 2009, 40 at baseline and 40 while on VEGF inhibitors. Measured urinary biomarkers include albumin, metabolites of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway and its downstream effector cGMP, and prostaglandin pathway biomarkers prostaglandin E2, 6-keto prostaglandin F1α, and cAMP, all normalized to urinary creatinine. The mean age in both groups was 61.8 years, 76% were men, and urinary albumin was higher in patients receiving VEGF inhibitors (median: 18.4 versus 4.6 mg/g; P = 0.009). cGMP/creatinine was suppressed in patients on VEGF inhibitors (0.28 versus 0.39 pmol/μg; P = 0.01), with a trend toward suppression of nitrate/creatinine (0.46 versus 0.62 μmol/mg; P = 0.09). Both comparisons were strengthened when patients on bevacizumab were excluded, and only those receiving small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors were analyzed (cGMP/creatinine: P = 0.003; nitrate/creatinine: P = 0.01). Prostaglandin E2, 6-keto prostaglandin F1α, and cAMP did not differ between groups. These results suggest that hypertension induced by VEGF inhibitors is mediated by suppression of NO production. Prospective studies are needed to explore whether these biomarkers may be useful predictors of efficacy in patients receiving VEGF-targeted therapies.

### Bevacizumab (Avzivi) [^1121qe9Y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received bevacizumab. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab.

Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during Avzivi therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)].

5.9 Infusion-Related Reactions

Infusion-related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients.

Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion-related reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion-related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion-related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen).

### Evidence-based guidelines for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy in chronic kidney disease [^111UdB54]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal Risks: Observational and Biopsy-Based Evidence

Evidence from real-world studies increasingly indicates that anti-VEGF treatment may not be harmless in CKD. In a retrospective analysis conducted by Rivero et al. around 20% of patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment experienced > 25% drop in estimated GFR (eGFR) within 1 year, with 6.7% facing > 50% decline. Furthermore, 17.2% progressed to requiring dialysis within a 2-year timeframe. These results are concerning and align with many case reports documenting new-onset nephrotic syndrome (minimal change disease [MCD], focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS] and membranous glomerulonephritis [MGN]) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Bollee et al. and Eremina et al. recognized a direct link between anti-VEGF therapy and TMA. A meta-analysis by Wu et al. highlighted a significantly increased risk of high-grade proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome among patients with cancer treated with bevacizumab. Several case-series have reported worsening proteinuria, increased blood pressure in patients with pre-existing CKD and even acute kidney injury (AKI) in some patients, particularly those with pre-existing CKD. De novo or relapsing glomerulonephritis has also been attributed to anti-VEGF therapy, which includes the relapse of MCD and membranous nephropathy. Graft dysfunction, new or worsening proteinuria, and antibody-mediated rejection have been attributed to anti-VEGF therapy one case-series. Studies by Haruhara et al. and Izzedine H et al. have further emphasized the histopathologic variety of AVAN ranging from podocytopathies to TMA.

Proteinuria is generally dose dependent. The underlying pathophysiological process is probably characterized by a reduction in systemic VEGF, resulting in injury to the glomerular endothelium, impairment of podocyte function and an increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy; these are similar to the effects observed in patients with cancer receiving systemic anti-VEGF treatment. Furthermore, in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis, the fluid overload, along with existing hypertension, may increase patient morbidity. Studies have depicted age, proteinuria and pre-existing CKD as risk factors for AVAN, and animal research supports these observations. For example, Tschulakow et al. showed that aflibercept attaches to the glomerular endothelium and decreases endothelial fenestration; in contrast, ranibizumab displayed minimal binding to the glomeruli in the same experimental set-up. Taken together, these results highlight the feasibility and biological foundation of AVAN.

### Evidence-based guidelines for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy in chronic kidney disease [^1112LiQt]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravitreal therapy using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) has transformed the approach to treating diabetic retinopathy (DR), but its application in individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, the majority of whom have diabetic kidney disease, involves a complex evaluation of risks and benefits. Emerging evidence indicates that the systemic absorption of anti-VEGF agents administered intravitreally may lower circulating VEGF levels and negatively impact the renal endothelium, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney issues. In this article, we showcase an evidence-based framework for the safe administration of anti-VEGF therapy in patients with DR accompanied by chronic kidney disease. We introduce a novel renoretinal syndrome, which we refer to as anti-VEGF-associated nephropathy (AVAN), and outline diagnostic criteria, severity classifications, biopsy indications, and treatment recommendations to guide clinical practice.

### Evaluation of hypertension and proteinuria as markers of efficacy in antiangiogenic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer [^116kUGWq]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The vascular endothelial growth factor pathway is strongly implicated in cancer-related angiogenesis. Antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab commonly cause hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria (PTN), which may be biomarkers of response and clinical outcome.

Study

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with either bevacizumab or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy at The Christie Hospital from January 2006 to September 2009.

Results

Of 90 patients evaluated, 50 were eligible. Seventeen (34%), 4 (8%), and 3 (6%) patients developed Common Toxicity Criteria (v 3.0) grades 1, 2, and 3 HTN, respectively. Response rates were 42% for patients with grades 0 to 1 HTN compared with 86% for patients with ≥ grade 2 HTN (P = 0.043). Median overall survival was 21.6 months for patients with grades 0 to 1 HTN and 25.2 months for patients with ≥ grade 2 HTN (P = 0.270). Twelve patients (24%) developed grade 1 PTN and 4 patients (8%) developed ≥ grade 2 PTN. Median overall survival was 23.9 months for patients with grades 0 to 1 PTN and 4.2 months for those with ≥ grade 2 PTN (P = 0.028).

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the utility of PTN as a surrogate marker of outcome in antiangiogenic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Although HTN is predictive of a significantly higher response rate, the development of PTN during treatment with bevacizumab or tyrosine kinase inhibitor portends poorer survival and should be evaluated prospectively.

### Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: final overall survival and adverse event analysis of a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (gynecologic oncology group 240) [^116Hw6J7]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

On Aug 14, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab for women with advanced cervical cancer on the basis of improved overall survival (OS) after the second interim analysis (in 2012) of 271 deaths in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial. In this study, we report the prespecified final analysis of the primary objectives, OS and adverse events.

Methods

In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical carcinoma from 81 centres in the USA, Canada, and Spain. Inclusion criteria included a GOG performance status score of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; adequately anticoagulated thromboembolism; a urine protein to creatinine ratio of less than 1; and measurable disease. Patients who had received chemotherapy for recurrence and those with non-healing wounds or active bleeding conditions were ineligible. We randomly allocated patients 1:1:1:1 (blocking used; block size of four) to intravenous chemotherapy of either cisplatin (50 mg/m 2 on day 1 or 2) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m 2 or 175 mg/m 2 on day 1) or topotecan (0.75 mg/m 2 on days 1–3) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 on day 1) with or without intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) in 21 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, voluntary withdrawal by the patient, or complete response. We stratified randomisation by GOG performance status (0 vs 1), previous radiosensitising platinum-based chemotherapy, and disease status (recurrent or persistent vs metastatic). We gave treatment open label. Primary outcomes were OS (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and adverse events (analysed in all patients who received treatment and submitted adverse event information), assessed at the second interim and final analysis by the masked Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The cutoff for final analysis was 450 patients with 346 deaths. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062.

Findings

Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, we enrolled 452 patients (225 [50%] in the two chemotherapy-alone groups and 227 [50%] in the two chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups). By March 7, 2014, 348 deaths had occurred, meeting the prespecified cutoff for final analysis. The chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups continued to show significant improvement in OS compared with the chemotherapy-alone groups: 16.8 months in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups versus 13.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone groups (hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.62–0.95]; p = 0.007). Final OS among patients not receiving previous pelvic radiotherapy was 24.5 months versus 16.8 months (0.64 [0.37–1.10]; p = 0.11). Postprogression OS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (8.4 months) and chemotherapy-alone groups (7.1 months; 0.83 [0.66–1.05]; p = 0.06). Fistula (any grade) occurred in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (all previously irradiated) versus three (1%) of 220 in the chemotherapy-alone groups (all previously irradiated). Grade 3 fistula developed in 13 (6%) versus one (< 1%). No fistulas resulted in surgical emergencies, sepsis, or death.

Interpretation

The benefit conferred by incorporation of bevacizumab is sustained with extended follow-up as evidenced by the overall survival curves remaining separated. After progression while receiving bevacizumab, we did not observe a negative rebound effect (ie, shorter survival after bevacizumab is stopped than after chemotherapy alone is stopped). These findings represent proof-of-concept of the efficacy and tolerability of antiangiogenesis therapy in advanced cervical cancer.

5.7	Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.

Discontinue VEGZELMA in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known.

5.8	Renal Injury and Proteinuria

The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab products as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies.

The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2–4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2–4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2–4 proteinuria.
