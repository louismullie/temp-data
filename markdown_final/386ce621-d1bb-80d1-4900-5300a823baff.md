## Question

8,9

Find the equation of the plane passing through the point $M(-2 ; 0 ; 3)$ and parallel to the plane $2 x-y-3 z+5=0$.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to find the equation of a plane that passes through a given point and is parallel to another plane. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "parallel planes" implies for their normal vectors. Then, I should extract the normal vector from the given plane. Next, I will write the general form of the new plane using that normal vector. After that, I need to substitute the coordinates of the given point to solve for the constant term. Finally, I will verify the result and present the equation in standard form.

> Let me first confirm the key geometric principle: two planes are parallel if and only if their normal vectors are parallel, which means they share the same normal direction up to a scalar multiple. So, the normal vector of the desired plane must be the same as the normal vector of the given plane, 2x − y − 3z + 5 = 0 [^notfound].

> I will now extract the normal vector from the given plane. The coefficients of x, y, and z in the general plane equation Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 directly give the normal vector n = (A, B, C), so here n = (2, −1, −3). Hold on, I should verify the sign convention; yes, the normal is indeed (2, −1, −3) from 2x − y − 3z + 5 = 0 [^notfound].

> Next, I should write the general equation of the new plane using the same normal vector. Since the normal is (2, −1, −3), the new plane has the form 2x − y − 3z + D = 0, where D is the constant I need to determine from the point condition. Wait, let me verify that I'm not inadvertently changing the normal; keeping the coefficients identical ensures parallelism [^notfound].

> Now, I need to substitute the given point M(−2, 0, 3) into this equation to find D. Plugging in: 2(−2) − (0) − 3(3) + D = 0, which simplifies to −4 − 0 − 9 + D = 0, so −13 + D = 0, and therefore D = 13. Hold on, I should double-check the arithmetic: 2 times −2 is −4, and 3 times 3 is 9, so −4 − 9 is −13, and D = 13 is correct [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the equation of the desired plane is 2x − y − 3z + 13 = 0. Let me reconsider whether this satisfies both conditions: it has the same normal as the given plane, so it is parallel, and substituting M(−2, 0, 3) gives 2(−2) − 0 − 3(3) + 13 = −4 − 9 + 13 = 0, confirming the point lies on the plane. I should confirm there are no sign errors; none are present, so the solution is consistent [^notfound].

The equation of the plane passing through point (M(-2, 0, 3)) and parallel to the plane (2x - y - 3z + 5 = 0) is (2x - y - 3z + 13 = 0). This is because parallel planes share the same normal vector, so the new plane has the form (2x - y - 3z + D = 0); substituting (M(-2, 0, 3)) gives (D = 13).

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: identify the normal vector of the given plane

The general equation of a plane is (Ax + By + Cz + D = 0), where ((A, B, C)) is the normal vector. For the plane (2x - y - 3z + 5 = 0), the normal vector is (\\mathbf{n} = (2, -1, -3)).

---

### Step 2: use the fact that parallel planes have the same normal vector

Since the desired plane is parallel to the given plane, it must have the same normal vector. Therefore, the equation of the new plane can be written as:

[
2x - y - 3z + D = 0
]

where (D) is a constant to be determined.

---

### Step 3: substitute the coordinates of point M into the equation

The plane passes through the point (M(-2, 0, 3)). Substituting these coordinates into the equation:

[
2(-2) - 1(0) - 3(3) + D = 0
]

Simplifying:

[
-4–0–9 + D = 0
]

[
-13 + D = 0
]

[
D = 13
]

---

### Step 4: write the final equation of the plane

Substituting (D = 13) back into the equation, the final equation of the plane is:

[
2x - y - 3z + 13 = 0
]

---

## Verification

To ensure the solution is correct, we can verify that the point (M(-2, 0, 3)) satisfies the equation:

[
2(-2) - 1(0) - 3(3) + 13 = -4–0–9 + 13 = 0
]

The equation holds true, confirming that the plane passes through the given point.

---

## Conclusion

The equation of the plane passing through the point (M(-2, 0, 3)) and parallel to the plane (2x - y - 3z + 5 = 0) is:

(\\boxed{2x - y - 3z + 13 = 0})

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^55f4a482]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior,, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ i P i (t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P 1, P 2, P 3) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities 1/ n and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, P i > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time,and. This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W 0 = W 1, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### Statistical moments of quantum-walk dynamics reveal topological quantum transitions [^faf5bd92]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Methods

Asymptotic expressions of first and second moments

The large step-number limit for the walker distribution moments (equations 7 and 8) can be derived conveniently by evaluating M 1 and M 2 in momentum representation, where they are defined as follows:

Here N is the step-number,is the single-step evolution operator (3), and | φ 0 〉 is the coin initial state. Expanding the evolution operator as

whereis the identity matrix in 2D,and the components of n δ (k) are those reported in equation 6, it is straightforward to obtain the following equations:

It is important to observe that equations 13 and 14 are valid for any quantum system whose Hilbert space has the same structure as our QW, that is the direct product of an infinite discrete lattice and a two-state quantum degree of freedom. Equation 13, reporting the expression for the first-order moment, can be evaluated considering that V δ = n z =− n y. Applying this substitution, the same equations reads

First- and second-order moments reported in equations 14 and 15, respectively, coincide with the equations 7 and 8 of the main text. In the specific case of our QW model, the integral appearing in equations 14 and 15 can be solved analytically. Using the expression for the group velocity reported in equations 5 and 9 yields

This integral can be calculated by the residue theorem passing to the complex variable z = e ik. Then we obtain, where the integral is along the unit circle in the complex z -plane and f δ (z) is given by

The poles of f δ (z) are located on the imaginary axis at,,and(k =1, … 5) and the residues of f δ (z) at the poles are given by,,and, respectively. Apart from the pole at z =0, when δ varies, the locations of the poles move in the complex plane entering and exiting the unit circle, but only the residues of the poles inside the unit circle contribute to L (δ). Thus, we find

In Supplementary Note 3 and in Supplementary Fig. 6 we show how with the same approach the analytical expression for the function L can be found for the SSH model.

Next, we need to find the coordinates ofin the inertial reference frame once the head rotation has occurred:

With x, y and z corresponding to the components of the eye vector in the inertial frame.whereand.

Now, we need to find the intersection ofwith the plane defined in Equation (6) at times t and t + d t :

To find the point of intersection, we can substitute thecomponent in the equation of the plane and compute the coefficient m. Starting with Equation (6):

In order to have a better perspective of the track that the intersection ofwith the screen at different times produces, we treat each of the intersection points as the endpoint of a vector with its base at the inertial frame origin. Then we can rotate these vectors around the z axis of the inertial frame with a desired angle to have a better view. In other words, it is as if we have rotated the screen with that angle, since the relative geometry of the points on the screen would not change after this rotation. In order to perform this rotation, we use a Rodrigues’ rotation formula:Where v is the vector of intersection points and β is the rotation angle around theaxis. If we pick, we practically rotate the screen such that it becomes parallel toandaxes of the inertial frame and perpendicular to.

In the above treatment, the gaze vectoris fixed in the head frame. However, this is not correct as the pupil would move in the head frame. In order to correct for this effect, we simultaneously recorded eye and head rotations in mice during foraging, as described, and implemented the pupil rotations in the head frame to our model. This effectively makes the direction of the gaze dependent on pitch, roll and yaw. In mathematical terms, in Equation (7) we would make the correction:

The rest of the transformations follows as before. The correction rotation matrix in head frame,, was computed from the head–eye rotations measured and represented in Extended Data Fig. 9f,g.

### Linear optics of the eye and optical systems: a review of methods and applications [^bd98eed4]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Four special systems

The fourfundamental properties are related through symplecticity and each is a modification of a familiar optical property.Consequently, four special systems are defined and occur when each of the four fundamental properties, is null.These four special systems are shown in figure 2.

Figure 2 
The four special systems for optical systems. (A) Exit-plane focal, (B) conjugate, (C) afocal and (D) entrance-plane focal.

Settingreduces equation 7 towhich implies that a pencil of rays of reduced inclinationentering an optical system atwill focus at a point in the exit-plane T. Such a system is referred to as exit-plane focal. Where the system is an eye,represents emmetropia.Harrisrefers toas the ‘condition for emmetropia’. Consequently, Harris,regards A as the ametropia of the eye, such that, whenthe eye is ametropic. A is a scalar matrix, that is,represents a hyperopic eye anda myopic eye. Where A is not a-scalar matrix the eye is astigmatic.

When, equation 7 simplifies toand rays from a point with positionatare conjugate with a point with position y at T. For a conjugate system, A represents the transverse magnification.For a Gaussian system, where A is the familiar transverse magnification in a conjugate system. The transference for a conjugate system is also referred to as the object-image matrix.For example, from a reading plane to the retina of an eye that is accommodated at the reading plane.

For, equation 8 becomes. A pencil of parallel rays entering an afocal system will exit parallel. D represents an angular magnification.For a Gaussian system this is the familiar.

Finally, if equation 8 becomesand rays entering the system from a point with positiononwill emerge from the system all with the same inclination. Such a system is entrance-plane focal.This is the situation, for example, in ophthalmoscopy. The entrance plane is the retina and the exit plane is the cornea of an emmetropic eye. Light is traversing the eye in the reverse sense. The optical system is a reversed eye.

Some of these special systems are used to obtain certain familiar derived properties. Each of A, B, C and D, when applied in this manner, are generalised magnifications.

### GRAF-pop: a fast distance-based method to infer subject ancestry from multiple genotype datasets without principal components analysis [^8851f403]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

In GRAF-pop, we use the expected D values calculated using Equation (3) to find the vertices of ΔEFA, and use it as the reference triangle to calculate barycentric coordinates. When there are missing genotypes, we first calculate the barycentric coordinates using the SNPs with genotypes, then map the coordinates onto the reference triangle when no genotypes are missing. Specifically, we do the following steps to normalize the genetic distances and plot the results:

For each subject group U {E, F, A}, calculate the expected genetic distances D U1, D U2, D U3, to the first three reference populations, using Equation (3) for the full set of 10,000 fingerprint SNPs.
Represent each group with a 3-D point in space by treating D U1, D U2, D U3 as the x, y, z Cartesian coordinates. Build a triangle by connecting the three points representing the three subject groups.
Rotate and translate the triangle so that it is in the plane z = 0, and side FA is parallel to the x -axis. Denote this triangle as ΔEFA 0, to be used as the reference triangle for calculating barycentric coordinates.
Given a subject i, find the subset, T, of fingerprint SNPs with genotypes for this subject.
For each subject group U {E, F, A}, calculate the expected genetic distances D U1T, D U2T, D U3T, to the first three reference populations using Equation (4) for subset T. Represent each group with a 3-D point in the space.
Calculate the genetic distances D i1, D i2 and D i3 from subject i to the first three reference populations. Represent subject i as a 3-D point, Q, by treating D i1, D i2, D i3 as the x, y, z Cartesian coordinates.
Build a triangle by connecting the three points representing the three subject groups. Rotate and translate the three points, together with point Q, so that the triangle is in the plane z = 0. Denote this triangle as ΔEFA T.
Using the x, y coordinates of point Q after transformation, calculate the barycentric coordinates (λ ie, λ if, λ ia) for subject i with respect to ΔEFA T, using Equations (5) and (6).
Convert the barycentric coordinates back to the Cartesian coordinates (x i0, y i0) using reference triangle ΔEFA 0 : where (x e0, y e0), (x f0, y f0), (x a0, y a0) are the Cartesian coordinates of the three vertices of ΔEFA 0.
Plot the converted Cartesian coordinates of subject i, together with ΔEFA 0, on the x-y plane. The final x i0, y i0 values are the normalized genetic distances, called GD1 and GD2 scores in this article and in GRAF.
The z coordinate of point Q after transformation (step 7), called GD3 score, is also used for plotting results.
Calculate the genetic distances D i4 and D i5 from subject i to the last two reference populations South Asian and Mexican/Latino. The difference D i5 - D i4, called GD4 score, is plotted against GD1 scores to separate South Asians from Latin Americans.

### PLANET: an ellipse fitting approach for simultaneous tand tmapping using phase-cycled balanced steady-state free precession [^e6c95e83]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Reconstruction Method for Parametric Mapping

Essential to the PLANET method is a three‐step reconstruction algorithm to simultaneously estimate relaxation parameters T 1 and T 2, and an effective banding free magnitudefrom phase‐cycled bSSFP data. However, an additional step is required when the reconstruction of the off‐resonance mapis also desired.

Step 1. Direct linear least squares ellipse fitting to phase‐cycled bSSFP data.

The first step consists of performing voxel‐wise direct linear least squares fitting of a general quadratic polynomial function to the data points in the complex plane 22 :where x and y are real and imaginary components of transverse magnetization.

By minimizing the sum of squared algebraic distances of the ellipse to the data points under a proper scaling and an appropriate constraint specific to ellipses (discriminant– 4C 1 C 3 = −1), we avoid the trivial solution C = 0 and exclude all nonelliptical fits, such as hyperbola and parabola. As a result, we find a unique set of coefficients C = [C 1, C 2, C 3, C 4, C 5, C 6] representing the ellipse. The fitting is based on a numerically stable version of the ellipse fit 24. This is a fast, direct, linear, non‐iterative ellipse fit. Because there are six unknowns, we need at least six data points x, which can be acquired by scanning with at least six different RF phase increment settings.

Step 2. Rotation of the ellipse to initial vertical conic form.

The rotation of data points of the ellipse to the initial vertical form, i.e. the orientation directly after RF excitation pulse, was performed by applying basic algebraic transformations to the polynomial representation of the ellipse found in the previous step (Eq. [6]). We found the rotation angleto be:

Becauseis defined within, we unwrapped it to cover therange by verifying that the ellipse of every voxel is vertical and that its center lies on the positive real axis.

After rotation, illustrated in Figure 2 a, the conic equation for the vertical orientation can be used to describe the ellipse:where (, 0) is the geometrical center of the ellipse,andare the semi‐axes of the ellipse.

### Plastic anisotropy and dislocation trajectory in BCC metals [^9a8fd5e6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

So far, non-Schmid effects have been modelled using a phenomenological law based on a linear combination of the stresses that affect dislocation motion, which in the case of the T/AT asymmetry are the RSSs projected on two different planes of the 〈111〉 zone. The choice of these planes is arbitrary as long as they are not parallel. When the horizontal (10) plane and the (01) plane in the twinning region are chosen, the yield criterion is expressed as:

withand a, two phenomenological parameters that may be fitted on experimental or numerical data. Expanding and reorganizing equations (2) and (3), we can show that. Equation (2) therefore provides a physical justification for the phenomenological law in equation (3). In particular, the relation above shows that a increases monotonically from 0 to 1 when α decreases from 0 (straight path) to − π /6 (path passing through the [111] atomic column). The parameter a is therefore directly related to the deviation of the dislocation trajectory from the straight (10) plane.

### X-ray-to-visible light-field detection through pixelated colour conversion [^38803af2]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Principle of the 3D light-field sensor

In spherical coordinates, a detector placed parallel to the y axis can measure the angle variation of light around the y axis in the XOZ plane (Supplementary Fig. 8). For a detector placed parallel to the x axis, it can measure the angle variation of light around the x axis in the YOZ plane. Accordingly, for a beam incident from any direction (θ, φ), detector 1 placed parallel to the x axis detects the angle α 1 between the projection of the beam onto the YOZ plane and the z axis, whereas detector 2 placed parallel to the y axis detects the angle α 2 between the projection of the beam onto the XOZ plane and the z axis (Supplementary Fig. 9). The relationships between α 1, α 2 and θ, φ are as follows:where α 1 and α 2 are encoded for the colour output of detectors 1 and 2, respectively. In a specific experiment, α 1 and α 2 are obtained from the CIE tristimulus value of the colour output of detectors 1 and 2, respectively. The φ and θ values of the beam are then obtained from equations (1) and (2) as follows:

### Kinetic features dictate sensorimotor alignment in the superior colliculus [^9b69e44d]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Visuo-motor alignment

This analysis was performed on neurons that had a significant tuning to moving gratings and a significant tuning to head rotations. In order to determine whether any alignment existed between these 2 types of tuning we first modelled the 3D head-rotation tuning of a neuron as a 2D projection of a vector coming out of the eye of that mouse (corresponding to gaze) into the 2D plane of the screen in which the visual stimuli were shown. We considered the head position at time 0 equal to the position of the mouse head when head-restrained for visual stimuli (see ‘3D head rotations to 2D screen plane transformation model’). We then determined the weighted average of the newly computed motion vectors that make up the 2D trajectory. We weighted the motion vector at each time-point by the instantaneous velocity of the gaze movement. This analysis gave us a vector with an angleon the same plane as the gratings presentation and that could be directly compared to the angle of maximum selectivity. We focussed on comparing the direction of these two vectors by subtraction:.

Modelling

3D head rotations to 2D screen plane transformation model

In order to project a gaze vector from the eye of the mouse onto the plane of the screen in which the visual stimuli are shown we first computed the equation of the plane in the laboratory’s reference frame. l is a line from point 1 to point 2 in the screen plane and since it also lies within the xy plane (for the particular choice of points), we have (see Supplementary Fig. 1):

Thus, the normal vector to the plane is given by:

For simplicity we pick the plane normal vector as:

Using point 1 coordinates, we can find the equation of the plane:

Next, we determined the equation of a vectorcoming out of the mouse eye in the mouse head’s reference frame:Where a, b and c are the elements of a vector that determines the direction of the gaze andis the initial location of the pupil in the head frame (see Supplementary Fig. 2).

Overview of the proposed method for anisotropic stochastic dynamics of a coarse-grained membrane model.

a Schematic of a coarse-grained membrane model with the two leaflets resolved. For a membrane suspended in solvent, distinct membrane and solvent domains are designated. The local coordinate system describing the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, as well as the distributed boundary conditions and the fluid response are shown for a selected particle. b Schematic of the proposed method for handling anisotropic stochastic dynamics. c Three distinct idealized geometries used in the derivation of the fluid response: (i) single planar membrane, (ii) parallel planar membranes, (iii) spherical vesicle. The cell membrane of a human red blood cell can be considered to experience fluid responses approximated by a combination of the three geometries.

As the breakdown chart in Fig. 1b suggests, we use the Saffman–Delbrück model of the diffusion of cylindrical inclusions in fluid sheets to obtain the in-plane components,(Eq. (11)),. Other choices are also possible, provided that they are consistent with the macroscopic viscosity of the membrane (see “In-plane diffusion coefficient” under Methods section, and also ref.for a discussion on how to make this connection). However, there are no readily available descriptions of hydrodynamics yielding out-of-plane components,and. To derive numerical values for these components, we have developed semi-analytical solutions to the Stokes equations in select idealized geometries (Fig. 1b and c).

The underlying approach is to use Gaussian distributed velocity or stress boundary conditions as the test input, and numerically integrate the resulting fields over selected patches on the surface of the membrane, i.e. find the generated forces or displacements which describe the fluid response (Fig. 1a). For the simple case of a single planar membrane, we have found a closed form solution for,where, with α being a scaling parameter corresponding to the width of the Gaussians used as input, A p is the area per particle, and I 0 and I 1 are the modified Bessel functions of the first kind. The problem is not, of course, tractable for arbitrary geometries. However, based on the solutions presented in ref. it is possible to find numerical results specific to a membrane model, using the scheme depicted in Fig. 2a. We have derived the results for several prototypical membrane geometries, based on our previously developed membrane model (Fig. 2b),.

### Reliability and agreement of automated head measurements from 3-dimensional photogrammetry in young children [^632b272e]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Image Processing and Extraction of Occipitofrontal Circumference and Cephalic Index Measurements

The algorithm that was developed to extract the head measurements assumes the 3D image to be in a predefined reference frame. Therefore, aligning the 3D image data to a standard coordinate system that is consistent across different images is a crucial step. Details about the registration steps are provided in Supplemental Methods: Image Processing (Supplemental Digital Content 1,) Although finding an anatomically meaningful reference point based on surface data is not trivial, multiple reference frames have been defined in the literature.– The method presented in this study uses the plane going through the nasion and both tragi as an alternative to the commonly used orbitomeatal line, as the tragus is often easier to identify on 3D images than the outer canthus (particularly young in children). These landmarks are selected by the user and guide the global (initial) alignment. After alignment, an iterative search algorithm goes systematically through different axes in pursuit of local optima. The maximum head length is extracted by searching along axial slices. These slices are a function of 2 variables (coordinates) along a particular axis and can, therefore, be mapped as contour lines on top of the 3D image. These contour lines provide information about the steepness of slopes in a similar way to contour lines on topographic maps, which connect points of equal elevation. For our application, contour lines plotted along the y -axis [posterior (−) to anterior (+)] converge at 2 locations: one on the anterior and one on the posterior part of the head. The distance between these 2 optima is defined as the maximum head length. To improve the reproducibility of this method, searches are limited to orthogonal slices, meaning that the anterior and posterior optima points have to lie within a single plane that is parallel to the xy-plane defined in our reference frame, that is, any plane parallel to the plane going through the nasion and both tragi. The slice containing the maximum head length, referred to as the occipitofrontal (OFD) plane, is subsequently used to find the head width by searching for 2 optimum points on the parietal sides of the head. Vertical slices parallel to the yz-plane [left (−) to right (+)] converge at these points. The contour lines (in white) and optima (as red dots) are visualized in Figure 1.

### Transition from light diffusion to localization in three-dimensional amorphous dielectric networks near the band edge [^8a2b48c2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The network was illuminated with a broadband pulse of linearly polarized light with electric field vector parallel to one of the sides of the simulation box. The pulse bandwidth was sufficient to cover vacuum wavelengths between 1 and 7 μm corresponding to reduced frequencies. Perfectly matched layers (PML) were fitted at both ends of the simulation box and periodic boundary conditions were applied perpendicular to the wave propagation direction. The PML’s absorb all transmitted and reflected waves (regardless of incidence direction) and prevent them from re-entering the simulation box. The PML thickness was 7 microns, which ensured that all wavelengths shorter than this value were suppressed. The spatial resolution was equal to 20 pixels per μm. Convergence tests were performed to check the robustness of the simulation. It was verified that increasing the spatial resolution by a factor of two did not considerably influence the transmittance curves. Also the simulation time was selected in a way to yield robust results. By placing an additional monitor between the source and the network, we checked for flux conservation over the entire frequency interval of interest.

Numerical implementation of the SC theory of localization

In the self-consistent theory of localization, the standard diffusion equation is replaced by an equation where the diffusion coefficient is nonlocal both in the space and time domain. The renormalization of the diffusion coefficient accounts for the different return probability when interference effects are considered in the multiple scattering regime. We are considering a slab geometry and continuous wave illumination at a given carrier wave frequency. The simplified geometry, invariant in the plane parallel to the slab, leads to a set of SC equations for the diffusion constant dependence and the diffusion equation Green’s functionin the direction z perpendicular to the slab surfaces (lying between z = 0 and z = L). Here we work in reduced units, where all lengths are scaled by the mean free path ℓ. The diffusion coefficientis normalized by the Botzmann diffusion coefficient D B. Taking the Fourier transform in the x, y plane, parallel to the slab boundaries, we reach at the diffusion equation:

### A scaling law for random walks on networks [^54819821]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

As a second example, we present a symbolic dynamics analysis of the Lorenz attractor. Originally devised to model atmospheric convection, the Lorenz dynamics are given by a system of three differential equations:

where x, y and z are the variables, and σ, ρ and β are parameters controlling the dynamics. Lorenz’s observations of the complexity of its dynamics, which are neither periodic nor stable, lead to the birth of chaos theory. Figure 2e shows a trajectory of the system projected onto the xy plane, where two main loops in the trajectory are easily seen: a loop in the positive- x or right halfspace (R) and a loop in the negative- x or left halfspace (L). The field of symbolic dynamicsincludes widely used techniques for the qualitative description of continuous dynamical systems, including enumeration of possible paths and quantification of system complexity or entropy. As an example of a symbolic dynamics analysis, we numerically simulated a single very long trajectory of the Lorenz system, such that there were a total of 10 7 halfspace loops (either R or L). We then divided that trajectory into segments based on every time it passed through the region x =0, y <0, where the Lorenz system is just entering the right halfspace R. Each segment thus involves one or more loops around the right halfspace, a transition from the right to left halfspaces (through the region x =0, y >0), and then one or more loops around the left halfspace, before returning to x =0, y >0. Thus, a symbolic sequence describing a segment can be written as R m L n where m, n ≥1 indicate the number of right halfspace and left halfspace loops. We then analysed the empirical frequencies of different sequences. As shown in Fig. 2f, the empirical frequencies are not consistent with power law scaling. As in the baseball example, we asked whether a simple random walk model could explain the observed scaling. We posed the model shown in Fig. 2g, estimating the transition probabilities from our long simulated trajectory. Our theory predicts that the probabilities should scale as P r ∝exp(br 1/2), which is borne out by the plot in Fig. 2h. Moreover, the empirical slope of b emp =−0.3106 is quite close to our theoretical slope of b thry =−0.3443. Thus, we conclude that a simple random walk model can explain the observed distribution of qualitative dynamical sequences of the Lorenz system.

### Surgical technique for achieving implant parallelism and measurement of the discrepancy in panoramic radiograph [^7ff0ecd8]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article describes a surgical technique for achieving implant placement parallelism and presents an equation concept to predict the bone depth available for implant placement by measuring the discrepancy of the panoramic radiograph compared with a clinical situation in cases in which a wide edentulous area is present.

Materials and Methods

A surgical template with tube technique in combination with measurement of the vertical dimension of the mandible bone available for implant placement was used to treat 2 patients in whom 7 and 3 implants, respectively, were inserted in the lower and upper jaws.

Results

All implants were successfully implanted into their reliable positions. In regard to the position of an important area such as the inferior alveolar nerve and maxillary sinus, this predictive equation can provide an extra margin of security.

Conclusion

A partial denture surgical template technique with tube technique using a Coen's drill guide in combination with a mathematical equation to find the clinical-radiographic discrepancy can be used as an alternative method in placement guidance of dental implant insertions and its fixed prosthetic treatment planning in a wide edentulous area.

### Infrared photoconduction at the diffusion length limit in HgTe nanocrystal arrays [^a25b38de]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Electromagnetic simulation

Calculations have been achieved with Matlab library based on rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). The Maxwell equations are solved in each layer and interface conditions are applied to find the final solution of the whole structure. We considered incoming plane wave under normal incidence, either with transverse magnetic or transverse electric polarization, i.e. with the magnetic field or electric field parallel with the slits of the grating s, respectively. Grating is supposed to be invariant along y direction, and repeated infinitely along x direction with a period of 10 µm. Inputs needed for this simulation are the device structure and the optical index of the different materials (see Supplementary note 7).

Schrödinger equation resolution

To probe the effect of the electric field on the bandgap and wave functions, we solve the 1D time-independent Schrödinger equation in spherical geometry:Where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m * the effective mass profile, V (r) the energy band profile, E the eigen energy and ψ (r) the wavefunction. V (r) here accounts for a constant part, relative to confinement for which we add on top of which a linear contribution that mimic the effect of electric field. Using spherical geometry in presence of an electric field can only be valid in the regime where electric field is a small perturbation (e.F.R << E G), which actually corresponds to the operating bias range of our nanotrench electrodes. At large electric field, quantitative results become inaccurate but the charge localization effect remains valid. The equation is solved using a shooting method. Material input parameters are the effective masses of electrons (m* HgTe = 0.035 m 0,) and holes (m* HgTe = 0.5 m 0,) and the position of the valence band maximum of the two materials.

### Improved large tip angle parallel transmission pulse design through a perturbation analysis of the bloch equation [^80bce804]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Parallel transmission has emerged as an efficient means for implementing multidimensional spatially selective radiofrequency excitation pulses. To date, most theoretical and experimental work on parallel transmission radiofrequency (RF) pulse design is based on the small-tip-angle approximation to the Bloch equation. The small-tip-angle, while mathematically compact, is not an exact solution and leads to significant errors when large-tip-angle pulses are designed. Methods have been proposed to overcome the limitations of the small-tip-angle using regularized least-square optimization or optimal control algorithms. These methods, however, are based on further approximations to the Bloch equation or require the use of general purpose algorithms that do not capitalize fully on the dynamics of the physical model at hand. In this article, a novel algorithm for large-tip-angle parallel transmission pulse design is proposed. The algorithm relies on a perturbation analysis of the Bloch equation and it depicts the relationship between the excited magnetization, its deviation from the target pattern and the desired pulses. Simulations and experiments are used to validate the proposed method on a 7 T 8-channel transmit array. The results demonstrate that the perturbation analysis algorithm provides a fast and accurate approach for multidimensional large-tip-angle pulse design, especially when large acceleration factors and/or echo-planar trajectories are used.

### Phasor field diffraction based reconstruction for fast non-line-of-sight imaging systems [^c60b225b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fast phasor field diffraction

The main goal of this paper is to develop a fast 3D NLOS reconstruction method based on the RSD propagatorin Eq. (7). Multiple convolutional RSD methods have been introduced in the literature – and form the basis of our approach.

The RSD as defined in Eq. (4) can propagate the wave from an arbitrary surface to any arbitrary point x v. For fast implementation we constrain the operator to propagate the wave between two parallel planes. This allows us to work with two spatial dimensions. We introduce the scalar coordinates x c = (x c, y c, 0) and x v = (x v, y v, z v) and rewrite the RSD in Eq. (4) as follows:where the geometrical setup is illustrated in Fig. 2. Equation (8) considers two parallel planes with spacing z v in a Cartesian coordinate system. For this reason, the RSD notation changed fromfor the point x v toto indicate that the propagation holds for all points in the plane at distance z v from the relay wall. For a single frequency component Ω, the relation between the wavefrontat the camera aperture plane and the wavefrontat the virtual image plane is a two-dimensional spatial convolution with the 2D convolution kernel defined bywhere the factor α (x v, y v, z v) will be ignored during reconstruction. Note that the RSD in Eq. (8) needs to be calculated for each individual frequency component. Considering the virtual pulse illumination in Eq. (5), the wavefrontis a broad-band signal; its spectrum is a Gaussian centered around Ω C as shown in Eq. (6). For this reason, it is sufficient to consider the frequency range Ω ∈ [Ω C − ΔΩ, Ω C + ΔΩ]. Although the magnitude is not completely zero outside this interval, it is very small and can be neglected. The chosen range ΔΩ depends on the virtual illumination pulse bandwidth and thus on the pulse width parameter σ. Thus, applying Eq. (8) for the frequencies Ω ∈ [Ω C − ΔΩ, Ω C + ΔΩ] and subsequent inverse Fourier transform with respect to timeis equivalent to sending the designed modulated virtual illumination pulse wavefrontinto the hidden scene, capturing its reflection at the visible relay wall, and propagating it back into the scene or imaging it onto a virtual imaging sensor using a virtual lens. The relay wall functions as a virtual aperture. The outputin Eq. (9) depends on the time t, as each reconstruction point is illuminated only for a short period of time. Taking the absolute value ofin Eq. (9) and squaring it makes us arrive at a 4D reconstruction (cf. Eq. (7)). We can understand this reconstruction as a movie of a virtual pulse traveling through the hidden scene, as shown in Fig. 3. In this figure, a patch shaped as a 4 is being illuminated by a spherical wavefront coming from the illumination point on the relay surface.

### Exact invariant solution reveals the origin of self-organized oblique turbulent-laminar stripes [^7f18b4c1]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Wall-bounded shear flows transitioning to turbulence may self-organize into alternating turbulent and laminar regions forming a stripe pattern with non-trivial oblique orientation. Different experiments and flow simulations identify oblique stripe patterns as the preferred solution of the well-known Navier-Stokes equations, but the origin of stripes and their oblique orientation remains unexplained. In concluding his lectures, Feynman highlights the unexplained stripe pattern hidden in the solution space of the Navier-Stokes equations as an example demonstrating the need for improved theoretical tools to analyze the fluid flow equations. Here we exploit dynamical systems methods and demonstrate the existence of an exact equilibrium solution of the fully nonlinear 3D Navier-Stokes equations that resembles oblique stripe patterns in plane Couette flow. The stripe equilibrium emerges from the well-studied Nagata equilibrium and exists only for a limited range of pattern angles. This suggests a mechanism selecting the non-trivial oblique orientation angle of turbulent-laminar stripes.

### X-ray rheography uncovers planar granular flows despite non-planar walls [^d3c471a5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Next, both the real experimental and artificially generated radiographs are analysed by first dividing into 32 × 32 interrogation windows. For a given window, the auto- and cross-correlation functions are computed and, by solving a deconvolution inverse problem, used to calculate the probability density functions (PDFs) of in-plane displacements in that window (Fig. 3a). These PDFs give the distribution, along the path of the X-ray beam, of the in-plane velocities, which we discretise by taking equally spaced percentiles (Fig. 3b) into vectors of candidate velocities, considering the two planar components separately. For each window and component this tells us the different displacements perpendicular to the beam that occur through the direction of the beam, but does not give the relative out-of-plane position of each such component. An orthogonal scanning angle provides the additional information required to reconstruct a 3D map of the velocity component in plane with both detectors, by combining the two sets of candidate arrays. For example, scanning directions 1 and 2 (as shown in Fig. 1) are used for the vertical component. Given these two candidate arrays, the problem becomes a question of how best to consistently arrange the vectors in the internal grid. This may be thought of as a generalised Sudoku-style puzzle because we know the numbers that should be placed in each row and column but not how to arrange them. However, unlike a Sudoku problem, we are not given any filled-in cells to start the process, and the row and column information may not perfectly match each other. Nevertheless, it can be formulated into a simple optimisation problem, where one aims to minimise discrepancies between the two sets of observations, which we solve with a fast, constructive algorithm to find the arrangement of the two sets of candidate arrays. Taking the mean of these two vectors in each cell gives the output solution value. Note that the solution of this algorithm is not unique, being dependent on the order in which each internal grid point is calculated. This problem is overcome by computing several comparable solutions using different random paths through this grid and averaging over these values. The other two components of the velocity are reconstructed in the same manner by repeating with other pairs of scanning directions.

Calculation of LSA of the Anterior Corneal Surface and Whole Cornea

The LSAs of the anterior corneal surface and the whole cornea were calculated at 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 mm aperture diameters.For the convenience of data collation, the LSA calculation process can be transformed as follows.

Corneal asphericity was calculated as follows

Where x and y are the radii from the corneal apex, z is the distance from cornea to the XY plane, R is the radius of the curvature at corneal apex, and Q is the asphericity of the cornea.

A cross section of the corneal surface in the XOZ plane is shown in Figure 1. A single meridian on the corneal surface can be expressed as part of a conic curve.

According to Figure 3, the LSA of the whole cornea at the target optical zone can be calculated.

### Exact, time-dependent analytical equations for spiral trajectories and matching gradient and density-correction waveforms [^a4c9208e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2026). Medium credibility.

2.7 Moment nulling trapezoids

Designing a pair of trapezoids to null zeroth and first moments of a single gradient waveform is common; for spiral imaging, the design of “vector” trapezoid pairs that are played out in both in‐plane directions and are freely rotatable under gradient constraints has not been shown to our knowledge. We have developed a fast algorithm for joint design of this trapezoid pair, which reduces their total duration compared with those made using separate, single‐channel designs. Joint design ensures simultaneous nulling across both axes while maximizing gradient usage without exceeding system limits, resulting in more efficient and symmetric gradient waveforms. Using the notation illustrated in Figure 2, we define variables t a and t b to be the effective total duration (area divided by amplitude) of two trapezoids A and B, respectively, and the effective ramp time t r to be one‐half the actual ramp time. Defining M0 and M1 as the relative gradient moments at the end of spiral waveforms, we write matrix equations for the desired moments of the gradient waveforms and invert them, givingWe enforce these equations in the following iterative solution:

FIGURE 2 
Illustration of trapezoids used for pair‐wise design of M1 and M0 nulling with full rotational compatibility.

Step 0: Initialize with t ra = t rb = 0.5*Gmax/Smax, t a = 2 t ra, t b = t rb.

Step 1: Solve for gradient amplitudes, using Equations (19) and (20).

Step 2: Normalize A and B vector gradient amplitudes separately by factorsand, respectively.

Step 3: Solve for new trapezoid durations, using Equation (21).

Iterating these 3 steps converges on a solution quickly. One can modify this approach routine (see code) to account for nontrapezoid (triangular) waveforms.

### Non-additivity of molecule-surface van der waals potentials from force measurements [^8e13a69c]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

C 3 coefficients

We now turn to the determination of precise C 3 coefficients within the theoretical model given by equation (2). For a correct recovery of the (by definition asymptotic) C 3 values, it is crucial to exclude the z tip -interval where the height z mol of the lower end of the molecule above the surface (Fig. 1) is small and deviations from equation (3) are expected, due to Pauli repulsion, higher-order terms of the vdW multipole expansion, and the invalid point dipole approximation. To identify the minimal allowed z mol, we fit the experiments in intervals that start between z mol =3.5 and 7.0 Å (yellow regions in Fig. 3a) and end at the largest z tip values reached. We find that all fit parameters (Fig. 3b) and the fit quality s (inset of Fig. 3a) converge to a plateau for z mol ≥4.8 Å. Below this threshold, the fitted parameters depend strongly on the starting value of the fit region, with z 0 becoming unphysically small. The value of the threshold is consistent with calculations in the random phase approximation (RPA)(see Supplementary Methods). Fits for a starting value of z mol =5.3 Å are displayed in Fig. 3a, while Fig. 3c shows how the fit quality depends on the individual C 3,X values. For all three molecules, we find a clear minimum in s, for NTCDA at C 3,N =24.9 kcal mol −1 Å 3, for PTCDA C 3,P =25.9 kcal mol −1 Å 3 and for TTCDA C 3,T =28.0 kcal mol −1 Å 3. The respective data points are plotted in Fig. 4a.

### Generation of spatiotemporal acoustic vortices with arbitrarily oriented orbital angular momentum [^37273a33]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Direct rotation of spatiotemporal (ST) vortices in three-dimensional (3D) space

While previous studies on acoustic OAM have primarily focused on longitudinal and transverse OAM, it is essential to recognize that acoustic OAM can exhibit arbitrary orientations. To alter the direction of the OAM, we can directly rotate the wave packet carrying transverse or longitudinal OAM in 3D space. Here, we take the example of rotating a wave packet carrying longitudinal OAM. Considering a 45-degree rotation around the-axis of the acoustic pressure field described in Eq. (1) and setting, the rotated wave packet is expressed as:

The wave packet carrying longitudinal OAM is rotated without altering its propagation direction along the-axis. The intrinsic OAM carried by the tilted wave packet can be calculated using Eqs. (3)–(5) as, indicating that the OAM direction also rotates 45 degrees around the-axis. The 3D iso-intensity profiles, derived from both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements for the rotated wave packet, are illustrated in Fig. 3 a, b, including perspective, front, side, and top views. The direction of the OAM after rotation is indicated by orange arrows in Fig. 3a. From the three views, it is evident that there is a tunnel tilted at a 45-degree angle upwards relative to the-axis. This is because the singularity line is rotated from being aligned with the z-axis to a direction at a 45-degree angle to the z-axis. Figure 3 c, d presents the amplitude distributions in the,, andcross-sections passing through the center of the wave packet, and Fig. 3 e, f illustrate the corresponding phase distributions, based on both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Due to the rotation of the wave packet, the previously circular intensity distribution on theplane is now rotated onto a plane with a normal vector of. The tilted annular intensity distribution obtained after rotation exhibits an elliptical intensity distribution on both theandcross-sections, while the diagonal line with zero intensity in thecross-section corresponds to the tilted tunnel passing through the center of the wave packet, as illustrated in Fig. 3 c, d. The phase distribution in thecross-section exhibits an edge phase dislocation, corresponding to the transverse OAM component in the-direction, while the phase distribution in thecross-section manifests a helical phase dislocation, corresponding to the longitudinal OAM component in the-direction, as shown in Fig. 3 e, f. Here, only an example of a wave packet rotating 45 degrees around the-axis is shown. More generally, by controlling the direction and angle of rotation of the wave packet, the orientation of OAM can be precisely manipulated in the 3D space.

### Accelerating compressed sensing in parallel imaging reconstructions using an efficient circulant preconditioner for cartesian trajectories [^38854bb4]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

2.3 Split Bregman iterations

Solving Equation 3 is not straightforward as the partial derivatives of the‐norm terms are not well‐defined around 0. Instead, the problem is transformed into one that can be solved easily. In this work, we use Split Bregman to convert Equation 3 into multiple minimization problems in which the‐norm terms have been decoupled from the‐norm term, as discussed in detail in Refs. 14 and 24. For convenience, the Split Bregman method is shown in Algorithm 1. The Bregman parametersare introduced by the Bregman scheme and auxiliary variablesare introduced by writing the constrained problem as an unconstrained problem. The algorithm consists of two loops: an outer loop and an inner loop. In the inner loop (steps 4–11), we first compute the vector b that serves as a right‐hand side in the system of equations of step 5. Subsequently, the‐norm subproblems are solved using the shrink function in steps 6–8. Hereafter, the residuals for the regularization terms are computed in steps 9–11 and are subsequently fed back into the system by updating the right‐hand side vector b in step 5. Steps 4–11 can be repeated several times, but one or two inner iterations are normally sufficient for convergence. Similarly, the outer loop feeds the residual encountered in the data fidelity term back into the system, after which the inner loop is executed again.

The system of linear equations,in line 5 of the algorithm follows from a standard least squares problem, where the system matrix is given bywith right‐hand side

In this work we focus on solving Equation 4, which is computationally the most expensive part of Algorithm 1. It is important to note that the system matrixremains constant throughout the algorithm and only the right‐hand side vector b changes, which allows us to efficiently solve Equation 4 by using preconditioning techniques.

### A unique analytical solution of the white matter standard model using linear and planar encodings [^f12d8453]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

It is known that white matter modeling based on commonly used linear diffusion encoding is an ill-posed problem. We analyze the additional information gained from a double pulsed diffusion encoding.

Methods

Zeroth (spherical means) and second-order (harmonic powers) rotation invariant signal features are used to factor micro- and mesoscopic contributions. The b-value dependency up to second-order of the features form 6 nonlinear equations, which are analyzed.

Results

The 6 derived equations can be uniquely solved for all relevant biophysical parameters. No assumptions about the form of the mesoscopic contribution (fiber dispersion) is necessary. Under certain conditions the solution still shows a certain degeneracy which is inherent to model. It is further shown that a combination of second-order information from single and spherical diffusion encoding is not enough to solve the problem.

Conclusions

A combination of single and double pulsed diffusion encodings is sufficient to solve the full 3 compartment white matter model uniquely.

### Internal carotid artery in endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery [^a3764887]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The transsphenoidal approach to the pituitary is widely used in pituitary surgery. Even though there are some landmarks for internal carotid artery (ICA) on the wall of the sphenoid sinus, it is not rare to get the artery injured during surgery. We found that the most important landmark, carotid prominence, matched with ICA in merely 37.5% of subjects. In order to find a simple method to locate the artery, we made an anatomical measurement of the ICA and placed the results in a 3-dimensional coordinate system. The sphenoid sinus opening is both the center of the endoscope entry in the anterior sinus wall and the origin of the coordinate system containing 3 orthogonal axes: x, y, and z. The x axis follows the body of the endoscope(out of the sphenoid sinus) parallel to the sagittal plane while z is perpendicular to the sagittal plane. Most of the measurements were obtained in the initial operative plane, which is perpendicular to the sagittal plane and contains the sinus opening and the midpoint of the pituitary fossa. We calculated the coordinates of the midpoint of the pituitary fossa and 4 ICA-related points. The depth of an ICA and the distance between 2 ICAs are also helpful in locating ICA. According to our operation method, all the projective points of the medial edge of ICA on the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinus are lateral to the sphenoid sinus opening, and operating within 0-25 degrees medial to the endoscope body is believed to be safe from ICA injury.

### High-brightness scalable continuous-wave single-mode photonic-crystal laser [^372de56d]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Derivation of frequencies and radiation constants of modes A and C

The frequency and radiation constant (δ A, α A) of mode A, which has the lowest radiation constant among all four modes, and those (δ C, α C) of its counterpart mode C can be obtained by solving the following equation based on three-dimensional coupled-wave theory, :

The first and second terms on the right-hand side of equation (2) represent the Hermitian and non-Hermitian coupling processes described in Fig. 1c,d, respectively. The third term on the right-hand side of equation (2) represents the deviation of the wave number from the Γ point in an arbitrary direction represented by wave numbersand, which induces a change in the eigenfrequency of each mode.

Here, we consider the eigenfrequencies of the modes in the Γ–M direction, which is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the double-lattice photonic crystal (y = x). Based on the symmetry along y = x, the coupled-wave matrices on the right-hand side of equation (2) can be block diagonalized using the basis-transformation matrix P :

as

Then, the coupled-wave equation (2) can be divided into the following two forms:andwhere equation (5) gives the coupling between a pair of electric-field vectors R x + R y and S x + S y, which leads to the formation of modes A and C (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The frequencies and radiation constants of modes A and C can be then derived from equation (5) as follows:where δ A + i α A /2 of mode A and δ C + i α C /2 of mode C correspond to the negative and positive square-root terms, respectively, and R and I are defined asand, respectively.

Note on the threshold gain margin Δ α v

It is difficult to specify a general value of Δ α v sufficient for single-mode oscillation in PCSELs. However, we have found that increasing Δ α v by simultaneously reducing R and μ contributes to the preservation of single-mode oscillation even in the presence of a non-uniform in-plane refractive index distribution borne by various physical phenomena. These findings will be reported separately.

### Tracing multiple scattering trajectories for deep optical imaging in scattering media [^90a28522]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The matrix element in the i th row and j th column ofrepresents the electric fieldmeasured at a pointfor a unit-amplitude point source located at a point. Based on the model represented by Eq. (2), the matrix element can be expressed as:

Here,is the free-space Green’s functionof a single point source, which is a complex field of the spherical wave emanating from a point, observed at a point, andis the matrix elements of M, representing the electric field of all the multiply scattered waves (see Supplementary Section Inverse scattering model for the detailed derivation of Eqs. (2) and (3)).

Next, we elaborate on the key concept to identifyfrom the measured reflection matrix. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3) contains the object’s amplitude reflectance functionand the free-space Green’s function. In Fig. 7a, b, we illustrate the first term in Eq. (3) of the two electric fieldsandfor two different source positionsand, respectively. The two fields resemble each other, except for the center of the spherical phase profile and the overall phase retardation. After normalizing out the Green function in each field, we compute the field–field correlation to determine the relative phase retardations(Fig. 7b). The presence ofwith its magnitude much larger than the first term makes it difficult to findaccurately and gives rise to an error. As we shall explain below, the field correlation across the object plane raises the fidelity of finding, because the first term of Eq. (3) is coherently added with respect to the reference point at, whereasis incoherent in the estimation of the correlation. Thus, the fidelity is determined by the number of detection pixels in the object plane.

### Onset of meso-scale turbulence in active nematics [^253b0a4a]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

which includes the pressure P (ref.). The active contribution to the stress takes the form Π act =− ζ Q (ref.), such that any gradient in Q generates a flow field, with strength determined by the activity coefficient, ζ.

The equations of active nematohydrodynamics (equations (1, 2, 3)) are solved using a hybrid lattice Boltzmann and finite difference method. We model a two-dimensional velocity field and nematic director. While the director field can theoretically develop out-of-plane components, for active experiments and the parameter values used in this study, it does not move out of plane. Discrete space and time steps are chosen as unity and all quantities can be converted to physical units in a material-dependent manner. Simulations are performed with the parameters A =0, B =0.3, C =−0.3, Γ =0.34, K =0.04, λ =0.3, ρ =1 and μ =2/3, in lattice Boltzmann units. Parameter fitting of the continuum equations to physical active systems remains a topic of research; therefore, we consider a generic parameter set that has been shown to reproduce the active turbulent state observed in bacteria and microtuble/motor protein suspensions. With the largest observed average speed and vortex size, these parameters indicate a small Reynolds number Re≲ O (10 −1). Additional details can be found in refs,,,.

We use a channel with a height h =25 and length L =3,000. No-slip boundary conditions are applied to channel walls and periodic boundary conditions are used at the channel extremities. The results reported here are for strong homogeneous boundary conditions for the director field on the channel walls. In addition, we have performed simulations with homeotropic and weak anchoring boundary conditions and find that the transitions described in the main text are independent of the anchoring boundary conditions on the walls. To obtain sufficient statistics for the turbulence fraction (Fig. 4a), several instances (5–10) of each set of parameters with initially randomized fields are simulated. A warm-up of 3 × 10 5 time steps is allowed to reach the stationary state. Above the critical point, this produces sample sizes of ≳100 puffs.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^8ec71b12]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are geometric implications of using sequential Bayesian inference as coordinates for n -dimensional decision trajectories (Fig. 1 a, b). Although the decision trajectories have n probability-coordinates, P n, they are constrained such that ∑ i P i (t) = 1; therefore, the decision trajectories populate (n − 1)D simplices. For example, 2AFC decision dynamics are represented as a particle constrained to have P 0 (t) + P 1 (t) = 1, which is the 1D line P 1 = 1 − P 0 on a 2D (P 0, P 1) plot of the beliefs. It follows that 3AFC dynamics take place on a 2D plane (Fig. 1 a) and 4AFC dynamics in a 3D tetrahedron (Fig. 1 b) and so forth. Note that if any hypothesis has zero probability P i (t) = 0, then the space in which the decision trajectory evolves collapses to the remaining non-zero directions. For example, each face of the 4-choice tetrahedron in Fig. 1 b is a combination of three choices with non-zero probabilities and each edge a combination of two such choices.

As a result, decision boundaries are (n − 2)-dimensional objects in n -dimensional probability space. So for n > 2 choices, boundaries can have spatial dependence with respect to the decision space visualized in Fig. 1 a, b. For 2AFC tasks, decision boundaries are points on a 2D line, which are simply the transformed boundaries (equation 2) of the standard two-choice integration-to-threshold model. Likewise, for 3AFC, the decision boundaries are lines on a plane (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) and for 4AFC are planes within a tetrahedron (Fig. 1 a, dark gray planes). The example boundaries shown are flat with a constant decision threshold in each dimension. An interesting consequence is that high-dimensional boundaries can have a nonlinear structure as a function of the n -dimensional beliefs P. Then, the linear 3AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) generalize to curves and the planar 4AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 b, dark gray planes) generalize to curved surfaces.

In the first row, spatial distribution in the plane y = 0 of the index of stress associated to the heating induced by the magnetic field generated by a tubular gradient coil system during the application of a 3D FISP pulse sequence. The isotropic index (Equation [3]) and the anisotropic index (Equation [4]) for 3 implants with weighting coefficient estimated from the peak temperature increase after 900 s are reported. In the second row, for each implant, the correlation between the anisotropic index of stress and the peak temperature increase after 900 s is shown by evaluating them when the implant is located in the position denoted by the white circles in the color maps.

For each implant, the correlation between I aniso and Δ T max,900s computed by simulating the implant exposed to the actual non‐uniform magnetic field generated by the GC system when located in different positions is reported in Figure 7. For this analysis, the barycenter of each implant is moved in the plane y = 0 along the x ‐axis (from 0.025 m to 0.275 m in 0.05 m steps) at the quote z = 0.3 m. The reported plots put in evidence the linear correlation between the 2 quantities. The angular coefficients of the linear regressions with the 3D FISP pulse sequence are ∼1.8 mK/(T 2 /s 2), ∼0.9 mK/(T 2 /s 2), and ∼1.5 mK/(T 2 /s 2) for the hip, knee, and shoulder implants, respectively. When the EPI‐X pulse sequence is used, the coefficients are ∼2.0 mK/(T 2 /s 2), ∼1.1 mK/(T 2 /s 2), and ∼1.5 mK/(T 2 /s 2).

### Off-axis metasurfaces for folded flat optics [^1668cff1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To realize the off-axis-focusing metasurface reflector shown in Fig. 1a, a set of metagratings are optimized over the desired area of 2 × 2 cm 2 with a focal distance of 1 cm, resulting in a 90° × 90° angle-of-view or 110° diagonally. Up to this point, the work has investigated discrete positions along the metasurface’s0 cross-section, as seen in Fig. 2. To allow focusing in two dimensions, the surface-relief ridges are curved according to the grating equation generalized in spherical coordinates. Alternatively, the position and orientation of each element can be found by simply superimposing the electric field of an off-axis plane wave with a spherical wave centered at the desired focal distance. This second method is implemented to define the metasurface supercells’ pitch, position, and orientation. The metagratings are optimized by RCWA at 400 × 400 discrete points across the 2 × 2 cm surface under the assumption of an infinitely repeating supercell period at each position. This approximation is sufficiently accurate for large centimeter-scale metasurfaces given the slowly varying phase profile of a large parabolic mirror. The structure within each supercell is determined by the nearest optimized RCWA point, effectively creating 50 × 50 µm pixels where the optimized duty cycles are constant. These duty cycles are multiplied by the local pitch such that elements still vary in width across these rounded pixels. Figure 3a illustrates the resultant metasurface, though it is a scaled down 100 × 100 μm version to make the elements visible. This rescaling is achieved by analytically recalculating the grating pattern for a 50 μm focal distance and re-interpolating to the RCWA data. Upon inspection of Fig. 3a, the results of optimization are seen to produce an ensemble of all the metagratings building blocks previously explored in Fig. 2. Each element is denoted in order from light blue, dark blue, black, to red. The width of each element slowly varies with transitions occurring when the number of elements in a 2π phase-wrapped period changes. This is illustrated in the inset where the number of elements decreases from four to three. Figure 3b provides the simulated first-order diffraction efficiency of the metasurface as a function of position. The estimated mean efficiency is 95%, with a maximum of 98% and a minimum of 83%. A histogram of the efficiency distribution is included in Supplementary Fig. S3 of the Supplementary Information. In Fig. 3c, the diffraction efficiency is converted to normalized luminance in sRGB color space to illustrate the expected uniformity seen by the human eye. This is calculated using the CIE 1931 color matching function at 532 nm and converted from XYZ tristimulus values to sRGB color space values with gamma correction. These results demonstrate the design can achieve high diffraction efficiencies and uniformity for all output diffraction angles within the targeted NA.

### Phase transition in the cuprates from a magnetic-field-free stiffness meter viewpoint [^aed84cda]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

A method to measure the superconducting (SC) stiffness tensor [Formula: see text], without subjecting the sample to external magnetic field, is applied to La 1.875 Sr 0.125 CuO 4 . The method is based on the London equation [Formula: see text], where J is the current density and A is the vector potential which is applied in the SC state. Using rotor free A and measuring J via the magnetic moment of superconducting rings, [Formula: see text] at T→T c is extracted. The technique is sensitive to very small stiffnesses (penetration depths on the order of a few millimeters). The method is applied to two different rings: one with the current running only in the CuO 2 planes, and another where the current must cross planes. We find different transition temperatures for the two rings, namely, there is a temperature range with two-dimensional stiffness. Additional low energy muon spin rotation measurements on the same sample determine the stiffness anisotropy at T<T c .

### Higher-order quantum spin hall effect in a photonic crystal [^4ceab216]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Numerical simulations

We use commercial software: COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS to conduct all numerical simulations of our samples. In all simulations, we use 2D photonic crystals to mimic our sample. This is valid when we consider TM modes. For boundary conditions of the ribbon structure we used to obtain Fig. 2 b, we set the in-plane boundary parallel to the propagation direction as the perfect electric conductor (PEC) and the boundary perpendicular to the propagation direction as Floquet periodic boundary (see Supplementary Note 3). In simulating Figs. 2 e, f, 3 b, and 4 e, f, we use the scattering boundary condition for the boundaries parallel to the interface of two PCs.

In simulating Fig. 3 b, we find extra mid-gap states which are upper boundary states and irrelevant to our study. Therefore, we use an algorithm to eliminate those irrelevant states as follows: We take the upper boundary of the nontrivial region as an area of 18 a × 2.5 l, where a is the lattice constant andis the edge length of the unit cell. By defining the proportion of the boundary field in the whole region, the mode independent of the boundary can be selected. The filter condition is defined as ∫ edge ∣ E z ∣ 2 d s /∫ all ∣ E z ∣ 2 d s < 0.5. This ensures that in the eigenfrequency of Fig. 3 b in the main text, the edge mode at the upper boundary is naturally eliminated. For the calculation of pseudospins in Fig. 3 b, we first obtain the out-of-plane electric field and then directly calculate the corresponding in-plane magnetic field.

### 3D gradient echo snapshot CEST MRI with low power saturation for human studies at 3T [^2605501e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In step 2, the off‐resonance of the water pool in the initial 2‐pool model was used as a surrogate B 0 map, and Z‐spectra were shifted to correct for field shifts. These B 0 ‐corrected Z‐spectra were then spectrally denoised using principal component analysis (PCA), retaining 9 of 53 components (details provided in Supporting Information Figures S7 – S10).

For peak‐selective CEST evaluation, the Lorentzian difference method was used according to a previous work 5 (Equation (5)):

Here, Z fit,ref is the 2‐pool background fit, which was repeated on the B 0 ‐corrected and denoised Z‐spectra in step 3.

Finally, in step 4, a 3‐pool Lorentzian model was used to fit the MTR LD spectrum at offsets +10, +9, ±8, –7.5, ±7, –6.5, ±6, ±5.5, ±5, ±4.5, ±4.0, ±3.5, ±3.0, ±2.5, ±2.0, and ±1.5 ppm (those previously excluded from the background fit) to isolate the amide (+3.5 ppm), amine (+2.0 ppm), and NOE (–3.5 ppm) resonances (Equation (6)):

and (Equation (7))

All pool‐fitting parameters can be found in Supporting Information Tables S3 to S6. Quantitative maps were generated from the fitting parameter A x for the three CEST pools and the ssMT pool. All multi‐Lorentzian fitting was performed in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc. Natick, MA); code is available online at. The total postprocessing time, including B 0 estimation and correction, denoising, background signal removal, and CEST pool fitting on each 4D stack, was approximately 7.5 minutes using parallel computation on a 12‐core, 2.2‐GHz computer.

Region of interest (ROI) analysis of CEST effects was performed in gray and white matter segments of a single slice in each subject. Tissue segments were approximated by thresholding the ssMT pool map. Slices for tissue analysis were chosen to ensure similar tissue distributions in each subject. Coefficient of variation across subjects (standard deviation divided by the mean) was used to determine reproducibility of fitted pool sizes.

Common Volume Geometric Methods Used in the Clinic

Composite midpoint integration method

The commonly used composite midpoint integration method applies to parallel stacks of short‐axis image planes that, ideally, encompass the entire extent of the LV from the mitral valve annulus to the apex (Figure 1). The LVV is estimated by multiplying the observed cavity area on each slice, A, times the slice thickness, h, to get the volume contribution of each slice, and summing these over all slices (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1). This “stack of disks” approach is also commonly referred to as the Simpson's Rule; however, in mathematics the Simpson's Rule refers specifically to integration using quadric polynomials. 22 In this article, the in‐plane cavity area was computed numerically from the user‐selected LV endocardial contour, but in the clinic is often approximated from 1 or 2 user‐defined diameter measurements and a circular or elliptical model for the in‐plane area. A common variant implemented by Wyatt et al 17 models the most apical aspect of the LV as a hemisphere that emanates from the bottom half of the most apical slice (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1).

B (bottom), Gives a variant from Wyatt et al 17 intended to correct for curvature effects at the apex. The sum is over all slices except the apex, then adds half the apex volume plus the volume of a hemisphere of radius equal to half the slice thickness.

### Improving ultrasound-based prostate volume estimation [^4685ef84]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

New regression analyses were performed with the reduced cohort, using 0.66 and 0.52 as coefficients. Figure 2 c shows that the updated equation with 0.66 as the coefficient was improved to y = 0.9309x + 5.6897 with an R 2 of 0.64, compared to the analysis using the ellipsoid coefficient, which yielded an equation of 0.7278x + 5.1463 and an R 2 of 0.55 (Fig. 2 d), thereby demonstrating the superiority of 0.66 as the coefficient to better estimate prostate volumes using TRUS dimensions.

The second step was to assess the accuracy of our coefficient compared to the bullet formula, L x H x W × 5 π /24, as proposed by MacMahon et al. In Fig. 3 a, we repeated the same type of regression analyses using the bullet formula for the entire cohort (n = 153; as in Fig. 1 a). The equation generated was y = 0.8784x + 8.7483 with an R 2 value of 0.42. The Bland-Altman analysis was also performed (Fig. 3 b) as above, allowing removal of outliers, reducing the cohort to 138 prostates. The new regression analysis yielded an equation of y = 0.8867x + 7.1574 with an R 2 value of 0.60 (Fig. 3 c), a value closer to the one obtained in Fig. 2 c using 0.66 as a coefficient, but with a lower slope value 0.8784 for the bullet coefficient 0.65 vs. 0.9309 for the new coefficient 0.66.

Fig. 3 
Linear regression analysis of estimated vs. measured prostate volumes using the bullet formula (a) with the full cohort. b Bland-Altman plot for outlier removal when using the bullet formula. c Linear regression analysis of estimated vs. measured prostate volumes using the bullet formula with the updated cohort, after outlier removal. In (a) and (c), solid line represents the linear regression with a constant term. Dashed line represents the linear regression passing through the intercept

Altogether these findings suggest that our prostate-derived coefficient of 0.66 is more accurate than that of the ellipsoid formula (0.52) and slightly better than the coefficient of the bullet formula (0.65) in estimating true prostate volume.

Altering agonist pMHC density

For pMHC density measurements and prior to placing cells on SLBs, Alexa-647 labeled pMHC 9V on the SLB was subject to 3 × 10 s pFCS measurements using a 40x water objective (NA1.2; with 633 nm laser at 1% laser power). To alter the density of pMHC 9V, ceteris paribus, it was exchanged directly for pMHC null ; e.g. 0.5 ng/μl pMHC 9V and 9.5 ng/μl pMHC null becomes 0.1 ng/μl pMHC 9V and 9.9 ng/μl pMHC null. As the lower limit of detection for pFCS in this setup was ~1 molecule/μm 2, standard curves were produced to extrapolate densities below this. This was achieved by performing a four-point titration of density versus concentration. The three data points were measured above 1/μm 2 and were used to extrapolate the 4th lower density by assuming a linear relationship between density and concentration that passes through 0,0. The regression line equation could then be used to calculate concentration and density of agonist pMHC. For SLB1, the equation was Y (molecules/μm 2) =  132.6*X(concentration in ng/μl). For SLB1 + glycocalyx, the equation was Y (molecules/μm 2) = 327*X(concentration in ng/μl). For SLB1 + CD58, the equation was Y (molecules/μm 2) = 434.8 × X(concentration in ng/μl). For SLB2, the equation was Y (molecules/μm 2) = 185.5*X(concentration in ng/μl).

### Probing the symmetry of the potential of localized surface plasmon resonances with phase-shaped electron beams [^8bd12e9a]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The loss spectra collected using a conventional round aperture and the modified aperture are displayed in Fig. 3d. As can be observed, the two spectra display strong selectivity in agreement with the above arguments, with the imperfect selection being due to the finiteness of the collection angle.

To further explore and understand these results, a numerical simulation code was developed, based on integrating equation (5) with numerically simulated eigenmodes and beam profiles (see Methods). The resulting spectra (dashed lines in Fig. 3d) show the same type of selectivity as the experimental ones. The slight mismatch in the excitation energies is entirely expected, due to the simplified model used to represent the sample.

Further insight can be obtained by studying the effects of alignment and azimuthal angle between beam and particle. We simulated the transition probability induced by the dipolar mode of a 400 nm nanorod on our modified electron beam, for two different orientations of the probe, either parallel or perpendicular to the rod (reproduced in Fig. 4b,d). The simulations show that the transition probability for a beam centred on the particle will be maximized when parallel and vanish when orthogonal, allowing to directionally probe the plasmonic response in a manner similar to that of linearly polarized light and in agreement with the symmetry arguments shown in Fig. 1. When shifting the beam position (see Methods), the collected signal appears sensitive to directional variations in the plasmon's intensity. An experimental acquisition of the same maps, despite the artefacts induced by the beam's asymmetry and the slight error over the azimuthal angle, appear in good qualitative agreement. The map acquired with the probe oriented parallel to the rod, shows a central maximum and two side lobes (Fig. 4c), whereas the other one, acquired with the probe orthogonal to the nanorod, possesses a structure presenting a central minimum surrounded by four peripheral intensity lobes (Fig. 4e).

### Grain rotation mediated by grain boundary dislocations in nanocrystalline platinum [^1290c1ed]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Let us now consider the GB dislocations visualized in our HRTEM images, which are responsible for the in-plane rotation. Then, p is perpendicular to ρ. The Frank–Bilby equation can be written as:

Here, b is the edge component of the Burgers vectors, ~0.243 nm, and h is the average dislocation spacing. We can then compare the prediction by equation (2) with our experimental observation. From Fig. 3b–e, the measured average dislocation spacing is 0.9, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 nm, respectively. The calculated GB angle is correspondingly 15.5°, 11.6°, 8.7° and 7.0°, respectively, which is very consistent with the measured GB angles (15.1°, 11.2°, 8.5° and 7.2°, respectively). From Fig. 4b,c, the measured average dislocation spacing for GB 1–3 is 1.06 and 2.25 nm. The calculated GB angle is then 13.2° and 6.2° for GB 1–3, also close to the HRTEM measurements of 12.6° and 5.1°. For GB 1–4, the measured average dislocation spacing is 1.95 and 1.10 nm. The calculated GB angle is 7.1° and 12.7° for GB 1–4, consistent with the measured GB angle of 7.5° and 15.3° (see summary in Supplementary Table 4). It should be noted that for the above application of the Frank–Bilby equation, we only examine the dislocation Burgers vector perpendicular to the tilt GB plane, that is, the edge component of the Burgers vectors, because the screw component of the Burgers vectors cannot be detected and quantified in the HRTEM images. The edge component leads to the rotation, while the screw component (parallel to the GB plane) leads to tilt.

### Edge States and skyrmion dynamics in nanostripes of frustrated magnets [^e7f3bb35]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 1b shows three types of evanescent edge states induced by the easy plane surface anisotropy in one or more rows at the edges of the magnetic stripe. The type I edge state with collinear in-plane spin components is induced by K ′≤−0.434 in the first row; K ′=0 in the first row and K ′≤−0.808 in the second row induces type II state—the evanescent conical spiral state with the wave vector along the boundary (x direction) and the in-plane magnetization vector rotating around the z axis. K ′=−0.406 in the first row and K ′=−0.203 in the second row give rise to type III state, in which the in-plane magnetization vector shows fan-like oscillations around a fixed direction in the xy plane. Importantly, in all edge states the in-plane magnetization oscillates with the decaying amplitude along the y axis normal to the edge (Fig. 1c).

These oscillations are a characteristic property of frustrated magnets and the three types of edge states are generic. The origin of the oscillations can be understood by considering asymptotic of the in-plane magnetization vector, m ⊥ (x)∝e i q · x, deep inside the magnetic stripe. In the continuum limit,,

where the first two terms originate from the expansion of the exchange energy of a frustrated magnet in powers of q (a =(3 J 2 − J 1)>0, b =(9 J 2 − J 1)>0). This bi-quadratic equation with real coefficients has four solutions: ± q =±(q ′+ iq ″) and ± q *=±(q ′− iq ″). In the situation when modulated states are suppressed in the bulk, all four wave vectors have a nonzero imaginary part q ″. They can be grouped into two pairs according to the sign of q ″: (+ q ′+ iq ″,− q ′+ iq ″) and (+ q ′− iq ″,− q ′ − iq ″). One pair describes m ⊥ with an amplitude decreasing away from the upper edge and another pair describes the evanescent state near the lower edge. The real parts of the two wave vectors in each pair have opposite signs. The interference between the modulations with positive and negative q ′ leads to spin oscillations.

Profiles calculated using Eclipse AAA version 13.6 and measured using radiochromic film in an anthropomorphic skull phantom.

The parallel plate chamber signal relative to a 10 cm × 10 cm field was measured 9 times over a 15-day period. The mean ratio was 0.305, 0.363, and 0.421 with a standard deviation of 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.2% for leaf gaps of 1.6 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.6 mm, respectively. The slope of a linear fit to the relative signal was 0.116 per mm, a change of 32% per mm relative to the 2.1 mm gap. This result indicates that the parallel plate chamber is sensitive to changes in MLC gap width.

The dose rate measured using radiochromic film was 0.420 cGy/MU (range, 0.415-0.430) and 0.322 cGy/MU (range, 0.318-0.325) at 4 cm and 10 cm, respectively, corresponding to a TPR at 4 cm of 1.30. The dose calculated using these values and Equations 5 and 6 are shown in Table 3.

### Self-assembly of amorphous calcium carbonate microlens arrays [^47ebb7f2]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

The light path through an ACC microlens array and the focal length are characterized by confocal microscopy as shown in Fig. 3 (ref.). Figure 3c shows 11 spots corresponding to the light of a collimated laser beam focused at the back focal plane of the microlens array as shown in Fig. 3a. The beam waists at the focal plane of the microlenses were uniform in size and smaller than 1.2 μm (measured at full width at 1/e 2). The x – z plane images in Fig. 3b,d show the position of the chitosan coating at the surface of the microlenses in contact with the microscope coverslip and the converging light path at the back plane of the microlenses, respectively. To calculate the focal length of the microlenses, we measured their thickness by atomic force microscopy line scans and the distance from the back plane of the microlenses and the focused point (Supplementary Fig. S5). We measured a focal length of 7.2±0.3 μm. The focal length of the microlenses focusing in the glass coverslip was calculated using the relation,where R =3.1±0.2 μm is the radius of curvature calculated based on the geometry of 11 microlenses measured by atomic force microscopy line scans, and n glass and n ACC are refractive indices of glass (1.50) and ACC (1.58, taken from the measured value of 1.5791–1.5830 by Merten and group), respectively. Entering these parameters into equation (1), we find f =8.0±0.5 μm.

Visualizing a self-similar propagating ellipse

Figure 5a shows the geometry of an ellipse under the assumptions described above. The R (t) of the ellipse apex (the point of the ellipse farthest from the Sun along the ellipse central direction) is given by DBM. In this section, we derive equations for the ellipse semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b as a function of R (t), the inverse aspect ratio f and the half width λ. We use f = b/a rather than a r = a/b because it simplifies the following calculation. The equations

follow from the definition of f and the definition of angle β, which is the angle between the semi-major axis a and the normal to the tangent at point T (Fig. 5a). The location of T is the point of tangency on the ellipse for a line originating at the Sun. It can be easily seen that β = λ by checking the sum of the angles of the small orange triangle in Fig. 5a in relation to a larger triangle (not highlighted) containing the angles λ and η. The polar angle of the ellipse θ is given by a relationship from general ellipse geometry between β and θ. It is important to emphasize that we further construct the ellipse based on this particular value of θ, for which a line with distance r connects the ellipse center C to point T. Combining equation (2) gives a relationship for the polar angle θ based on known parameters,

From the law of sines on the large orange-shaded triangle in Fig. 5a we derive:

Angle α follows from the angles of the orange-shaded triangle, and distance r from the definition of an ellipse in polar coordinates:

The last equation can be rewritten with the definition of f as

Introducing α from equation (5) and the last equation for r into equation (4) then eliminates the unknowns (α, r) and expresses b in function of known variables:

Equations (7) are the final description of the ellipse parameters. The minor axis b of the ellipse depends on all known variables (R (t), f, λ) through θ and ω, from equations (3) and (6). The major axis a then simply follows from the definition of f in equations (2). The heliocentric distance of the centre of the ellipse is parameter c (Fig. 5b), closing the model equations necessary for visualizing the ellipse.

### Dioptric power and refractive behaviour: a review of methods and applications [^79929f12]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

With exclusion of the SCPD,the stereo-pair scatter plot (that is, the data points only) of figure 1A (using h -vectors) and 1b (using power matrices, F i where i =1:279 here) are the most fundamental graphical representation of dioptric power and assumptions of normality are not an issue with such representations (although SCPD assume data normality and are influenced by outliers). In figure 1C the axes are rotated to view along the scalar (spherical) axis (which advances towards the observer using an exo-posture during fusion). Effectively this orientation allows one to view the antiscalar plane (containing the two antiscalar axes with labels 5 J and 5 K here). This plane contains all possible powers that are antiscalar or Jacksonian (ie, JCC). Over the previous decade or two, many studies of refractive state have emphasised this plane using power vector t with axes J 0 and J 45 and equating this plane with astigmatism. This method, however, ignores the fundamental multivariate nature of refractive state and while this approach is not incorrect, astigmatism cannot be simply equated with antiscalarism (or antistigmatism) and one also cannot ignore the scalar components of power as is sometimes the case. Powers are either scalar (spherical) or astigmatic (anything that is not scalar including antiscalar powers) and they are respectively found on the scalar axis (with label 5 I, for example, in figure 1B or are located away from the scalar axis and are astigmatic. Antiscalar (or antistigmatic) powers are simply JCC found within a single plane within the infinite 3-space of all symmetric powers concerned (ie, a subspace of four-dimensional dioptric power space).

### EAE / ASE recommendations for image acquisition and display using three-dimensional echocardiography [^e19c9659]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Medium credibility.

Aortic valve assessment with three-dimensional echocardiography—A preliminary 2D multiplane biplane survey can be performed with and without color flow Doppler to identify mechanism, etiology, and severity of aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, and during real-time transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) a 2D image at either the 60° midesophageal short-axis view or the 120° midesophageal long-axis view should be obtained; after acquisition, when displayed en face, the aortic valve should be oriented with the right coronary cusp inferiorly. For focused wide-sector zoom or full-volume data sets, aligning the cropping plane parallel to the valve orifice results in a short-axis 3D image used for planimetry; the cutting plane can be moved to the LV outflow tract, the sinus of Valsalva, or the sinotubular junction to obtain respective cross-sectional areas, and cropping planes can be placed perpendicular as well as parallel to the aortic annulus to assess supravalvular and subvalvular anatomy for serial stenoses. With full-volume color flow Doppler, Color Doppler 3D TEE imaging should also be performed to detect the initial appearance of flow at the onset of systole, and these signals can be cropped at the valve level using a parallel plane to estimate the orifice area and the vena contracta. Clinically, three-dimensional echocardiography has been used to improve aortic valve area quantification with either planimetry or the continuity equation; three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) planimetered aortic valve area has been reported to be feasible in 92% of patients with correlation to 2D TEE planimetry and transthoracic echocardiography–derived continuity values, and three-dimensional TEE quantitative aortic valve areas were found to have better correlation to invasively measured aortic valve areas than 2D TEE values.

### The XZZX surface code [^8f6ac9c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

This structured noise model thus leads to two distinct regimes, depending on which failure process is dominant. In the first regime where, we expect that the logical failure rate will decay like. We find this behaviour with systems of a finite size and at high bias where error rates are near to threshold. We evaluate logical failure rates using numerical simulations to demonstrate the behavior that characterises this regime; see Fig. 6 (a). Our data show good agreement with the scaling ansatz. In contrast, our data are not well described by a scaling.

The data fit the former very well; for the latter, the gradients of the best fit dashed lines, as shown on the inset plot as a function of, give a linear slope of 0.61(3). Because this slope exceeds the value of 0.5, we conclude that the sub-threshold scaling is not consistent with. b Logical failure ratesat modest bias far below threshold plotted as a function of the physical error rate p.

Analysis of kinetic data

For fluorescence anisotropy titrations: anisotropy was calculated, as described below, based upon established procedures,,,.

Total fluorescence intensity (F t) is given by:

Total anisotropy (A t) is given by:Where c i is the concentration of species i, F i is the fluorescence intensity per unit of concentration and A i is the anisotropy. This is calculated from the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence intensity (I) in relation to the plane of excitation by:

As anisotropy is additive for multiple fluorescence species in solution, it is used to give a measure of their relative concentrations. For MVI (and various constructs) there are two fluorescence species, DNA and MVI.DNA. The total anisotropy can then be calculated in terms of the dissociation constant (K d) for the MVI.DNA complex:where

And where [MVI] t and [DNA] t are the total concentrations for each reactant. [MVI.DNA] is the concentration of the protein-bound DNA complex. Q is the fluorescence intensity of MVI.DNA relative to DNA. The anisotropy data were fitted to obtain dissociation constants based on the above equations using GraFit fitting software.

For the FRET titrations: the 575 nm intensity data were corrected for the increase in intensity due to a small direct excitation. This background signal was subtracted from the dataset to leave the FRET values. The titration curves for the MVI TAIL interactions were fitting to a binding quadratic equation:

For lipid titrations: curves were fitted to a 1 site plus background equation:

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^d73719c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 2 
Comparison between phase gradient maximization and field minimization to obtain phase singularities.

Both methods can be used to obtain phase singularities, but they produce different field behavior in terms of its real (blue) and imaginary (red) zero-isosurfaces. Yellow dots label the positions at which the field and phase gradients are optimized. Inset surface plots are the logarithmically scaled field intensities at z = 0 μm over the same XY domain. The z = 0 μm plane is indicated with the gray plane in each isosurface plot. a When the phase gradient in a specified direction is maximized, the two zero-isosurfaces align approximately tangentially and in the direction normal to that specified gradient. This produces a flat low field intensity structure along these aligned zero-isosurfaces. b Minimizing the field amplitude at a point to produce a singularity merely enforces a crossing of the zero-isosurfaces without any alignment, producing a 1D line singularity. c Simultaneously optimizing two nearby points with directed phase gradients can extend the range of the singularity sheet. d Minimizing the field amplitude at two points simultaneously does not guarantee alignment of the zero-isosurfaces and can instead produce multiple crossing lines, each producing a 1D line singularity.

### Three-dimensional wave breaking [^10c24ed3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

3D ‘global steepness’

We now introduce a measure akin to the global steepness that accounts for the effects of directional spreading. For directionally spread (3D) linear waves, the surface slope has two orthogonal components:andThe directions in which waves propagate affect how they contribute to the total surface slope. When calculating S in equation (4), which corresponds to the maximum possible 2D linear slope (M = 1 and θ = 0), the phase argument in equation (5) is ignored. A similar approach may be used to calculate a 3D equivalent of S :For broadbanded spectra, the slope maxima of each component are not necessarily colocated in space. As a result, the 3D global slope S 3D can be quite different from the maximum achievable slope for a linear focused wave group. Thus, we did not use S 3D in ‘Results’. To calculate the linear maximum achievable slope, we searched for the time and position at which the absolute slope was a maximum for a focused wave group based on each directional distribution. Extended Data Fig. 2 demonstrates how two focused wave groups with the same global steepness S can have different waveforms and local slopes (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). The wave group in Extended Data Fig. 2a is unidirectional, whereas the wave group in Extended Data Fig. 2d is an axisymmetric standing wave.

Local steepness

Local measures of steepness, unlike the global steepness, implicitly capture the effects that nonlinear evolution and directionality may have on the waveform of steep waves. As a result, such measures may provide better descriptions of the free surface elevation at breaking onset for any given wave. The local steepness has various forms for which either a locally measured wave amplitude a or a height H (Extended Data Fig. 2) are non-dimensionalized using a chosen length scale, which is most commonly the wavelength λ (a k and k H /2, where k = 2π/ λ). The choice of length scale and the manner by which it is calculated (in space or time) have significant implications for the resulting measure of steepness. In highly spread conditions, even if highly resolved spatial measurements of surface elevation are available, the wavelength and other length scales become ill-defined. Even in 2D, where some of the aforementioned issues are resolved, the local steepness is not always a robust indicator of breaking onset. As a result, we have not used local steepness parameters herein.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^f5d9ba0e]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Algorithmic Solution in 1D

The cyclical nature of the grid representation within each module i is such that an activity bump at phase p i implicitly represents an infinite set of “unwrapped” phases p i + 2 πn i, where n i can take any integer value, corresponding to an infinite set of distances s i (p i /2 π + n i) along that 1D axis that are separated by the scale s i of module i. Initially, we assume that all phases are zero at the current location a and the distance d to a goal location b must be inferred from the grid cell representation across modules at that location { p i (b)} = { p 1 (b), p 2 (b),…, p M (b)}. The grid representation of the goal location b is such that there is a set of unwrapped phases (one for each module) that explicitly represent the same distance—i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

Graphically, this coherent set of unwrapped phases across modules falls on a horizontal line when plotted against a y axis of represented distance (i.e. y = d ; Figure 4 A) or, equivalently, on a straight line through the origin when plotted against a y axis of phase against inverse grid scale (Equation 2 ; Figure 4 B)—i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

This latter relationship is obtained by re-arranging Equation 1 and corresponds to the Fourier shift theorem (see discussion of the Algorithmic Solution in 2D below;). Thus, the distance d to a goal location represented by the set of module phases { p i } can be inferred by fitting a straight line through the origin on a plot of unwrapped phases p i + 2 πn i against inverse grid scale 1/ s i across modules (Figure 4 B). Moreover, this result can be generalized to any pair of arbitrary current and goal locations on that 1D axis, by replacing the absolute phase p i at the goal location with the phase difference Δp i between grid cell representations of current and goal locations in each module (Equation 3):

### High-density magnetoresistive random access memory operating at ultralow voltage at room temperature [^dd32ca57]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

By further introducing the dipole coupling between the Ni-free layer and its upper reference layer (equation (4) in Methods section), the thickness-dependent E -induced magnetization switching in the Ni-free layers are plotted in Figure 2a. As shown, bistable magnetization states are exhibited at E =0, for example, m x =0.9538 and 0.0364 for the 64×64×35 nm 3 Ni-free layer, corresponding to a magnetization rotation of about 70°. This is also directly illustrated by their magnetic vector diagrams shown in Figure 2b. Moreover, the magnetization– E curves become gradually flatter with the film thickness decreasing from 35 to 5 nm, along with a small increase in the maximum magnetization rotation around 5°. This can be attributed to the suppression of the out-of-plane magnetization component due to enhanced demagnetization in thinner magnetic thin films, which would in turn facilitate the in-plane magnetization rotation. The larger magnetization rotation further leads to a broader resistance change of the spin valve, as the device resistance is determined by the relative magnetization alignment, analytically expressed as,

Here R 0 denotes the device resistance with parallel magnetization configuration in the reference and free layer, and R MR the maximum magnetoresistance ratio, that is, the relative device resistance change between the parallel and antiparallel magnetization alignments. For illustration, R MR is taken as 7% for a normal spin valvewith giant magnetoresistance effect. Corresponding to the greater magnetization switching, increased maximum resistance changes are exhibited as indicated in Figure 2c. This may suggest the first design principle of such voltage-write MRAM device: the thinner, the better. However, growing ultrathin films requires more sophisticated processing control. Besides, the interface magnetic anisotropy contribution may lead to additional effect on the magnetization switching, especially in ultrathin (several monolayers) films, but is not considered herein regarding the robust magnetoelastic coupling of Ni as well as the large piezoelectric response of PMN-PT, which should in principle produce a large strain-mediated magnetoelectric response. Nonetheless, based on the results in Figure 2, 5 nm could be a well-compromised thickness for metallic Ni-free layer deposited on the PMN-PT. In particular, the actuation electric field required for the MRAM device is ultralow, that is, | E |<0.2 V μm −1 (Fig. 2c).

### AI-based screening for thoracic aortic aneurysms in routine breast MRI [^ec554f35]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Additional preprocessing

As a first step to the calculation, the provided segmentation is resampled to isotropic spacing (using its original minimum spacing in all dimensions, i.e. 0.85 mm on the preprocess images). Each axial slice is processed if needed to keep only the two largest segmentation components, which are most likely to belong to the aorta. Binary closing and hole-filling operations are also performed on the segmentation.

Centerline determination

A mirroring operation is performed on the segmentation in the z -direction, which helps extend the resultant centerline to the edge. The centerline is calculated with the skeletonization operation, and centerline points that have overlap with the original segmentation (excluding the mirrored parts) are kept. The Dijkstra algorithm is applied to ensure that a single continuous line is kept. Finally, to reduce processing overhead, we remove centerline points that are within 2 mm of other points. This process is repeated for each unconnected segment of the segmentation. For small segmentation parts of height < 25 mm, typically resulting from the aortic arch being outside the field-of-view and the ascending aorta being a separate segment, a simpler process is followed instead, where the segmentation is eroded only in the x and y dimensions, until a centerline remains.

Plane selection

In order to define a plane for each centerline point, a normal vector needs to be calculated. For each point, we calculate the normal vectors defined by the current and the previous point, alongside the one defined by the current and the next point, and average them at each dimension (point order is dictated by the Dijkstra algorithm). This process is repeated for the 3 previous and 3 next centerline points (if they are within 1 cm), and the final normal is averaged across all calculated normal vectors. For each defined plane, 27 different small variations are tested (by shifting the normal vectors by [− 15%, 0, + 15%] at each direction), and the combination that leads to a segmentation with the highest circularity is kept. If no combination resulted in an acceptable circularity, then the plane is discarded (circularity threshold: 85% or 75% if the plane normal in the z -direction is ≤ 0.5, to account for the less circular shapes in the z -direction due to the larger slice thickness).

Performing the Dynamic Distortion Correction

From Eq. (5), the resulting map of local phase changes associated with each time point i can be scaled from radians to a change in B 0 field, ΔΒ 0 i in Hz by dividing by the echo time, TE, of the EPI volume, and a value of 2π since the phases are given in radians (i.e. ΔΒ 0 i = Δ ϕ correction i /(2π TE)). ΔΒ 0 i must be divided by the bandwidth per pixel in the phase‐encode direction, BW PE, to give the relative distortion in voxels, resulting in a voxel displacement map (vdm):Each vdm i describes the voxel displacement in the phase encode direction caused by the change in field at each voxel in the distorted image i with respect to the space of the first image. To calculate the field required to correct for the relative distortion between each image and the first in the time series, the vdm i must be inverted. For this inversion procedure, the forward mapping gives us x′ = f (x) for each value x on a regular grid, where x is a 1‐dimensional column in the phase encode direction. The inverse mapping yields x = f −1 (x ′) for each value x ′ on a regular grid. It is calculated by, for each value x ′, finding the first x i so that f (x i) > x ′ and then finding x by linear interpolation between f (x i −1) and f (x i). This is a valid procedure as long as f (x) is monotonously increasing, which is the case in general. When it is not, i.e. when the off‐resonance field changes very rapidly over space (compared with the effective encoding gradient strength), there will be almost total signal loss in the gradient echo EPI images, so the displacement of the nonexistent signal will not matter. Finally, at each time point i, the original distorted image can be distortion corrected to the space of the first image by resampling distorted image voxels at new locations along the phase encode direction according to the values in the vdm i [Hutton et al. 2002 ; Jezzard and Balaban, 1995].

FIGURE 4 
A, A region contours of constant Bz for Y gradient coil, with (red) and without (black) E max optimization, showing that gradient distortion is virtually identical despite the peak E‐field being reduced by a factor of 2.8 for the Y coil. B, Difference in the B y components of the gradient field with versus without E‐field optimization. Values are normalized to the gradient strength yielding units of length (mm) and show a highly uniform concomitant y‐directed field added to the optimized (asymmetric) solution. C, Wire pattern representing the difference between optimized (asymmetric) and nonoptimized (symmetric) solutions with same current scaling as Figure 3. Similar results are obtained for the X gradient coil

The key difference between the E‐field minimized and nonminimized solutions is the addition of a uniform concomitant B 0 field component in the x or y direction. Figure 4B shows a difference plot of the concomitant B y field, normalized to gradient strength (units of millimeters), which is responsible for the reduction in E‐field. Figure 4C shows the winding that would need to be added to the Y symmetric coil (Figure 3B) to obtain the winding pattern of the Y asymmetric coil (Figure 3D), and shows the fundamental difference between the two solutions. The winding in Figure 4C produces a uniform field transverse to the main B 0 field, resulting in a concomitant component with additional magnetic stored energy. Conceptually, this can be thought of as a second coil, which if activated, converts the symmetric coil into an asymmetric coil with reduced E‐field but otherwise identical distortion. The added concomitant field in Figure 4B is highly uniform with a 0.85% variation over the 26‐cm imaging region, resulting in minimal distortion of the desired gradient field; this concomitant field can be compensated with a phase/frequency offset correction by the scanner. Figure 4B shows that the average concomitant field of 88.5 mm within the imaging region can be directly compared with the z 0x defined by Meier et al, 29 in which a value of 127 mm was reported for an asymmetric head gradient. The z 0x for both the ESP and HG2 gradients are approximately 120 mm 30 ; these are both fully asymmetric designs (single eye per half coil with all return currents flowing above the head), similar to the original concept defined by Roemer. 12 The X coil of Figure 3 requires a smaller concomitant field (z 0y = 57.8 mm) than the Y coil, reflecting a decreased need to pull E‐field off the torso region due to the smaller extent of the body in the anterior–posterior direction.

Algorithm description

Here, we give a simple, nonoptimized variant of the algorithm (see flowchart in Supplementary Fig. 2). Better implementations can be devised, for example with better fitting routines, however the description below is easier to follow and works well. Given a SAT problem, we first determine the b parameter as described previously. Step 1: initially we set, Γ min,,=and t max. Unless specified otherwise, in our simulations we used Γ min = 100, Γ max = 2 × 10 6, t max = 50. Step 2: to initialize our statistics, we run Γ min trajectories up to t max, each from a random initial condition. For every such trajectory ω we update the p (E, t) distributions as function of the energies of the orthants visited by ω. We record the lowest energy value found. Step 3: starting from Γ = Γ min + 1 and up to Γ max, we continue running trajectories in the same way and for each one of them check: (a) If, set, update p (E, t) and go to Step 4. (b) If Γ just reached, go to Step 4. (c) If Γ = Γ max, output “Maximum number of steps reached, increase Γ max ”, output the lowest energy value found, the predictedand the quality of fit for, then halt. Step 4: using the p (E, t) distributions, estimate the escape rates κ (E) as described in the corresponding Methods section. Step 5: the κ (E) curve is extrapolated to the E − 1 value obtaining κ (E − 1) and then using this we predict(as described in another Methods section). Further extrapolating the κ (E) curve to κ = 0 we obtain(see the corresponding Methods section). Step 6: we check the consistency of the prediction defined here as saturation of the predicted values. We call it consistent, ifhas not changed during the last 5 predictions. If it is not consistent yet, we continue running new trajectories (Step 4). If the prediction is consistent, we check for the following halting conditions: (i) Ifthen we decide the global optimum has been found:and skip to Step 7. (ii) If the fitting is consistently predicting(usually it is very close,) we check the number of trajectories that has attained states with, i.e.=. If it is large enough (e.g. >100), we decide to stop running new trajectories and setand go to Step 7. (iii) Ifthen we most probably have not found the global optimum yet and we go to Step 4. We added additional stopping conditions that can shorten the algorithm in case of easy problems, see Methods corresponding section, but these are not so relevant. Step 7: the algorithm ends and outputs,,values, the Boolean variables corresponding to the optimal state found, along with the quality of fit.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^e39d4c0f]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

AIUM ultrasound-guided procedures—needle guidance techniques—describe in-plane and out-of-plane approaches as follows: In the in-plane approach, the needle is advanced parallel to the long axis of the transducer so the needle shaft and transducer are colinear; it can be performed freehand or with a needle guide and is often preferred because the needle tip and shaft are visualized throughout the entire procedure. Needle conspicuity during the in-plane approach is primarily dependent on the angle with the transducer face, and a larger angle renders the needle less conspicuous; this can be managed by planning a shallower trajectory or using a heel-toe maneuver to bring the transducer face into a more parallel arrangement, and an oblique standoff maneuver may also be used to increase needle-transducer collinearity and may be particularly useful in superficial regions with little subcutaneous tissue. For the out-of-plane (short-axis) approach, the needle shaft is perpendicular to the long axis of the transducer so the ultrasound beam depicts a cross section and the screen shows an echogenic dot that may represent either the shaft or tip; in clinical settings, the clinician would keep the transducer over the needle tip using techniques such as the “walk-down” maneuver.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

The dashed line gives the lateral beam shift for an ideal spaceplate (i.e. Δ x = −(R − 1) d sin θ) with the same thickness d and compression factor R as the spaceplate in a. The uniaxial birefringent crystal acts as a perfect spaceplate for all measured angles of incidence.

We next experimentally investigate the transverse displacement of a beam incident on a uniaxial spaceplate. This effect is central to the spaceplate’s application, since it also applies to rays in the standard ray-tracing-based design of lens systems. In order to test whether a uniaxial spaceplate is inherently limited in numerical aperture, we vary the angle of incidence θ of the beam with respect to the normal of the calcite interface. For each angle, we record the beam’s lateral displacement (indicated by Δ x in Fig. 1a) upon exiting, shown in Fig. 3b. The observed displacement Δ x (red data) is equal to the ideal displacement of a beam traveling through d eff of the linseed oil at angle θ (dashed theory curve). Consequently, the uniaxial spaceplate is found to perfectly reproduce the free propagation displacement for all measured angles, i.e. up to θ = 35°, corresponding to NA = 0.85 in oil.

### The snm procedure guideline for general imaging 6.0 [^0e7310d4]. SNMMI (2010). Medium credibility.

SNM Procedure Guideline for General Imaging 6.0—field uniformity testing for scintillation cameras states that field uniformity should be tested each day a scintillation camera is used, using a solid- or liquid-filled uniform flood source to evaluate system (collimator on) uniformity; an acceptable alternative is to remove the collimator and produce an image using a distant (5 times the maximum detector dimension) point source, and the point source must be on the central axis. For planar imaging, images for small-field cameras must contain at least 1.25M counts, large-field circular, 2.5M counts and large rectangular field cameras, 4M counts, and all imaging parameters and the technologist’s initials should be recorded.

### AIUM practice parameter for the use of ultrasound to guide vascular access procedures [^c1f260c3]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In-plane (long-axis) versus out-of-plane (short-axis) visualization—Using basic B-mode imaging, the orientation of the ultrasound image may be described relative to the needle or to the vessel, and when the plane is parallel to the needle it is referred to as “in-plane,” whereas when it is perpendicular it is considered “out-of-plane,” with in-plane visualization showing the ultrasound plane longitudinal or long axis to the vessel and out-of-plane showing the vessel in the transverse or short axis. In- and out-of-plane are the preferred terms for describing the relationship of the ultrasound plane to the needle in ultrasound-guided procedures. For vascular access using an out-of-plane approach, the vessel should appear in the short axis as an anechoic circle with the needle visualized as a hyperechoic point, and care must be taken to “fan” the plane along the needle to track the tip and avoid underestimating tip depth, with a helpful technique being the “vanishing target” sign. While the in-plane view allows visualization of the entire needle shaft and tip, it may be more difficult to keep the plane in line with the vessel; the in-plane approach may be easier and more appropriate in larger vessels such as central veins when knowing the tip location is crucial, although with experience and care the out-of-plane approach is adequate and sufficient, and the out-of-plane, short-axis approach may also be used when the space available for the transducer footprint does not allow for the in-plane, long-axis view, ie, in patients with a short neck or when devices or structures are in the way of the beam.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^352c3afb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered phase-singularity sheet

As a proof-of-concept for singularity sheet engineering, we design a 2D phase-singularity sheet with a heart-shaped cross-section (Fig. 3). The heart-shaped singularity is centered at z = 10 mm and is designed for the scalar field associated with the x -polarized electric field at λ 0 = 532 nm emitted from a 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm patterned aperture. The paraxial scalar field approximation (qualitatively supported by the propagation distance to the target plane being much larger than the aperture size) is justified by a full vectorial propagationof the electromagnetic fields, which shows that the time-averaged energy density associated with the y (transverse) and z (axial) polarization components over the volume of interest is much smaller (in this case, <0.05%) than that of the x -polarization. The sheet singularity is constructed by maximizing the phase gradient in the directions oriented normally to a heart-shape at the target z = 10 mm plane. The free parameters are the propagation phase delay (from 0 to 2 π) at each pixel on the patterned aperture located at z = 0 mm. The optimized phase pattern is shown in Fig. 3b and does not exhibit any discernible long-scale pattern apart from a series of concentric rings, which appear to apply a focusing effect. Figure 3a shows a field intensity isosurface of the singularity profile to depict its orientation in 3D space (real and imaginary zero-isosurfaces are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 3), along with the locations and directions at which the phase gradient maximization was performed. This surface represents the points at which the phase gradient is very large, nearly reaching 100 times the wavenumber k 0. Simulated cross-sectional intensity and phase plots at the z = 10 mm plane are depicted in Fig. 3d, g, respectively. There is a visible phase jump of π radians across the singularity boundary as the field changes sign. The phase profile is in fact continuously differentiable with a well-defined phase gradient and just achieves a large gradient value at the singularity boundary. In Fig. 3c, we plot this phase gradient magnitude |∇ ⊥ ϕ | 2 = (∂ x ϕ) 2 + (∂ y ϕ) 2 profile alongside the intensity and phase profiles for the linear cut indicated in Fig. 3d. These profiles are qualitatively similar to those of a transverse cut through the singular optical axis of a fundamental LG 0,1 vortex beam of the same wavelength (with a beam waist diameter equal to the diagonal of the 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm square aperture), which are plotted using dotted lines in Fig. 3c. The transverse phase gradient over the transverse plane is plotted in Supplementary Fig. 4. This phase gradient achieves large magnitudes near the heart-shaped boundary and even exceeds k 0 by an order of magnitude, thereby exhibiting superoscillatory behavior. The longitudinal behavior of this cut profile with z is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 5, which shows that |∇ ⊥ ϕ | exceeds k 0 for a superoscillatory region ~150 μm in front of and behind the target z = 10 mm plane. The characteristic depth of this singularity sheet using this superoscillatory region is thus around 300 μm. The depth of a singularity sheet can be extended by maximizing the phase gradient over more than one transverse plane. We also exhibit additional phase-singularity sheet shapes (flat sheet and double-walled cylinders) in Supplementary Fig. 6 to demonstrate the versatility of this algorithm.

### Two-dimensional phase cycled reconstruction for inherent correction of echo-planar imaging nyquist artifacts [^57a3dda9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The inconsistency of k-space trajectories results in Nyquist artifacts in echo-planar imaging (EPI). Traditional techniques often only correct for phase errors along the frequency-encoding direction (one-dimensional correction), which may leave significant residual artifacts, particularly for oblique-plane EPI or in the presence of cross-term eddy currents. As compared with one-dimensional correction, two-dimensional (2D) phase correction can be much more effective in suppressing Nyquist artifacts. However, most existing 2D correction methods require reference scans and may not be generally applicable to different imaging protocols. Furthermore, EPI reconstruction with these 2D phase correction methods is susceptible to error amplification due to subject motion. To address these limitations, we report an inherent and general 2D phase correction technique for EPI Nyquist removal. First, a series of images are generated from the original dataset, by cycling through different possible values of phase errors using a 2D reconstruction framework. Second, the image with the lowest artifact level is identified from images generated in the first step using criteria based on background energy in sorted and sigmoid-weighted signals. In this report, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method in removing Nyquist ghosts in single-shot, segmented and parallel EPI without acquiring additional reference scans and the subsequent error amplifications.

### A first-principles phase field method for quantitatively predicting multi-composition phase separation without thermodynamic empirical parameter [^2b0639f2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Since a 3D model with those parameters determined by first-principles calculations can be used for constructing a more realistic model, we performed 3D simulations for some of the alloy compositions by taking a smaller system size of 40 × 40 × 40 grid points, using the same simulation parameters as in the 2D simulations. The initial structure consists of two seeds in a uniform matrix of the alloy. The resulting microstructures (shown in Fig. 7) are very similar to the ones obtained in the 2D simulation even for the spatial scale of the resulting patterns. This suggests that the 2D simulations are good enough to reproduce the real microstructures. Using this model, we confirmed that the resulting PFM works well giving the reliable time evolution of microstructures for various compositions with no empirical parameter in the thermodynamic part of the model.

Fig. 7 
3D simulations with (40 × 40 × 40) grid points and grid spacing of Δ x = 0.8. a Plot of initial microstructure (φ Ni) at planes z = 8.0, z = 16.0, and z = 24.0 for Ni 30%. Microstructures after a simulation step of 10 5 for Ni concentration, b 30%, c 40%, d 41%, e 52.5%, f 70%, g 75%, h 82%, and i 92% are plotted for φ Ni at cross-sections along the vertical planes, z = 8.0, z = 16.0, and z = 24.0. The length scale, given here is a guideline for the readers to have a rough estimation and obtained by comparing with the microstructures as in ref.

Thus, our first-principles phase field method is definitely a successful achievement in determining microstructures of the length scale of 1–100 μm purely from quantum mechanical ab initio theory. We strongly believe that the present method becomes a future theoretical standard for materials, which is fundamentally different from the existing methods limited only within explanation of experimental observations with empirical parameters. We are creating an automatic submission protocol for potential renormalization calculation that can be used to provide all the necessary input data for any system. This method has a potential to predict new useful materials in industries by supplying T–C phase diagram with microstructures, which is crucial to discuss about material properties in realistic applications. Our first-principles PFM is a universal method to perform large scale simulation for variety of materials at less computation time.

### Echocardiographic assessment of valve stenosis: EAE / ASE recommendations for clinical practice [^e106b65d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) measurement—calculation of continuity-equation valve area requires three measurements: AS jet velocity by continuous-wave Doppler (CWD), LVOT diameter for calculation of a circular cross-sectional area (CSA), and LVOT velocity recorded with pulsed Doppler. LVOT diameter is measured in the parasternal long-axis view in mid-systole from the white–black interface of the septal endocardium to the anterior mitral leaflet, parallel to the aortic valve plane and within 0.5–1.0 cm of the valve orifice; diameter is measured from the inner edge to inner edge of the septal endocardium and the anterior mitral leaflet in mid-systole, and usually three or more beats are averaged in sinus rhythm with at least 5 consecutive beats for irregular rhythms. LVOT velocity is measured from the apical approach either in an apical long-axis view or an anteriorly angulated four-chamber view, using a pulsed-Doppler sample volume with a length of 3–5 mm positioned just proximal to the aortic valve so the velocity location matches the LVOT diameter site; the VTI is measured by tracing the modal velocity. If annular flow acceleration produces spectral dispersion, the sample volume needs to be moved axially from 0.5 to 1.0 cm to obtain a laminar flow curve.

### A strong, highly-tilted interstellar magnetic field near the solar system [^2cfa7c08]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Magnetic fields play an important (sometimes dominant) role in the evolution of gas clouds in the Galaxy, but the strength and orientation of the field in the interstellar medium near the heliosphere has been poorly constrained. Previous estimates of the field strength range from 1.8-2.5 microG and the field was thought to be parallel to the Galactic plane or inclined by 38-60 degrees (ref. 2) or 60-90 degrees (ref. 3) to this plane. These estimates relied either on indirect observational inferences or modelling in which the interstellar neutral hydrogen was not taken into account. Here we report measurements of the deflection of the solar wind plasma flows in the heliosheath to determine the magnetic field strength and orientation in the interstellar medium. We find that the field strength in the local interstellar medium is 3.7-5.5 microG. The field is tilted approximately 20-30 degrees from the interstellar medium flow direction (resulting from the peculiar motion of the Sun in the Galaxy) and is at an angle of about 30 degrees from the Galactic plane. We conclude that the interstellar medium field is turbulent or has a distortion in the solar vicinity.

### Detection of magnetospheric ion drift patterns at mars [^e0964b59]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Formation mechanisms of the wedge-like dispersion structures

The wedge-like dispersion structure observed in intrinsic magnetospheres is attributed to the radially spatial separation of ions at different energies –. To gain a comprehensive understanding of our specific case at Mars, it is essential to investigate the spatial separation of ions at different energies within the crustal fields. A useful approach is to examine the drift path of particles and the spacecraft trajectory relative to the crustal fields on the magnetic equator plane –. This plane is defined by the magnetic equator points, which correspond to the locations of the minimum field strength along the field lines. For the Earth’s dipole field, the magnetic equator plane is basically parallel to the equator plane and can be easily determined, and we can utilize the L -value parameter to quantitatively ascertain the positions of the magnetic field lines. The magnetic equator points situated in lower L -shells possess higher.

Here we also construct a magnetic equator plane of the crustal fields to determine the spacecraft’s relative path and gain insights into the spatial distribution of ions at different energies. First, we extracted the magnetic equator points of the traced field lines (denoted by the magenta dots in Fig. 4a). Subsequently, we employed the least-square method to fit the average magnetic equator plane (depicted by the grey-shaded region) that encompasses most of these magnetic equator points. Figure 4a demonstrates that these magnetic equator points predominantly reside within the magnetic equator plane, indicating that this plane is well-determined. Then, similar to the dipole field, we set a local coordinate system to study the distribution of ions at different energies, where n is the normal direction of the magnetic equator plane,is the azimuthal direction,is the radial direction (pointing to the outer region of crustal fields) which completes the right-handed system (see detailed information in the Methods).

### Observation of strong nonlinear interactions in parametric down-conversion of X-rays into ultraviolet radiation [^517b2b89]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 5 
Spectral measurements for PDC signal in LiNbO 3.

Spectra for a the (1 1 0) atomic planes, b the (3 3 0) atomic planes, c the (−1 1 10) atomic planes, and d the (0 0 6) atomic planes. The features in a – c can be attributed to either band transitions or atomic resonances. The vertical error bars indicate the counting statistics. See further details in the text.

Of importance, the measured efficiencies presented in Figs. 2 and 3 show a very different angular dependence from the angular dependence of the elastic scattering. Hence our results cannot be described by generalized scattering factors. The interpretation of the measured efficiencies for different directions of the crystal is essential for the understanding of the nonlinear interaction. The differences in the efficiencies for different atomic planes can be attributed to higher densities of valence electrons in different directions.

Another interesting result becomes apparent when comparing the efficiencies for LiNbO 3 with reciprocal lattice vectors of nearly equal magnitudes. Although the X-ray scattering factors for these reciprocal lattice vectors are comparable, the efficiencies of the PDC effect for reciprocal lattice vectors, which are parallel to the c -axis of the crystal, are considerably larger. For example, the effect measured for the (0 0 6) atomic planes is two orders of magnitude larger compared to the (1 1 0) atomic planes. This can indicate that the nonlinearity depends on the direction of the permanent dipoles in the crystal and on symmetry of unit cells or the molecules in the materials. It is remarkable to note that for the visible range, the nonlinear coefficient is the largest for polarizations along the c -axis. It is very likely that the electric field of the idler that leads to the largest efficiencies we observed in LiNbO 3 is also in the direction of the c -axis. This is consistent with the theories that predict that the largest efficiency for selected atomic planes is obtained when the electric field of the idler is parallel to the reciprocal lattice vector (normal to the atomic planes).

### Self-assembly of nanocrystal checkerboard patterns via non-specific interactions [^b971e2e8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Free energy calculation

To understand the orientational and assembly behavior of NCs, we performed two sets of free energy calculations. In both sets of calculations, the NCs were constrained at their “equilibrium” positions relative to the interfacial plane (i.e. normal distance z from this plane), obtained by computing the ensemble averagedof freely mobile NCs.

The first set of calculations involved carrying out MD simulations of a single NC for computing its orientational free energy as a function of Euler angles (rotations about the internal axes parallel to x and y axes), specifically to determine the relative free energies of the idealized face-up, edge-up, and vertex-up orientations (Fig. 2d). To this end, we first prepared a well-equilibrated system of a single NC constrained in the pure face-up orientationconstrained at positionof the nanocube if it were freely mobile) relative to the air–water interface. Subsequently, we performed a very long MD simulation of the system in which the NC was first rotated around its center in steps of(holding) until it reached the pure edge-up orientation ofand then rotated about a different axis in steps of(holding) until the NC reached the pure vertex-up orientation of. In each rotation step, the NC was rotated with constant angular velocity over a period of 0.1 million timesteps and then held fixed for 0.6 million timesteps at each rotated angle. The ensemble-averaged torque componentexperienced by the entire NC (including grafts) in the direction of rotationwas measured from the last 0.5 million timesteps. The orientational free energy of NC (relative to its initial orientation)can then be obtained by simply integrating this torque component over the rotational angle as:

### A comprehensive approach for correcting voxel-wise b-value errors in diffusion MRI [^4f0aecf3]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Figure 1 A shows both the measured (top) b‐value map from Experiment_1 and the predicted (bottom) b‐value correction map based on a spherical harmonic expansion. 13 Overall, the predictions provided a pattern similar to the measured b‐value correction maps, albeit the latter captured more spatial detail and showed larger deviations from the nominal b‐value (please see also the histograms in Figure 1B and note the different color bars for the two maps). This discrepancy is most probably due to the fact that the predictions consider only one source of deviation (i.e. diffusion gradient nonlinearities), ignoring all other effects (e.g. imaging gradients, concomitant fields).

### Real-time observation of the spin hall effect of light using metasurface-enabled single-shot weak measurements [^090a2641]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Theoretically predicted, numerically simulated, and experimentally measured W values are displayed in Fig. 3 b (see Methods for the numerical simulation). At this static interface, δ = 225.0 nm (Eq. (1)) and W follows a cotangent curve as α changes (Eq. (3)). The linear relation between W and δ begins to deviateand becomes nonlinear asas α approaches zero (compare black solid and dotted curves) and reduces to zero after reaching its maximum value, μ m (black solid). The simulated W using the ideal phase map (blue dashed) and the realistic metasurface design (red dashed) closely match the theoretical predictions and are nearly indistinguishable in Fig. 3 b. In the conventional weak measurement setup (Fig. 1 b) conducted for comparison, the postselected beam is captured by varying α from  − 2.5° to 2.5°. The measured W values are obtained after finding the center position of the incidence (y = 0) when the entire process is completed. The experimental results agree with the theory (black square). A single capture, however, does not provide the weak values.

In contrast, the metasurface-implemented weak measurement does not require such a multistep or calibration process. Before starting this measurement, the metasurface is mounted on a rotation stage and positioned so that the splitting direction under direct incidence is 45°. This process is intended to align the metasurface horizontally, corresponding to α = 0, akin to aligning the optical axis of a commercial polarizer prior to measurements, and is not a calibration. We conduct the measurement by rotating the metasurface (Fig. 3 a) and acquire a single image that includes two postselected beams simultaneously. The rotation of the metasurface not only determines the postselection angle but also alters the deflecting direction from π /4 to π /4 − α (Fig. 3 d and g, black line). The difference in the y position averages between the two postselected beams is obtained from the single image aswhere X, Y are the center position differences of the two beams along the x - and y -axes, respectively (see Supplementary Note 9). The weak signals are then determined usingand are shown as red circles in Fig. 3 b. These results are in excellent agreement with theoretical and simulated results.

### The safe zone of posterior semicircular canal resection in suboccipital retrosigmoid sinus approach for acoustic neuroma surgery [^dfd8fe66]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to find the safe zone of posterior semicircular canal resection that can avoid structure damage in suboccipital retrosigmoid sinus approach for acoustic neuroma. One hundred twenty subjects (72 male and 48 female subjects) were involved in this study anonymously. Five parameters are measured in computed tomography: L1 is the line that goes through the common bony crus and parallel to the plane that contains posterior semicircular canal at axial plane. L2 is the middle sagittal line at axial plane. A is the point of posterior wall of the internal auditory canal at the level of the common bony crus. B is the intersection point of L1 and posterior wall of auditory canal. L3 is the line that goes through the plane that contains posterior semicircular canal at coronary plane. L4 is the middle sagittal line at coronary plane. C is the common bony crus. D is the ampulla. E is the most posterior point of posterior wall of auditory canal at the plane that goes through the posterior semicircular canal. The angle between L1 and L2 was 41.76 (SD, 5.64) degrees on the right and 43.40 (SD, 5.25) degrees on the left (P = 0.003). The distance between A and B was 0.59 (SD, 0.13) cm. The angle between L3 and L4 was 16.57 (SD, 6.51) degrees on the right and 17.57 (SD, 6.98) degrees on the left (P = 0.017). The distance between C and D was 0.60 (SD, 0.05) cm. The distance between E and line CD was 0.48 (SD, 0.09).

2.1.2 | Local velocity error variance

We empirically evaluate local spurious divergence variance,, and model’s propagation through our numerical schemes approximating the divergence operator,. Figure 1C shows that modeling this propagation of error variance permits us to directly map our local divergence variance estimates to local velocity error variance estimates,.

We apply the law of CoM to estimate spurious divergence,, in each voxel and time frame:

Givenis also predicted to be 0 sinceis a linear operator. The spurious divergence variance is equivalent to the variance of the velocity divergence for incompressible fluid,, whereis the position in the i th direction. We approximate the velocity field’s divergence using finite difference schemes. For each velocity component, we estimate its gradient in the same direction as, where Δ U i is the velocity component difference,is the scheme’s step size andis the voxel dimension in the i th direction. Therefore, our approximation ofis:

For first-order accurate and second-order accurate numerical schemes,is equal to 1 and 2, respectively.

Given that there are correlations between velocity components, we expect correlations between velocity difference components depending on the finite difference scheme. We write the velocity difference covariance matrix as. The finite difference schemes’ resolution is expressed using the resolution vector,. Eq. (10) is equivalent to the following equation under our definitions of r and:

Eq. (11) demonstrates that estimates ofinforms, and in turn, the variance of individual velocity components owing to error sources.

To estimate, we model the relationship between the velocity and velocity difference. For first-order accurate forward/backward schemes or second-order accurate central difference schemes, we approximate the velocity difference covariance matrix as twice that of the velocity covariance matrix,. This relationship assumes that local velocity error variance is similar. Upon assuming equal error variance for each velocity component,, we expect, whereis the diagonal elements of. We decomposeas a product between the local velocity variance and the velocity difference correlation matrix,, similar to Eq. (2) :

### Multilevel measurement of acetabular version using 3-D CT-generated models: implications for hip preservation surgery [^a9ce9a21]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Two specialized measurement spheres were created in a commercially available computer-assisted design software program (Solidedge; UGS, Plano, TX, USA) containing seven evenly spaced parallel planes running through each sphere with the fourth plane bisecting the sphere. A series of anatomic planes were constructed for each pelvis (Fig. 2). A summary of the definitions of each plane is provided (Table 1). The standard coronal plane (SCP) was defined as the plane formed between both ASIS points and the pubic symphysis. This plane is approximately vertical with upright standing but can vary from 10.4° ± 7.4° forward rotation in the supine position to 5.0° ± 9.4° forward rotation in the standing position. The pelvic axial plane (PAP) was defined as the plane passing through both ASIS points and positioned normal to the SCP. This plane is approximately horizontal with upright standing. The sagittal plane (SP) was defined as the plane that passes through the sacral midpoint, runs through the center of the pubic symphysis, and is normal to the SCP and the PAP. The measurement spheres were sized and positioned manually to best outline the acetabular anatomy on all cuts. The measurement spheres then were rotated around their center and the center of the acetabulum such that their seven planes were exactly parallel to the PAP (Fig. 3). In this way, the equatorial acetabulum corresponded to Level 4 of the measurement sphere and defined the acetabular equatorial plane (AEP), which was defined as the plane that passes through the center of the acetabulum and is parallel to the PAP. The acetabular coronal plane (ACP) was defined as the plane passing through the acetabular center and parallel to the SCP. The point on the acetabulum where the ACP intersected the rim superiorly was labeled the 12 o’clock point and represented the most superior aspect of the acetabulum (Fig. 2). The point where the ACP intersected the acetabular rim inferiorly was labeled the 6 o’clock point and represented the inferior-most aspect of the acetabulum (Fig. 2). The acetabular abduction plane (AAP) was defined as the plane passing through the 12 and 6 o’clock points and normal to the SCP. To determine AV at multiple levels, points were plotted manually in the software where each of the seven parallel planes on the measurement sphere intersected the anterior and posterior rim of the acetabulum (Fig. 4). AV planes (AVPs) were created and defined as the plane formed between the anterior and posterior points at each level and normal to the PAP (Fig. 5). These were created at Levels 1 to 5. They were not created at Levels 6 and 7 owing to the lack of consistency of the intersection points on the anatomy of the inferior acetabulum. The AV at each level tested was calculated as the angle between the AVP and the SP as these two planes varied from one another in only one degree of freedom, namely the degree of AV. Version was given a positive value (anteversion) or a negative value (retroversion) based on the relationship between each AV and the SP (Fig. 5). Once all points had been placed, acetabular abduction was measured automatically by the software as the angle between the AAP and the AEP. The interASIS distance, interacetabular distance, and interischial spinous distances also were measured in the same manner. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability analyses were performed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the analysis method and were performed by two observers at two times, a minimum of 2 weeks apart for each observer on three specimens (six hips). The ICCs for the two sessions were 0.997 and 0.994 for the first (AAJ) and second observer (AP), respectively (intraobserver reliability). The ICC between the two observers was 0.996 and 0.997 for the first and second sessions, respectively (interobserver reliability).

The results above clearly indicate that the misorientation angle between the neighbouring grains affects TT. The cause has been commonly attributed to the increased misalignment in the twin plane and shear direction when crossing the GB. More specifically, over the years, the likelihood of slip-slip, slip-twin and twin-twin transmissions across grain boundaries has been characterized via the following geometric measure

for the (mis)alignment of the glide or twin plane normals and shear directions of the incoming and outgoing systems. In equation (1), the plane normals and shear directions are unit vectors.

Related to m ′ is a second factor, which only takes into account the alignment of the incoming and outgoing twin shear vectors. This factor implies glide planes or their intersection trace with the GB play a small or negligible role compared to the direction of shearing. A third and final geometric factor that has been considered in conjunction with m ′ is the macroscopic Schmid factor (MSF) for the (possible) outgoing twin m 0. m 0 would represent the notion that TT is independent of the GB misorientation and is a consequence of the neighbouring grain orientation with respect to the macroscopic loading state. The rationale for the latest criterion is that if the parent grain with the incoming twin of {10–12} type were well suited for twinning under the current loading, any neighbouring grain that deviates in orientation from the parent would be less favourable for twinning. Consequently, the further the neighbour deviates from the parent, the less likely it is to twin.

To compare these three geometric factors, a simple bicrystal set-up is considered (shown in Fig. 3a). The orientation of the grain with the incoming twin is fixed and its c axis is normal to the imposed compression. It corresponds to ∼0.5 Schmid factor for the incoming twin. A total of 221 different orientations are considered for the neighbouring grain. All three geometric measures are calculated for all the twin variants of the neighbouring grain orientations with respect to the loading direction (for m 0) and/or the incoming twin (for m ′ and m ″), and the maximum geometric measure, which corresponds to the best-oriented twin variant, is selected. The measure m ′ and m ″ range from 0 to 1, and the MSF m 0 range from 0 to 0.5. To have the same range as m ′ and m ″, we used 2 m 0 in this comparison.

### Real-time assessment of potential peak local specific absorption rate value without phase monitoring: trigonometric maximization method for worst-case local specific absorption rate determination [^0c47fe51]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

For this transmit array setup, the large pSAR variability is probably due to a reduced distance between the dipoles of the array, which results in pSAR values produced by the interference of E fields of similar amplitude leading to a higher potential modulation depth, that is, relatively large worst‐case pSAR compared to the mean pSAR.

Whereas for array setups where the pSAR values are mainly due to just one transmit element 33 (eg, body array with fractionated dipoles, where they are typically located in the region immediately under the array element), this pSAR variability is much smaller (Figure 3A).

It is worth noting that, since the investigated body array for prostate imaging is composed of parallel fractionated dipoles, it shows a very dominant z‐component of the transmitted E‐field (Supporting Information Figure S2). Whereas, in many head regions (eg, neck, cheeks, forehead, etc.), no strongly dominant components are observed with the head array with oblique fractionated dipoles and rectangular loops (Supporting Information Figures S3 and S4).

Since the fixed point in (−π, π) is not unique (fixed points for maximum and minimum SAR exist), we are not able to prove by theory the convergence to the maximum of the proposed algorithm (eg, using the Banach fixed‐point theorem). However, even if strictly speaking this is not true (because this is not a gradient ascent method), it can be observed that, at each iteration, the definedfunction updates the solution “following” the direction of the gradient. Thus, the minimum SAR corresponds to an unstable fixed point.

The numerical results also experimentally demonstrate that it always converges towards the fixed point corresponding to the maximum. Indeed, starting from any initial phase set, the phase setthat maximized the SAR for each voxel is obtained in a few iterative steps.

### Quantitative evaluation of the fetal cerebellar vermis using the median view on three-dimensional ultrasound [^ea9007db]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness for quantitative evaluation of cerebellar vermis using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and to establish a nomogram for Chinese fetal vermis measurements during gestation.

Methods

Sonographic examinations were performed in normal fetuses and in cases suspected of the diagnosis of vermian rotation. 3D median planes were obtained with both OMNIVIEW and tomographic ultrasound imaging.

Results

Measurements of the cerebellar vermis were highly correlated between two-dimensional and 3D median planes. The diameter of the cerebellar vermis follows growth approximately predicted by the quadratic regression equation. The normal vermis was almost parallel to the brain stem, with the average angle degree to be <2° in normal fetuses. The average angle degree of the 9 cases of vermian rotation was >5°.

Conclusions

Three-dimensional median planes are obtained more easily than two-dimensional ones, and allow accurate measurements of the cerebellar vermis. The 3D approach may enable rapid assessment of fetal cerebral anatomy in standard examination. Measurements of cerebellar vermis may provide a quantitative index for prenatal diagnosis of posterior fossa malformations.

3.2.3 Echo‐shift estimation

After the image processing, we estimated a spatially resolved map ofbased on complex FASE images (Figure 4). We obtained the complex k‐space data by applying the Fourier transform to the complex images. The k‐space location at which the signal maximum was read out was determined through sequentially setting each k‐space line in the phase‐encoding direction to zero and reconstructing the corresponding magnitude images. For a given voxel, the curve describing the signal magnitude as a function of the removed k‐space line index was investigated. A Gaussian filter with standard deviation of 2 was applied to reduce random noise in the curve. The index, where the signal was minimal, was identified and interpreted as the k‐space line that contains the shifted center of k‐space for that voxel, because the omission of the k‐space line caused the largest drop in signal magnitude.

FIGURE 4 
Simulated signal dropout method to determine k‐space shift per voxel. The method aims to identify shifts to the effective k‐space center caused by in‐plane macroscopic magnetic field gradients (MFGs). The phase‐encoding line of the complex k‐space data that leads to the minimum signal in a given voxel when omitted is interpreted to be the center of shifted k‐space in that voxel. The shift can be converted into, given the known readout timings. The red signal magnitude curve is smoothed with a Gaussian filter to increase the robustness of the minimum magnitude determination. FT, Fourier transform.

Using a known center index of k‐space, which corresponds to a timeafter the spin echo, and a known effective echo spacingof the EPI readout, this k‐space index showing minimal signalwas converted intowith the formula. This procedure of estimatingis referred to as the “simulated signal dropout” method.

For pairs of images acquired with opposite phase‐encoding directions but otherwise identical parameters, the two estimatedwere subtracted voxelwise. This yields an estimation offor every voxel.

To align with the directions of the calculated MFGs, the directions left–right and anterior–posterior were considered the reversed phase‐encoding directions.

3.2.4 Signal dependence on phase‐encoding direction

Likewise, for pairs of images with the sameand opposite phase‐encoding direction, the ratio of the signal magnitudes was calculated, and the natural logarithm of it was computed. Thus, for every voxel we obtain a value for.

ACR–AIUM–SPR–SRU DDH ultrasound—coronal view technique—notes that the anatomic coronal plane is approximately parallel to the infant’s body and that if the superior edge of the transducer is rotated 10 to 15 degrees (usually posteriorly) into an oblique coronal plane, the ilium will appear straight. The standard plane is defined by identifying a straight iliac line, the tip of the acetabular labrum, and the transition from the os ilium to the triradiate cartilage, and the coronal view in the standard plane can be obtained with the hip in the physiologic neutral position (15- to 20-degree flexion). Femoral head position and acetabular morphology are assessed, the alpha angle (normally =60 degrees) is measured, and performance of stress in this plane may be helpful.

### 3D echocardiography: a review of the current status and future directions [^df3afece]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3D) left ventricular (LV) imaging and quantification—Simultaneous display of 3 planes (colored red, green, and blue) of an RT3D data set is available, and each imaging plane can be manipulated to obtain the proper alignment for LV volume calculation. LV volumes can be calculated with a 5-point tracing algorithm obtained using 2 planes (4- and 2-chamber views). Plane orientation options are described: the short-axis view can be visualized from the perspective of the apex or base; the coronal plane can be viewed from above or below; and the sagittal plane can be viewed from the left or right. The choice of narrow-angle or wide-angle imaging acquisition modes depends on the cardiac structure to be examined. For imaging of the ventricles, it is best to use a wide-angle acquisition in the apical window (4-chamber) so as to include the entire ventricle, whereas for smaller structures, such as the aortic valve, a narrow-angle acquisition may be adequate. EDV indicates end-diastolic volume and ESV end-systolic volume.
