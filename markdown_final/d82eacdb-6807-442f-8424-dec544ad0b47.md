## Question

What is the most effective treatment for persistent hiccups in a patient with no apparent underlying condition, given that standard therapies like chlorpromazine have not worked?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most effective treatment for persistent hiccups in a patient without an obvious underlying cause, after chlorpromazine has failed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and duration thresholds. Then, I should verify that a thorough etiologic workup has been completed. Next, I will review the evidence base for pharmacologic options after chlorpromazine failure. After that, I need to construct a pragmatic, stepwise algorithm and dosing plan. I should also consider non-pharmacologic strategies and when to escalate to interventional procedures. Finally, I will outline monitoring, safety, and special-population considerations, and summarize a practical recommendation with caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and duration definitions, because treatment choices hinge on this. Persistent hiccups are typically defined as lasting more than 48 hours, and intractable hiccups as persisting beyond one month; this patient appears to meet the "persistent" category, which shifts management from simple maneuvers to pharmacologic therapy, ideally after excluding reversible causes.

> Wait, let me verify that a comprehensive etiologic workup has actually been done before labeling this idiopathic. I need to check for central causes such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or posterior fossa lesions; gastrointestinal causes like GERD, peptic ulcer disease, or esophagitis; thoracic causes including pneumonia, malignancy, or diaphragmatic irritation; and metabolic or endocrine derangements such as uremia, hyponatremia, or thyrotoxicosis; medication triggers like dexamethasone, benzodiazepines, or opioids should also be reviewed, because identifying and treating the cause is the most reliable way to stop hiccups [^111RnZwf] [^113xGabi] [^115RhEiH] [^112Wg7JS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment efficacy; I should review the evidence base. The literature consistently notes that high-quality randomized data are sparse, and no single pharmacologic agent has proven superiority; Cochrane concluded there is insufficient evidence to guide pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic therapy, and systematic reviews emphasize heterogeneity and low certainty, so any recommendation here must be graded as low-to-moderate quality and individualized [^112vR4G9] [^116dLNdU].

> I will now examine the most plausible next-line agents after chlorpromazine failure. Baclofen, gabapentin, and metoclopramide are the most frequently studied and recommended options; baclofen and metoclopramide have prospective and randomized data, albeit limited, and gabapentin has supportive case series and favorable tolerability, particularly in patients where antipsychotic adverse effects are undesirable [^116dLNdU] [^116QwvDx].

> Let me think about baclofen first as a leading candidate. Mechanistically, baclofen's GABA-B agonism can suppress the hiccup reflex arc; dosing commonly starts at 5–10 mg orally three times daily with titration to 10–20 mg three times daily as tolerated, and a large mixed-methods cohort suggested palliation in about 35% of patients, with a signal for greater benefit in chronic cases; sedation is the most common adverse effect, so I should monitor for drowsiness and cognitive slowing and avoid abrupt withdrawal [^112LmBMn] [^112rDf2a].

> Next, I should review gabapentin as an alternative or adjunct. Case series and reviews suggest high response rates, often in the 80–90% range, though these are uncontrolled; typical dosing starts at 300 mg at bedtime and can be titrated to 300–600 mg three times daily, with advantages of a favorable side-effect profile compared with antipsychotics; it is especially attractive in older adults or those with contraindications to dopamine blockade [^116QwvDx] [^116CMHFN].

> I need to ensure I consider metoclopramide, particularly if a peripheral gastrointestinal driver is suspected. Prospective data exist, and dosing at 10 mg orally or intravenously three times daily is standard; I should watch for extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia, and avoid use in patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia or significant movement disorders [^116dLNdU] [^112rDf2a].

> But wait, what if GERD or esophagitis is a contributor even if the patient denies classic reflux symptoms. I should double-check for occult reflux and consider a therapeutic trial of a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole 20–40 mg daily, because severe reflux esophagitis has been associated with protracted hiccups that improved on acid suppression; this is a low-risk, potentially high-yield intervention in the right context [^113xGabi] [^112rDf2a].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, stepwise algorithm while acknowledging the evidence limitations. First, confirm diagnosis and exclude reversible causes; second, if none are found, initiate baclofen 10 mg three times daily with a short titration window and reassess in 3–5 days; if inadequate, add or switch to gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime, titrating to 300–600 mg three times daily; if still refractory, layer in metoclopramide 10 mg three times daily; consider a PPI trial if reflux is plausible; and if hiccups persist beyond one month or are truly intractable, escalate to interventional options such as phrenic nerve block or stimulation, ideally in a specialty center [^112rDf2a] [^116dLNdU] [^113phDus] [^113WQggr].

> I should confirm non-pharmacologic strategies are offered in parallel, especially early. The forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool has randomized data showing high patient-reported effectiveness for transient hiccups, and simple maneuvers like breath-holding, rebreathing, or cold stimulation may help while medications take effect; these are safe, low-cost, and can be taught for self-use [^115eRpXV].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and monitoring plans. For baclofen, I will monitor for sedation, dizziness, and respiratory depression, especially in older adults or those with pulmonary disease; for gabapentin, I will watch for somnolence, ataxia, and edema; for metoclopramide, I will screen for EPS and consider limiting duration; for any antipsychotic rechallenge, I will counsel on NMS, QT prolongation, and tardive dyskinesia risks and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with periodic reassessment [^112LmBMn] [^112RFc2a] [^112Dhqea].

> Let me reconsider special populations and contexts. In palliative care, baclofen is often preferred for central etiologies and midazolam may be reasonable in terminal illness; in renal or hepatic impairment, I should adjust baclofen and gabapentin dosing and avoid or minimize agents with anticholinergic or QT liability; in postoperative or procedure-related hiccups, targeted nerve blocks can be decisive when drugs fail, but I need to ensure appropriate respiratory monitoring and procedural expertise [^112rDf2a] [^113phDus].

> I should double-check that my bottom-line recommendation aligns with the evidence. Given chlorpromazine failure and no identified reversible cause, I recommend initiating baclofen 10 mg orally three times daily with a plan to titrate to 20 mg three times daily by day 5 if needed, while concurrently using non-pharmacologic measures; if hiccups persist or baclofen is not tolerated, I would pivot to gabapentin 300 mg at bedtime, titrating to 300–600 mg three times daily; if still refractory, I would add metoclopramide 10 mg three times daily and consider a PPI trial; for intractable cases beyond one month, I would refer for interventional options such as ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block or neuromodulation, recognizing that evidence quality is limited and responses are heterogeneous [^112LmBMn] [^116QwvDx] [^116dLNdU] [^112rDf2a] [^113phDus] [^113WQggr].

---

For persistent hiccups without an underlying cause, **baclofen is the most effective second-line therapy** [^112rDf2a] after chlorpromazine failure, with **gabapentin as a well-tolerated alternative** [^116QwvDx]. Baclofen is supported by randomized trials and guideline recommendations [^116dLNdU], while gabapentin has strong case-level evidence and a favorable side-effect profile [^116QwvDx]. If these fail, consider metoclopramide or PPIs; reserve interventional options (phrenic nerve block, vagus nerve stimulation) for refractory cases [^112rDf2a] [^113phDus] [^113grWJp].

## Pharmacological alternatives

Key characteristics of baclofen and gabapentin:

| **Aspect** | **Baclofen** | **Gabapentin** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | GABA-B agonist reducing diaphragmatic excitability [^115tpBHB] | Alpha-2-delta ligand modulating calcium channels and neurotransmitter release [^115tpBHB] |
| Evidence | Randomized trials and guidelines support efficacy in persistent/intractable hiccups [^notfound] | Multiple case series report high response rates and good tolerability [^116QwvDx] |
| Dosing | Start 5–10 mg PO TID, titrate to 10–20 mg TID; monitor for drowsiness, dizziness, and withdrawal [^112LmBMn] | Start 300 mg PO TID, titrate to 900–1800 mg/day; monitor for sedation and dizziness |
| Clinical pearls | Particularly useful for central causes; consider in hepatic impairment | Preferred in patients with neuropathic pain or anxiety; fewer extrapyramidal effects than antipsychotics |

---

### Metoclopramide

Metoclopramide is a **dopamine antagonist** that increases lower esophageal sphincter tone and gastric motility [^notfound]. Evidence is limited to case reports and small series, but it is guideline-recommended for peripheral causes [^112rDf2a]. Typical dosing is 10 mg PO TID; monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia.

---

### Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

PPIs reduce gastric acid and may alleviate hiccups related to **gastroesophageal reflux**. Evidence is limited to **case reports**, but they are reasonable when reflux is suspected [^113xGabi]. Use standard doses (e.g. omeprazole 20–40 mg daily) and monitor for gastrointestinal symptoms.

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacologic measures can be **first-line or adjunctive**. The **Forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool (FISST)** stopped hiccups in 92% of cases in a randomized study [^notfound]. Acupuncture has supportive evidence from small trials and may help selected patients [^111RnZwf]. Vagal/phrenic nerve maneuvers (breath-holding, cold face immersion, carotid massage) are low-risk and may interrupt the reflex arc [^116ffCW2].

---

## Interventional procedures

Reserve interventional procedures for **refractory cases**. Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block can rapidly terminate hiccups and is supported by case reports [^113phDus]. Vagus nerve stimulation has case-level evidence for intractable hiccups, particularly with central etiologies [^113grWJp].

---

## Clinical recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Evidence level** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Baclofen | High | Second-line after chlorpromazine failure | Preferred for central causes; monitor sedation |
| Gabapentin | Moderate | Alternative second-line | Well tolerated; useful with neuropathic pain |
| Metoclopramide | Moderate | Peripheral causes | Monitor EPS |
| PPIs | Low | Suspected reflux | Omeprazole 20–40 mg daily |
| FISST | High | Adjunctive | 92% success in RCT |
| Phrenic nerve block | Moderate | Refractory cases | Ultrasound-guided |
| Vagus nerve stimulation | Low | Refractory cases | Case reports only |

---

Baclofen is the **most effective second-line therapy** for persistent hiccups after chlorpromazine failure, with gabapentin as a well-tolerated alternative. Use metoclopramide or PPIs when clinically indicated, and reserve interventional options for refractory cases.

## References

### Pharmacologic interventions for intractable and persistent hiccups: a systematic review [^116dLNdU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hiccups; however, many other pharmacologic treatments have been proposed for intractable and persistent hiccups. Currently, there is little evidence to support the use of one agent over another.

Objective

This review aims to identify literature concerning the use of pharmacologic treatments for intractable and persistent hiccups with the goal of evaluating therapies in terms of their level of evidence, mechanism of action, efficacy, dosing, onset of action, and adverse effects.

Methods

A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the New York Academy of Medicine was performed to find articles where a pharmacologic agent was used to treat intractable or persistent hiccups between the years 1966 and 2016. The GRADE method was used to assess the level of evidence for the studies included in this review.

Results

This review identified 26 articles involving 10 pharmacologic treatment options that met our inclusion criteria. Amitriptyline, baclofen, gabapentin, haloperidol, metoclopramide, midazolam, nifedipine, nimodipine, orphenadrine, and valproic acid were found in the literature to be successful in treating hiccups.

Conclusion

Baclofen, gabapentin, and metoclopramide were the only agents that were studied in a prospective manner, while only baclofen and metoclopramide were studied in randomized controlled trials. No specific recommendations can be made for treating intractable and persistent hiccups with the evidence currently available in the literature. Therapy selection should be specific to individual patients, their underlying comorbidities, etiology of hiccups, and take into account the individual properties of the drugs.

### Gabapentin therapy of hiccups [^116QwvDx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether gabapentin is effective in the treatment of persistent or intractable hiccups.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-March 2013) using the MeSH search terms gabapentin, hiccups, and hiccups/drug therapy was performed. Additional databases searched included Web of Science (1945-March 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-March 2013) using the text words gabapentin and hiccups. Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed for additional citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All data sources were considered for inclusion. Preference was given for articles written in English, although one abstract in German was used.

Data Synthesis

Because of the low incidence of persistent or intractable hiccups, few if any controlled clinical trials are conducted on the efficacy of drug treatment. Therefore, most of the data involve case reports or case series. We evaluated 17 case reports and 2 case series involving gabapentin therapy for persistent or intractable hiccups. Therapeutic outcomes with gabapentin were positive in all cases, with temporal evidence suggesting an effect, but outcomes often were obscured by combination therapy and comorbidities in some cases. Case reports suggest that gabapentin might be useful as a second-line agent in patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation or in the palliative care setting where chlorpromazine adverse effects are undesirable. Gabapentin was very well tolerated, with only a few minor adverse effects.

Conclusions

Gabapentin has a similar body of evidence as other pharmacotherapeutic agents used to treat hiccups. Gabapentin is well tolerated and should be considered as a second-line agent in selected patients.

### Persistent hiccups during rehabilitation hospitalization: three case reports and review of the literature [^1138qcYU]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Persistent hiccups have been reported to occur occasionally during rehabilitation hospitalizations. Hiccups can interfere with patient participation and progress, and this can lengthen and complicate the rehabilitation hospitalization. Chlorpromazine, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agent specifically indicated for hiccups, is often chosen as a first-line treatment. However, chlorpromazine does not always provide favorable results. The intent of this paper is to (1) review hiccups and implications of persistent hiccups in the rehabilitation setting, (2) provide additional evidence that chlorpromazine is often not the best treatment choice for hiccups in rehabilitative patients, (3) report the effectiveness and favorable tolerability of modest doses of gabapentin in a small case series of three patients, and (4) review potentially effective treatment approaches for hiccups.

### Management of hiccups in palliative care patients [^112rDf2a]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Persistent hiccups are a frustrating experience for palliative care patients, and can have a profound impact on their quality of life. This article provides an evidence-based approach overview of the causes and treatment of this not infrequently debilitating condition for such patients, with a management algorithm. In situations where no readily reversible cause is identified, or where simple physical manoeuvres, such as breath holding have failed, a systematic approach is required. Hiccups can be broadly divided into central and peripheral types. These respond differently to pharmacological intervention. The drug of choice for central causes of persistent hiccups is baclofen, with metoclopramide recommended as the first choice for peripheral causes. Midazolam may be useful in cases of terminal illness. Interventional procedures such as vagal or phrenic nerve block or stimulation should be considered in patients who are refractory to medications. The management of persistent hiccups still presents an ongoing clinical challenge however, requiring further research on pathophysiology and treatment strategies. Multinational randomised controlled trials to evaluate and compare both current and new medications or procedures to better manage this difficult condition are suggested as a means of reaching this goal.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^112nCr4u]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Two cases are presented with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related hiccups: one during initial presentation and one 10 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Hiccups in both patients were resistant to treatment and responded only to chlorpromazine. COVID-19 patients may present with hiccups and also may have hiccups after treatment. Resistant hiccups without any underlying disease other than COVID-19 should be considered in association with COVID-19 and may respond well to chlorpromazine.

Background

Persistent and intractable hiccups (typically defined as lasting for more than 48 hours and one month respectively) can be of serious detriment to a patient's quality of life, although they are relatively uncommon. A wide range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used for the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups. However, there is little evidence as to which interventions are effective or harmful.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions used in the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups of any aetiology in adults.

Search Methods

Studies were identified from the following databases: CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and SIGLE (last search March 2012). The search strategy for all the databases searched was based on the MEDLINE search strategy presented in Appendix 1. No additional handsearching of journals was undertaken. Investigators who are known to be carrying out research in this area were contacted for unpublished data or knowledge of the grey literature.

Selection Criteria

Studies eligible for inclusion in this review were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs).

Inclusion Criteria

adults (over 18 years old) diagnosed with persistent or intractable hiccups (hiccups lasting more than 48 hours), treated with any pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention.

Exclusion Criteria

less than ten participants; no assessment of change in hiccup frequency or intensity in outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors assessed each abstract and title for relevance. Disagreement on eligibility was resolved by discussion. Where no abstract was available the full paper was obtained and assessed. We obtained full copies of the studies which met the inclusion criteria for further assessment. Two review authors independently collected data from each appropriate study and entered them into the software Review Manager 5. Two independent review authors assessed the risk of bias using the RevMan 5 'Risk of bias' table following guidance from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2009).

Main Results

A total of four studies (305 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All of these studies sought to determine the effectiveness of different acupuncture techniques in the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups. All four studies had a high risk of bias, did not compare the intervention with placebo, and failed to report side effects or adverse events for either the treatment or control groups. Due to methodological differences we were unable to perform a meta-analysis of the results. No studies investigating pharmacological interventions for persistent and intractable hiccups met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to guide the treatment of persistent or intractable hiccups with either pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions. The paucity of high quality studies indicate a need for randomised placebo-controlled trials of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. As the symptom is relatively rare, trials would need to be multi-centred and possibly multi-national.

### Chronic hiccups: an underestimated problem [^111RnZwf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Persistent singultus, hiccupping that lasts for longer than 48 hours, can have a tremendous impact on a patient's quality of life. Although involved neurologic structures have been identified, the function of hiccups remains unclear-they have been controversially interpreted as a primitive reflex preventing extent swallowing of amniotic fluid in utero, an archaic gill ventilation pattern, or a fetus' preparation for independent breathing. Persistent singultus often presents as a symptom for various diseases, most commonly illnesses of the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract; they can also be evoked by a variety of pharmacological agents. It is often impossible to define a singular cause. A wide range of treatment attempts, pharmacological and nonpharmacological, have been concerted to this date; however, chlorpromazine remains the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug in this context. Large-scale studies on efficacy and tolerance of other therapeutic strategies are lacking. Gabapentin, baclofen, and metoclopramide have been reported to accomplish promising results in reports on the therapy of persistent singultus; they may also be effective when given in combination with other drugs, eg, proton pump inhibitors, or as conjoined therapy. As another approach of note, acupuncture treatment was able to abolish hiccups in a number of studies. When managing hiccup patients within the clinical routine, it is of importance to conduct a comprehensive and effective diagnostic workup; a well-functioning interdisciplinary team is needed to address possible causes for the symptom. Persistent singultus is a medical problem not to be underestimated; more research on options for effective treatment would be greatly needed.

As to the therapeutic measures of intractable hiccups, a wide range of treatment attempts have been conducted, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to this date. However, chlorpromazine remains the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug in this context due to the lack of large-scale studies on efficacy and tolerance of other therapeutic strategies. Gabapentin, baclofen and metoclopramide have been reported to accomplish promising results in reports on the therapy of persistent singultus; they may also be effective when given in combination with other drugs, for example, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics or as conjoined therapy. As another approach of note, acupuncture treatment was able to abolish hiccups in a number of studies. In therapy-refractory cases, invasive procedures such as the selective phrenic nerve block are available. More studies are needed to help deal with the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that hiccups presents for clinicians. Finally, we successfully saved the patient's life with artificial ventilation under general anaesthesia to correct respiratory failure as well as intractable hiccups.

Implications

Chronic hiccups may be a serious therapeutic problem. Pharmacological treatment with increasing dosages of baclofen, carbamazepine, or gabapentin is not always successful. In this paper, the use of general anesthesia with positive-pressure ventilation and muscle relaxation for the termination of chronic hiccups is described.

INTRODUCTION

Hiccups are familiar to everyone; they are repetitive contractions of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. The classification of hiccups is based on their duration. An acute attack lasts less than 48 hours. Persistent hiccups last more than 2 days. Intractable hiccups are present if the attack lasts more than 1 month. Hiccups are more common in diseases affecting the gastrointestinal or central nervous systems. Among the causes of hiccups, toxic and pharmacological drug use, and recent surgical operations are included. Ear–nose–throat (ENT), cardiovascular, and pulmonary disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system are also among the causes of hiccups. Hiccups are rarely described as a clinical manifestation of community-acquired pneumonia, and one should consider this diagnosis in a patient with unexplained fever. Rarely, pneumonia manifests as intractable hiccups, with the latter resolving with antibiotic treatment. Whenever possible, the treatment of hiccups should be directed at the underlying cause of the condition. Several pharmacological agents (metoclopramide, baclofen, gabapentin, and chlorpromazine) are reported for empirical treatment of persistent hiccups. Two large case series from 1950s documented the efficacy of chlorpromazine for cessation of persistent hiccups.

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was designated by the WHO in February 2020, and the pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes SARS has spread throughout the world. The most frequently reported symptoms are fever, dry cough, muscle pain, fatigue, and complicated dyspnea, with less commonly reported symptoms of headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, rhinorrhea, and cough with phlegm. The first case of a COVID-19 infection presenting with persistent hiccups was reported by Prince et al. Bakheet et al.reported that hiccup attacks could be more severe and prolonged.

We describe two male patients who presented with COVID-19-related hiccups: one during his initial presentation and one 10 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^114aGCUY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Persistent hiccups after ESI or interventional pain procedures can be treated with conservative measures and non-pharmacologic methods, with escalation to therapy with baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, other antipsychotic or antidopaminergic agents and possible dual or triple therapy if further indicated. Hiccups are a rare occurrence after ESIs at any level, and patients should be advised that they are benign and have been reported to resolve after conservative and pharmacologic therapy. Patients should also be counseled that hiccups can occur even if prior epidural steroid injections were tolerated without adverse effects.

A chest X-ray was acquired after the patient's respiratory examination. On the same day, chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and small ground-glass nodules were seen, scattered across the two lungs, suggesting viral pneumonia (Figure 1). One day later, a real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the patient's throat swab sample indicated SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hospitalized the patient with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We found that our patient had moderate pneumonia according to the WHO's classification. During hospitalization, Favipiravir (day 1, 2 × 1,600-mg loading dose; afterwards days 2–5, 2 × 600 mg) antiviral treatment was added to the treatment, and dexamethasone and azithromycin (day 1, 1 × 500-mg loading dose; days 2–5, 1 × 250 mg) therapy were used as recommended in the COVID-19 guidelines. The patient's hiccups did not improve for 2 days after treatment initiation and he had insomnia. Chlorpromazine was started for resistant hiccups, which disappeared 12 hours after treatment. Chlorpromazine treatment of hiccups continued for 3 days and there was no complaint after discontinuation of chlorpromazine. After 10 days of treatment, the patient's symptoms improved significantly and he recovered, as shown with negative RT-PCR. The patient returned for a follow-up 2 months after discharge and reported no recurrent hiccups. Control chest CT scan is shown in Figure 1.

Case 2.

A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension controlled with ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine presented to the pulmonology department with persistent hiccups. The patient had a history of childhood poliomyelitis; he reported no alcohol intake and did not smoke. The patient disclosed that he had been hospitalized and treated with RT-PCR for positive COVID-19 pneumonia 15 days previously. At that time, he was treated with Favipiravir, Plaquenil, Ceftriaxone, and Enoxaparin, as recommended in the COVID-19 guidelines. During last 2 days of hospitalization he developed persistent hiccups and was discharged with metoclopramide. Chest CT scans are shown in Figure 2. The scans are from his first hospital admission.

### Rare clinical manifestation of community-acquired pneumonia [^115RhEiH]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old patient was admitted due to fever and persistent (> 48hours) hiccups. History and physical examination were not instructive. Lab tests were not specific, showing an inflammatory response. Chest film did not demonstrate opacities. The patient was treated with chlorpromazine with no relief. Fever and hiccups persisted, and therefore neck and chest CT was performed revealing a right lower lobe infiltrate, a finding consistent with pneumonia. Antibiotics were initiated and within 48hours fever and hiccups resolved and patient recovered. Although hiccups are rarely described as a clinical manifestation of community acquired pneumonia, one should consider this diagnosis in a patient with unexplained fever.

### Singultus: avoiding a hiccup in care [^112UMJpV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Hiccups (singultus) is often a benign, common and self- limited condition. A case of profound electrolyte disturbances presenting with chief complaint of hiccups is presented in which chlorpromazine was not administered and could have been problematic had it been given. For those who present to the ED with chief complaint of hiccups, it is critical to consider a life threatening etiology as the cause of their symptom. This case presents a potential pitfall in the management of singultus.

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^113phDus]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous hiccups during surgery not only affect the surgical procedure, they can also cause adverse effects for the patient. Apart from active investigation of the cause of the hiccups, their timely termination is also necessary.

Case Presentation

We reported a case of a 70-year-old woman with continuous intraoperative hiccups that appeared during vaginal hysterectomy under low continuous epidural anesthesia. After the ineffectiveness CO 2 repeated inhalation and intravenous administration of chlorpromazine and methoxychlorpromide, we performed unilateral phrenic nerve block under ultrasound guidance. Hiccups were terminated without any related complications.

Conclusions

During intraoperative continuous hiccups, ultrasound guided phrenic nerve block may be a suitable treatment option when physical methods and drug therapy are not effective. However, given the absence of a vital risk related to hiccups, this block should imply the complete absence of any respiratory contraindication and a prolonged postoperative respiratory monitoring.

### Persistent hiccups – A rare complication of suprahepatic inferior vena cava stenting [^116uBsqx]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Persistent hiccups has not been reported previously with suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) stenting. Persistent hiccups after palliative oesophageal stenting has been reported. We present a case of a 41-year-old male patient diagnosed with primary Budd-Chiari syndrome who underwent IVC stenting for suprahepatic IVC stenosis. Patient developed transient hiccups post procedure which settled immediately with medications. Patient developed a recurrence of symptoms after a year due to stent migration which led to redo stenting. Post-procedure, the patient developed persistent hiccups which could not be controlled by physiological methods or chlorpromazine and needed baclofen at a dose of 10mg three times a day. The patient has been symptom-free for the past 2years. Persistent hiccups may present as a rare complication of suprahepatic IVC stenting due to extrinsic phrenic nerve compression or by direct irritation of the diaphragm. Baclofen has been effective in terminating persistent hiccups in our case.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^112mjCk6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Pneumonia may rarely present with persistent hiccups, and hiccups may disappear after antibiotic treatment. A review of the literature reveals very few reported cases of pneumonia presenting with hiccups. Burdette and Marinellasuggested that inflammatory pneumonic irritation of the phrenic nerve and its pericardial branch, which are located along the superior portion of the diaphragm and right heart border, respectively, may be the pathophysiological cause of hiccups.

The first case of COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with persistent hiccups was reported by Prince et al. A 62-year-old woman presented with a 4-day history of hiccups. Ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities compatible with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were noted on chest X-ray and CT scan. Bakheet et al.reported a patient in whom hiccup attacks were more severe and prolonged (from 1 week before admission to 1 week afterward). He showed improvement after a baclofen dosage increase toward the end of his first week after admission, and he later proved to be COVID-19 negative. A small number of other case reports with atypical presentation of COVID-19 pneumonia with hiccups have been published.

One of our patients presented to the neurology department for hiccups, similar to other reports in the literature. Radiology and PCR confirmed a COVID-19 diagnosis. His persistent hiccups responded well to chlorpromazine and regressed within hours. After 2 months, his COVID-19 infection had resolved and there was no recurrence of hiccups. Our second patient is the first reported in the literature (to our knowledge) with a 15-day history of hospital treatment for COVID — without hiccups — who presented 2 days after discharge with persistent hiccups. Clinicians should be aware of the atypical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in patients in epidemic areas.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^116CMHFN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given that hiccups can emerge after diverse interventional pain procedures and can be distressing to patients, a modified management algorithm was devised for patients experiencing singultus (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Modified management algorithm for singultus after interventional pain procedures

Although there is limited supporting data to advocate for a specific pharmacologic treatment, historically baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine have been recommended for singultus. However, given that many pain management patients are already on gabapentin and pregabalin, baclofen may be a better first-line agent unless there is concern over its potential side effects. Baclofen has been shown to lead to full cessation of persistent hiccups within the first six days of treatment in 34 of 35 cases, whereas Gabapentin led to cessation in 81 of 83 cases with a duration of therapy ranging up to six months. Furthermore, if patients fail treatment with any first-line agent chlorpromazine should be elected since it is the only medication approved for this indication and has shown efficacy in previous reported cases. Patients treated with chlorpromazine should be monitored due to a higher risk for side effects such as sedation, palpitations, syncope, extrapyramidal symptoms, and dermatologic reactions. If a patient complains of reflux there should be a strong consideration for a proton-pump inhibitor such as omeprazole.

Providers should counsel patients that singultus is a rare adverse effect of ESIs and should be ready to treat the outcome should it occur. Given that singultus typically resolves with pharmacologic therapy or within a couple weeks after the ESI, providers should refer patients to other specialists, including a Neurologist, if symptoms continue beyond this timeframe. Advanced imaging should be considered in any patient with refractory singultus after an image-guided pain procedure.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^112paKD6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed non-pharmacologic therapies and "cures" for singultus encompass various approaches involving nasopharyngeal stimulation (e.g. inhalation of smelling salts, uvular stimulation), glottic stimulation (e.g. drinking multiple sips of water, chewing lemon, inhaling pepper), vagal maneuvers (e.g. fright induction, application of cold compresses), or respiratory techniques (e.g. breath-holding, rebreathing). Other options involve hypnosis, massage, electrotherapy, and acupuncture (i.e. auricular), although limited bias-free studies exist on acupuncture due to undefined study population characteristics.

A lack of high-quality evidence hampers advocating a specific pharmacologic treatment for singultus. Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole have been suggested as first-line therapy for persistent hiccups since as many as 80% of cases may be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease. Baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine are also considered effective treatments for singultus. Other agents such as antipsychotics or antidopaminergics are recommended based on anecdotal cases, and combination therapy can also be considered. Since baclofen, gabapentin, and pregabalin have a lower side effect profile they are typically recommended after proton-pump inhibitors, with metoclopramide, then chlorpromazine following. However, chlorpromazine is the only pharmacologic agent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hiccups. Chlorpromazine antagonizes dopamine in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to its role in treating singultus.

### High dose of prokinetics for refractory hiccups after chemotherapy or the return to a simple drug [^116tPo4p]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Hiccups in patients with cancer might be difficult to treat, impacting negatively on the quality of life. Many therapies are available, but they are usually started empirically, and often they are unsuccessful. We report a case of a man with metastatic colon cancer who after the first cycle of chemotherapy developed persistent hiccups refractory to neuroleptics and low dose of metoclopramide. After searching for the potential cause, a high dose of prokinetics was initiated in the hospital and his symptoms disappeared. This case shows how searching for potential causes helps start the right treatment immediately, and therefore it is relevant for the prompt relief from this bothersome symptom. So far, no cases reporting high doses of prokinetics to treat persistent hiccups after chemotherapy have been published. This option should be taken into account when developing hiccups and gastro-oesophageal reflux after chemotherapy, especially if low doses of prokinetics have already been tried.

### Perspectives on the medical, quality of life, and economic consequences of hiccups [^116SHbis]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Singultus or hiccups (HU) is a common, usually temporary, event. Its potentially serious consequences are often overlooked. This review explores published evidence describing HU burden (clinical, economic, and quality of life [QoL] consequences) across patient populations.

Recent Findings

Literature review identified 81 articles (including 57 individual case reports). We extracted relevant information to better understand the burden of HU and to identify knowledge gaps for future study. HU are physiologic events that can complicate existing medical conditions and treatments regardless of duration. Relatively short episodes can have devastating consequences in patients who have pre-existing conditions. HU appear to impact physical and psychological health, diminish QoL, increase healthcare resource use, and increase costs. A better understanding of HU burden is needed.

### Vagus nerve stimulation for chronic intractable hiccups. case report [^113grWJp]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Intractable hiccups are debilitating and usually a result of some underlying disease. Initial management includes vagal maneuvers and pharmacotherapy. When hiccups persist despite medical therapy, surgical intervention rarely is pursued. Cases described in the literature cite successful phrenic nerve blockade, crush injury, or percutaneous phrenic nerve pacing. The authors report on a case of intractable hiccups occurring after a posterior fossa stroke, Complete resolution of the spasms has been achieved to date following the placement of a vagus nerve stimulator.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^116LyKvG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cervical epidural steroid injections (ESIs) can provide effective pain management for patients suffering from chronic neck pain due to various pathological changes of the cervical spine. There are several rare adverse effects reported from interventional pain procedures, including persistent hiccups ("singultus"). Based on a limited number of cases, we propose a modified treatment algorithm for this adverse outcome (Fig. 3).

Case report

Singultus has been documented as an adverse effect of interventional pain procedures, including epidural steroid, facet joint, and sacroiliac joint injections. We describe the case of a general contractor who presented to our clinic with chronic neck pain and central canal stenosis. The patient received an uncomplicated lumbar ESI in the past and was recommended for a cervical interlaminar ESI. After an uneventful C6-C7 interlaminar ESI with dexamethasone, 1% lidocaine, and normal saline the patient developed singultus. Baclofen was sent to his pharmacy, but this was unsuccessful at alleviating his hiccups. The patient was subsequently started on chlorpromazine and found relief from his symptomatology.

Conclusion

Persistent hiccups after ESI or interventional pain procedures can be treated with conservative measures and non-pharmacologic methods, with escalation to therapy with baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, other antipsychotic or antidopaminergic agents, and possible dual or triple therapy if further indicated.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^111jR5GP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy remains an important approach in cancer treatment, and hiccups are a common and clinically significant complication. However, they are often underestimated or underrecognized. Studies have shown that the incidence of hiccups after chemotherapy ranges from approximately 30–54% in patients with different cancer types or treatment regimens. This symptom not only affects patients' quality of life but may also interfere with the treatment process in some cases. Chemotherapy-associated hiccups can be classified as acute (lasting less than 48 h), persistent (lasting more than 48 h but less than a month), or refractory (lasting more than a month), with acute hiccups being particularly bothersome. One study also indicates that hiccups may occur outside the typical risk window, potentially affecting patients in the long term.

Currently, clinical interventions for acute hiccups in patients undergoing chemotherapy fall into two main categories: non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological interventions are usually based on physical mechanisms or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theories, aiming to relieve symptoms by stimulating specific nerves or muscle groups. In contrast, pharmacological treatments primarily act by modulating neurotransmitter levels or altering gastrointestinal motility. Systematic reviews and expert consensus recommend initiating management with non-pharmacological treatments for acute hiccups, escalating to pharmacological options if necessary. Despite the variety of available therapies, many are not consistently effective. Some pharmacological agents have notable side effects, limiting their use in vulnerable populations, such as chemotherapy patients. Moreover, there is a lack of high-quality clinical studies to support evidence-based recommendations.

In recent years, non-pharmacological behavioral-physical interventions have drawn growing attention for their potential to alleviate acute CIH. Preliminary studies have yielded promising results; however, further data are needed to confirm their efficacy and safety. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a patient-directed behavioral-physical intervention model for managing acute hiccups during chemotherapy.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^116ZaThT]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent and persistent bouts of hiccups impact the quality of life by interfering with eating, social interaction and work. Popular home remedies, such as breath holding and drinking ice water, target activity in the vagal and phrenic nerves that are thought to trigger these repetitive, myoclonic contractions. However, the pathophysiology of hiccups and the mechanism by which any of these methods work are unclear. Indeed, so little is known that there is no agreement whether the 'Hic' sound is due to the abrupt closure of the epiglottis or the glottis, including the vocal cords.

Investigations were performed in a 50-year-old, otherwise healthy male with recurrent hiccups, in whom contractions persisted for up to 4 hours. Hiccups were initiated by drinking carbonated soda. The aerodigestive tract was visualised by video fluoroscopy. Hiccups were terminated by drinking a non-viscous contrast agent through a forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool. This device requires significant suction pressure (−100 mm Hg) to draw fluid into the mouth and is effective in approximately 90% of cases. The images were analysed together with concurrent audio recordings to gain insight into 'what causes the 'hic' in hiccups' and how this commonplace but annoying problem can be treated.

### Chlorpromazine hci [^112Dhqea]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Persistent hiccups as an atypical presenting complaint of COVID-19 [^115BAsiQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hiccups (singultus) are reflex inspiratory movements that involve the swallowing reflex arc and can be classified as acute (< 48 h) or persistent (> 48 h). A 62-year-old man with no history of malignancy or pulmonary disease presented to the Emergency Department with a four-day history of persistent hiccups. Other than episodic hiccupping, his physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. An abnormal chest X-ray led to a CT scan of the chest with IV contrast, which demonstrated regional, peripheral groundglass opacities of the upper lobes with small focal groundglass opacities scattered throughout the lungs. He was tested for COVID-19 per admission protocol, started on hydroxychloroquine, his hiccups improved, and he was discharged to home after 3 days. An emergency medicine physician should keep COVID-19 on the differential and be vigilant of exposure in atypical presentations.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) of the phrenic nerve for intractable hiccups: a novel use case report [^113WQggr]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intractable hiccups, defined as those persisting for over 1month, represent a rare but significant clinical challenge often associated with substantial morbidity and refractory to standard treatments.

Case Presentation

This case report describes the innovative use of phrenic nerve peripheral neuromodulation for managing chronic intractable hiccups in a 73-year-old male patient with a 6-year history of daily hiccups. Conventional treatments and interventional procedures had failed to provide lasting relief. Bilateral phrenic nerve peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) placed under ultrasound guidance resulted in immediate and substantial improvement, with the patient's Hiccup Assessment Instrument score decreasing from 6/10 to 2/10. The patient experienced significant enhancements in speech and quality of life without complications.

Conclusions

This novel application of phrenic nerve PNS highlights its potential as a therapeutic strategy for intractable hiccups, underscoring their pathophysiologic involvement of the diaphragm and respiratory muscles. The findings suggest that phrenic nerve PNS could offer a viable treatment option for patients unresponsive to conventional therapies, warranting further research to establish its long-term efficacy and safety.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^1113GRrG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In our case, the decision to initiate baclofen followed by chlorpromazine for pharmacologic treatment was based on the available literature. Baclofen monotherapy has been shown to alleviate intractable hiccups, even those developed after ESI. Additionally, in one case report chlorpromazine 10 mg every six hours resolved singultus after a cervical ESI by the following day. In the case series by Abbasi et al. one patient experienced complete resolution of hiccups after one dose of chlorpromazine 10 mg, whereas another failed metoclopramide therapy and experienced resolution after starting chlorpromazine. However, in another case, a patient received haloperidol 5 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg, and gabapentin 300 mg every eight hours for singultus following a cervical ESI. Despite treatment by three agents, the patient experienced no relief, and the hiccups gradually resolved thirteen days after the procedure. The literature suggests that this adverse outcome is typically resolved with pharmacologic treatment or self-limited to two weeks. Reassuringly, singultus that develops after an ESI does not appear to necessitate invasive treatments such as vagus nerve stimulation or phrenic nerve blockade.

### Persistent hiccups after attempted interscalene brachial plexus block [^117JW3YU]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We describe a case of persistent hiccups after attempted interscalene brachial plexus block.

Case Report

A 38-year-old man was admitted for arthroscopic repair of a right shoulder injury. An interscalene block was attempted in the preoperative area and combined with general anesthesia for surgery. The procedure lasted 5(1/4) hours. After transfer to the recovery room, the patient complained of severe right shoulder pain and had no discernible sensory or motor block. He was noted to be hiccuping. The patient was discharged home the following morning but returned 2 days later complaining of persistent hiccups since surgery, with associated insomnia and nausea. He was readmitted and given chlorpromazine 50 mg intravenously every 8 hours and metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously every 6 hours. The patient was discharged 4 days later on chlorpromazine 25 mg by mouth every 8 hours and baclofen 5 mg by mouth every 12 hours, with hiccups greatly reduced in both intensity and frequency. Hiccups ceased 1 day after discharge. Eighteen days after surgery, he was off all medication with no return of his hiccups; 1 month later he remains hiccup free.

Conclusions

Persistent hiccups have many postulated causes, including several that are common in the perioperative period, but this is the first time to our knowledge that persistent hiccups have been described in association with attempted interscalene brachial plexus block.

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^115zQSWr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

A hiccup is an involuntary spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, which is an unconscious spinal reflex and has a complete reflex arc. The afferent nerves are the phrenic nerve, vagus nerve, and sympathetic nerve (T6 – T12), and the reflex center consists of the brainstem, phrenic nucleus, medullary reticular formation, and hypothalamus. The efferent nerves are the phrenic nerve and intercostal nerves, and the effectors comprise of the diaphragm, intercostal muscle, and anterior scalene muscle. There are various causes of hiccups, and the most common are diseases located in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous pathways and digestive system diseases.

In the current patient, who had continuous hiccups during surgery, the cause may be related to uterine stretching during gynecological surgery, which caused stretching of other organs and tissues in the abdominal cavity and stimulation of the phrenic nerve leading to causing spasm of the diaphragm. In addition, hiccups may occur when, as a result of anxiety, a patient swallows a lot of cold air into the stomach before surgery. It has been reported that bupivacaine epidural anesthesia could also induce hiccups.

Continuous hiccups during surgery is a rare phenomenon; however, it can severely influence both the patient and the surgical procedure. Stuth et al. reported a case where continuous hiccups induced pulmonary edema, and Rullo et al. reported a case in which continuous hiccups caused left common iliac artery perforation. Therefore, timely termination of continuous hiccups during surgery is essential.

Various methods can be used for treating hiccups, including physical treatment (rebreathing carbon dioxide), drug treatment (chlorpromazine), and nerve block. When physical and pharmacological treatments are not successful, a phrenic nerve block may be a good option; it can quickly block the hiccup reflex pathway and terminate the hiccups. As the phrenic nerve is thin, blind puncture has a higher failure rate, and may easily damage the nerve, blood vessels, and peripheral tissues. A high-resolution ultrasound scan can accurately distinguish the phrenic nerve and its surrounding anatomy. As a result, phrenic nerve block under ultrasound guidance has an improved success rate and can also decrease the damage to nearby nerves and blood vessels. Furthermore, it has been reported that five cancer patients with intractable hiccups underwent unilateral phrenic nerve block under ultrasound guidance and all patients had satisfactory results without any complications.

### Treatment of hiccup during general anaesthesia or sedation: a qualitative systematic review [^116G85Hw]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Acute hiccup is a minor complication that can occur during sedation or general anaesthesia. The disorder can disturb the surgical field, might interfere with lung ventilation or could hamper diagnostic procedures. The objective was to perform a systematic search for interventions aimed at treating hiccup occurring during anaesthesia or sedation.

Methods

A systematic search for reports describing interventions to treat hiccup in conjunction with anaesthesia was carried out (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane-Library, manual screening of reference lists and review articles, up to December 2001). Search terms were 'hiccup', 'singultus' or 'hiccough'.

Results

Twenty-six reports involving approximately 581 patients focused on hiccup remedies in the anaesthesia setting. Only one report was substantiated by a randomized controlled trial. This investigated methylphenidate 10 mg intravenously in 51 patients, which did not show a beneficial effect compared with placebo. Hiccup was a self-limiting phenomenon. Case series and case reports focused on various systemically applied drugs in 12 reports, stimulating techniques (e.g. pharyngeal stimulation) in seven, topical applied remedies (e.g. intranasal ice-cold water) in four, and ventilation techniques (e.g. continuous positive pressure ventilation) in two.

Conclusions

A large variety of interventions have been proposed for the treatment of hiccup during anaesthesia and sedation. However, perioperative treatment is still based on empirical findings and no treatment is 'evidence-based'. Thus, no valid recommendations for the treatment of hiccup can be derived. Uncontrolled observations are inadequate to establish treatment efficacy.

### Successful treatment of intractable hiccup with methylphenidate in a lung cancer patient [^114pcSoc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

In a 56-year-old man with metastatic small-cell lung cancer, a persistent hiccup was refractory to classic treatments. Hyponatremia, neoplasic mediastinal involvement and liver metastases were though to be potential causative factors. Methylphenidate (MTP), a mild central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is most commonly used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was started at a daily dose of 10 mg. It was rapidly efficient and well tolerated. This report suggests a potential advantage of MTP in the treatment of intractable hiccup in cancer patients.

The purpose of this report is to increase awareness of central nervous system lesions as a possible cause for recurrent hiccups and provide an illustrative case of an otherwise fit man presenting with ongoing hiccups caused by a medullary haemangioblastoma.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^1169qLyG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of CIH varies widely, with reported rates ranging from 15 to 40%, depending on tumor type and treatment regimen. Cisplatin-containing regimens, in particular, have been associated with hiccups in up to 28.6% of patients. Additionally, while novel drugs like NK1-RAs (neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist) can relieve some chemotherapy-related side effects such as constipation and insomnia, they also introduce new risks, including diarrhea and hiccups. While hiccups are typically transient, some patients experience persistent or refractory episodes, which can significantly impact quality of life, causing sleep disturbances, reduced appetite, and difficulty in speaking or social interactions. In severe cases, prolonged hiccups may even necessitate modifications in chemotherapy regimens, highlighting the need for better prevention and management strategies.

Furthermore, a prior study indicated that over 20% of cancer patients experience hiccups during chemotherapy, and if poorly controlled, these may persist beyond the acute phase. Certain malignancies appear to have a higher association with hiccups, particularly gastrointestinal and lung cancers, where studies have reported CIH incidences of 54.1% and 31.6%, respectively. Our study further identified key risk factors for CIH, revealing that alcohol consumption, tumor type, and platinum-based chemotherapy significantly influenced hiccups' occurrence.

The prior study found that patients are willing to learn about hiccups after chemotherapy. Learning seems to reduce the incidence of hiccups, but its primary endpoint is not an efficacy indicator and cannot directly reflect the effect of relieving hiccups. The current study directly assessed the use and efficacy of six non-pharmacological behavioral-physical interventions in hiccups. In contrast, our study design focused more on patient involvement, validated the effect of the pre-learning intervention on hiccup remission, and further explored its effect on the improvement of anxiety and depression levels in patients and their families. Therefore, this study, building on the prior study, provides more direct evidence to support primary research data on the clinical use of non-pharmacological interventions in the management of hiccups.

### Aripiprazole-induced hiccups: a case report [^116h2ffb]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Hiccups can arise from idiopathic, psychogenic and organic causes. The use of therapeutic drugs forms one of the important causes of hiccups. Although the exact pathophysiological processes involved have not yet been established, the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and gamma amino butyric aid (GABA) have been documented to play a significant role in the generation of hiccups. We report a patient of organic bipolar affective disorder who developed hiccups with the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole. The possible underlying neurotransmitter mechanisms, predisposing factors and clinical implications of this rare adverse event are discussed.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^1154SCPP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

To optimize individualized hiccup management, future research should consider patient preferences and intervention adherence. Moreover, the potential link between hiccup control and psychological well-being warrants further investigation. Autonomic nervous system regulation and symptom-related stress reduction may play key roles in mediating this relationship. Future studies should focus on clarifying causal pathways between symptom relief and psychological benefits, utilizing longitudinal research and neurophysiological assessments.

As a preliminary interventional study in the field of CIH, this research has several limitations. The study adopted an open-label design, and the primary endpoint was self-reported by patients, making it difficult to implement blinding. These factors may have introduced observer bias and social desirability bias. Additionally, the randomized sequence of intervention methods presented in the manual and instructional video may have led patients to preferentially select certain techniques, potentially affecting the assessment of the overall effectiveness of other methods and the intervention model as a whole. The current findings suggest only that the intervention model may be feasible and potentially effective in alleviating CIH; however, both the model and specific techniques require further validation through more rigorously designed studies. Future research will aim to optimize the study design by introducing appropriate blinding, evaluating each intervention method separately, and incorporating objective monitoring tools such as diaphragmatic electromyography to accurately record hiccup events and assess intervention efficacy.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^1138frmP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-pharmacological interventions have been increasingly recognized as effective strategies for managing CIH, offering a safe and well-tolerated alternative to pharmacological treatments. Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various behavioral-physical interventions, such as acupuncture, breath-holding, deep breathing exercises, and acupressure, in alleviating hiccups. Our study further validated the clinical effectiveness of these interventions, demonstrating that pre-learning and autonomous use of six behavioral-physical methods significantly shortened hiccup duration compared to standard care. Naturally, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Our previous study found that CINV in patients can significantly increase the risk of anxiety/depression in their family caregivers, so we speculate that acute hiccups in patients may also cause psychological problems in their family caregivers. In our study, the intervention group exhibited significantly lower anxiety and depression scores compared to the control group, suggesting that providing patients with the knowledge and tools to manage hiccups not only enhances their confidence but also alleviates psychological stress for both themselves and their caregivers.

### Baclofen for hiccups: a large mixed methods multisite study [^112LmBMn]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Objective

Hiccups can be bothersome and spawn morbidity. Although oral baclofen is perhaps the most prescribed agent for hiccups, a paucity of data supports its use.

Methods

This multisite, single institution study examined the medical records of patients who had hiccups and had been prescribed baclofenas noted in a clinical encounter. Mixed methods were used to assess baclofen's palliative efficacy. In view of the sometimes transient nature of hiccups and other such factors, cessation or palliation of hiccups in 75% of patients was sought to indicate true palliation.

Results

A total of 301 patients with a median age of 61 years (range 20–87 years) and a male predominance are the focus of this report. Baclofen was most often prescribed at 10mg orally three times a day. Only 105 patients (35%) (95% CI: 30% to 41%) acquired hiccup palliation. Corroborative medical record quotations included, 'Still has hiccups'. uotations such as, 'Responding to baclofen this AM', were also recorded. Baclofen appeared more likely to benefit patients with hiccups of > 48hours (chronic) duration in univariable analyses (OR for benefit: 0.51 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.91; p = 0.02) with similar conclusions drawn from multivariable analyses. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients with drowsiness the most common.

Conclusions

Baclofen did not meet this study's a priori threshold for successful hiccup palliation, but further study is indicated to learn whether baclofen might help patients with chronic hiccups.

### Carvedilol suppresses intractable hiccups [^1136acVm]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Carvedilol (6.25 mg, 4 times daily) relieved 2 years of constant hiccupping, marked tardive dyskinesia, compulsive self-induced vomiting, and feelings of hopelessness and low mood in a 59-year-old African-American man. He previously failed trials of ranitidine, chlorpromazine, promethazine, tegaserod, ondansetron, metoclopramide, pantoprazole, pyloric injections of botulinum toxin A, and a vagal nerve stimulator. At a 5-month follow-up, improvement was maintained; there had been several instances of rapid relapse on carvedilol discontinuation.

### Protracted hiccups due to severe erosive esophagitis: a case series [^113xGabi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hiccups although a common annoyance of life, have been linked with significant morbidity and even death. There are numerous causes of prolonged hiccups, including diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Hiccups are reported to represent an atypical manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Cases

We report 4 cases of prolonged hiccups in patients who failed to respond to initial treatment with abortive neurologic medications and who subsequently improved on proton-pump inhibitors. Endoscopic examination revealed severe reflux esophagitis.

Conclusion

Hiccups are an atypical manifestation and may represent a more severe course of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^116ffCW2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent and persistent bouts of hiccups impact the quality of life by interfering with eating, social interaction and work. These repetitive, myoclonic contractions are maintained by a reflex arc that consists of an afferent sensory limb (includes vagus nerve and sympathetic chain), an integration centre in the spinal cord and brainstem, and an efferent motor limb that involves the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and accessory nerves to the intercostal muscles. This activity draws air into the lungs that is, within a few milliseconds, interrupted by closure of the upper airway producing the characteristic sound, the 'hic' in hiccups. Popular home remedies, such as breath holding and drinking ice water, seek to interrupt this neuromuscular relay. However, the pathophysiology of hiccups and the mechanism by which any of these methods work are unclear. Indeed, so little is known that there is no agreement whether the 'Hic' sound is due to the abrupt closure of the epiglottis or the glottis, including the vocal cords.

Investigations were performed in a 50-year-old, otherwise healthy male with recurrent hiccups, in whom contractions can persist for up to 4 hours. This unique experiment was possible because hiccups could be reproducibly initiated in this volunteer by drinking carbonated soda. The aerodigestive tract was visualised using video-fluoroscopy by drinking a non-viscous, barium sulfate suspension through a 'forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool' (FISST). This device has been described previously and patients report that its use terminates hiccups in more than 90% of cases (figure 1).FISST uses Bernoulli's principle to generate a high-negative, intrathoracic, suction pressure (−100 cmH₂O). This draws fluid through a small orifice in a rigid drinking tube into the mouth, an action that is immediately followed by swallowing. The images were analysed together with simultaneous audio recordings to gain insight into 'what causes the 'hic' in hiccups' (video 1).

### Intradermal injection for hiccup therapy in the emergency department [^1126K32Z]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hiccup is a condition caused by involuntary contraction of inspiratory muscles, especially the diaphragm. Although it is generally considered as a physiological. response, if hiccup persists for a long time, it can lead to many undesirable conditions such as depression, weight loss, insomnia, and fatigue. A 35-year-old male patient was admitted to our emergency department with hiccup lasting for 15 h. He had a history of several hiccup attacks. Classical non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies were used to treat the condition without any response. As an alternative method, an intradermal injection was applied. A mixture of thiocolchicoside and lidocaine was administered intradermally to a depth of 1–3 mm at the epigastric region and adjacent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient's hiccup ended after the intradermal injection procedure. During 48 h of follow-up the hiccup attack did not develop again. No complications related to the process were detected. This is the first case in the literature demonstrating the use of intradermal injection to terminate hiccups. The intradermal injection approach can be administered in cases of hiccups that do not respond to medical treatment.

Thyroid function tests.

On the second day of hospitalization, the patient exhibited extremely sudden hiccups, profuse sweating and nausea with a high fever (39.8°C). Her heart rate was 170 beats/min (sinus rhythm). The following was sequentially implemented: fever control, metoclopramide (10 mg injection intramuscular bid), omeprazole (40 mg intravenous guttae q12h), hydrotalcite, domperidone, promethazine (25 mg injection intramuscular bid), chlorpromazine (500 mg intravenous guttae q12h), acupuncture, continuous infusion of traditional herbal drugs (Yi Wei Tang, the soup beneficial to stomach), esmolol (intravenous guttae 0.05 mg/kg per min–0.25 mg/kg per min) and rhubarb enema. Intractable hiccups were not controlled but progressively worsened. Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no acute haemorrhagic or ischaemic lesions. Abdominal computed tomography scan, chest X-ray and cerebrospinal fluid examination also were negative. On the fourth day of hospitalization, the intractable hiccups progressively worsened, accompanied by mental changes. TS was diagnosed based on the Burch–Wartofsky score (total score of 60). The patient was immediately treated with hydrocortisone (100 mg/6 h), propylthiouracil (200 mg/6 h), propranolol (20 mg/8 h), paracetamol and intravenous fluids. On the sixth day of hospitalization, her intractable hiccups were still not controlled and she developed respiratory failure. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation quickly decreased to 47% (under continuous and high flux inhalation of oxygen with a facemask). Tracheal intubation was immediately performed, with artificial ventilation, and the patient became tranquil and calm. Her hiccups gradually slowed. De-ventilator and extubation were conducted after 1 week of treatment. According to the clinical manifestations and experimental examination results, Graves' disease (Table 2, Figure 1) was definitively diagnosed. The dosages of hydrocortisone, propranolol and propylthiouracil were reduced gradually, and her free T4 and T3 levels were nearly normal after 16 days of therapy (Table 2). She was maintained on a treatment with propylthiouracil (with a discharge dose of 100 mg bid) and propranolol (with 20 mg tid). She had completely recovered from her intractable hiccups 2 weeks later, and her metabolic parameters of diabetes had improved significantly. Her pulse rate was 84 beats/min, blood pressure was 118/70 mmHg, and temperature was 36.5°C when she was discharged. After a 1-year follow-up in the endocrinology department, the patient had no recurrence of hiccups.

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^116ksVSf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

The patient involved has consented to the publication of her case and signed the consent form. A 70-year-old woman was hospitalized for third degree uterine prolapse in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine on February 10, 2016. Vaginal hysterectomy under continuous epidural anesthesia was indicated. She was rated class I risk using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) criteria and did not have any cardiopulmonary dysfunction or gastrointestinal disease. The preoperative blood tests were normal. The arterial blood pressure (ABP) was 145/85 mmHg. The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured using pulse oximetry was 98%. The heart rate (HR) was 70 beats per minute. The results of the blood gas analysis, performed after the patient entered the operating room, were as follows: arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), 90 mmHg; and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), 39 mmHg. The patient was placed in the left lateral position, and a continuous epidural anesthesia was performed in the L2 – L3 space. After successful puncture, a catheter was inserted in cephalad direction 4 cm beyond the tip of the needle. The patient was then placed in a supine position and given oxygen continuously via nasal catheter with an oxygen flow rate of 2 L/minute. A test dose of 3 mL 1.5% lidocaine was administered through the epidural catheter, followed by 8 mL of a 1.5% lidocaine-0.5% bupivacaine mixture. Sensory block was shown to be complete within 10 min, and the upper level of the block was at the level of T8. At this time, ABP was 130/70 mmHg, SPO2 was 99%, and HR was 82 beats per minute. A continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.3 μg/kg/h was administered. The patient developed hiccups approximately 30 min after the start of surgery, about 10 times per minute at first, gradually increasing to 30 times per minute, 10 min later. At this time, ABP was 150/90 mmHg, SPO2 was 98%, and HR was 90 beats per minute. The persistent hiccups interrupted the operation. In order to terminate the hiccups, we first used repeated CO2 inhalation for 5 min, followed by intravenous injection of 25 mg chlorpromazine and 20 mg metoclopramide. There was no effect after 20 min. The abnormal movement of the diaphragm was confirmed using an ultrasound examination. It showed a spastic contraction of the patient's right diaphragm. We decided to block the right phrenic nerve under the guidance of a high resolution portable ultrasound unit (Italy, Yum Mylab One). With the patient's head towards the left, the ultrasound probe (frequency, 8 MHz) was placed on the right side of the neck. The axial scanning of the neck along the surface of the anterior scalene muscle, showed that the phrenic nerve rounded the anterior scalene muscle from the outside to the inside, and coursed through the trench between the common carotid artery and anterior scalene muscle (Fig. 1). Using an in-plane technique, when the needle was close to the phrenic nerve, 5 mL 0.4% ropivacaine was injected around the phrenic nerve. The hiccups gradually stopped after approximately 5 min. At this time, ABP was 135/75 mmHg, SPO2 was 99%, HR was 72 beats per minute, PaO2 was 88 mmHg, and PaCO2 was 41 mmHg. The patient reported no discomfort, and no related complications were observed. The operation resumed and ended 80 min later. The patient was kept in the intensive care unit for 24 h and was discharged 7 days after the surgery. No hiccups or phrenic nerve block-related complications were observed after the operation. No related complications were reported on the telephonic follow-up one month after being discharged.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^117EFmap]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

TS has been reported in 0.20 people per 100,000 in the Japanese population annually and occurs in 0.22% of patients with thyrotoxicosis.TS is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism that has a very high mortality rate of 8–25%. Symptoms and signs of endocrine crisis may overlap with those of other severe disease states. In general, failure to recognize endocrine crises results in delayed diagnosis, and a lack of rapid specific therapy may have fatal consequences. Therefore, the early identification of TS is very important to reduce the mortality rate. TS is characterized by decompensation of multiple organ functions, leading to severe clinical manifestations such as high fever, disturbed consciousness, marked tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and gastrointestinal and hepatic disturbances.TS usually occurs in patients with previously undiagnosed or poorly treated hyperthyroidism, even subclinical hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease is a leading cause of TS and may be the first clinical presentation. The usual cause of TS is associated with infection, withdrawal of anti-thyroid drugs, radioiodine therapy, surgical procedure and severe emotional stress. Common clinical manifestations are central nervous system manifestations and gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Diarrhoea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom in thyrotoxicosis as well as in TS. The literature related to TS was searched from 2016 to 2019, and the clinical characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with TS were found to mainly be nausea, and the main cause of TS to be Graves' disease with unknown or poor compliance with anti-thyroid drugs (Table 3). -

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^117Hcytx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Several limitations of the current case report should be considered. First, we did not report information on the recovery of phrenic nerve function and the timing of hemi-diaphragm movement. Second, we did not observe the spread of local anesthetics and its effect on brachial plexus under ultrasound. In addition, we did not pay attention to the effect of phrenic nerve block on other organ functions.

Continuous hiccup during surgery is a rare occurrence that can lead to severe outcomes. Hence, when choosing the methods to treat hiccups, we should consider the causes of hiccups, the surgery, and the anesthesia. This article described only one case, which was successfully treated with phrenic nerve block, a technique which may not be suitable for all cases with hiccups during surgery. Nevertheless, this case may provide relevant evidence for selecting suitable treatment strategies for treating continuous hiccups that develop during surgery.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^114iHzze]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical methods

This study adopted an open-label, randomized, and controlled trial design. Computer-generated block randomization was used, and the randomization sequence was assigned in real time by an independent statistician using SAS 9.4 software. Group allocations were generated through a centralized randomization system, and neither the researchers nor the participants could predict the assignment results prior to randomization.

Based on preliminary data from the research team, the median time to remission of acute hiccups following chemotherapy was estimated at 2.48 h. The study aimed to achieve a median remission time of 1 h following patient-directed learning of non-pharmacological behavioral-physical interventions. Sample size calculations were performed using d = 0.taking into account a significance level (α) of 0.05 and a test power (1-) of 0.80 and assuming equal proportional distribution of participants to the two groups (π = 0.5 and = 0.5). The standard normally distributed critical values for the significance level and the test power were determined: = 1.96, = 0.84. The value of stepwise calculatingis 2.8. The natural logarithm of the effect size, θR, was log(0.4) ≈ − 0.916. The sample size was calculated as the following: d ≈ 37.4, which would require approximately 38 patients per group. Considering 20% loss to follow-up, the final requirement was approximately 48 patients per group. Given the incidence of acute hiccups after chemotherapy reported in previous studies as approximately 15%–40%, it was estimated that a total of no less than 640 chemotherapy patients meeting the enrollment criteria would need to be screened.

The primary endpoint was the median time to remission of acute hiccups, defined for each patient as the interval in hours between the first hiccup and the final hiccup. Remission was established by a hiccup-free period of at least 2 h. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of anxiety and depression in patients and their family caregivers.

Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were compared using independent sample t -tests, while categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Survival plots for the duration of the treatment effect were generated using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. A P -value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Corticosteroid rotation to alleviate dexamethasone-induced hiccup: a case series at a single institution [^116QrdKq]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone, one of the key medications for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), may cause hiccups as an adverse effect. In this case series, we present five patients who developed hiccups after receiving dexamethasone for CINV. We successfully switched dexamethasone to an equipotent dosage of either methylprednisolone or prednisolone, which resolved the hiccups while maintaining adequate control of CINV. This was achieved without changing the rest of the antiemetic regimen, chemotherapy doses, or the use of other medications such as baclofen, haloperidol, and metoclopramide for hiccups. Further studies on switching dexamethasone to alternative corticosteroids in patients developing hiccups after administration of dexamethasone are warranted.

### Chlorpromazine (chlorproMAZINE hydrochloride) [^112RFc2a]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

### Alpha-2-delta ligands for singultus (hiccup) treatment: three case reports [^115tpBHB]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic idiopathic singultus (hiccup) is a debilitating condition affecting mostly elderly males. While in the past, pharmacologic singultus treatment was mostly "trial and error", more recently, treatment has become both more evidence based and pathophysiology guided. A combination of an acidity-reducing drug (H(2)-receptor blocker or proton pump inhibitor) with baclofen (gamma-amino-butyric-acid receptor type B agonist) has become the most widely used regimen. Some clinicians replace or supplement baclofen with gabapentin. We present three cases of chronic idiopathic hiccup managed with gabapentin or another alpha-2-delta ligand, pregabalin. This is the first reported use of pregabalin for this indication.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^112x4TvU]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

These 50 studies amounted to a total of > 2000 person-years of exposure to chlorpromazine or placebo. For people with this serious mental illness, and certainly in situations were resources are limited, chlorpromazine remains a first line treatment. The medium term data on improvement suggest that about 7 people have to be treated for one to have what the trialists would describe as 'global improvement' (n = 1121, 13 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 5 to 10). This outcome relates to a simple dichotomised impression of a person's mental state, behaviour and functioning. Given the limited quality of reporting and the fact that we may be only able to pool data from a subset of the included trials, even this finding may be an over estimate of the positive and an underestimate of the negative effects of giving chlorpromazine.

The increased likelihood that people given chlorpromazine continued in their trial may be heartening. It could indicate a genuine decrease in the distressing symptoms of schizophrenia that led to an increased compliance with medication, despite common and unpleasant adverse effects such as sedation and hypotension. Doctors and nurses may, at times of acute disturbance, welcome this sedative effect but people with schizophrenia may not.

Despite limitations, this review provides quantitative evidence to confirm many of the impressions held by clinicians and recipients of care about the effects of chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine is a sedating drug, prone to cause movement problems. Reliable evidence about its short-term effects is surprisingly weak, but information from studies that are > 6 months does suggest that chlorpromazine facilitates a global improvement and may decrease the likelihood of behaving in a disturbed manner, at least within the confines of hospital.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^1166o574]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The patient was admitted with signs of dehydration; she was awake and alert, ill looking, had an active position, and answered correctly to inquiries; her body mass index was 24.4 kg/m 2. Regarding vital signs, she had a body temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats/min and respiration rate of 20 times/min. The thyroid gland showed no enlargement or murmur. Her breath sound was rough. Assessments of muscular strength, visual fields and postural tremor were unremarkable.

Based on whole blood count analysis, the total amount of leucocytes was 14.61 × 10 9 /L, and the percentage of neutrophil granulocytes was 83.6%. The blood lactic acid level was 1.02 mmol/L (the normal reference range was 0.60–2.20 mmol/L). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was 0.9 mg/L, and serum procalcitonin was 0.04 ng/mL (Table 1). Urinalysis, electrocardiography, and liver and kidney function analyses were unremarkable. Thyroid ultrasound scanning showed a normal size with a heterogeneous, reduced echo and abundant flow signals, with no nodules. Thyroid function tests revealed very high tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine levels under the normal range of undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (Table 2). Immediate treatments included rehydration, anti-infection (levofloxacin, 0.6 g intravenous guttae qd), glycaemic control and anti-thyroid therapy (methimazole and propranolol). Her blood glucose was adjusted to the range of 5.0–14.0 mmol/L; blood plasma β-hydroxybutyric acid was controlled at approximately 1.1–3.8 mmol/L.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^111L8xyw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants and methods

Study design and participants

In this prospective randomized controlled trial, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy at the Oncology Center of Shangjin Hospital of West China Hospital of Sichuan University were screened for eligibility. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the BPI group or the control group. Patients in the BPI group received the Hiccup Knowledge Manual and instructional videos and were guided to learn and master six non-pharmacological behavioral-physical interventions for hiccups. They were instructed to apply these interventions independently during an acute episode of hiccups, based on their prior training. The control group received routine medical care, which includes general information about CIH and precautions during treatment, but did not involve any systematic BPI. Caregivers held a conversation with the patient prior to chemotherapy to explain the physiology, common triggers, expected duration, and potential impact of hiccups, in order to help the patient understand the symptoms.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: ① patients with malignant tumors confirmed by pathological examination; ② scheduled to receive chemotherapy; ③ planned to receive standardized prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prevention; ④ normal cognitive function; ⑤ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0–2 and full muscle strength (grade 5); and ⑥ provision of written informed consent.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: ① severe cardiopulmonary insufficiency; ② gastrointestinal bleeding; ③ coagulopathy; ④ unstable brain metastases; ⑤ history of intractable hiccups caused by cerebral infarction, traumatic brain injury, or other conditions; and ⑥ occurrence of hiccups from any cause during the week prior to enrollment.

The removal criteria were as follows: ① non-compliance as determined by the investigator; ② withdrawal of informed consent; and ③ failure to receive chemotherapy for any reason.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^1125sCPL]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Table 3
Adverse effects.

There were no reports of deaths occurring during any of the studies. Any data relating to violent incidents, hospital discharge or admissions, presence of delusions or hallucinations were either absent or impossible to use. Not one of the studies, even in recent years, reported levels of satisfaction and quality of life, nor could we identify any direct economic evaluation of chlorpromazine.

### Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia [^117ANwp6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of chlorpromazine for schizophrenia in comparison with placebo.

Search Strategy

We updated previous searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (October 1999), Biological Abstracts (1982–1995), the Cochrane Library (1999, Issue 2), EMBASE (1980–1995), MEDLINE (1966–1995), PsycLIT (1974–1995), and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (June 2002), by searching The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2007). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non-affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and quality assessed these. BT and JR extracted data. CEA and GA independently checked a 10% sample for reliability. We analysed dichotomous data using fixed effects relative risk (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. Where possible we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) statistics. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow up; where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using fixed effects weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval.

Main Results

We inspected over 1000 electronic records. The review currently includes 302 excluded studies and 50 included studies. We found chlorpromazine reduces relapse over the short (n = 74, 2 RCTs, RR 0.29 CI 0.1 to 0.8) and medium term (n = 809, 4 RCTs, RR 0.49 CI 0.4 to 0.6) but data are heterogeneous. Longer term homogeneous data also favoured chlorpromazine (n = 512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.57 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 4 CI 3 to 5). We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n = 1121, 13 RCTs, RR 'no change/not improved' 0.80 CI 0.8 to 0.9, NNT 6 CI 5 to 8). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early (n = 1780, 26 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 15 CI 11 to 24) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n = 1404, 19 RCTs, RR 2.63 CI 2.1 to 3.3, NNH 5 CI 4 to 8), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n = 942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.5 CI 1.5 to 8.0, NNH 32 CI 11 to 154), parkinsonism (n = 1265, 12 RCTs, RR 2.01 CI 1.5 to 2.7, NNH 14 CI 9 to 28). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo (n = 1164, 9 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.5 to 1.1). Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n = 1394, 16 RCTs, RR 2.37 CI 1.7 to 3.2, NNH 11 CI 7 to 21) and considerable weight gain (n = 165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.3 to 10.4, NNH 2 CI 2 to 3).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence-based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients.

### Chylous ascites and persistent hiccups as complications after laparoscopic radical nephrectomy [^115Ed6D2]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A patient in his mid-40s with a history of gastric ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease presented with 6months of left flank discomfort. He was diagnosed with stage III (cT3aN1M0) papillary renal cell carcinoma and received neoadjuvant therapy for 3 months. Follow-up imaging showed partial response with residual carcinoma and metastatic lymphadenopathies. The patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection. Postoperatively, he developed chylous ascites and subsequent persistent hiccups as unusual complications. Although chylous ascites improved gradually, the hiccups persisted despite non-pharmacological interventions and pharmacological treatments. Finally, the hiccups ceased following the removal of the J-P drain which ended up stimulating the phrenic nerve by the J-P drain at left renal fossa.

### Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia [^111NV7Mp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia.

Objectives

To review the effects of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (15 May 2012). We also searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non-affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and quality assessed these. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. We used a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We inspected over 1100 electronic records. The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow-up (n = 512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous. No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous. We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n = 1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early (n = 1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n = 1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n = 942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n = 1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo. Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n = 1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n = 165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well-established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence-based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^116q6s9h]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine (CPZ) remains one of the most common drugs used for people with schizophrenia worldwide, and a benchmark against which other treatments can be evaluated. Quantitative reviews are rare; this one evaluates the effects of chlorpromazine in the treatment of schizophrenia in comparison with placebo.

Methods

We sought all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing chlorpromazine to placebo by electronic and reference searching, and by contacting trial authors and the pharmaceutical industry. Data were extracted from selected trials and, where possible, synthesised and random effects relative risk (RR), the number needed to treat (NNT) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated.

Results

Fifty RCTs from 1955–2000 were included with 5276 people randomised to CPZ or placebo. They constitute 2008 person-years spent in trials. Meta-analysis of these trials showed that chlorpromazine promotes a global improvement (n = 1121, 13 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 5 to 10), although a considerable placebo response is also seen. People allocated to chlorpromazine tended not to leave trials early in both the short (n = 945, 16 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.5 to 1.1) and medium term (n = 1861, 25 RCTs, RR 0.79 CI 0.6 to 1.1). There were, however, many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is sedating (n = 1242, 18 RCTs, RR 2.3 CI 1.7 to 3.1, NNH 6 CI 5 to 8), increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders, Parkinsonism and causes low blood pressure with dizziness and dry mouth.

Conclusion

It is understandable why the World Health Organization (WHO) have endorsed and included chlorpromazine in their list of essential drugs for use in schizophrenia. Low- and middle-income countries may have more complete evidence upon which to base their practice compared with richer nations using recent innovations.

### Evaluation of the forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool to stop hiccups [^115eRpXV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Home remedies to relieve transient hiccups, such as breath holding, recycled breathing in a paper bag, and drinking water from the far side of a glass, are plagued by unclear instructions, inconsistent performance, and poor effectiveness. There is a need for a simple and effective method to stop hiccups. The forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool (FISST) has a low-cost design and straightforward mode of action that stimulates the phrenic and vagus nerves by inducing diaphragmatic contraction and epiglottis closure, respectively. The study hypothesis was that patients with hiccups would associate FISST with more effective termination of transient hiccups compared with home remedies.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^112aNBUg]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Inclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were defined and disseminated for peer review within a Cochrane protocol first published 1998. Articles were included if they reported RCTs where the participants had schizophrenia or non-affective serious/chronic mental illness, and where the interventions included chlorpromazine (any dose or mode of administration) versus placebo or no treatment.

Identification of relevant trials

We identified relevant randomised trials by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (June 2002), with a phrase designed to identify the many ways of naming chlorpromazine [see Additional file 1]. Citations in all identified articles were inspected for further trials. Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (the original distributors of chlorpromazine) was contacted to request access to archive material, and Dr RA Pargiter (Hobart, Tasmania) donated a large series of May and Baker chlorpromazine reports from 1955 to 1973.

Data extraction and study appraisal

All electronic records identified were independently inspected by BT, CA and JR. The reliability of selection processes and data extraction was checked using a 10% random sample. Full reports of studies of agreed relevance were obtained, quality rated, and data relating to methods, participants, interventions and outcomes, extracted. Any disagreement was discussed and decisions documented. If there were outstanding issues, the authors of the studies were contacted where possible to help resolve problems.

Statistical methods

Dichotomous and continuous data were not used if over half of those randomised did not contribute to the outcome due to early attrition from the study or non-compliance. Dichotomous data were combined using a random effects Relative Risk (RR). Numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) were also calculated, and χ² tests for heterogeneity were performed. Where < 50% of people were lost to follow-up at the end of a trial, 'worst case' intention-to-treat analyses were undertaken by assuming that those who had left a trial early had had a poor outcome. The sensitivity of the final results to this assumption was tested. Continuous data were excluded if derived from scales of unknown validity and if totals or measures of variance were not reported. Summation was not attempted where continuous data were too skewed. All estimates of effect are presented with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

### A randomized, double-blinded feasibility trial of educational materials for hiccups in chemotherapy-treated patients with cancer [^112FUHqN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chemotherapy can cause hiccups but few randomized controlled trials have focused on hiccups. This trial examined the feasibility of such research.

Methods

This single-institution, multi-site trial used phone recruitment for patients: (1) 18 years or older, (2) able to speak/read English, (3) with a working e-mail address, (4) with hiccups 4 weeks prior to contact, and (5) with ongoing oxaliplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy. The primary outcome was feasibility. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two sets of educational materials, each of which discussed hiccups and palliative options. The experimental materials were almost identical to the standard materials but provided updated content based on the published medical literature. At 2 weeks, patients responded by phone to a 5-item verbally administered questionnaire.

Results

This trial achieved its primary endpoint of recruiting 20 eligible patients within 5 months; 50 patients were recruited in 3 months. Among the 40 patients who completed the follow-up questionnaire, no statistically significant differences between arms were observed in hiccup incidence since initial contact, time spent reviewing the educational materials, and the troubling nature of hiccups. Twenty-five patients tried palliative interventions (13 in the experimental arm and 12 in the standard arm), most commonly drinking water or holding one's breath. Eleven and 10 patients, respectively, described hiccup relief after such an intervention.

Conclusions

Clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced hiccups are feasible and could address an unmet need.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^111khXJA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Research tools

Hospital information system (HIS) data collection

All clinical and demographic data were collected using the HIS electronic medical record platform. Information included the patient's name, gender, age, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, family history of cancer, past medical history, whether it was the patient's first treatment, history of hiccups, physical status score (ECOG = 0–2), pathological diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment regimen, comorbid conditions, and other relevant baseline characteristics. All data were collected immediately after enrollment.

Hiccup Knowledge Manual

The manual covers the following topics: an overview of hiccups, their etiology, clinical features, six different behavioral-physical intervention techniques, prognosis, and prevention.

A variety of possible effective methods for alleviating hiccups were collected through literature retrieval, Internet search, clinical consultation, and other means. Interventions that required professional operation (such as acupuncture, electronic acupoint stimulation, ear pill acupoint stimulation) were excluded. Finally, six methods that were easy to master and could be operated independently by patients were selected. The specific operation is shown in Table 1.

Table 1
List of six behaviors — physical intervention methods

The learning time for the manual was less than 60 min. All patients in the BPI group completed the training within 1 h, and their understanding was verified by study staff. The accompanying video is 2 min and 54 s and illustrated the six interventions for managing acute hiccups. A Quick Response code for the video was printed on the manual, and patients were encouraged to keep the manual accessible for review. If forgotten, the content could be revisited at any time.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)

This scale was used to assess the patient's level of anxiety and depression during episodes of hiccup. The HADS comprises 14 items, divided into two subscales: anxiety and depression, with each subscale containing seven items. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, resulting in a total score range of 0–21. A score > 7 indicates anxiety or depression. Specifically, scores of 8–21 indicate anxiety or depression, while scores of 0–7 suggest no anxiety or depression. Scores of 8–10 indicate mild anxiety or depression, 11–14 denote moderate anxiety or depression, and 15–21 represent severe anxiety or depression.

### Use of baclofen in the treatment of esophageal stent-related hiccups [^116LFT3S]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Hiccupping is a characteristic noise caused by a sudden closure of the glottis after repeated, involuntary, spasmodic contraction of the respiratory muscles. Hiccupping caused by gastric distention, spicy foods, and neural dysfunction often resolves itself without any treatment. Some hiccups are associated with certain diseases or occur postsurgically, and life-restricting intractable hiccups should be treated. The cause of hiccups should be expressly stated for treatment. We report a case of inoperable esophagogastric junction tumor with hiccupping after esophageal stent that could only be treated with baclofen.

### Chlorpromazine (chlorproMAZINE hydrochloride) [^1179PqzK]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Therapy: To lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with chlorpromazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued.

Antiemetic Effect: The antiemetic action of chlorpromazine may mask the signs and symptoms of

overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome. (See WARNINGS).

When chlorpromazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of chlorpromazine.

Abrupt Withdrawal: Like other phenothiazines, chlorpromazine is not known to cause psychic dependence and does not produce tolerance or addiction. There may be, however, following abrupt withdrawal of high-dose therapy, some symptoms resembling those of physical dependence such as gastritis, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and tremulousness. These symptoms can usually be avoided or reduced by gradual reduction of the dosage or by continuing concomitant anti-parkinsonism agents for several weeks after chlorpromazine is withdrawn.

### Do some people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness experience pain? A clinically focused narrative review and synthesis [^115w7KZ9]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Prolonged disorders of consciousness

In 2020, the Royal College of Physicians working party on managing people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness defined it as: ' any disorder of consciousness that has continued for at least four weeks following sudden onset brain injury'. It includes coma and the vegetative and minimally conscious states. Most patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness have progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease or dementia. Cumulative co-morbidities accrued over a while may also result in a prolonged disorder of consciousness. This article refers to all those people with prolonged disordered consciousness resulting from all these conditions.

Brains from patients who had a prolonged disorder of consciousness show widespread cortical damage, diffuse axonal injury after trauma and extensive nerve cell body loss after metabolic injury, combined with damage to the dorsomedial and ventral posterior thalamic nuclei. Thus, pain networks in the cortex are inevitably extensively disrupted, and it is unlikely that any cognitive analysis or moderation of lower brain networks will be undertaken.

Midbrain and brainstem structures are more resistant to damage. Less extensive damage will not disrupt lower networks because networks are intrinsically resilient and resist degradation unless the loss is severe.

Therefore, lower brain networks are probably still functioning in people with prolonged disorders of consciousness. The nature of the output and how the loss of cortical modulation of their function affects it are unknown, but they may increase arousal and produce non-specific non-willed behaviours. These aversive behavioural and autonomic reactions are retained as basic outputs arising from nociceptive stimuli.

Many factors are likely to lead to pain in people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness:
Nursing and care procedures, such as moving and handling people, stretching muscles to facilitate personal care, tracheal suctioning, complex mouth care, bowel management and replacing urethral catheters.
Muscle immobility and increased muscle tone, maintaining posture and positioning for long periods
Blood tests and injections for spasticity and salivary management
Other unpredictable phenomena such as hypersensitivity to touch, muscle spasms, local infections, skin pressure ulcers, hiccups and coughing.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^115LbeyW]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3.
The literature review of clinical characteristics in thyroid storm.

Considering that hiccups are not common in either DKA or TS, we speculate that the incidence of intractable hiccups is rare when DKA overlaps with TS. By carefully searching the literature, we found the following related cases. A case of TS associated with Graves' disease masked by DKA in a 59-year-old woman was reported by Osada et al. However, this patient had no history of diabetes, Graves' disease or respiratory failure compared with the present patient. Management of the functional gastrointestinal tract in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis represents a difficult but significant clinical challenge associated with a high mortality rate. Monteiro et al. reported a 70-year-old male who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and TS. The patient presented gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, asthenia, psychomotor retardation and generalized decrease in muscle strength but no hiccups. Ahmed et al. reported a case of hiccups as an extremely rare presentation of thyrotoxicosis in Graves' disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a woman with DKA who developed TS by intractable hiccups that subsequently induced respiratory failure.

### Intractable hiccup: an odd complication after laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113wdmM4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Intractable hiccup can be an unbearable circumstance and its treatment is often frustrating. More than 100 causes for hiccup have been described in the literature; the most common cause is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We report a case of a 31-year-old patient who suffered from intractable hiccup starting 3 weeks after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GERD, a potential surgical complication that has not been described. After frustrating medical treatment, the patient underwent computed tomography and nerve stimulator-guided blockade of vagal and phrenic nerves on each side separately. Hiccup ceased only after blockade of the right phrenic nerve with 4 ml/h l% ropivacaine and relapsed soon after discontinuation. He underwent thoracoscopic right phrenicectomy, which rendered him symptom free for well over 2 months, at the time of this writing.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^111uiRVX]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Results

Electronic searches identified over 1000 records, most of which were ineligible. Full copies of 351 citations were obtained for detailed scrutiny, including a further 50 papers identified from citations. Of these, 302 papers were excluded and 99 reports of the 50 RCTs included (Table 1). Studies were mainly excluded due to lack of random allocation (68%). However, 43 randomised trials (30%) reported irrelevant outcomes, such as serum levels of chlorpromazine breakdown products, or presented data in such a way as to make the outcomes unintelligible or impossible to use.

Table 1
Included studies.

Key: ● = Yes; U/K = Unknown; C = Chronic; A = Acute; M = Male; F = Female; m = Mean; im = Intramuscular injection.

Study quality

All 50 included studies reported the use of random allocation; only 4 were explicit about the process used. Two used the toss of a coin, and 2 used random number tables. Citations to all included and excluded studies are available in the full Cochrane Review, otherwise the names and dates cited in this text relate to Table 1. A further 2 trials described some form of allocation concealment (sealed envelopes in both cases). The other 44 studies gave little assurance that bias was minimised during the allocation procedure and this may mean that this review overestimates the effect of chlorpromazine. Twenty-eight (56%) of the trials adequately described their attempts to be double-blind, with two and reporting how successful these attempts were. Two studies and gave no indication that blinding had been attempted. Other trials indicated that an attempt at blinding had been made, but they gave no description of how this had been done. The description of participants who left studies early was poor; 12 of the 50 included studies providing no details of treatment withdrawals. Presentation of data was also poor. Trials frequently presented both dichotomous and continuous data in graphs, or reported inexact statistical measures of probability, for example p > 0.05. This often made it impossible to extract raw data for synthesis. Continuous scale data were frequently collected in the trials, but were often poorly reported; 30/50 trials did not report standard deviations and 9/42 did not present any data from the scales they had used.

### Chlorpromazine hci [^1172dm2z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

EKG CHANGES

Particularly nonspecific, usually reversible Q and T wave distortions–have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazine tranquilizers, including chlorpromazine.

Note: Sudden death, apparently due to cardiac arrest, has been reported.

CNS Reactions

NEUROMUSCULAR (EXTRAPYRAMIDAL) REACTIONS

Neuromuscular reactions include dystonia, motor restlessness, pseudo-parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, and appear to be dose-related. They are discussed in the following paragraphs:

Dystonia

Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

Motor Restlessness

Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided.

### Dexamethasone and hiccups: a 2000-patient, telephone-based study [^112Wg7JS]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

Dexamethasone causes hiccups in an undefined percentage of patients, and these hiccups are often ignored ('My doctors just shook their heads like I was joking… '). This study sought to learn the percentage of dexamethasone-treated patients who develop hiccups and to explore patients' responses to the availability of educational materials on hiccups.

Methods

English-speaking, adult outpatients treated with oral, intravenous or epidural dexamethasone 2 weeks prior were contacted by phone and asked about hiccups. Educational materials were offered, and patients were queried on their opinion of the availability of such materials.

Results

One hundred and twenty-seven patients or 11% (95% CI 9% to 13%) reported hiccups. This percentage was derived from 1186 reachable patients from 2000 total patients. Fifty-four (43%) of those with hiccups desired to learn about educational materials. Of these, 49 completed a single-item, 5-point scale item: 21 (43%) viewed the availability of educational materials 'extremely helpful', providing a 5 rating; 8 (16%) provided a 4; 4 (8%) provided a 3; and 1 (4%) provided a 2.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone-induced hiccups occur in a small percentage of patients. The fact that most patients responded favourably to learning about the availability of educational materials suggests some have unmet needs.

Chlorpromazine is one of the three antipsychotic drugs on the WHO Essential Drug List. It is used worldwide. The optimal dose has been the subject of evaluative research but summaries of this work are rare.

Objectives

To determine chlorpromazine dose response and dose adverse effect relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2008). References of all included studies were examined for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed doses of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and reporting clinical outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated fixed-effect relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) based on a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included four relevant studies (1012 participants) in this review. They are all hospital-based trials, have a duration of less than six months and are at moderate risk of bias. When low dose (≤ 400mg/day) was compared with medium dose (401–800 mg/day) mental state data were very few and difficult to interpret (n = 22, 1 RCT, WMD 'withdrawal retardation' -2.00 CI -3.76 to -0.24). More people left for inefficacy of treatment in the low dose group (n = 48, 1 RCT, RR 4.24 CI 0.24 to 74.01). In the short term, all measured extrapyramidal adverse effects tended to be lower in the low dose group (n = 70, 2 RCTs, RR dystonia 0.20 CI 0.04 to 0.97). When low dose was compared with high (> 800mg/day) data were taken from only one study (2gms chlorpromazine/day). Global state outcomes tended to favour the high dose group (n = 416, 1 RCT, RR 'No clinically important improvement 1.12 CI 1.01 to 1.23). One case of death was reported in the high dose group (n = 416, RR 0.33 CI 0.01 to 8.14) and a significantly greater number of people in the high dose group left early due to disabling adverse effects (n = 416, RR 0.10 CI 0.04 to 0.27). Significantly less dystonia and unspecified extrapyramidal adverse effects were reported in the low dose group (n = 416, dystonia RR 0.11 CI 0.02 to 0.45, unspecified extrapyramidal adverse effects RR 0.43 CI 0.32 to 0.59). People in both groups experienced akathisia (n = 416, RR1.00 CI 0.55 to 1.83).

Authors' Conclusions

The average dose of chlorpromazine given to people with schizophrenia has declined across time, but this has come about by long - and sometimes hard - experience rather than from direction from high-grade trial-based evidence. This progression towards gentler levels of dosing has taken six decades. We hope that, for modern compounds, data from relevant high-grade evaluative studies will be much more swiftly available to guide informed practice.

### Evaluation of the forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool to stop hiccups [^115sJvB7]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

A total of 249 responses were validated, with a mean (SD) age of 30.9 (19.3) years (range, 1–90 years), primarily adult (175 of 249 participants [70.3%]), female (126 of 249 participants [50.6%]), and White (197 of 249 participants [79.1%]). Most participants (69.5%) reported hiccups at least once a month, and most (65.9%) had hiccups of less than a 2-hour duration. FISST stopped hiccups in nearly 92% cases and was rated favorably compared with home remedies across all demographic characteristics, hiccup frequencies, and hiccup durations (Table). The mean (SD) subjective effectiveness score of FISST was 4.58 (0.90) in the sample of participants who responded, with 183 of 203 participants (90.1%) rating it favorably (4 or 5) compared with home remedies. The mean (SD) satisfaction was 4.57 (1.61), with 226 of 249 participants (90.8%) rating FISST more feasible than home remedies (4 or 5). No adverse effects were reported.

### Hiccups in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a cross-sectional study [^11734dc5]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Hiccups are a symptom in cancer patients but it's less researched.

Objectives

The aimed to determine of prevalence of hiccups and treatment approach used in hiccup management in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy for nursing care.

Methods

This study used a descriptive cross-sectional design with self-reported questionnaires and was conducted from November 2018-May 2019 in Turkey. For collection of the data, a Patient Information Form (sociodemographic and disease characteristics), and a Hiccups Evaluation Form were used for the patients.

Results

Hiccups were observed in 37 (23%) of the 160 patients who met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The great majority of the patients suffering from hiccups were male (65.9%) and the type of cancer in the majority of these patients was gastrointestinal cancer (54.1%). It was determined that the duration of hiccups in 83.8% of patients observed with hiccups was between 0 and 48 hours, that the average severity of their hiccups was 3.81 ± 2.25 (0–10), and that hiccups in 59.5% of these patients was of low severity. It was found that only 10.8% of patients suffering from hiccups used pharmacological methods for relief and that 27% used nonpharmacological methods.

Conclusion

The results of the study showed that over one-fifth of cancer patients suffered from hiccups. This situation reveals that hiccups are an important symptom that needs to be carefully emphasised in oncology practice.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^114uCu1j]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Action statement — identifying underlying cause of dysphonia: Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination for underlying causes of dysphonia and factors that modify management; this is a recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes aggregate evidence quality Grade C from observational studies, a high level of confidence in evidence, risks/harms/costs noted as none, a preponderance of benefit over harm, and policy level strong recommendation. Stated benefits are to identify potential causative factors of dysphonia, increase awareness of underlying causes, identify patients at risk for serious underlying conditions, and identify underlying cause to allow for targeted treatment; value judgments state that further management is completely dependent on the underlying cause.

### Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adult patients [^111fPuV8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a syndrome characterised by a disturbance of consciousness (often fluctuating), cognition and perception. In terminally ill patients it is one of the most common causes of admission to clinical care. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should be directed at addressing these causes rather than the symptom cluster. In cases where this is not possible, or treatment does not prove successful, the use of drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. This is an update of the review published on 'Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adult patients' in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 2 (Jackson 2004).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of drug therapies to treat delirium in adult patients in the terminal phase of a disease.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012), CINAHL (1982 to 2012) and PSYCINFO (1990 to 2012).

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials with or without randomisation or blinding involving the use of drug therapies for the treatment of delirium in adult patients in the terminal phase of a disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality using standardised methods and extracted trial data. We collected outcomes related to efficacy and adverse effects.

Main Results

One trial met the criteria for inclusion. In the 2012 update search we retrieved 3066 citations but identified no new trials. The included trial evaluated 30 hospitalised AIDS patients receiving one of three agents: chlorpromazine, haloperidol and lorazepam. The trial under-reported key methodological features. It found overall that patients in the chlorpromazine group and those in the haloperidol group had fewer symptoms of delirium at follow-up (to below the diagnostic threshold using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) and that both were equally effective (at two days mean difference (MD) 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.58 to 5.32; between two and six days MD -0.21; 95% CI -5.35 to 4.93). Chlorpromazine and haloperidol were found to be no different in improving cognitive status in the short term (at 48 hours) but at subsequent follow-up cognitive status was reduced in those taking chlorpromazine. Improvements from baseline to day two for patients randomised to lorazepam were not apparent. All patients on lorazepam (n = 6) developed adverse effects, including oversedation and increased confusion, leading to trial drug discontinuation.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the role of drug therapy in the treatment of delirium in terminally ill patients. Thus, practitioners should continue to follow current clinical guidelines. Further research is essential.

JAMA. 1955; 157: 309–310. doi: 10.1001/jama.1955.02950210005002 Hiccups may be a minor symptom of transient duration or may progress to exhaust the patient's strength and produce marked depression or even death. Many widely divergent causes for hiccups are known, such as diaphragmatic irritation in pleurisy, subphrenic abscess, or retention of toxic products in uremia. When there is no specific cause, the methods of therapy available are of uncertain value in refractory cases. In the past year, 50 patients with intractable hiccups have been treated with chlorpromazine. This agent is a chlorinated phenothiazine and has the following formula: 10–2-chlorophenothiazine hydrochloride. The group included 46 men and 4 women from 26 to 80 years of age.

Symptoms had persisted from days to weeks and had not responded to heavy sedation, carbon dioxide inhalations, or any other therapy including phrenic nerve crush in five cases.

### Treatment of hiccups… [^1115WUVv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Benign, self-limited hiccups are common phenomena experienced by almost everyone at some time or another. However, persistent hiccups may cause the victim great distress and be refractory to most treatments. Patients are first distressed, later endangered by persistent hiccups. Vomiting, acid-base and fluid imbalance, malnourishment, and exhaustion may follow. In the postoperative patient, wound dehiscence is an added danger. Methods of treatment from the simplest to the severest must be tried successively until relief is obtained. Because hiccups may be such a dangerous complication during and after surgery, this paper will review the experiences of others in addition to some of our own in the hope of achieving the best possible management of the problem. A hiccup is described by Smith1 as a pathological respiratory reflex characterized by a clonic spasm of the diaphragm, which results in a sudden inspiration. This, in turn, is abruptly terminated by closure of Gigot AF, Flynn PD.

### Hiccups… [^111LndAi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Hiccups usually present as a common annoyance lasting for short periods. Rarely, they may be the harbinger of a serious disease. We present the case of a 19-year-old man in which intractable hiccups was the first and most prominent symptom of a serious underlying neurologic disorder. The patient had been examined by his pediatrician, and despite multiple medical regiments and physical maneuvers, his symptoms persisted. A thorough head and neck examination revealed a right-sided vocal cord paralysis. This finding prompted obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging scan, which demonstrated a type I Arnold-Chiari malformation associated with a large cervicothoracic syringomyelia. The patient was referred to the neurosurgical service and subsequently underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. There was considerable initial improvement in his neurologic status and cessation of the hiccups. However, the symptoms recurred within 1 month.

The case report as well as a brief review of the relevant pathophysiologic and etiologic considerations and several treatment modalities for hiccups is presented. Loft LM, Ward RF. Hiccups: A Case Presentation and Etiologic Review. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1992; 118: 1115–1119.
