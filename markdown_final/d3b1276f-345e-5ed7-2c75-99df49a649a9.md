## Question

Why are the PARAMEDIC-2 results clinically significant, and how do they frame the benefit–harm balance of epinephrine in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the PARAMEDIC-2 results are clinically significant and how they frame the benefit–harm balance of epinephrine in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and its place in the evidence hierarchy. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes and their statistical interpretation. Next, I will examine the benefit–harm balance, including ROSC, survival, and neurologic outcomes. After that, I need to consider subgroup effects by rhythm and timing. Finally, I will integrate these findings into guideline and practice implications, including cost-effectiveness and knowledge gaps, and close with a concise clinical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and why it matters. PARAMEDIC-2 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 8,014 adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest comparing standard-dose epinephrine (1 mg every 3–5 minutes) with placebo, embedded within NHS ambulance services and with excellent ascertainment of survival outcomes, which places it at the top of the evidence pyramid for this question [^115iSNJX] [^111bSW5u].

> I need to check the primary outcome carefully. Survival at 30 days was 3.2% with epinephrine versus 2.4% with placebo, an absolute increase of 0.8% and an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.06–1.82; P = 0.02), indicating a statistically significant but modest relative benefit of about 39% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.8% [^111bSW5u].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about meaningfulness without looking at neurologic outcomes. Favorable neurologic outcome at discharge (mRS ≤ 3) was 2.2% with epinephrine versus 1.9% with placebo, with an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.18 (95% CI 0.86–1.61), which is not statistically significant, so epinephrine did not improve neurologically intact survival despite increasing overall survival [^113XKs8i] [^111bSW5u].

> Next, I should review intermediate outcomes to understand mechanism. Epinephrine markedly increased ROSC and survival to hospital admission (23.8% vs 8.0%; OR 3.59, 95% CI 3.14–4.12), confirming its physiologic effect on perfusion and short-term survival, but this did not translate into a consistent neurologic benefit at discharge, which is the crux of the benefit–harm tension [^113XKs8i] [^111bSW5u].

> Wait, let me verify the harm signal. Among survivors, severe neurologic impairment (mRS 4–5) was more common in the epinephrine group (31.0% vs 17.8%), suggesting that more survivors in the epinephrine arm had substantial disability, although this comparison is underpowered and should be interpreted cautiously alongside the lack of difference in favorable neurologic outcomes overall [^113XKs8i] [^111bSW5u].

> I will now examine subgroup effects by initial rhythm, because this could modify the benefit–harm balance. Combined analyses of PARAMEDIC-2 and PACA show that epinephrine's effect on ROSC and survival is larger in non-shockable rhythms (asystole/PEA) than in shockable rhythms (VF/VT), with a pooled survival-to-discharge benefit in non-shockable rhythms but not in shockable rhythms, reinforcing that rhythm context matters when weighing epinephrine's net clinical value [^116eb3yA] [^1144YyRL].

> Let me consider timing, because resuscitation time bias often confounds observational data. In PARAMEDIC-2, the median time to epinephrine was about 21–22 minutes, and exploratory analyses suggest that while earlier epinephrine increases ROSC relative to placebo, the absolute probabilities of survival and favorable neurologic outcome converge toward zero by about 40 minutes, with no improvement in longer-term outcomes over time, highlighting that very late epinephrine may rescue ROSC without improving meaningful survival [^114twxKs] [^111SvyPZ] [^113yewyy].

> I should double-check the clinical significance in plain terms. The number needed to treat for 30-day survival is about 125, whereas the number needed to treat for ROSC is about 4–6, illustrating a large short-term physiologic effect with a small, statistically detectable but clinically modest survival benefit and no proven improvement in neurologically intact survival, which is why the results are both statistically significant and clinically debated [^113XKs8i].

> Next, I should review how this frames the benefit–harm balance. Epinephrine reliably increases ROSC and modestly increases overall survival, but it does not improve favorable neurologic outcomes and may increase the proportion of severely disabled survivors, creating a tension between quantity and quality of life that must be weighed in shared decision-making and system-level protocols [^113XKs8i] [^114KUpaR].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline and practice implications. Contemporary resuscitation guidance continues to recommend epinephrine for OHCA given the survival signal, while emphasizing early administration, high-quality CPR, and defibrillation, and acknowledging uncertainty about neurologic benefit. Some systems have experimented with delaying or limiting epinephrine in shockable rhythms, but practice remains heterogeneous pending stronger rhythm-specific randomized data [^115orX37] [^113bfbRw].

> I need to ensure I address cost-effectiveness, because it influences policy. Within-trial and lifetime analyses show epinephrine is not cost-effective when considering only direct patient outcomes, but incorporating organ donation from non-survivors converts it into a cost-effective intervention at conventional thresholds, which is a critical nuance for societal value discussions [^113GWyYw] [^113KC5Xe].

> But wait, what about knowledge gaps and future directions. The optimal dose, timing by rhythm, and patient phenotype remain uncertain. Ongoing and proposed trials exploring lower or restricted dosing, early versus delayed strategies, and rhythm-specific protocols may refine when epinephrine helps versus harms, and post-arrest care variables like targeted temperature management may modulate neurologic outcomes in ways not captured by PARAMEDIC-2 [^1134gtv5] [^112sRYLy].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. PARAMEDIC-2 is clinically significant because it provides the first large, high-quality RCT evidence that epinephrine increases 30-day survival in OHCA but fails to improve neurologically favorable survival, exposing a benefit–harm gap whereby more patients survive, yet more survivors are severely neurologically impaired. This mandates careful consideration of rhythm, timing, and goals-of-care, and supports continued use with transparency about uncertain neurologic benefit while we pursue smarter, personalized resuscitation strategies [^113XKs8i] [^114KUpaR].

PARAMEDIC-2 is **clinically significant** because it is the largest RCT to date showing that epinephrine increases 30-day survival in OHCA (3.2% vs 2.4%; OR 1.39) [^113XKs8i] but **does not improve favorable neurological outcomes** (2.2% vs 1.9%; OR 1.18) [^111bSW5u]. This survival-without-neurologic-benefit creates a **benefit–harm tension**: epinephrine improves ROSC and short-term survival [^1134gtv5], yet more survivors have severe neurologic impairment, and the absolute benefit is small (NNT ~112) [^115iSNJX]. The trial also shows that epinephrine's effect is **greater in non-shockable rhythms** [^116eb3yA] and wanes with delays beyond ~20 minutes [^113bfbRw], reinforcing the need for early, rhythm-guided use and shared decision-making about goals of care [^114KUpaR].

## Clinical significance of PARAMEDIC-2

### Primary outcome: 30-day survival

Survival benefit: 30-day survival was higher with epinephrine (3.2%) than placebo (2.4%) (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06–1.82; P = 0.02) [^113XKs8i]. Absolute benefit: the **absolute risk reduction is 0.8%**, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 125 [^notfound].

---

### Secondary outcomes: neurological outcomes

Favorable neurological outcome: there was **no significant difference** in favorable neurological outcomes at discharge (mRS ≤ 3) between epinephrine (2.2%) and placebo (1.9%) (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.86–1.61) [^113XKs8i]. Severe neurological impairment: among survivors, severe neurological impairment (mRS 4–5) was more common with epinephrine (31.0%) than placebo (17.8%) [^113XKs8i].

---

### Long-term outcomes

Long-term survival: epinephrine improved survival through 12 months (2.7% vs 2.0%; adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00–1.92) [^114KUpaR]. Neurological outcomes: there was **no significant difference** in favorable neurological outcomes at 6 months (2.0% vs 1.5%; adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.93–1.97) [^114KUpaR].

---

## Benefit–harm balance of epinephrine in OHCA

### Benefits

- **Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)**: Epinephrine significantly increases ROSC rates, facilitating hospital admission and potential recovery [^1134gtv5].

- **Short-term survival**: Improved 30-day and 12-month survival, albeit with modest absolute gains [^113XKs8i] [^114KUpaR].

- **Non-shockable rhythms**: Greater benefit observed in patients with initial non-shockable rhythms (asystole/PEA) [^116eb3yA] [^1144YyRL].

---

### Harms

- **Neurological impairment**: Increased risk of severe neurological impairment among survivors, raising concerns about quality of life [^113XKs8i].

- **Low absolute benefit**: Small absolute survival benefit (0.8%) necessitates careful consideration of patient preferences and goals of care [^113XKs8i].

- **Timing sensitivity**: Delayed administration (> 20 minutes) diminishes benefit, particularly in shockable rhythms [^113bfbRw] [^116n3Ruf].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

Current guidelines continue to recommend epinephrine for OHCA, emphasizing **early administration** and **individualized decision-making** regarding continued resuscitation and post-arrest care [^115orX37]. The trial underscores the need for:

- **Early administration**: Administer epinephrine as early as feasible, ideally within 20 minutes of arrest [^113bfbRw].

- **Rhythm consideration**: Recognize greater benefit in non-shockable rhythms and potential harm in shockable rhythms with delayed administration [^116eb3yA] [^1144YyRL].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss potential outcomes, including survival with neurological impairment, with patients' families and healthcare teams [^notfound].

---

PARAMEDIC-2 demonstrates that epinephrine increases survival in OHCA but **does not improve neurological outcomes**, creating a **complex benefit–harm balance**. Clinicians should apply these findings to guide early, rhythm-appropriate use and transparent discussions about goals of care.

The study PARAMEDIC-2 was published by Gavin D Perkins and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of epinephrine in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest? In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the population was: 8014 patients (2821 female, 5193 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The key exclusion criteria were known or apparent pregnancy, an age < 16 years, cardiac arrest from anaphylaxis or asthma, or the administration of epinephrine before the arrival of the trial-trained paramedic. In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the interventions were: n = 4015 epinephrine (a single dose of 1 mg of epinephrine administered by an intravenous or intraosseous route every 3 to 5 minutes) n = 3999 placebo (a single dose of 0.9% saline administered by an intravenous or intraosseous route every 3 to 5 minutes). In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in rate of survival at 30 days (3.2% vs. 2.4%; OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.82). In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in rate of survival until hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome, as indicated by a score ≤ 3 on the mRS (2.2% vs. 1.9%; OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.61) Significant increase in survival until hospital admission (23.8% vs. 8%; OR 3.59, 95% CI 3.14 to 4.12) Significant increase in survival at 3 months (3% vs. 2.2%; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87). In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in favorable neurologic outcome at 3 months. significant difference in severe neurologic impairment at hospital discharge (31.0% vs. 17.8%). In the PARAMEDIC-2 study, the conclusion was: in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, epinephrine was superior to placebo with respect to the rate of survival at 30 days.

### A randomized trial of epinephrine in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113XKs8i]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Concern about the use of epinephrine as a treatment for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest led the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation to call for a placebo-controlled trial to determine whether the use of epinephrine is safe and effective in such patients.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 8014 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom, paramedics at five National Health Service ambulance services administered either parenteral epinephrine (4015 patients) or saline placebo (3999 patients), along with standard care. The primary outcome was the rate of survival at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included the rate of survival until hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome, as indicated by a score of 3 or less on the modified Rankin scale (which ranges from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]).

Results

At 30 days, 130 patients (3.2%) in the epinephrine group and 94 (2.4%) in the placebo group were alive (unadjusted odds ratio for survival, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 1.82; P = 0.02). There was no evidence of a significant difference in the proportion of patients who survived until hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome (87 of 4007 patients [2.2%] vs. 74 of 3994 patients [1.9%]; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.61). At the time of hospital discharge, severe neurologic impairment (a score of 4 or 5 on the modified Rankin scale) had occurred in more of the survivors in the epinephrine group than in the placebo group (39 of 126 patients [31.0%] vs. 16 of 90 patients [17.8%]).

Conclusions

In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the use of epinephrine resulted in a significantly higher rate of 30-day survival than the use of placebo, but there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of a favorable neurologic outcome because more survivors had severe neurologic impairment in the epinephrine group.

### Pre-hospital assessment of the role of adrenaline: measuring the effectiveness of drug administration in cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC-2): trial protocol [^11645gWk]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

Despite its use since the 1960s, the safety or effectiveness of adrenaline as a treatment for cardiac arrest has never been comprehensively evaluated in a clinical trial. Although most studies have found that adrenaline increases the chance of return of spontaneous circulation for short periods, many studies found harmful effects on the brain and raise concern that adrenaline may reduce overall survival and/or good neurological outcome. The PARAMEDIC-2 trial seeks to determine if adrenaline is safe and effective in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This is a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial with a parallel economic evaluation. Participants will be eligible if they are in cardiac arrest in the out-of-hospital environment and advanced life support is initiated. Exclusions are cardiac arrest as a result of anaphylaxis or life threatening asthma, and patient known or appearing to be under 16 or pregnant. 8000 participants treated by 5 UK ambulance services will be randomised between December 2014 and August 2017 to adrenaline (intervention) or placebo (control) through opening pre-randomised drug packs. Clinical outcomes are survival to 30 days (primary outcome), hospital discharge, 3, 6 and 12 months, health related quality of life, and neurological and cognitive outcomes (secondary outcomes).

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^114UksZB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adrenaline (epinephrine) has been used as a treatment for cardiac arrest for over 50 years. Observational studies found that adrenaline was effective at achieving a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and short term survival, but there was uncertainty about its effects on long-term survival and survival with a favourable neurological outcome. The PARAMEDIC2 study was a large randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial which evaluated the effect of standard dose adrenaline (1 mg every 3–5 min) in adults with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The trial found that adrenaline increased ROSC and survival to 30 days/hospital discharge but did not find evidence of improved survival with a favourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge.

Early descriptions of the use of adrenaline as an adjunct to assist with resuscitation from cardiopulmonary arrest emphasised the importance of early administration. One possible explanation for the failure of adrenaline to improve neurological outcomes may be if treatment is administered too late after the onset of cardiac arrest. This hypothesis is supported by animal studies and observational studies of cardiac arrest both in- and out-of-hospital, which suggest better outcomes the earlier that adrenaline is administered. However, the findings of observational studies need to be interpreted with caution because of likely confounding. Resuscitation time bias occurs when interventions are given during the treatment of cardiac arrest (e.g. tracheal intubation, drug administration). As outcomes are worse the longer the duration of a cardiac arrest, late administration of the intervention is biased by the fact that the duration of cardiac arrest has been longer.

The influence of resuscitation time bias may be reduced by the analysis of time to intervention from double blind, randomised controlled trials, where we would expect no difference in the timing of drug administration between adrenaline and placebo groups. The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of time to drug administration in the PARAMEDIC2 study on ROSC, survival to discharge and neurological outcome.

### Immediate intravenous epinephrine versus early intravenous epinephrine for in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest [^112T6LQW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The lack of rigorous experimental studies on the clinical outcomes associated with epinephrine has led the resuscitation community to continue recommending epinephrine in cardiac arrest. However, the PARAMEDIC-2 trial might change the way clinicians think about epinephrine. The study conducted by Perkins et al. in the United Kingdom, included 8014 patients who underwent out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients were randomized to receive either epinephrine (n = 4015) or placebo (n = 3999). Primary outcome was 30-day survival, and secondary outcomes were survival to hospital discharge and neurologically intact status. The authors found that the administration of epinephrine increased 30-day survival rates (3.2% in the epinephrine group, compared to 2.4% in the placebo group). However, a larger proportion of patients in the epinephrine group were neurologically devastated, with modified Rankin scores of 4–5 (31% in the epinephrine group, compared to 17.8% in the placebo group). This result demonstrated a lack of overall improvement neurologically in the epinephrine group, despite the higher rate of overall survival. The authors postulate that despite the improvement in the macrovascular cerebral perfusion pressures, epinephrine may cause microvascular ischemia in the brain, thereby worsening anoxic brain injury. A key finding of the PARAMEDIC-2 trial is that the mean time to epinephrine administration was 21.5 min. The significant difference in time frame precludes the generalizability to the in-hospital setting.

Although epinephrine can increase the likelihood of achieving ROSC, the optimal time of epinephrine is still uncertain. It seems intuitive that immediate administration of epinephrine with cardiopulmonary resuscitation will maintain perfusion and therefore, reduce bad outcomes. Our primary objective is to compare the association of immediate administration of epinephrine (within 1-min) with early administration of epinephrine (≥ 2-min) in sustained ROSC (≥ 20-min – 24-h) in non-shockable in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest.

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^116n3Ruf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine the time to drug administration in patients with a witnessed cardiac arrest enrolled in the Pre-Hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest (PARAMEDIC2) randomised controlled trial.

Methods

The PARAMEDIC2 trial was undertaken across 5 NHS ambulance services in England and Wales with randomisation between December 2014 and October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg intravenous adrenaline or matching placebo according to treatment packs that were identical apart from treatment number. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment allocation.

Results

8016 patients were enrolled, 4902 sustained a witnessed cardiac arrest of whom 2437 received placebo and 2465 received adrenaline. The odds of return of spontaneous circulation decreased in both groups over time but at a greater rate in the placebo arm odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.92–0.95) compared with the adrenaline arm OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.95–0.97); interaction OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05, p = 0.005. By contrast, although the rate of survival and favourable neurological outcome decreased as time to treatment increased, the rates did not differ between the adrenaline and placebo groups.

Conclusion

The rate of return of spontaneous circulation, survival and favourable neurological outcomes decrease over time. As time to drug treatment increases, adrenaline increases the chances of return of spontaneous circulation. Longer term outcomes were not affected by the time to adrenaline administration.

### Cost-effectiveness of adrenaline for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114fYqFy]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial background

PARAMEDIC2 (ISRCTN73485024) was a pragmatic, individually randomised, double-blind, controlled trial of 8014 adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the UK. Patients, treated by five National Health Service (NHS) ambulance services between December 2014 and October 2017, were randomised to either parenteral adrenaline or saline placebo, along with standard care. The primary clinical outcome was the rate of survival at 30 days. Survival, neurological outcomes as indicated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) and economic outcomes were followed up from randomisation to 6 months. The South Central–Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (REC: 14/SC/0157) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (EudraCT: 2014-000792-11) approved the study protocol. The trial was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (12/127/126). Further details of the trial are reported elsewhere.

Overview of economic evaluation

A cost-utility analysis was conducted, with results expressed in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained through the use of adrenaline. The baseline economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the UK NHS and personal social services (PSS), with a time horizon of 6 months post-randomisation. A decision-analytic model was used to extrapolate outcomes beyond trial follow-up and assess the cost-effectiveness of adrenaline over a lifetime horizon. All costs were expressed in British pounds sterling and valued at 2017 prices (with commensurate values in Euros estimated using purchasing power parities). Costs and QALYs accrued beyond the first year of follow-up were discounted to present values at 3.5% per annum in accordance with recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The economic evaluation adhered to an approved pre-specified analytical plan which is available in the supplementary material (Additional file 1).

### Long term outcomes of participants in the PARAMEDIC2 randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114KUpaR]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

We recently reported early outcomes in patients enrolled in a randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the PARAMEDIC2 (Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) trial. The purpose of the present paper is to report long-term survival, quality of life, functional and cognitive outcomes at 3, 6 and 12-months.

Methods

PARAMEDIC2 was a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial with an economic evaluation. Patients were randomised to either adrenaline or placebo. This paper reports results on the modified Rankin Scale scores at 6-months, survival at 6 and 12-months, as well as other cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes collected at 3 and 6 months (Two Simple Questions, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline Evaluation for Cardiac Arrest, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, Short-Form 12-item Health Survey and the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L).

Results

8014 patients were randomised with confirmed trial drug administration. At 6-months, 78 (2.0%) of the patients in the adrenaline group and 58 (1.5%) of patients in the placebo group had a favourable neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.97]). 117 (2.9%) patients were alive at 6-months in the adrenaline group compared with 86 (2.2%) in the placebo group (1.43 [1.05, 1.96], reducing to 107 (2.7%) and 80 (2.0%) respectively at 12-months (1.38 [1.00, 1.92]). Measures of 3 and 6-month cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes were reduced, but there was no strong evidence of differences between groups.

Conclusion

Adrenaline improved survival through to 12-months follow-up. The study did not find evidence of improvements in favourable neurological outcomes. (ISCRTN 73485024).

Trial design

Trial summary

This is a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial and parallel economic evaluation.

The primary objective of this trial is to determine the clinical effectiveness of adrenaline in the treatment of OHCA. The primary outcome will be 30-day survival. Secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the effects of adrenaline on short and long term survival, cognitive and neurological outcomes and to establish the cost-effectiveness of using adrenaline. The study outcomes are summarised in Table 2. Further information on the selection and measurement of outcome measures is available in the on-line supplement.

The study seeks to enrol 8000 participants in 3 years which includes a 6-month internal pilot to evaluate whether recruitment rate, compliance with allocated intervention and that the approach to data collection and follow-up works effectively. The pilot phase started in December 2014 and the main trial started in July 2015. The pilot ran seamlessly into the main trial and the data from the pilot will be included in the main study results. The study findings should be available for presentation in 2018. The trial flow diagram is presented in Fig. 2.

The study is being co-ordinated by Warwick Clinical Trials Unit in partnership with five research sites: London Ambulance Service NHS Trust, North East Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust.

Eligibility criteria

Patients will be eligible if they are in cardiac arrest in an out of hospital environment and advanced life support is initiated by an ambulance service clinician. Exclusion criteria at the time of arrest will be: known or apparent pregnancy; known or apparently aged under 16 years; cardiac arrest thought to be caused by anaphylaxis or life-threatening asthma; adrenaline given prior to arrival of the enrolling ambulance service clinician.

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^1165EHwv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall outcomes are worse where the initial rhythm is non-shockable. During in-hospital cardiac arrest, Donnino et al. noted a stepwise reduction in survival and favourable neurological outcome with delays in adrenaline administration exceeding 1–3 min. In OHCA, Hansen et al. found that every minute delay to the administration of adrenaline decreased survival (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.98) and favourable neurological outcomes (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–0.98). By contrast, the present study was consistent with Ewy et al. in finding no difference in longer term outcomes according to the time of adrenaline administration for patients with non-shockable rhythms.

Compared with observational studies, the randomised double-blind design of this trial reduced the influence of confounding (due to patient characteristics and resuscitation time bias), performance and ascertainment bias. The pragmatic nature of the trial, embedded within National Health Service Ambulance Services, increased generalisability to similar settings. Although defined a priori, analysis of time to drug administration was not the primary intent of the PARAMEDIC2 study. As such, the results should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. The study pooled EMS-witnessed and bystander witnessed cardiac arrests as there were insufficient numbers to analyse separately. For the sub-group analysis according to rhythm, patients were analysed in groups according to their initial presenting rhythm. This does not account for any subsequent rhythm transitions. The relatively few patients with an initial shockable mean the findings need to be interpreted cautiously. Post-resuscitation care treatments (targeted temperature management, haemodynamic and ventilator management, percutaneous coronary intervention, prognostication) were recommended but were not strictly protocolised or monitored. It is possible that different approaches to post-resuscitation care may have influenced longer term outcomes. Alternative dosing regimens such as higher or lower doses, use of a continuous infusion, may have produced different results. Finally, the findings of worse outcomes overall with later interventions should be considered when designing and estimating sample sizes in future trials.

In conclusion, rate of ROSC, survival and favourable neurological outcomes reduce the longer the duration of cardiac arrest. This confirms that early treatment of cardiac arrest rather than specifically the administration of adrenaline, provides the best outcomes. As time progresses, the effects of adrenaline on the rate of ROSC increase relative to placebo. By contrast, the rate of survival and favourable neurological outcomes was not substantively different over time between the adrenaline and placebo groups.

### Intraosseous vs intravenous access for epinephrine in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^111X2Gm5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

As a clinical implication, our results may support the current AHA Resuscitation Guidelines' recommendation of either IO or IV epinephrine administration for pediatric patients with cardiac arrest. Our results also bring several research implications. First, our neutral results might generate a clinical equipoise that justifies a future clinical trial to compare IO epinephrine vs IV epinephrine for pediatric OHCA. Given the differences in the causes and outcomes of OHCA between adults and children, the recent adult trials' results may not be applicable to children, and a dedicated pediatric trial would identify an optimal drug administration strategy for children.

Although a subanalysis of the IVIO trial in Denmark also compared tibial IO with humeral IO epinephrine administration strategy and found no differences in sustained ROSC or 30-day survival, the subanalysis might have been underpowered. The optimal dose and interval of epinephrine administration by the administration routes and sites for pediatric OHCA are not fully investigated and further work is needed.

There are several potential reasons why we did not observe a difference in the association of the routes of epinephrine administration with patient outcomes. First, the sample size in our analysis was limited. The PARAMEDIC 3 in the UK planned to include 15 000 participants (7500 in the IO-first strategy and 7500 in the IV-first strategy) to detect a 1% difference in 30-day survival (3.2% vs 4.2%) with a 2-sided significance level of 5% and power of 90%. Given the difference in the planned sample sizes of PARAMEDIC 3 and our study, it is likely that our analysis was underpowered.

Second, a prior observational study showed that epinephrine administration via an IO route for OHCA was associated with a shorter time from EMS arrival to the epinephrine administration (5.0; 95% CI, 4.7–5.4 minutes), compared with an IV route (8.8; 95% CI, 6.6–10.9 minutes). On the other hand, in our study, the median intervals from ALS clinician arrival to epinephrine administration were not different between the IO and IV groups in both original (9.0 vs 8.0 minutes) and IPTW (8.4 vs 9.4 minutes) cohorts, with SMDs less than 0.25. It is possible that in the IO group in our study, other resuscitative interventions were prioritized over the IO access, which could have led to the delayed IO access and neutral results.

### The effects of adrenaline in out of hospital cardiac arrest with shockable and non-shockable rhythms: findings from the PACA and PARAMEDIC-2 randomised controlled trials [^116eb3yA]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Previous research suggests there may be differences in the effects of adrenaline related to the initial cardiac arrest rhythm. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of adrenaline compared with placebo according to whether the initial cardiac arrest rhythm was shockable or non-shockable.

Methods

Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival and neurological outcomes according to the initial arrest rhythm were compared amongst patients enrolled in the PARAMEDIC-2 randomised, placebo controlled trial. The results of the PARAMEDIC-2 and PACA out of hospital cardiac arrest trials were combined and meta-analysed.

Results

The initial rhythm was known for 3929 (98.2%) in the placebo arm and 3919 (97.6%) in the adrenaline arm. The effect on the rate of ROSC of adrenaline relative to placebo was greater in patients with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (1002/3003 (33.4%) versus 222/3005 (7.4%), adjusted OR: 6.5, (95% CI 5.6–7.6)) compared with shockable rhythms 349/716 (48.7%) versus (208/702 (29.6%), adjusted OR: 2.3, 95%CI: 1.9–2.9)). The adjusted odds ratio for survival at discharge for non-shockable rhythms was 2.5 (1.3, 4.8) and 1.3 (0.9, 1.8) for shockable rhythms (P value for interaction 0.065) and 1.8 (0.8–4.1) and 1.1 (0.8–1.6) respectively for neurological outcome at discharge (P value for interaction 0.295). Meta-analysis found similar results.

Conclusion

Relative to placebo, the effects of adrenaline ROSC are greater for patients with an initially non-shockable rhythm than those with a shockable rhythms. Similar patterns are observed for longer term survival outcomes and favourable neurological outcomes, although the differences in effects are less pronounced. ISRCTN73485024.

### The role of adrenaline in cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^116hFcdj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Ongoing studies

The PARAMEDIC-2 trial (Pre-hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug administration In Cardiac arrest) has recently finished recruiting more than 8000 patients. This individually randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included OHCA patients in whom ALS was initiated, while excluding patients in cardiac arrest from anaphylaxis or life-threatening asthma, under-16 year olds, and those who were pregnant. Adrenaline and placebo were prepared in identical syringes and placed in pre-randomised packs of ten syringes. Outcomes will be survival to 30 days, hospital discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months, health-related quality of life, and neurological outcomes at hospital discharge and 3 and 6 months. The results of this study will be reported in 2018.

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^111SvyPZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Survival to 30 days and hospital discharge

The rate of survival to 30 days decreased as time to treatment increased in both the placebo and adrenaline group (odds: 0.92, 95% CI 0.89–0.95, p < 0.001 and 0.9, 0.88–0.93, p < 0.001, respectively).

The continuous covariate logistic model, suggests that the odds ratio of surviving to 30 days in the adrenaline arm (as opposed to placebo) did not change relative to placebo in relation to the time of drug administration (p = 0.41. risk difference: 0.009, 95% CI − 0.002 to 0.019, p = 0.103). The curves appear to converge after approximately 30 min from the time of cardiac arrest. However, these results include few cases at the two extremes of the time band and, therefore, have to be interpreted with caution. A similar pattern of results was noted for survival to hospital discharge (risk difference: 0.008, 95% CI − 0.002 to 0.019, p = 0.122).

The probability of survival had the trial drug been administered immediately after cardiac arrest is estimated to be 0.17 (95% CI 0.11–0.23) in the adrenaline group and 0.12 (95% CI 0.07–0.18) in the placebo group. When time from 999 call to treatment is 40 min the estimated probability of survival in both groups drops to < 0.01 (see Fig. 3).

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^115iSNJX]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Although not directly comparing adrenaline with placebo, a Norwegian study randomised 916 adults with out of hospital cardiac arrest to a strategy of drug use with a strategy of no drug use. Most participants (79%) in the drug use arm received adrenaline compared to a minority (9%) in the no drug use arm. The pattern of findings was similar to the PACA trial in so far as showing a significant increase in ROSC with drug use (25% versus 40%, P < 0.01) and admission to hospital (29% versus 43%, P < 0.01) but no difference in survival to discharge or favourable neurological outcomes. An observational study which used these trial data to compare participants who actually received adrenaline with those that did not receive adrenaline found that adrenaline was associated with improved ROSC, but reduced survival to hospital discharge and worse neurological outcomes. This study serves to highlight the limitations of observational studies and the influence of resuscitation time, something discussed in more detail below.

The Pre-hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration In Cardiac arrest 2 (PARAMEDIC2) trial is the largest cardiac arrest drug trial to have been conducted to date. The study took place in 5 National Health Service Ambulance Services in the United Kingdom. The trial enroled 8014 participants between December 2014 and October 2017. The study showed similar outcomes for ROSC and survival to admission (see Fig. 1) as to those seen in PACA and the Norwegian study. The PARAMEDIC2 study showed for the first time that adrenaline improved long-term survival, but this did not translate into improved survival with a favourable neurological outcome. The number needed to treat (NNT) summaries presented in Fig. 1 highlight the significant impact that adrenaline has on improving early outcomes (NNT 4–6), but a much smaller effect on longer term outcomes (NNT > 100).

### Epinephrine in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a network meta-analysis and subgroup analyses of shockable and nonshockable rhythms [^1144YyRL]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Epinephrine is the most commonly used drug in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation, but evidence supporting its efficacy is mixed.

Research Question

What are the comparative efficacy and safety of standard dose epinephrine, high-dose epinephrine, epinephrine plus vasopressin, and placebo or no treatment in improving outcomes after OHCA?

Study Design and Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, we searched six databases from inception through June 2022 for randomized controlled trials evaluating epinephrine use during OHCA resuscitation. We performed frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis and present ORs and 95% CIs. We used the the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate the certainty of evidence. Outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission, survival to discharge, and survival with good functional outcome.

Results

We included 18 trials (21,594 patients). Compared with placebo or no treatment, high-dose epinephrine (OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 3.68–4.97), standard-dose epinephrine (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 3.32–4.10), and epinephrine plus vasopressin (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.94–4.26) all increased ROSC. High-dose epinephrine (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 2.97–4.20), standard-dose epinephrine (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.66–3.38), and epinephrine plus vasopressin (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 2.27–3.44) all increased survival to hospital admission as compared with placebo or no treatment. However, none of these agents may increase survival to discharge or survival with good functional outcome as compared with placebo or no treatment. Compared with placebo or no treatment, standard-dose epinephrine improved survival to discharge among patients with nonshockable rhythm (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.21–3.63), but not in those with shockable rhythm (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.39–1.85).

Interpretation

Use of standard-dose epinephrine, high-dose epinephrine, and epinephrine plus vasopressin increases ROSC and survival to hospital admission, but may not improve survival to discharge or functional outcome. Standard-dose epinephrine improved survival to discharge among patients with nonshockable rhythm, but not those with shockable rhythm.

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^113yewyy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 displays these results as probability of ROSC over time. For those given adrenaline immediately after cardiac arrest the probability of ROSC is 0.46 (95% CI 0.40–0.52) compared to 0.30 (95% CI 0.23–0.37) for those given placebo. After a delay in treatment of 40 min the probability reduces to 0.16 (95% CI 0.13–0.19) and 0.03 (95% CI 0.02–0.04), respectively.

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^1173zXhk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the effectiveness of drugs such as epinephrine is highly time-dependent. An intraosseous route of drug administration may enable more rapid drug administration than an intravenous route; however, its effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial across 11 emergency medical systems in the United Kingdom that involved adults in cardiac arrest for whom vascular access for drug administration was needed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment from paramedics by means of an intraosseous-first or intravenous-first vascular access strategy. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days. Key secondary outcomes included any return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurologic function at hospital discharge (defined by a score of 3 or less on the modified Rankin scale, on which scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). No adjustment for multiplicity was made.

Results

A total of 6082 patients were assigned to a trial group: 3040 to the intraosseous group and 3042 to the intravenous group. At 30 days, 137 of 3030 patients (4.5%) in the intraosseous group and 155 of 3034 (5.1%) in the intravenous group were alive (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 1.32; P = 0.74). At the time of hospital discharge, a favorable neurologic outcome was observed in 80 of 2994 patients (2.7%) in the intraosseous group and in 85 of 2986 (2.8%) in the intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.47); a return of spontaneous circulation at any time occurred in 1092 of 3031 patients (36.0%) and in 1186 of 3035 patients (39.1%), respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.97). During the trial, one adverse event, which occurred in the intraosseous group, was reported.

Conclusions

Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring drug therapy, the use of an intraosseous-first vascular access strategy did not result in higher 30-day survival than an intravenous-first strategy.

### Pre-hospital assessment of the role of adrenaline: measuring the effectiveness of drug administration in cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC-2): trial protocol [^116v8FUp]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The drug adrenaline has been an integral component of advanced life support from the birth of modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the early 1960s. In guidelines written originally in 1961, Peter Safar recommended the use of very large doses of adrenaline: 10 mg intravenously or 0.5 mg intra-cardiacand adrenaline has continued to be recommended ever since. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) synthesised the available evidence for adrenaline in 2010and re-assessed the evidence in October 2015noting that whilst it may improve the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and short-term survival, there is insufficient evidence to know if adrenaline had beneficial or harmful effects on survival to discharge from hospital and on neurological outcomes. ILCOR has called for placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the use of any vasopressor in adult and paediatric cardiac arrest.

Summary of clinical evidence

At the time of initiating the study, a systematic review of the literature identified two relevant randomised, placebo controlled trials and 16 observational studies. The PACA trial, aimed to enrol 5000 patients but at the time the study closed, only 601 patients had been randomised. The relatively small numbers led to the results having large uncertainty. ROSC [short term survival] was higher in those receiving adrenaline (64/272 (23.5%) vs. 22/262 (8.4%); OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0–5.6), but there was not clear evidence of a benefit in survival to hospital discharge [long term survival]: adrenaline 11 (4.0%) vs. placebo 5 (1.9%) (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.7–6.3). In addition to the study's imprecision, interpretation of the findings is limited by a large number of post randomisation exclusions (n = 67, 11%).

Statistical analysis

The primary analysis will be by intention to treat, comparing the outcomes between all participants randomised to adrenaline and all those randomised to placebo.

Results will be presented as estimates of the treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals. Dichotomous outcomes (survival to 30 days, survived event, and survival to hospital discharge, 3, 6 and 12 months) will be analysed using logistic regression models, both unadjusted and adjusted for appropriate covariates which are selected a priori in agreement with the Data Monitoring Committee and Trial Steering Committee. Survival and other time to event outcomes will be analysed using time to event techniques. Continuous outcomes will be analysed by regression methods and the results presented as the difference in means between the groups and 95% confidence intervals. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be analysed by ordinal logistic regression and presented using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Reporting of analyses will follow CONSORT guidelines.

The following exploratory analyses will be used to investigate potential moderators of the treatment effect of adrenaline by fitting interaction terms in the logistic or linear regression models described above:

- Age
- Witnessed cardiac arrest versus not witnessed
- Bystander CPR versus no bystander CPR
- Type of initial rhythm (VF/VT, PEA, Asystole)
- Time of 999 call to administration of adrenaline
- Aetiology of cardiac arrest (presumed cardiac versus non-cardiac).

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^115gALiX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the effectiveness of drugs, such as epinephrine, is highly time-dependent. The intraosseous, as compared with intravenous, drug route may facilitate more rapid drug administration, but its effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain.

Methods

In a multicenter, open-label randomized trial across 11 emergency medical systems in the United Kingdom, paramedics randomly assigned adults in cardiac arrest requiring drug therapy to an intraosseous-first or intravenous-first vascular access strategy. The primary outcome was survival at 30-days, with key secondary outcomes including favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 3, range 0–6) and return of spontaneous circulation. We made no adjustment for multiplicity.

Results

Among 6082 randomized participants, 30-day survival occurred in 137 of 3030 (4.5%) in the intraosseous group and 155 of 3034 (5.1%) in the intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio 0.945, 95% confidence interval 0.676–1.322, p = 0.741). A favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge occurred in 80/2994 (2.7%) and 85/2986 (2.8%) in the intraosseous and intravenous groups, respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 0.914, 95% CI 0.567–1.474) and return of spontaneous circulation at any time in 1092/3031 (36.0%) and 1186/3035 patients (39.1%) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.863; 95% confidence interval, 0.765 to 0.974). During the trial, one adverse event was reported, which occurred in the intraosseous group.

Conclusions

In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring drug therapy, an intraosseous-first strategy did not improve the rate of 30-day survival. (Funded by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research; Trial registration: ISRCTN14223494).

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^114VDMWr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Favourable neurological outcome at discharge

The proportion of patients who survived to hospital discharge with a favourable neurological outcome decreased with time in both the adrenaline and the placebo group (p < 0.001).

The odds ratio for favourable neurological outcome in the logistic model did not change over time (p = 0.39. risk difference: 0.004, 95% CI − 0.006 to 0.013, p = 0.450). The curves appear to converge after approximately 20 min from the time of cardiac arrest. This is limited by very low frequency counts and, therefore, should be interpreted with caution.

Figure 3 shows that the probability of survival with favourable neurological outcome is estimated to be 0.16 (adrenaline, 95% CI 0.09–0.22) and 0.12 (placebo, 95% CI 0.06–0.17) when time to treatment is zero minutes and < 0.01 for both groups when time to treatment is 40 min.

### Cost-effectiveness of adrenaline for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113GWyYw]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The 'Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration In Cardiac Arrest' (PARAMEDIC2) trial showed that adrenaline improves overall survival, but not neurological outcomes. We sought to determine the within-trial and lifetime health and social care costs and benefits associated with adrenaline, including secondary benefits from organ donation.

Methods

We estimated the costs, benefits (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with adrenaline during the 6-month trial follow-up. Model-based analyses explored how results altered when the time horizon was extended beyond 6 months and the scope extended to include recipients of donated organs.

Results

The within-trial (6months) and lifetime horizon economic evaluations focussed on the trial population produced ICERs of £1,693,003 (€1,946,953) and £81,070 (€93,231) per QALY gained in 2017 prices, respectively, reflecting significantly higher mean costs and only marginally higher mean QALYs in the adrenaline group. The probability that adrenaline is cost-effective was less than 1% across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. Combined direct economic effects over the lifetimes of survivors and indirect economic effects in organ recipients produced an ICER of £16,086 (€18,499) per QALY gained for adrenaline with the probability that adrenaline is cost-effective increasing to 90% at a £30,000 (€34,500) per QALY cost-effectiveness threshold.

Conclusions

Adrenaline was not cost-effective when only directly related costs and consequences are considered. However, incorporating the indirect economic effects associated with transplanted organs substantially alters cost-effectiveness, suggesting decision-makers should consider the complexity of direct and indirect economic impacts of adrenaline.

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^112xDFWz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The background to the trial, methods and baseline characteristics of the randomised patients have been previously reported.

The protocol was approved South Central–Oxford C Research Ethics Committee and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. Trial oversight was provided by independent trial steering and data monitoring committees. The trial was designed and conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, the Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and Council, which was transposed into legislation in the United Kingdom by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. Due to the emergency nature of the trial, it was not possible to obtain consent before enrolment. In accordance with the clinical trial regulations, and with permission from the ethics committee, consent to continue was sought after the initial emergency had passed.

In brief, PARAMEDIC-2 was a multicentre double-blinded placebo-controlled trial conducted by five National Health Service ambulance services in the United Kingdom from December 2014 to October 2017. Adult patients treated for OHCA who were not successfully resuscitated by means of defibrillation or CPR, and who met predetermined eligibility criteria, were randomly allocated to receive parenteral adrenaline or saline placebo. Randomisation occurred when trial paramedics opened packs containing prefilled 10 mL syringes loaded with either ten 1 mg doses of adrenaline or ten doses of 0.9% saline. Trial packs and their contents were identical in appearance and carried a unique identification number. In all other respects identical paramedic resuscitation protocols were followed.

Randomisation of drug packs to ambulance services was achieved using the minimisation method with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Patients, paramedics and trial staff were blinded to treatment allocation. The time of drug administration was entered manually in the ambulance clinical record.

Patients and the public were involved during the conception, design, conduct, interpretation and dissemination stages of the trial. Involvement was integrated through patient and public membership of the core research team and Trial Steering Committee, public consultation meetings and regular meetings with a patient and public advisory group.

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^114twxKs]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A key unanswered question in PARAMEDIC2 was the influence of time to drug administration. The time from collapse to drug treatment was on average 22 min. This is longer than the interval during in-hospital cardiac arrest (average 3 min) and during the majority of animal cardiac arrest models (average 9.5 min). The timing is similar to a systematic review of time to drug administration across 17 studies [19.4 min (95% CI 12.8–25.9)] and with more recent studies (range 13–24 min). This analysis of time to treatment shows that the shorter the time to treatment, whether treatment was adrenaline or placebo, is associated with the best outcomes. Current treatment algorithms recommend that CPR is started (and if indicated defibrillation) before adrenaline is administered. This finding is, therefore, probably related to a shorter duration of low or no flow time after the onset of cardiac arrest. The later administration of adrenaline increases the chances of ROSC relative to placebo but without incremental improvement in longer term outcomes. This discordance may in part explain improved ROSC, but smaller effects on long-term survival and minimal influence on favourable neurological outcome.

The present study explored if the treatment effects differed according to whether the initial rhythm was shockable or non-shockable. In an analysis of in-hospital cardiac arrests with an initial shockable rhythm, Andersen et al. found that very early (within 2 min of first defibrillation) compared with no or late adrenaline (> 2 min) was associated with lower rates of ROSC (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60–0.83), survival (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59–0.82) and survival with a favourable neurological outcome (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58–0.83). In OHCA (time to drug administration 13 min), Ewy et al. found that delayed adrenaline reduced survival (aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.97) in patients with shockable rhythms but did not affect neurological outcomes. Hayashi noted both improved survival and better neurological outcomes in those who received adrenaline within 10 min of cardiac arrest. The present study suggests that very early adrenaline does not increase the rates of ROSC in patients with an initially shockable rhythm.

Sample size

The basis for our sample size estimate is summarised in the electronic supplement. The target sample size will be 8000, which is expected to give a width of the 95% CI for the risk ratio of approximately 0.4 or slightly less; for a risk ratio of 1.25 the 95% CI is 1.07–1.46, and for risk ratio of 1.0 it is 0.84–1.19. There is a trade-off between precision and practicality in setting a target sample size; above 8000, there is only a small improvement in precision, but the difficulty and time needed to recruit this number increase significantly. Using a conventional significance test based sample size calculation, this sample size would give 93% power to detect an increase in survival of 2% (from 6% to 8%), with (two-sided) type I error rate of 5%. We expect very few missing data for survival outcomes; in a previous trial we ascertained survival status for over 99% of randomised patients, and we have therefore not adjusted the sample size estimates to account for missing data.

Ethical/legal considerations and trial registration

We have previously reported our assessment of the ethical considerations for this trial. Further details are contained in the on-line supplementary material.

The Oxford Research Ethics Committee C (REC: 14/SC/0157) and Medical Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA) (EudraCT:2014-000792-11) approved the study protocol. The trial registration number is ISRCTN73485024.

Provision of general information about the trial

We issued a national press release in August 2014 which received substantial national and regional media coverage. Additional information has been distributed by ambulance services in each of the regions. In addition study information leaflets (Fig. 3) have been distributed via pharmacies, emergency departments, local councils, libraries, Register of Births and Deaths offices, Foundation Trust members and general practitioner surgeries. Patient and public facing information was designed with extensive input from our lay advisory group. Full details about the trial are available on the study website:

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^114WJWMQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The incidence of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) currently ranges from 30.0 to 97.1 per 100 000 individuals, with a survival rate of 3.1% to 20.4%. Prehospital resuscitation for OHCA relies on seamless implementation of the chain of survival, including dispatcher‐assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and dispatcher‐assisted public access defibrillator use. In Taoyuan, Taiwan, the current (2024) rates of bystander CPR and public access defibrillator use are 71.1% and 8.7%, respectively. With the improvement in the quality of basic life support, subsequent efforts must also be made to enhance advanced life support to strengthen the chain of survival.

Compared with placebo, epinephrine markedly improved the rate of survival to discharge of OHCA cases in the PARAMEDIC is the name of trial. Hansen et al revealed that every minute of delay in administering epinephrine during OHCA reduces the likelihood of survival to discharge by 4% to 7%. In addition, studies have indicated that early use of epinephrine in patients experiencing cardiac arrest leads to improved outcomes. Current guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend administering epinephrine as early as possible in patients with a nonshockable rhythm.

### Prehospital determinants of successful resuscitation after traumatic and non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^115YhEkR]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

A negative association between the administration of prehospital epinephrine and outcome has been previously reported. The recent randomised trial Pre-hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug administration In Cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC-2) demonstrated a 30-day survival advantage for epinephrine versus placebo, but no difference in neurological intact survival. This suggests that while epinephrine administration may increase survival this does not translate to meaningful survival in OHCA. This trial excluded patients who had an ROSC during initial resuscitation (before epinephrine was indicated), and are therefore a cohort of longer duration arrests that would be expected to have a worse outcome. Our data also included patients who had an early ROSC, in whom epinephrine was not administered, which might explain our findings that epinephrine administration was associated with worse outcomes (compounded by the length of arrest).

The presence of an air ambulance was strongly associated with improved survival at both time points in NTCA and at admission in TCA. It would be tempting to attribute this to the critical care skills of air ambulance providers, and previous literature has suggested this. However, in the East of England this is also likely to represent effective triage of patients who are more likely to survive. In particular, we cannot determine how many of the patients attended by an air ambulance had already obtained ROSC, with the critical care team instead being tasked to assist with post-ROSC care.

It is interesting that we were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of defibrillation prior to arrival of EEAST, which we take to be a measure of the effectiveness of public access defibrillators corrected for the other factors that we considered. However, only a small number of patients (n = 141) were defibrillated prior to EEAST arrival, introducing the chance of a type 2 error.

### The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial [^112kfeWu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Examining the influence of time to treatment was an a priori, planned analysis of the PARAMEDIC2 trial.

The time interval to administration of treatment was recorded from the time the first 999 emergency call was received to administration of the trial drug. Analyses assessed the primary outcome: survival at 30 days, and secondary outcomes: survival at discharge, ROSC at hospital admission and neurological outcome at discharge from hospital. The neurological outcome was measured using a modified Rankin scale (mRS) assessment [ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death)] where a score of 0–3 inclusive was considered favourable.

The effect of time to administration of trial drug on primary and secondary outcomes was examined within the group of patients whose cardiac arrest was EMS or bystander witnessed. Analysis was restricted to these patients because the delay between cardiac arrest and the 999 call was unknown for unwitnessed cases. Some of the witnessed patients (n = 42) were found to have a treatment time interval in excess of 60 min. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of these extreme outliers.

### Early epinephrine administration for cardiac arrest… [^1139EyEk]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Okubo et al1 observed a time-dependent association between epinephrine administration and survival to hospital discharge and a favorable funtional outcome at discharge in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable or nonshockable cardiac rhythm. Most of our recent understanding of the role of epinephrine during CPR comes from the PARAMEDIC-2 randomized clinical trial3 that compared epinephrine with placebo in 8014 patients with OHCA in the UK and showed that epinephrine increased return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge compared with placebo. Another concern was that epinephrine use increased intensive care admissions in patients who subsequently died.

A secondary cost-analysis of PARAMEDIC-2 suggested that epinephrine use was associated with an increase in the number of organs donated by nonsurvivors and the number of organ transplant recipients. 4 When organ donation and transplants were taken into account, administration of epinephrine changed from not being a cost-effective option to being a cost-effective intervention. The study by Okuda et al1 corroborates another secondary finding of the PARAMEDIC-2 study in that any beneficial treatment effect of epinephrine on ROSC, survival to discharge, and favorable functional outcome declined with increasing time to drug administration compared with placebo, and any beneficial treatment effect was greater for initial nonshockable cardiac rhythms. 5 There are no randomized clinical trials of epinephrine for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

In that study of patients with initial nonshockable cardiac rhythm, survival decreased in a stepwise fashion for every 3 minutes of delay to administration of the first epinephrine dose. 6 For shockable rhythms, however, propensity score–matched data from the same IHCA registry that accounted for resuscitation time bias found that epinephrine given within the first 2 minutes of CPR was associated with decreased ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and favorable neurological outcome at discharge. 7.

Randomisation and blinding

Randomisation will use a system of pre-randomised, numbered treatment packs containing 10 pre-filled syringes of adrenaline (1 mg) or placebo. The randomisation allocation will be 1:1 (active: control). The packs for either intervention will be identical in appearance thus ensuring allocation concealment for the attending clinicians, Research Paramedics and trial administration team. The pre-randomised sequence will be prepared by the trial statistician and only he/she will be able to link the drug pack number to the allocation of adrenaline or placebo. However, all statistical analyses will use masked allocation to avoid the revelation of the true allocation. The sequence will be generated using simple randomisation to ensure approximate balance between numbers of patients receiving adrenaline and placebo within each ambulance service. When ambulance service personnel identify an eligible patient, randomisation will be achieved by opening one of the packs carried by the vehicle attending the arrest.

Trial intervention

Participants will receive resuscitation according to the Resuscitation Council (UK) Advanced Life Support Guidelines, except that standard adrenaline will be substituted with the trial drug drawn from a single trial treatment pack.

Participants enrolled in the intervention arm will receive adrenaline 1 mg contained in 3 mL pre-filled syringes. Participants in the control arm will receive 0.9% saline formulated as identical 3 mL pre-filled syringes. Each treatment pack will contain 10 treatment doses. After this clinicians will review the appropriateness of continued resuscitation and either transfer to hospital or terminate resuscitation efforts. Trial interventions will cease when the patient arrives in an emergency department or when resuscitation efforts are discontinued. Treatment after admission to hospital will be at the discretion of the attending clinician.

### Association of timing of epinephrine administration with outcomes in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^116xqH9c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Comparison With Previous Studies

Previous studies have reported inconsistent findings about the timing of epinephrine administration in patients with OHCA. A retrospective observational study in Michigan found that early epinephrine administration (time from 9-1-1 call to epinephrine administration, ≤ 10 minutes) was not associated with survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.35–2.37) for adults with OHCA compared with late epinephrine administration (time from 9-1-1 call to epinephrine administration, > 10 minutes). A secondary analysis of a clinical trial in the UK that included 4810 patients with OHCA found that 30-day survival (interaction OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94–1.03) and favorable functional outcomes at hospital discharge (interaction OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93–1.03) were not substantively different over time between the epinephrine and placebo groups, suggesting that timing of epinephrine administration is not an effect modifier on survival and functional outcome. In contrast, a secondary analysis of the ROC registry reported that each additional minute of time from EMS arrival to epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in the odds of survival to hospital discharge (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95–0.98) for patients with nonshockable cardiac rhythms. In a 2019 systematic review, the authors recognized that all included studies investigating the timing of epinephrine administration had a critical risk of bias attributable to confounding and/or selection bias. The high degree of heterogeneity across the studies and the serious critical risk of bias precluded any meaningful assessment of the optimal timing of epinephrine administration.

Implications

The latest resuscitation guidelines and international recommendations emphasize early epinephrine administration for OHCA. Findings of the present study support earlier epinephrine administration for OHCA with shockable and nonshockable cardiac rhythms and provide further evidence to complement these guidelines and recommendations. Another implication is that later epinephrine was found to be associated with ROSC but inversely associated with survival to hospital discharge and favorable functional outcomes. This discordance may suggest that later epinephrine administration might not be beneficial for survival to hospital discharge and functional recovery. The reasons for this discordance are unclear, but it is possible that longer resuscitation time may be associated with poor outcome, and epinephrine is the only intervention associated with increased odds of ROSC in patients with OHCA.

Key messages

- Currently, there was only one RCT which compared prehospital adrenaline administration versus placebo among out of hospital cardiac arrest patients.

- Receiving prehospital adrenaline significantly increased prehospital ROSC, but not for overall ROSC, hospital admission, and survival to discharge.

### Association of epinephrine and outcome in cardiac arrest with refractory shockable rhythm: a population-based, propensity-score matched analysis [^1152gDN3]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Even though epinephrine increases cerebral and coronary perfusion during cardiac arrest through alpha-1-adrenergic receptors, thereby increasing the odds of ROSC, it also increases myocardial demand, decreases sub-endocardial perfusion, and favors arrhythmia, through beta-adrenergic receptors which could explain lower survival rates in patients with shockable rhythm. At the brain level, its potential detrimental impact on neurological outcome could be mediated by its effect in microcirculation that can lead to reduced cerebral perfusion that was reported in animals.

Given the observational nature of our data, it is essential to recognize that causality cannot be conclusively established in this context, and we can only compile indirect evidence. The strength of the association, its consistency following propensity-score analysis, the dose–response relationship, biological plausibility and the plausible temporal sequence of events all contribute to reinforcing this hypothesis. Given the persistent uncertainty regarding the use of epinephrine in the setting of shockable OHCA, we believe that alternative strategies might be considered. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate alternative therapeutic options for OHCA, including investigations into the potential benefits of glucocorticoids, vasopressin, or beta-blockade. Double sequential external defibrillation should be considered for refractory ventricular fibrillation, as a randomized controlled trial has demonstrated its association with improved survival and favorable neurological outcome. Recent observational studies have also explored the reduction of epinephrine doses, yielding conflicting findings. An ongoing randomized controlled trial, the CanROC Epinephrine Dose trial (NCT 03826524), aims to compare the efficacy of low-dose (up to 2 mg) versus standard-dose epinephrine in patients with shockable rhythms. Furthermore, an additional therapeutic option under consideration is extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), increasingly being regarded as a potential rescue therapy for refractory shockable cardiac arrest. Recently, three randomized controlled trial were published on ECPR in out of hospital refractory ventricular fibrillation with conflicting results, and survival rates ranging from 20% up to 43%. A meta-analysis of these trials concludes that ECPR improves survival with a good neurological outcome especially when the first rhythm is shockable. In this study, the number needed to treat was 7 in patients with shockable rhythm, whereas in PARAMEDICS 2 the number needed to treat with epinephrine was 112. Another recent meta-analysis of trials and propensity score matched studies, found that ECPR improved outcomes after cardiac arrest, particularly after in-hospital cardiac arrest. In light of recent data, including our observational findings, current guidelines may need to be reevaluated to discourage the use of epinephrine in cardiac arrest with refractory shockable rhythms and to carefully reconsider the role of ECPR in selected patients with refractory shockable rhythms. ECPR could represent a valuable alternative; however, its use requires a thorough cost-effectiveness evaluation. Indeed, it requires considerable ressources and incurs significant costs. To date, only a few studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ECPR, with mixed results that may not be directly applicable to the French healthcare system. Additionnal data are needed to optimize the efficiency of ECPR and ensure its use in carefully selected patients. Moreover, for ECPR to be effectively implemented, pre-hospital care should adopt an approach similar to that used in the ARREST trial to minimize delays from cardiac arrest to ECMO initiation thereby optimizing patient selection for ECPR. This strategy involves patient's transport under continuous chest compressions in cases of refractory shockable cardiac arrest, directing patients to specialized cardiac arrest centers equipped for immediate coronary angiography and rapid ECPR initiation in the absence of ROSC.

Mechanisms of action

A detailed review of the mechanism of action for adrenaline in cardiac arrest has been published previously. In brief, potentially beneficial effects are attributed to stimulation of α receptors in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction. This increases aortic diastolic pressure, which in turn leads to increased coronary perfusion pressures, which is associated with an increased chance of ROSC. Potentially harmful effects are α and β receptor mediated and include reduced cerebral micro-vascular blood flow and exacerbation of cerebral injury, cardiovascular instability after ROSC, and adverse immunomodulatory, and metabolic effects. Experimental studies have shown that β-blocker treatment may mitigate some of these harms.

Clinicians' views on the safety and effectiveness of adrenaline

To assess attitudes of the UK clinical community on the role of adrenaline for the treatment of cardiac arrest we conducted a written survey of 213 attendees (doctors, nurses, paramedics) at the Resuscitation Council (UK) Annual Scientific Symposium in September 2012. Respondents expressed their agreement to a series of statements on a 7 point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree). Respondents reported that they believed that adrenaline increased short term survival (median score 6 (IQR 6–7), but disagreed that it improved long term outcomes (median score 2 (IQR 2–3)). There was greatest uncertainty about the balance of risks and benefits of IV adrenaline (Fig. 1 a). Respondents felt the most pressing future research need for the NHS was a trial comparing adrenaline to placebo (Fig. 1 b).

Summary

The use of adrenaline in cardiac arrest increases the chances that the heart is restarted [ROSC] but there remains doubt as to whether this is translated into improved or worse long term survival and neurological outcomes. The Pre-hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug administration In Cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC-2) trial seeks to establish whether the use of intravenous adrenaline, administered in accordance with current cardiac arrest guidelines is helpful or harmful.

For those that do not wish to participate

We have developed a system to allow individuals to decline participation in the trial based on the approach used by the North American Resuscitation Outcome Consortium. An online form can be completed on the website or the team can be contacted by phone or email. A stainless steel "No Study" bracelet will be issued to the person's home address and with the person's permission, their home address will be passed to their local ambulance service to register their wishes. They will also be asked to inform those close to them of their wishes and that those wishes will be respected by the treating paramedics. Paramedics are trained to look for the bracelet.

Enrolment, consent and follow-up

Cardiac arrest outside a hospital is a sudden, unexpected event. The victim becomes unconscious rapidly and thus loses mental capacity. Treatment must be initiated immediately making it impractical to obtain informed consent from the patient or legal representatives. Authorisation to enrol patients under waiver of consent regulations was granted by the Research Ethics Committee. Once the initial emergency has passed, patients (or their legal representative (usually a relative) if the patient lacks capacity) will be provided with written information about the study and consent to continue in the follow-up elements of the study will be sought. Full information about our approach to informing patients and their relatives about the trial and their follow-up can be found in the on-line supplement.

### Association of epinephrine and outcome in cardiac arrest with refractory shockable rhythm: a population-based, propensity-score matched analysis [^1141VhNi]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based registry including over 3000 patients with refractory shockable rhythm managed with advanced life support, only 1 patient out of five did not receive epinephrine, although it is recommended in current guidelines. Furthermore, we observed a negative and dose dependent association between epinephrine use and favorable outcome among patients with OHCA with refractory shockable rhythm, a result which remained consistent using different statistical approaches. Given these findings and the potential for alternative treatments, we believe that the use of epinephrine in this patient population may warrant reevaluation.

In our large population, reflecting real-life practices over 10 years, one fifth of patients with refractory shockable rhythm did not receive epinephrine, despite current guidelines. This unexpected result might be the consequence of increasing reluctance of EMS to use epinephrine. The results of the PARAMEDICS2 trial, which were released in 2018, showed an association between epinephrine and survival after OHCA, but at the cost of a higher rate of severe neurologic impairment in survivors, and therefore ultimately without any difference regarding favorable neurologic outcome during follow-up. An observational study conducted in the United States in 2022 found that 16% of American states made a change in their cardiac arrest protocol since 2018, the most frequent change being a reduction in the cumulative dose of epinephrine. In the present study, we did not observe any temporal effects on the use of epinephrine associated with the publication year of PARAMEDICS 2. However, EMS might have previously adjusted their protocols in response to earlier studies that raised questions about the use of epinephrine, even before the release of PARAMEDICS 2. We also conducted a comprehensive analysis of factors associated with the administration of epinephrine. Our findings revealed that longer delays, advanced age, and a greater number of defibrillations were all associated with the use of epinephrine in our study population. A previous study found that factors associated with epinephrine use in shockable rhythm were older age, male sex and non-witnessed cardiac arrest. Specific analysis of epinephrine use in OHCA with shockable rhythm is justified by limited and inconsistent litterature in this setting.

### Epinephrine for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134gtv5]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating epinephrine for adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation.

Data Sources

The search included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine, clinical trial registries, and bibliographies.

Study Selection

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers.

Data Extraction

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers.

Data Synthesis

A total of 17 trials (21,510 patients) were included; seven were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared to placebo, pooled results from two trials showed that standard dose of epinephrine increased return of spontaneous circulation (risk ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 2.82–3.89), survival to hospital admission (risk ratio, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.68–3.72), and survival to discharge (risk ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11–1.86). The largest placebo-controlled trial showed that standard dose of epinephrine also improved survival at 30 days and 3 months but not neurologic outcomes, standard dose of epinephrine decreased return of spontaneous circulation (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.98) and survival to admission (risk ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–0.99) when compared with high dose epinephrine. There were no differences in outcomes between standard dose of epinephrine and vasopressin alone or in combination with epinephrine.

Conclusions

Largely based on one randomized controlled trial, standard dose of epinephrine improved overall survival but not neurologic outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients compared with placebo. There is a paucity of trials with meaningful patient outcomes; future epinephrine trials should evaluate dose and method of delivery on long-term survival, neurologic function, and quality of life after cardiac arrest.

### Pre-hospital assessment of the role of adrenaline: measuring the effectiveness of drug administration in cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC-2): trial protocol [^115CqgTf]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

A second randomised study compared intravenous (IV) cannulation and injection of drugs (including adrenaline) versus no IV cannula or drugs amongst 851 patients with OHCA. The patients in the IV group had better short-term survival (ROSC 165/418 (40%) vs. 107/433 (25%), OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.48–2.67)); however, there was no clear difference in long term survival outcomes (survival to hospital discharge (IV arm 44/418 (10.5%) vs. no IV arm 40/433 (9.2%) OR 1.16 (95%CI 0.74–1.82), or favourable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 1–2: IV 9.8% vs. no IV 8.1% OR 1.24 (0.77–1.98). The higher rate of ROSC was seen mainly in the patients with initial non-shockable rhythms (asystole and PEA): 29% (IV) vs. 11% (no IV). The rate of ROSC was 59% (IV) vs. 53% (no IV) in those patients with an initial rhythm of VF/VT.

Observational studies allow large amounts of data to be collected but are often limited by bias, and confounding. Statistical techniques can be used to adjust for differences in measured confounding variables, however unknown confounders may still lead to biased results. This is illustrated by two propensity score matched analyses from the same cohort of patients. The studies used slightly different statistical models produced different results. One showed worse long term neurologically outcomes (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.44), whereas the other study showed marginal benefit (1.57, 1.04–2.37). Meta-analyses of such studies should be interpreted with caution but show better short term outcomes (return of spontaneous circulation) and either no difference or worse long term survival and neurological outcomes.(Table 1)

This creates the paradox of better short term survival at the cost of worse long term outcomes, in other words a 'double-edged sword'.

Patient and public involvement (PPI)

We sought guidance from patients and the public during the conception, design and running of the trial. We held a community engagement event (supported by West Midlands South CLRN) in late November 2012 where we presented the scientific rationale behind this trial to a group of 280 lay-people who were interested in first aid. After preparing the talk in collaboration with one of our PPI representatives (John Long) to ensure concepts were presented in plain, understandable English, we delivered the presentation and addressed questions/queries from the group. We explained the concept of short term and longer-term outcomes and briefly sought community views about priorities for outcomes and their views on a trial of adrenaline for out of hospital cardiac arrest. We received responses from 243 participants. Ninety-five percent of respondents prioritised long-term survival over short-term survival (hours to days). Participants broadly agreed there was a need for further research about adrenaline as a treatment for cardiac arrest (86% agreed, 8% neither agree nor disagreed, 6% disagreed). Patient and public representatives serve on our trial management group and study steering committee. In addition we consulted user groups via the Clinical Research Ambassador Group and University/User Teaching and Research Action Partnership and Resuscitation Council (UK) and established a patient advisory group to assist with the design of supporting material and our approach to sharing information about the study.

### Epinephrine's effects on cerebrovascular and systemic hemodynamics during cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^117WiFpk]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Epinephrine remains a mainstay in the treatment of cardiac arrest, but there continues to be debate on its safety and efficacy. In various pediatric and adult studies of cardiac arrest, early epinephrine administration was associated with increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and improved neurological outcomes when compared with late administration. Conversely, there are several studies suggesting that epinephrine does not improve outcomes and may possibly confer a harmful effect. In the large PARAMEDIC-2 randomized double-blind clinical trial of epinephrine versus placebo for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in adults, the use of epinephrine improved the 30-day survival rate, but did not improve survival with favorable neurologic outcomes.

A fundamental issue with epinephrine's mixed effects in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) lies in an incomplete understanding of its mechanistic effects on cerebrovascular hemodynamics. While epinephrine increases systemic arterial blood pressure, there are conflicting experimental results regarding its effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral tissue oxygenation. Specifically, animal studies have demonstrated both increases and decreases in various measurements of CBF following epinephrine administration during CPR. Maintaining CBF during CPR is an important physiologic target to minimize potentially devastating effects of cerebral hypoperfusion during this vulnerable period. Thus, better delineation of the effect of epinephrine on CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation during CPR is an important knowledge gap in the quest to improve both mortality and neurologic morbidity following cardiac arrest.

In this study, we assessed the cerebrovascular hemodynamic and cerebral tissue oxygenation effects of intravenous bolus-dosed epinephrine, using both invasive and noninvasive measurements of CBF and cerebral oxygen saturation in a swine model of asphyxia-associated cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that (1) repeated epinephrine doses during CPR will increase CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation, (2) the effects of repeated epinephrine administration are attenuated with subsequent doses, and (3) noninvasive measurements of CBF and cerebral oxygenation directly correlate with invasive measurements.

### Effect of time to treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs on return of spontaneous circulation in shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^116k6yf5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, the optimal sequence of Advanced Cardiac Life Support interventions for VF/pVT cardiac arrest, including administration of epinephrine or antiarrhythmic drug, at the optimal dose and the timing of medication administration in relation to other interventions, is not known. In this study, we saw a higher ROSC rate with early amiodarone administration (compared with placebo); a secondary analysis of the PARAMEDIC‐2 (Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) trial showed an increased chance of ROSC with a longer time to epinephrine administration (compared with placebo). Exploring the timing of antiarrhythmics during resuscitation and the order of antiarrhythmics versus epinephrine (ie, amiodarone before epinephrine versus after epinephrine) may result in improved overall rate of ROSC. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest is complex, with hemodynamic, autonomic, and electrophysiologic factors playing a significant role. Each phase of resuscitation may require different, tailored, antiarrhythmic therapy. Improved understanding of these phases is important to the identification of novel antiarrhythmic targets for resuscitation and the optimal bundle of care for shock‐refractory VF/pVT. The translation of optimized basic life support and advanced life support interventions into the best possible outcome is contingent on the optimal transition between intra‐arrest and post–cardiac arrest care. This requires effective implementation of techniques to identify ROSC reliably and timely implementation of therapeutic strategies to give patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest the best chance for survival with favorable neurological function.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous administration of adrenaline in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a secondary analysis of the PARAMEDIC2 placebo-controlled trial [^114auyD4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the effectiveness of the intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO) routes for drug administration in adults with a cardiac arrest enrolled in the Pre-Hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest (PARAMEDIC2) randomised, controlled trial.

Methods

Patients were recruited from five National Health Service Ambulance Services in England and Wales from December 2014 through October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg adrenaline or matching placebo. Intravascular access was established as soon as possible, and IO access was considered if IV access was not possible after two attempts.

Results

Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 3631 received adrenaline and 3686 received placebo. Amongst these, 1116 (30.1%) and 1121 (30.4%) received the study drug via the IO route. The odds ratios were similar in the IV and IO groups for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at hospital handover [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.07 (95% CI 3.42–4.85) and (aOR 3.98 (95% CI 2.86–5.53), P value for interaction 0.90]; survival to 30 days [aOR 1.67 (1.18–2.35) versus 0.9 (0.4–2.05), P = 0.18]; and favourable neurological outcome [aOR 1.39 (0.93–2.06) versus 0.62 (0.23–1.67), P = 0.14].

Conclusion

There was no significant difference in treatment effect (adrenaline versus placebo) on ROSC at hospital handover between drugs administered by the intraosseous route or by the intravenous route. We could not detect any difference in the treatment effect between the IV and IO routes on the longer term outcomes of 30-day survival or favourable neurological outcome at discharge (ISRCTN73485024).

### ILCOR scientific knowledge gaps and clinical research priorities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: a consensus statement [^115Vjt6F]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Vasopressors during cardiac arrest — Given uncertainty from observational studies, the 2015 CoSTR suggested that epinephrine continue to be administered to patients in cardiac arrest by using existing dosing and timing strategies. The page notes no adequately powered placebo-controlled prospective trial assessing long-term outcomes; an underpowered randomized controlled trial in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest documented a higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation without improving survival to discharge or neurological outcome, and a meta-analysis of large observational studies associated epinephrine with no change in survival to discharge and worse long-term neurological outcomes despite higher ROSC. A propensity-matched analysis of the Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry reported that epinephrine given within the first 2 minutes after the first defibrillation to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest and an initially shockable rhythm was associated with decreased odds of survival (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.59–0.82).

### Evaluation of use of epinephrine and time to first dose and outcomes in pediatric patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114hwanu]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the timing of epinephrine administration for pediatric cardiac arrest, the ILCOR Pediatric Task Force conducted systematic review and meta-analyses for which the last search was performed on March 11, 2020. The systematic review identified 4 observational studies that evaluated the timing of epinephrine administration for pediatric OHCA. Across the included studies, the certainty of evidence was very low. The meta-analyses showed that time to the first epinephrine administration of less than 15 minutes was associated with survival to hospital discharge (RR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.30–4.77) and 30-day survival (RR, 5.78; 95% CI, 2.82–11.86), but not associated with survival with good neurological outcome (RR, 3.94; 95% CI, 0.99–15.64), compared with time to the first epinephrine administration of greater than 15 minutes. None of the included studies in the systematic review and meta-analyses accounted for resuscitation time bias which might have led the difference in survival between results in the meta-analyses and our study.

Implications

First, our results would support epinephrine administration for pediatric OHCA and provide evidence to complement current resuscitation guidelines. It is worth noting that this current study included 1432 patients in the PS-matched cohort and may have been underpowered to detect significant difference in favorable functional outcome since a clinical trial that showed an effect of epinephrine on survival after adult OHCA was designed to enroll 8000 patients to detect a risk ratio of 1.25 on 30-day survival. Our study results may justify a well-powered future clinical trial to evaluate an effect of epinephrine for pediatric OHCA, although relatively low incidence of pediatric OHCA would be one of the difficulties of conducting such a trial. Additionally, since our study population is heterogenous, including broad range of age and diverse causes of arrest, there may be a subset of patients who have more benefit from epinephrine. Further investigation of such phenotypes would be important since a future trial could focus on those phenotypes with efficient sample size. Second, given the sample size limitation in pediatric OHCA research and expected challenges of conducting future trials, our findings support enhancing a collaborative research network across multiple regional and national OHCA data sets and further advancing our knowledge of intra-arrest interventions for pediatric patients using robust observational study designs.

### Epinephrine for out of hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11328vzw]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of epinephrine, compared with control treatments, on survival at admission, ROSC, survival at discharge, and a favorable neurologic outcome in adult patients during OHCA.

Data Source

MEDLINE and PubMed from inception to August 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on adult patients after OHCA treated with epinephrine versus controls.

Data Extraction

Independent, double-data extraction; risk of bias assessment with Cochrane Collaboration's criteria.

Data Synthesis

15 RCTs representing 20 716 OHCA adult patients. Epinephrine, compared with all pooled treatments, was associated with a better survival rate to hospital discharge (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.00–1.35) and a favorable neurologic outcome (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04–1.48). No difference was found in survival to hospital admission (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.75–1.38) and ROSC when comparing epinephrine with all pooled treatments (RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.84–1.53). When epinephrine was compared with a placebo/no drugs, survival to hospital discharge (RR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08–1.67), ROSC (RR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.18–3.51) and survival to hospital admission (RR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.22–3.43) were increased, but there was not a favorable neurologic outcome (RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.99–1.51).

Conclusions

In OHCA, standard or high doses of epinephrine should be used because they improved survival to hospital discharge and resulted in a meaningful clinical outcome. There was also a clear advantage of using epinephrine over a placebo or no drugs in the considered outcomes.

### Prehospital factors predicting mortality in patients with shock: state-wide linkage study [^116hdpUb]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

We found that patients who received prehospital endotracheal intubation had a higher 30-day mortality rate compared with those who did not. Endotracheal intubation has long been considered the optimal method for protecting the airway, preventing hypoxia and controlling ventilation prior to hospital arrival. In Victoria, like elsewhere, patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest routinely undergo prehospital endotracheal intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for airway management. Therefore, our finding of the higher 30-day mortality among intubated patients is likely confounded by out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as the proportion of patients with cardiac arrest among the non-survivors was significantly higher than the survivors. Nevertheless, several authors have reported significantly higher chances of survival to hospital admission in patients who received prehospital intubation compared with those who did not after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Prehospital airway management remains paramount, and current guidelines recommend intubation in patients with shock. Our data support robust prehospital randomised controlled trials (RCTs) into optimal airway management in critically unwell patients.

We report that administration of epinephrine was associated with lower mortality. The use of epinephrine for patients with prehospital hypotension is likely to result in improvements of blood pressure and allows sufficient time to initiate resuscitative measures with vasopressors and volume resuscitation. Authors of small observational studies have reported the effectiveness of epinephrine in augmenting hypotension in the prehospital setting similar to our study. However, the effectiveness of epinephrine use in the prehospital setting has been controversial. Some authors report worse outcomes or no benefit with epinephrine administration with regards survival to discharge or neurological outcomeswhile others report the benefits of epinephrine to be time dependentor dose dependent. Prospective, RCT are needed to determine the efficacy of epinephrine in reducing mortality and improving clinical outcomes in the prehospital setting. One such trial, underway in the state of Victoria, Australia is the Paramedic Randomised Trial of Noradrenaline versus Adrenaline in the Initial Management of Patients with Cardiogenic Shock (PANDA Trial: ACTRN 12621000805875). This trial aims to compare the efficacy of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the prehospital setting in a population experiencing cardiogenic shock. The trial commenced recruitment in January 2024 and is expected to enrol 1155 patients (578 patients per group) by end of 2026. The efficacy endpoint of the PANDA trial is all-cause mortality while the safety endpoint is the development of refractory shock during prehospital care. This clinical trial will provide real-world evidence that is crucial for the management of the patients with cardiogenic shock in the prehospital setting.

### Phenomenological study exploring ethics in prehospital research from the paramedic's perspective: experiences from the paramedic-2 trial in a UK ambulance service [^113DSWGz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We set out to investigate paramedics' views of ethics and research, drawing on experiences from Paramedic-2, a randomised controlled trial comparing epinephrine and placebo in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Methods

An interpretative phenomenological approach was adopted. A purposive sample of paramedics (n = 6) from North East Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust were invited to a semi-structured, in-depth interview.

Results

Three superordinate themes emerged: (1) morality, (2) emotion and (3) equipoise. Some viewed Paramedic-2 as an opportunity to improve OHCA outcomes for the many, viewing participation as a moral obligation; others viewed the study as unethical, equating participation with immoral behaviour. Morality was a motivator to drive individual action. Positive and negative emotions were exhibited by the paramedics involved reflecting the wider view each paramedic held about trial participation. Those morally driven to participate in Paramedic-2 discussed their pride in being associated with the trial, while those who found participation unethical, discussed feelings of guilt and regret. Individual experience and perceptions of epinephrine guided each paramedic's willingness to accept or reject equipoise. Some questioned the role of epinephrine in OHCA; others believed withholding epinephrine was synonymous to denying patient care.

Conclusion

A paucity of evidence exists to support any beneficial role of epinephrine in OHCA. Despite this, some paramedics were reluctant to participate in Paramedic-2 and relied on their personal perceptions and experiences of epinephrine to guide their decision regarding participation. Failure to acknowledge the importance of individual perspectives may jeopardise the success of future out-of-hospital trials.

### Usefulness of vasopressin administered with epinephrine during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113v7vck]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Vasopressin administration has been suggested during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and a previous clinical trial has suggested that vasopressin is most effective when administered with epinephrine. Adult subjects (n = 325) who received ≥ 1 dose of intravenous epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for nontraumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomly assigned to receive 40 IU of vasopressin (n = 167) or placebo (n = 158) as soon as possible after the first dose of epinephrine. The rate of return of pulses was similar between the vasopressin and placebo groups (31% vs 30%), as was the presence of pulses at the emergency department (19% vs 23%). No subgroup appeared to be differentially affected, and no effect of vasopressin was evident after adjustment for other clinical variables. Additional open-label vasopressin was administered by a physician after the study drug for 19 subjects in the placebo group and 27 subjects in the vasopressin group. Results were similar if these subjects were excluded or were assigned to an actual drug received. Survival duration for subjects admitted to the hospital did not differ between groups. In conclusion, vasopressin administered with epinephrine does not increase the rate of return of spontaneous circulation.

### Vasopressin or epinephrine for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112ffohg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The use of vasopressin in patients with cardiac arrest presenting with specific rhythms is controversial. We performed an evidence-based emergency medicine review of evidence comparing vasopressin to epinephrine in structured cardiac arrest protocols.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases for randomized trials or systematic reviews comparing vasopressin to epinephrine for adults with cardiac arrest and measuring survival to hospital discharge and neurologic function in survivors. We used standard criteria to appraise the quality of published trials and systematic reviews. We used the random effects model in supplementary analyses to summarize results and to test for significant differences across subgroups of patients presenting with different arrest rhythms.

Results

We found 3 high-quality well-reported randomized trials and 1 rigorous meta-analysis. The evidence does not confirm a consistent benefit of vasopressin over epinephrine in increasing survival or improving neurologic outcome in survivors. Subgroup analysis reveals a large difference in effect of vasopressin over epinephrine in cardiac arrest patients with asystole, compared to other arrest rhythms, coming from within-trial comparisons. The difference is not consistent across otherwise similar trials, is not statistically significant, may reflect the application of multiple unplanned subgroup analyses, and is not supported by a plausible biological hypothesis.

Conclusion

Evidence from randomized trials does not establish a benefit of vasopressin over epinephrine in increasing survival to discharge or improving neurologic outcomes in adult patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest.

### Association of epinephrine and outcome in cardiac arrest with refractory shockable rhythm: a population-based, propensity-score matched analysis [^1114CySD]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Animal studies have long established epinephrine as the preferred drug in cardiac arrest, although the level of evidence from human studies remained relatively weak for many years. Among the two randomized controlled trials on epinephrine in OHCA, one did not find a significant association between epinephrine and survival, albeit being underpowered. In contrast, PARAMEDICS 2 identified a positive association between epinephrine administration and both ROSC and initial survival. Notably, both trials encompassed cases of both shockable and non-shockable OHCA, and a recent meta-analysis combining their results showed divergent effects based on the initial rhythm: the beneficial impact of epinephrine was more pronounced in non-shockable rhythms compared to shockable rhythms. Moreover, a study from Olaasvegen et al. indicated that achieving ROSC in shockable rhythms was not enhanced with intravenous access compared to no intravenous access. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing various epinephrine protocols (high dose, standard dose, epinephrine plus vasopressin), revealed that standard epinephrine dose improved survival at discharge in non-shockable rhythms but not in patients with shockable rhythms. Consequently, the use of epinephrine in shockable rhythms has become increasingly controversial. Observational studies concentrating on shockable rhythms have produced conflicting findings, with none establishing a positive correlation between epinephrine use and favorable neurological outcomes.

In a French study stratified on first rhythm, authors found a negative association between epinephrine and both survival and good neurological outcome in shockable rhythm. By contrast, a Japanese study found a positive association between overall survival and epinephrine, but no association with favorable neurological outcome in shockable rhythm. Nevertheless, these two studies were not limited to shockable refractory cardiac arrest and may have included patients who required only one or two shocks. Similarly, two recent studies have indicated a detrimental effect on prognosis in in-hospital cardiac arrest when epinephrine is administered before, or early after defibrillation. Finally, Matsuyama et al. did not report any association between epinephrine use and favorable outcome in patients with ventricular fibrillation refractory to one defibrillation attempt. Overall, these findings are consistent with our results, discouraging epinephrine use in cases of persistent shockable rhythms. However, these previous studies involved epinephrine use in ways that deviate from recent guidelines (where epinephrine can only be used in refractory shockable rhythm). Our study is the first to demonstrate a negative association between epinephrine use and outcome, in a cohort where epinephrine administration is advocated by current guidelines.

### Association of timing of epinephrine administration with outcomes in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114x1uAo]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has strengths. First, we addressed resuscitation time bias and time-varying confounders. Although the secondary analysis of a clinical trial in the UK also addressed resuscitation time bias given its randomized double-blind design, the difference in the results of that study and the present study may be explained by the differences in time to epinephrine administration (median intervals between EMS arrival and epinephrine administration were 14.8 minutes in the epinephrine group and 14.5 minutes in the placebo group in the UK study) and sample size. Second, RRs in the present study should be interpreted as the ratio of the risk of outcomes with epinephrine at any given minute vs the risk of outcomes without epinephrine at the same minute. This interpretation is clinically relevant for deciding whether a patient should receive epinephrine now.

This study also has limitations. First, the timing of epinephrine administration may be a surrogate of EMS performance (ie, high-performing EMS personnel may administer epinephrine early). Because information on EMS systems was unavailable, we were unable to adjust for the clustering of patients within EMS systems. Similarly, we were unable to adjust for unmeasured confounders, such as patient comorbidity, postresuscitation practice, and neighborhood factors. Second, we cannot eliminate confounding by indication (ie, EMS personnel may not have administered epinephrine in patients who were expected to have early ROSC without epinephrine or in patients who had early TOR due to futility). To account for this, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding those who had ROSC or TOR within 5 minutes after ALS arrival and observed consistent results. However, residual confounding by indication may still exist. For example, we defined cases as patients who were successfully administered epinephrine, whereas patients who had delayed epinephrine administration because of difficulty in establishing vascular access could have been matched as a control. Third, given the observational design of the present study, we could not demonstrate causation. A clinical trial comparing early vs late epinephrine could assess for a causal association between early epinephrine administration and patient outcomes. However, given the current evidence about the survival benefit of epinephrine, such a trial would not be ethically feasible. Fourth, the findings of the present study may not be generalizable to other EMS systems.

### Effects of prehospital adrenaline administration on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112k6Qwe]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, prehospital adrenaline administration might increase prehospital ROSC, but not for survival to discharge in out of hospital cardiac arrest patients. However, our findings might be subject to bias from missing studies.

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113eNN13]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study PARAMEDIC-3 was published by Keith Couper and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the trial question was: what is the role of intraosseous-first vascular access strategy in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring drug therapy? In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the population was: 6082 patients (2190 female, 3892 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring drug therapy. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; age < 18 years; pre-existing vascular access. In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the interventions were: n = 3040 intraosseous route (needle inserted into a bone by a paramedic) n = 3042 intravenous route (needle inserted into a vein by a paramedic). In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in survival at day 30 (4.5% vs. 5.1%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.32). In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in favorable neurologic outcome (2.7% vs. 2.8%; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.47) Significant decrease in return of spontaneous circulation at any time (36% vs. 39.1%; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97) Significant decrease in sustained return of spontaneous circulation at hospital handover (21.7% vs. 24.6%; OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98). In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse event. In the PARAMEDIC-3 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring drug therapy, intraosseous route was not superior to intravenous route with respect to survival at day 30.

### Standard dose epinephrine versus placebo in out of hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MDXSK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a time critical and heterogeneous presentation. The most appropriate management strategies remain an issue for debate. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the association of epinephrine versus placebo with return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge and neurological outcomes in out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

A systematic review of five databases was performed from inception to August 2018. Only randomised controlled trials were considered eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were ROSC, survival to hospital admission, neurological function on discharge and three-month survival. All studies were assessed for level of evidence and risk of bias.

Results

Five randomised controlled trials with 17,635 patients were identified for inclusion. Use of epinephrine was associated with increased ROSC (OR = 3.10; 95% CI = 2.16 to 4.45; I2 = 74%; p < 0.0001) and increased survival to hospital admission OR = 2.52; 95% CI = 1.63 to 3.88; I2 = 94%; p < 0.0001). However, epinephrine was not associated with increased survival to discharge (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 0.48 to 2.47; I2 = 77%; p = 0.84) or differences in neurological outcomes (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.34 to 1.96).

Discussion

This study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of epinephrine versus placebo in OHCA. The use of epinephrine was associated with improved ROSC and survival to hospital admission. However, use of epinephrine was not associated with a significant difference in survival to hospital discharge, neurological outcomes or survival to 3 months. Further research is required to control for the confounders during inpatient management.

### Analysis of epinephrine dose, targeted temperature management, and neurologic and survival outcomes among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112sRYLy]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Among patients resuscitated from OHCA, the adverse association between increasing epinephrine and neurologically favorable survival was modified by TTM. The relative benefit of TTM increased with higher doses of epinephrine, suggesting that TTM may have a differential effect, depending on intra-arrest treatment, in this case the total dose of epinephrine. Whether such an understanding can better direct therapy to improve survival is uncertain and requires additional investigation.

### Effect of adrenaline on survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^111ySy7Z]. Resuscitation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is little evidence from clinical trials that the use of adrenaline (epinephrine) in treating cardiac arrest improves survival, despite adrenaline being considered standard of care for many decades. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of adrenaline on patient survival to hospital discharge in out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

We conducted a double blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Identical study vials containing either adrenaline 1:1000 or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) were prepared. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 1 mL aliquots of the trial drug according to current advanced life support guidelines. Outcomes assessed included survival to hospital discharge (primary outcome), pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category Score - CPC).

Results

A total of 4103 cardiac arrests were screened during the study period of which 601 underwent randomisation. Documentation was available for a total of 534 patients: 262 in the placebo group and 272 in the adrenaline group. Groups were well matched for baseline characteristics including age, gender and receiving bystander CPR. ROSC occurred in 22 (8.4%) of patients receiving placebo and 64 (23.5%) who received adrenaline (OR = 3.4; 95% CI 2.0–5.6). Survival to hospital discharge occurred in 5 (1.9%) and 11 (4.0%) patients receiving placebo or adrenaline respectively (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 0.7–6.3). All but two patients (both in the adrenaline group) had a CPC score of 1–2.

Conclusion

Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.

### ILCOR scientific knowledge gaps and clinical research priorities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: a consensus statement [^115Z7P2L]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Vasopressors during cardiac arrest — although the efficacy of vasopressor administration during adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been questioned by several prospective randomized trials and meta-analyses, there are no human studies comparing epinephrine or combinations of vasopressors with controls for pediatric OHCA, and a small case series suggested that the use of epinephrine could be harmful in sudden, witnessed arrest; the 2015 CoSTR recommended standard doses of epinephrine.

### Vasopressin and epinephrine vs. epinephrine alone in cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^114vaNfE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

During the administration of advanced cardiac life support for resuscitation from cardiac arrest, a combination of vasopressin and epinephrine may be more effective than epinephrine or vasopressin alone, but evidence is insufficient to make clinical recommendations.

Methods

In a multicenter study, we randomly assigned adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to receive successive injections of either 1 mg of epinephrine and 40 IU of vasopressin or 1 mg of epinephrine and saline placebo, followed by administration of the same combination of study drugs if spontaneous circulation was not restored and subsequently by additional epinephrine if needed. The primary end point was survival to hospital admission; the secondary end points were return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital discharge, good neurologic recovery, and 1-year survival.

Results

A total of 1442 patients were assigned to receive a combination of epinephrine and vasopressin, and 1452 to receive epinephrine alone. The treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics except that there were more men in the group receiving combination therapy than in the group receiving epinephrine alone (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences between the combination-therapy and the epinephrine-only groups in survival to hospital admission (20.7% vs. 21.3%; relative risk of death, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.05), return of spontaneous circulation (28.6% vs. 29.5%; relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.06), survival to hospital discharge (1.7% vs. 2.3%; relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.02), 1-year survival (1.3% vs. 2.1%; relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.02), or good neurologic recovery at hospital discharge (37.5% vs. 51.5%; relative risk, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.81 to 2.06).

Conclusions

As compared with epinephrine alone, the combination of vasopressin and epinephrine during advanced cardiac life support for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest does not improve outcome. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00127907.)

### Does the prognosis of cardiac arrest differ in trauma patients? [^114dcLZU]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

It is proposed to not resuscitate trauma patients who have a cardiac arrest outside the hospital because they are assumed to have a dismal prognosis. Our aim was to compare the outcome of patients with traumatic or nontraumatic ("medical") out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Design

Cohort analysis of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest included in the European Epinephrine Study Group's trial comparing high vs. standard doses of epinephrine.

Setting

Nine French university hospitals.

Patients

A total of 2,910 patients.

Interventions

Patients were successively and randomly assigned to receive repeated high doses (5 mg each) or standard doses (1 mg each) of epinephrine at 3-min intervals.

Measurements and Main Results

Return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission and discharge, and secondary outcome measures of 1-yr survival and neurologic outcome were recorded. In the trauma group, patients were younger (42 ± 17 vs. 62 ± 17 yrs, p < .001), presented with fewer witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (62.3% vs. 79.7%), and had fewer instances of ventricular fibrillation as the first documented pulseless rhythm (3.4% [95% confidence interval, 1.2–5.5%] vs. 17.3% [15.8–18.7%]). A return of spontaneous circulation was observed in 91 of 268 trauma patients (34.0% [28.3–39.6%]) compared with 797 of 2,642 medical patients (30.2% [28.4–31.9%]), and more trauma patients survived to be admitted to the hospital (29.9% [24.4–35.3%] vs. 23.5% [22.0–25.2%]). However, there was no significant difference between trauma and medical groups at hospital discharge (2.2% [0.5–4.0%] vs. 2.8% [2.1–3.4%]) and 1-yr survival (1.9% [0.3–3.5%] vs. 2.5% [1.9–3.1%]). Among patients who were discharged, a good neurologic status was observed in two trauma patients (33.3% [4.3–77.7%]) and 37 medical patients (50% [38.1–61.9%]).

Conclusions

The survival and neurologic outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were not different between trauma and medical patients. This result suggests that, under the supervision of senior physicians, active resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is as important in trauma as in medical patients.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113oPVNQ]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — In monitored intensive care units, survival is > 90%, and survival decreases rapidly after the initial 2 minutes from the onset of cardiac arrest, so that by 4 to 5 minutes, survival may be ≤ 25%, and by 10 minutes it is 0%. Paramedic administration of amiodarone after at least 3 failed shocks and administration of epinephrine improved hospital admission rates when compared with placebo or 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine. In RCTs in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to refractory VF or polymorphic VT, survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurologic outcome were not improved with amiodarone or lidocaine; however, in the subset of patients with witnessed cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory VF or pulseless VT, survival to hospital discharge after amiodarone administration was higher than with placebo. The administration of procainamide in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF or pulseless VT has been associated with more shocks, more pharmacologic interventions, longer resuscitation times, and lower survival. VA with hemodynamic instability, including VF and pulseless monomorphic or polymorphic VT, causes loss of consciousness and leads to death if untreated, and defibrillation should be performed as quickly as possible; CPR is used until a perfusing rhythm is restored, and if defibrillation is unsuccessful in returning to spontaneous circulation, resuscitation follows advanced cardiovascular life support activities. Quickly identifying and treating patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to acute coronary occlusion is associated with improved survival and better functional recovery.

### Outcome when adrenaline (epinephrine) was actually given vs. not given-post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1176h6cv]. Resuscitation (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Study

IV line insertion and drugs did not affect long-term survival in an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) randomized clinical trial (RCT). In a previous large registry study adrenaline was negatively associated with survival from OHCA. The present post hoc analysis on the RCT data compares outcomes for patients actually receiving adrenaline to those not receiving adrenaline.

Materials and Methods

Patients from a RCT performed May 2003 to April 2008 were included. Three patients from the original intention-to-treat analysis were excluded due to insufficient documentation of adrenaline administration. Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and clinical outcomes were compared.

Results

Clinical characteristics were similar and CPR quality comparable and within guideline recommendations for 367 patients receiving adrenaline and 481 patients not receiving adrenaline. Odds ratio (OR) for being admitted to hospital, being discharged from hospital and surviving with favourable neurological outcome for the adrenaline vs. no-adrenaline group was 2.5 (CI 1.9, 3.4), 0.5 (CI 0.3, 0.8) and 0.4 (CI 0.2, 0.7), respectively. Ventricular fibrillation, response interval, witnessed arrest, gender, age and endotracheal intubation were confounders in multivariate logistic regression analysis. OR for survival for adrenaline vs. no-adrenaline adjusted for confounders was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.92).

Conclusion

Receiving adrenaline was associated with improved short-term survival, but decreased survival to hospital discharge and survival with favourable neurological outcome after OHCA. This post hoc survival analysis is in contrast to the previous intention-to-treat analysis of the same data, but agrees with previous non-randomized registry data. This shows limitations of non-randomized or non-intention-to-treat analyses.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113n6eva]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis, synthesizing data from four RCTs, provides comprehensive evidence on the comparative effectiveness of IO and IV vascular access in adult patients with OHCA. IO access achieved a higher first-attempt success rate and a slightly shorter time to vascular access compared to IV access. However, the pooled analysis found no significant differences in key clinical outcomes, including survival and favorable neurological outcome, between the two groups. The sustained ROSC rate was numerically lower in the IO group compared with the IV group (24.6% vs. 27.0%), though this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 7). These findings support IV access as the preferred first-line approach when feasible. However, IO access remains a viable alternative in cases where IV access is difficult or delayed.

Fig. 7
Meta-analysis summary

Previous studies have shown that each minute delay in epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in survival and ROSC in patients experiencing OHCA. Establishing IV access in cardiac arrest situations with collapsed peripheral veins is challenging. On the other hand, IO access can provide fast, non-collapsible entry to the venous plexus in the bone marrow, with a relatively high success rate. In this meta-analysis, IO access consistently resulted in more than six-fold higher first-attempt success rates than IV access across all trials (OR 6.18, 95% CI 3.50–10.91), translating to a 15-s decrease in the time to vascular access. It is also noteworthy to mention that, regardless of the type of vascular access, there were substantial differences in time intervals for vascular access between the trials (Fig. 4). Specifically, the IVIO and Reades et al. trials reported faster vascular access times than the PARAMEDIC-3 and VICTOR trials. This variation may be attributable to differences in trial design, as PARAMEDIC-3 and VICTOR (in contrast to the IVIO and Reades et al. trials) were pragmatic trials and more closely reflected real-world clinical practice where procedural delays are more common. Additionally, differences in the EMS systems, paramedic training, and regional protocols may have contributed to this variation. These findings highlight the importance of minimizing delays and optimizing vascular access strategies in real-world practice to improve efficiency in OHCA management. Regarding safety outcomes for each access, no serious adverse events (such as tissue necrosis, osteomyelitis, or compartment syndrome) were reported in the trials.

### Augmented-medication cardioPulmonary resuscitation trials in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^111bjmqA]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Previously conducted physician-centered trials on the usefulness of vasopressin have yielded negative results; thus, patient-oriented trials have been warranted. We hypothesize that Augmented-Medication CardioPulmonary Resuscitation could be helpful for selected patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Methods

This is a double-blind, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the emergency department in a tertiary, university-affiliated hospital in Seoul, Korea. A total of 148 adults with non-traumatic OHCA who had initial diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 20 mm Hg via invasive arterial monitoring during the early cardiac compression period were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients received a dose of 40 IU of vasopressin or placebo with initial epinephrine. The primary endpoint was a sustained return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary endpoints were survival discharge, and neurologic outcomes at discharge.

Results

Of the 180 included patients, 32 were excluded, and 148 were enrolled in the trial. A sustained return of spontaneous circulation was achieved by 27 patients (36.5%) in the vasopressin group and 24 patients (32.4%) in the control group (risk difference, 4.1%; P = 0.60). Survival discharge and good neurologic outcomes did not differ between groups. The trial group had significantly higher median DBPs during resuscitation than the control group (16.0 vs. 14.5 mm Hg, P < 0.01). There was no difference in end-tidal carbon dioxide, acidosis, and lactate levels at baseline, 10 min, and end-time.

Conclusion

Among patients with refractory vasodilatory shock in OHCA, administration of vasopressin, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation.

### A prospective observational study on impact of epinephrine administration route on acute myocardial infarction patients with cardiac arrest in the catheterization laboratory (iCPR study) [^116mqonV]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Epinephrine administration during CPR and neurological outcomes

Data regarding neurological outcomes with epinephrine use during in-hospital CPR are sparse. The Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug administration In Cardiac arrest II trial was a randomized double-blind trial comparing epinephrine to placebo in 8014 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. It found that epinephrine resulted in a higher rate of ROSC and 30-day survival, but that survivors had worse neurological outcomes than those in the placebo group. However, epinephrine was administered over 20 min after the ambulance was called. Given that neuronal death can occur within minutes, it is difficult to conclusively attribute worse neurological outcomes to epinephrine administration alone.

While the nature of cardiac arrest makes it difficult to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials on this subject, other studies indicate that epinephrine may have a beneficial effect on outcomes. A large observational study of 119,639 patients with an observed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest found that early epinephrine administration (within 5–18 min of emergency call) was associated with better neurological outcomes than later epinephrine administration. A retrospective study utilizing the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database of 25,095 patients with non-shockable in-hospital cardiac arrest found that the administration of epinephrine had a significant impact on outcomes. When examining the data in 3-min intervals, there was an associated decrease in ROSC and 24-h survival for patients who received epinephrine within 4–6 min, 7–9 min, or > 9 min after cardiac arrest compared to receipt within 1–3 min. Similarly, survival with good neurological function (CPC score 1–2) decreased in a stepwise manner if epinephrine was administered 7–9 min or > 9 min when compared with 1–3 min or 3–6 min. These studies are concordant with our findings.

Conversely, another study from the same registry examined 2978 patients with shockable in-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent defibrillation within the first 2 minutes of CPR. Epinephrine administered within 2 minutes of defibrillation was associated with decreased rates of ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with good neurological function (CPC score 1–2). This may be due to increased myocardial oxygen consumption or degeneration of a shockable rhythm to PEA arrest from β receptor activation by epinephrine. Unfortunately, our study design did not allow us to repeat this analysis.

### Survival outcomes with the introduction of intravenous epinephrine in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112aSaGQ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The benefit of epinephrine in cardiac arrest is controversial and has not been conclusively shown in any human clinical study. We seek to assess the effect of introducing intravenous epinephrine on the survival outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in an emergency medical services (EMS) system that previously did not use intravenous medications.

Methods

This observational, prospective, before-after clinical study constitutes phase II of the Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation Epidemiology project. Included were all patients who are older than 8 years, with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest conveyed by the national emergency ambulance service. The comparison between the 2 intervention groups for survival to discharge was made with logistic regression and expressed in terms of the odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

From October 1, 2002, to October 14, 2004, 1,296 patients were enrolled into the study, with 615 in the pre-epinephrine and 681 in the epinephrine phase. Demographic and EMS characteristics were similar in both groups. Forty-four percent of patients received intravenous epinephrine in the epinephrine phase. There was no significant difference in survival to discharge (pre-epinephrine 1.0%; epinephrine 1.6%; OR 1.7 [95% CI 0.6 to 4.5]; adjusted for rhythm OR 2.0 [95% CI 0.7 to 5.5]); return of circulation (pre-epinephrine 17.9%; epinephrine 15.7%; OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.6 to 1.2]), or survival to admission (pre-epinephrine 7.5%; epinephrine 7.5%; OR 1.0 [95% CI 0.7 to 1.5]). There was a minimal increase in scene time in the epinephrine phase (10.3 minutes versus 10.7 minutes; 95% CI of difference 0.02 to 0.94 minutes).

Conclusion

We were unable to establish a significant survival benefit with the introduction of intravenous epinephrine to an EMS system. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of drugs such as epinephrine in resuscitation.

### Association of timing of epinephrine administration with outcomes in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113FkGz3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

### Effects of prehospital epinephrine during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initial non-shockable rhythm: an observational cohort study [^116riGEF]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Few clinical trials have provided evidence that epinephrine administration after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) improves long-term survival. Here we determined whether prehospital epinephrine administration would improve 1-month survival in OHCA patients.

Methods

We analyzed the data of 209,577 OHCA patients; the data were prospectively collected in a nationwide Utstein-style Japanese database between 2009 and 2010. Patients were divided into the initial shockable rhythm (n = 15,492) and initial non-shockable rhythm (n = 194,085) cohorts. The endpoints were prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 1-month survival, and 1-month favorable neurological outcomes (cerebral performance category scale, category 1 or 2) after OHCA. We defined epinephrine administration time as the time from the start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by emergency medical services personnel to the first epinephrine administration.

Results

In the initial shockable rhythm cohort, the ratios of prehospital ROSC, 1-month survival, and 1-month favorable neurological outcomes in the non-epinephrine group were significantly higher than those in the epinephrine group (27.7% vs. 22.8%, 27.0% vs. 15.4%, and 18.6% vs. 7.0%, respectively; all P < 0.001). However, in the initial non-shockable rhythm cohort, the ratios of prehospital ROSC and 1-month survival in the epinephrine group were significantly higher than those in the non-epinephrine group (18.7% vs. 3.0% and 3.9% vs. 2.2%, respectively; all P < 0.001) and there was no significant difference between the epinephrine and non-epinephrine groups for 1-month favorable neurological outcomes (P = 0.62). Prehospital epinephrine administration for OHCA patients with initial non-shockable rhythms was independently associated with prehospital ROSC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.83, 6.18, 4.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.01–9.73, 5.82–6.56, 3.98–4.69; for epinephrine administration times ≤ 9 min, 10–19 min, and ≥ 20 min, respectively), with improved 1-month survival when epinephrine administration time was < 20 min (aOR, 1.78, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.50–2.10, 1.17–1.43; for epinephrine administration times ≤ 9 min and 10–19 min, respectively), and with deteriorated 1-month favorable neurological outcomes (aOR, 0.63, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.48–0.80, 0.32–0.71; for epinephrine administration times 10–19 min and ≥ 20 min, respectively).

Conclusions

Prehospital epinephrine administration for OHCA patients with initial nonshockable rhythms was independently associated with achievement of prehospital ROSC and had association with improved 1-month survival when epinephrine administration time was < 20 min.

### Evaluation of use of epinephrine and time to first dose and outcomes in pediatric patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112B2maW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study with time-dependent PS and risk-set matching analyses from a large OHCA registry in North America including 1032 pediatric patients, we observed that epinephrine administration was associated with survival to hospital discharge and prehospital ROSC, compared with those at risk of receiving epinephrine, whereas epinephrine was not associated with favorable functional outcome at hospital discharge. We also observed that the timing of epinephrine administration was not associated with survival to hospital discharge, favorable functional recovery, or prehospital ROSC.

Comparison With Previous Studies

There are no clinical trials that compared epinephrine vs placebo for pediatric OHCA. A recent clinical trial comparing epinephrine vs placebo for adult OHCA showed that the epinephrine group had higher 30-day survival (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06–1.82) and survival to hospital admission (OR 3.59; 95% CI, 3.14–4.12), while epinephrine did not improve favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.86–1.61). Our findings are consistent with the results of this adult OHCA trial. A recent observational study of a nationwide Japanese OHCA registry from 2007 to 2016 demonstrated that epinephrine administration was not associated with 1-month survival (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.67–1.93) or 1-month survival with favorable neurologic outcome (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.61–3.96), while epinephrine was associated with prehospital ROSC (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.54–6.54) among 608 PS-matched pediatric patients (aged 8–17 years) compared with those at risk of receiving epinephrine using time-dependent PS and risk-set matching analyses. It is worth noting that the Japanese study used the same statistical method, and the participants were aged 8–17 years because EMS clinicians were legally permitted to administer epinephrine for patients aged 8 years and younger. Analyzing the largest sample size to date, we expanded previous knowledge to those who were younger than 8 years and to prehospital care in the US and Canada.

### Evaluation of isoproterenol in patients undergoing resuscitation for out-of-hospital asystolic cardiac arrest (the Israel resuscitation with isoproterenol study prospective randomized clinical trial) [^111DJ8cW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Israel Resuscitation with Isoproterenol Study included 79 consecutive patients with witnessed out-of-hospital asystolic cardiac arrest who were resuscitated with epinephrine and atropine and randomized to receive additional isoproterenol or no isoproterenol. The rate of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital admission did not differ in patients receiving standard therapy and those receiving additional isoproterenol.

### Analysis of epinephrine dose, targeted temperature management, and neurologic and survival outcomes among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112y1YPN]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Successful resuscitation and survival are possible and rely on a timely coordinated response that involves early recognition, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation, and both expert advanced life support (ALS) and meticulous postresuscitation care.

A mainstay of ALS has been the use of epinephrine to help restore spontaneous circulation. In a large randomized clinical trialof epinephrine vs placebo for OHCA resuscitation, epinephrine substantially increased return of spontaneous circulation (30% vs 12%) but produced a modest survival-to-discharge benefit (3% vs 2%) and no effect on neurologically favorable survival (2% vs 1.5%). One potential explanation is that epinephrine's cardiac benefits are attenuated by its adverse neurologic effects. More specifically, epinephrine may not only improve macrovascular coronary flow, cardiac electrical activity, and myocardial contractility but may also induce microvascular dysregulation that worsens critical brain ischemia. This balance of benefit and risk may become increasingly unfavorable as the total dose of epinephrine increases, although timing of administration may also influence outcome.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) may support brain recovery after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), presumably by limiting the cascade of neuronal damage and death activated by the ischemia of the arrest and potentially worsened by reperfusion injury, postresuscitation systemic inflammation, and, potentially, increasing dose of epinephrine. Although previous trials, have demonstrated conflicting results regarding the optimal temperature, data from 2 large retrospective studies, suggest that the benefit of TTM might be greatest in patients with more profound ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Whether TTM can mitigate the adverse neurologic effects associated with epinephrine is uncertain. We hypothesized that an interaction occurs between epinephrine dose and TTM such that the adverse association between increasing epinephrine dose and neurologically favorable survival is attenuated by TTM or, conversely, the potential survival benefit of TTM increases as the dose of epinephrine increases.

### Defibrillation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation first for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests found by paramedics to be in ventricular fibrillation? A randomised control trial [^1156APHi]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether in patients with an ambulance response time of > 5min who were in VF cardiac arrest, 3min of CPR before the first defibrillation was more effective than immediate defibrillation in improving survival to hospital discharge.

Methods

This randomised control trial was run by the South Australian Ambulance Service between 1 July, 2005, and 31 July, 2007. Patients in VF arrest were eligible for randomisation. Exclusion criteria were: (i) < 18 years of age, (ii) traumatic arrest, (iii) paramedic witnessed arrest, (iv) advanced life support performed before arrival of paramedics and (v) not for resuscitation order or similar directive. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with secondary outcomes being neurological status at discharge, the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the time from first defibrillation to ROSC.

Results

For all response times, no differences were observed between the immediate defibrillation group and the CPR first group in survival to hospital discharge (17.1% [18/105] vs. 10.3% [10/97]; P = 0.16), the rate of ROSC (53.3% [56/105] vs. 50.5% [49/97]; P = 0.69) or the time from the first defibrillation to ROSC (12:37 vs. 11:19; P = 0.49). There were also no differences between the immediate defibrillation group and the CPR first group, for response times of ≤ or > 5min: survival to hospital discharge (50.0% [7/14] vs. 25.0% [4/16]; P = 0.16 or 12.1% [11/91] vs.7.4% [6/81]; P = 0.31, respectively) and the rate of ROSC (71.4% [10/14] vs. 75.0% [12/16]; P = 0.83 or 50.5% [46/91] vs. 45.7% [37/81]; P = 0.54, respectively). No differences were observed in the neurological status of those surviving to hospital discharge.

Conclusion

For patient in out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest we found no evidence to support the use of 3min of CPR before the first defibrillation over the accepted practice of immediate defibrillation.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^115orX37]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Vasopressor use during cardiac arrest — evidence overview indicates that epinephrine use during cardiac arrest has been shown to improve rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival. The most recent ILCOR review with meta-analysis was completed in 2019 and used to inform the Red Cross guidelines, concluding that randomized controlled trial data suggest epinephrine improves ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and 3-month survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with more pronounced improvement in short-term outcomes for non-shockable rhythms; vasopressin with or without epinephrine was not shown to provide a benefit compared with epinephrine alone. A 2022 ILCOR evidence update identified multiple new observational studies and secondary analyses, and the reviewers concluded that there is insufficient new data.

### Effect of out-of-hospital sodium nitrite on survival to hospital admission after cardiac arrest: a randomized clinical trial [^116kVvgS]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Therapeutic delivery of sodium nitrite during resuscitation improved survival in animal models of cardiac arrest, but efficacy has not been evaluated in clinical trials in humans.

Objective

To determine whether parenteral administration of sodium nitrite given by paramedics during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest improved survival to hospital admission.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 randomized clinical trial including 1502 adults in King County, Washington, with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation or nonventricular fibrillation. Patients underwent resuscitation by paramedics and were enrolled between February 8, 2018, and August 19, 2019; follow-up and data abstraction were completed by December 31, 2019.

Interventions

Eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 45 mg of sodium nitrite (n = 500), 60 mg of sodium nitrite (n = 498), or placebo (n = 499), which was given via bolus injection by the paramedics as soon as possible during active resuscitation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was survival to hospital admission and was evaluated with 1-sided hypothesis testing. The secondary outcomes included out-of-hospital variables (rate of return of spontaneous circulation, rate of rearrest, and use of norepinephrine to support blood pressure) and in-hospital variables (survival to hospital discharge; neurological outcomes at hospital discharge; cumulative survival to 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours; and number of days in the intensive care unit).

Results

Among 1502 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were randomized (mean age, 64 years [SD, 17 years]; 34% were women), 99% completed the trial. Overall, 205 patients (41%) in the 45 mg of sodium nitrite group and 212 patients (43%) in the 60 mg of sodium nitrite group compared with 218 patients (44%) in the placebo group survived to hospital admission; the mean difference for the 45-mg dose vs placebo was -2.9% (1-sided 95% CI, -8.0% to ∞; P = 0.82) and the mean difference for the 60-mg dose vs placebo was -1.3% (1-sided 95% CI, -6.5% to ∞; P = 0.66). None of the 7 prespecified secondary outcomes were significantly different, including survival to hospital discharge for 66 patients (13.2%) in the 45 mg of sodium nitrite group and 72 patients (14.5%) in the 60 mg of sodium nitrite group compared with 74 patients (14.9%) in the placebo group; the mean difference for the 45-mg dose vs placebo was -1.7% (2-sided 95% CI, -6.0% to 2.6%; P = 0.44) and the mean difference for the 60-mg dose vs placebo was -0.4% (2-sided 95% CI, -4.9% to 4.0%; P = 0.85).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, administration of sodium nitrite, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve survival to hospital admission. These findings do not support the use of sodium nitrite during resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Early administration of adrenaline for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118KFaS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors declare that all supporting data, analytic methods, and study materials within the article and the online supporting information are available to other researchers. This systematic review was performed in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 25 The PRISMA checklist is provided in Table S1. The study was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; CRD42019130542). Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this systematic review and meta‐analysis.

Search Strategy and Study Eligibility

A systematic search of the scientific literature was performed. The search was conducted from inception to February 2019 in PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library database. The terms used for the search were as follows: ("heart arrest" OR "out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest" OR "ventricular fibrillation" OR "pulseless electrical activity" OR "PEA" OR "asystole" OR "cardiac arrest") AND ("epinephrine" OR "adrenaline").

Studies were selected by 2 independent reviewers if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients with OHCA were enrolled; (2) the patients were treated with epinephrine; (3) when multiple studies from the same institute were available, to avoid overlapping information, only the study with the largest sample size was included for each analysis; (4) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies; and (5) the study outcomes were stated. Inter‐reviewer agreement was determined using Cohen kappa coefficients.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers (L.Y.R. J.L.L.). Any disagreement was discussed with the senior author (W.H.). Study and participant characteristics were extracted. In addition, clinical data including initial cardiac rhythms, dose of adrenaline administered, presumed cardiac origin, witnessed cardiac arrest and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation status were also extracted.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was survival to discharge. The secondary outcomes were ROSC, favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge/1 month according to a cerebral performance category of 1 or 2, 26, 27 and survival to hospital admission.

based on preclinical evidence of increased cerebral and coronary perfusion by redirected peripheral blood flow. 1, 2 Beneficial short-term effects of epinephrine have been shown in animal studies, 3–5 but there is increasing concern for increased myocardial dysfunction6, 7 and disturbed cerebral microcirculation after cardiac arrest. 8 Epinephrine was an independent predictor of poor outcome in a large retrospective registry study, 9 but this observational, nonrandomized study cannot prove a causal relationship. Despite its near-universal use, epinephrine has, to our knowledge, not been tested in a randomized controlled study with a no-drug comparison group. Initial power analysis was based on survival statistics for the Oslo emergency medical service system and assumed that the survival rate would be doubled among patients not receiving epinephrine, as described previously in an observational study.

9 With a projected survival rate of 7% in the intravenous group and 14% in the no intravenous group, 900 patients provided a power level of 91. 4% with a type I error of 5%.
19. Patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia as the initial rhythm had a 10-fold improvement in long-term survival. We did not confirm the previous observational finding that intravenous epinephrine was an independent predictor for poor outcome. 9 Our results are consistent with a multicenter study by Stiell et al22 that found no difference in survival after implementing intravenous drug administration during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This finding is consistent with previous animal studies with epinephrine, 6, 7 and clinical studies evaluating the effects of amiodarone, 23 atropine, 24 and even high-dose epinephrine, 25 all of which documented improved short-term effects without improving long-term outcomes.

While epinephrine can produce more spontaneously beating hearts in animal models, it is also associated with increased postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction that might partly explain these clinical observations. 6, 7 Negative postresuscitation effects of epinephrine also are reported to be more prominent after longer, more clinically relevant cardiac arrest periods than short cardiac arrest periods. 7 Moreover, an experimental study has recently documented detrimental effects of epinephrine on cerebral microcirculation. 8.

### Estimating bias from withdrawal of life sustaining treatment in clinical trials [^114EKwqr]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Example of approach in a clinical trial

The Amiodarone, Lidocaine or Placebo Study (ALPS) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of two antiarrhythmic drugs for treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resulting from shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The complete methods and results of this trial have been reported. Patients with OHCA who had persistent ventricular fibrillation after one or more rescue shocks were treated by paramedics with study drug. The study drug was either placebo, lidocaine or amiodarone. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. The trial was designed to have 90% power to detect a 6.3% difference in the absolute rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group. Study interventions ended upon hospital arrival, but the trial prospectively recorded whether WLST occurred in the hospital. We examined the influence of WLST on results using the public-use dataset (NCT01401647;).

Patients enrolled in the trial had similar baseline characteristics (Table 1). A number of variables differed between groups after treatment. Specifically, patients who received lidocaine or amiodarone more often had pulses at ED arrival, received less epinephrine, less often required additional CPR in the hospital, and more often received coronary angiography and induced hypothermia in the hospital.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116XJGcW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendation‑specific supportive text — time‑sensitive survival and antiarrhythmic drug effects: Survival is highly time dependent; in unique settings with extraordinarily rapid response to VF or VT in monitored intensive care units, survival is > 90%, whereas survival decreases rapidly after the initial 2 minutes from onset so that by 4 to 5 minutes survival may be ≤ 25% and by 10 minutes it is 0%. Paramedic administration of amiodarone after at least 3 failed shocks and epinephrine improved hospital admission rates when compared with placebo or 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine, although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with out‑of‑hospital cardiac arrest due to refractory VF or polymorphic VT did not improve survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome with amiodarone or lidocaine; however, in witnessed initial shock‑refractory VF or pulseless VT, survival to hospital discharge after amiodarone was higher than with placebo. Administration of procainamide in out‑of‑hospital cardiac arrest due to VF or pulseless VT has been associated with more shocks, more pharmacologic interventions, longer resuscitation times, and lower survival. Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) with hemodynamic instability, including VF and pulseless monomorphic or polymorphic VT, causes loss of consciousness and leads to death if untreated, and defibrillation should be performed as quickly as possible. Quickly identifying and treating out‑of‑hospital cardiac arrest related to acute coronary occlusion is associated with improved survival and better functional recovery.

### Influence of EMS-physician presence on survival after out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111sXcMG]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that EMS-physician-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) may be associated with improved outcomes, yet randomized controlled trials are not available. The goal of this meta-analysis was to determine the association between EMS-physician- versus paramedic-guided CPR and survival after OOHCA.

Methods and Results

Studies that compared EMS-physician- versus paramedic-guided CPR in OOHCA published until June 2014 were systematically searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. All studies were required to contain survival data. Data on study characteristics, methods, and as well as survival outcomes were extracted. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis due to a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies (I 2 = 44%). Return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC], survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge were the outcome measures.

Out of 3,385 potentially eligible studies, 14 met the inclusion criteria. In the pooled analysis (n = 126,829), EMS-physician-guided CPR was associated with significantly improved outcomes compared to paramedic-guided CPR: ROSC 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.0–41.7%) vs. 23.4% (95% CI 18.5–29.2%) (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95% CI 1.36–2.63, p < 0.001); survival to hospital admission 30.1% (95% CI 24.2–36.7%) vs. 19.2% (95% CI 12.7–28.1%) (pooled OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.97–3.28, p = 0.06); and survival to discharge 15.1% (95% CI 14.6–15.7%) vs. 8.4% (95% CI 8.2–8.5%) (pooled OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48–2.79, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

This systematic review suggests that EMS-physician-guided CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with improved survival outcomes.

### Sequence of epinephrine and advanced airway placement after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114AVoJp]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In our analyses of the nationwide, population-based OHCA registry comprising 259 237 adult patients in Japan who received epinephrine and/or AAM, we found that the epinephrine-first strategy was associated with an increased likelihood of 1-month survival, 1-month survival with favorable functional status, and prehospital ROSC for both shockable and nonshockable rhythms compared with the AAM-first strategy. These findings remained consistent in sensitivity analyses.

The existing literature has not established a definitive relationship between the timing of epinephrine administration and survival or functional outcomes after OHCA. A 2019 systematic review examining vasopressors during adult cardiac arrest identified 16 observational studies of the timing of epinephrine administration. However, the review reported that differences in survival to hospital discharge and favorable neurologic outcomes were constrained by very low event rates and inconsistent results across studies. More recently, evidence of the timing of epinephrine has been accumulated and has supported early epinephrine administration. For example, a secondary analysis in 2020 of a clinical trial comparing epinephrine with placebo, which included more than 4800 adult OHCAs, showed a reduction in the rates of ROSC, survival, and favorable functional outcomes associated with longer durations of cardiac arrest and that earlier administration of epinephrine was associated with better outcomes. Similarly, a retrospective analysis in 2021 of Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) findings showed that among more than 40 000 adult patients with OHCA, survival to hospital discharge and favorable functional outcome varied with the timing of epinephrine administration and decreased with delayed epinephrine administration for shockable and nonshockable rhythms.

Adult advanced life support — high-dose and intramuscular epinephrine: Multiple RCTs have compared high-dose with standard-dose epinephrine, but the definition of high-dose varies widely by study; there were no new RCTs since the 2020 Guidelines comparing standard-dose to any high-dose epinephrine; systematic reviews and meta-analysis of RCTs have yielded mixed results; one registry-based study found dosing epinephrine more frequently than the standard interval may be potentially harmful; and one single-center, before-after study of 1405 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients receiving an initial intramuscular (IM) dose followed by standard IV/IO administration shortened time to epinephrine administration and improved survival to hospital admission, hospital survival, and favorable neurologic status at hospital discharge.

### Prehospital epinephrine use and survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^1153hNJq]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Epinephrine is widely used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, the effectiveness of epinephrine use before hospital arrival has not been established.

Objective

To evaluate the association between epinephrine use before hospital arrival and short- and long-term mortality in patients with cardiac arrest.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective, nonrandomized, observational propensity analysis of data from 417 188 OHCAs occurring in 2005–2008 in Japan in which patients aged 18 years or older had an OHCA before arrival of emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were treated by EMS personnel, and were transported to the hospital.

Main Outcome Measures

Return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival, survival at 1 month after cardiac arrest, survival with good or moderate cerebral performance (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 1 or 2), and survival with no, mild, or moderate neurological disability (Overall Performance Category [OPC] 1 or 2).

Results

Return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival was observed in 2786 of 15,030 patients (18.5%) in the epinephrine group and 23,042 of 402,158 patients (5.7%) in the no-epinephrine group (P < .001); it was observed in 2446 (18.3%) and 1400 (10.5%) of 13,401 propensity-matched patients, respectively (P < .001). In the total sample, the numbers of patients with 1-month survival and survival with CPC 1 or 2 and OPC 1 or 2, respectively, were 805 (5.4%), 205 (1.4%), and 211 (1.4%) with epinephrine and 18,906 (4.7%), 8903 (2.2%), and 8831 (2.2%) without epinephrine (all P < .001). Corresponding numbers in propensity-matched patients were 687 (5.1%), 173 (1.3%), and 178 (1.3%) with epinephrine and 944 (7.0%), 413 (3.1%), and 410 (3.1%) without epinephrine (all P < .001). In all patients, a positive association was observed between prehospital epinephrine and return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.36; 95% CI, 2.22–2.50; P < .001). In propensity-matched patients, a positive association was also observed (adjusted OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 2.24–2.80; P < .001). In contrast, among all patients, negative associations were observed between prehospital epinephrine and long-term outcome measures (adjusted ORs: 1-month survival, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.42–0.51]; CPC 1–2, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.26–0.36]; and OPC 1–2, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.27–0.38]; all P < .001). Similar negative associations were observed among propensity-matched patients (adjusted ORs: 1-month survival, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.43–0.68]; CPC 1–2, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.10–0.44]; and OPC 1–2, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.11–0.45]; all P < .001).

Conclusion

Among patients with OHCA in Japan, use of prehospital epinephrine was significantly associated with increased chance of return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival but decreased chance of survival and good functional outcomes 1 month after the event.

### Time to administration of epinephrine and outcome after in-hospital cardiac arrest with non-shockable rhythms: retrospective analysis of large in-hospital data registry [^114Z84NL]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In patients who experience a cardiac arrest in hospital, earlier administration of epinephrine is strongly associated with increased probability of return of spontaneous circulation, 24 hour survival, in-hospital survival, and overall neurologically intact survival. These associations remained robust after multivariable adjustments and were also maintained in sensitivity analyses adjusted for delays in initiation of resuscitation.

The physiologic rationale for early administration of epinephrine in patients with cardiac arrest is strong, particularly in those with rhythms not amenable to defibrillation. Epinephrine is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor as well as a coronary artery vasodilator. This combination of physiologic effects results in an increase in coronary perfusion pressure, which has been shown to be strongly associated with return of spontaneous circulation in both animals and humans. During complete circulatory arrest and in the absence of a shockable rhythm, the administration of epinephrine would logically be a time dependent intervention.

Comparison with other studies

While little controversy exists over the ability of epinephrine to increase rates of return of spontaneous circulation, current scrutiny of this intervention has focused on whether mortality and neurologically intact survival can be improved. The current findings might provide insight into this question. One previous large scale investigation failed to show a survival benefit with the use of drugs for advanced life support in the outpatient setting. The mean time to arrival of emergency medical staff in that investigation, however, was 10 minutes, and epinephrine delivery was therefore delayed by virtue of arrival time alone. The lack of efficacy could have resulted from delay in time to intervention. A recent randomized trial evaluated the provision of epinephrine versus placebo for patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest. In this investigation, Jacobs and colleagues found that epinephrine markedly increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation, but the study was underpowered to evaluate the primary outcome of neurologically intact survival. Finally, a retrospective study in Japan suggested an increase in return of spontaneous circulation but worse long term outcome. Only a small fraction of patients received epinephrine, however, and selection bias could have been present despite efforts to control for this. In the context of our findings, future investigations should consider timing of epinephrine administration in design and interpretation.

### Use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2010–2016 [^116doThq]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) devices came to market in the mid-1960s as a tool to provide consistent chest compressions during treatment for cardiac arrest. Although initial mechanical CPR devices were often cumbersome, later generations of devices slowly became portable and suitable for use outside of hospital settings. With this evolution, between 1976 and 2018, approximately 40 models of mechanical CPR devices were cleared for use by the US Food and Drug Administration through the 510(k) premarket notification pathway.

Despite the proliferation of these devices over time, there remains limited evidence supporting their use during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Randomized clinical trials focused on clinical outcomes have yet to demonstrate benefit when compared with manual CPR. Neither the PARAMEDIC (Prehospital Randomized Assessment of Mechanical Compression Device in Cardiac Arrest)trial nor the CIRC (Circulation Improving Resuscitation Care)trial, each testing different manual CPR devices among thousands of patients, found any significant differences in survival to discharge or 30-day survival between patients who received mechanical CPR and manual CPR. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis found similar results, determining there to be no significant difference in outcomes among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between those who received mechanical CPR and those who received manual CPR. Using the PARAMEDIC data, investigators also concluded that mechanical CPR was not cost-effective, demonstrating that those treated with the LUCAS 2 (Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System 2) mechanical CPR device experienced poorer health outcomes as measured by lower quality-adjusted life-years as well as higher health and social costs compared with those treated with manual CPR. However, data from a statewide, prospectively collected cardiac arrest registry did provide some suggestion of clinical benefit associated with mechanical CPR devices.

Despite the lack of evidence that mechanical CPR devices improve clinically meaningful outcomes among patients, there are anecdotal reports suggesting that their use is increasing among emergency medical services (EMS) professionals for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. If true, such an increase would be particularly worrisome not only because of the uncertainty of clinical benefit associated with device use, but also because of the devices' known significant costs; mechanical CPR devices are often priced higher than $10 000 per unit. Accordingly, our objectives were to characterize recent trends in mechanical CPR device use for patients identified with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by prehospital EMS professionals and to determine whether patient characteristics and geographical location were associated with use.

### Pediatric timing of epinephrine doses: a systematic review [^111wj3eC]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the optimal timing and doses of epinephrine for Infants and children suffering in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) for human randomized clinical trials and observational studies including comparative cohorts. Two investigators reviewed relevance of studies, extracted the data, conducted meta-analyses and assessed the risk of bias using the GRADE and CLARITY frameworks. Authors of the eligible studies were contacted to obtain additional data. Critically important outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital discharge and survival with good neurological outcome.

Results

We identified 7 observational studies suitable for meta-analysis and no randomized clinical trials. The overall certainty of evidence was very low. For the critically important outcomes, the earlier administration of epinephrine was favorable for both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Because of a limited number of eligible studies and the presence of severe confounding factors, we could not determine the optimal interval of epinephrine administration.

Conclusions

Earlier administration of the first epinephrine dose could be more favorable in non-shockable pediatric cardiac arrest. The optimal interval for epinephrine administration remains unclear.

### Design and implementation of the AIRWAYS-2 trial: a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the I-gel supraglottic airway device versus tracheal intubation in the initial airway management of out of hospital cardiac arrest [^1135YFdp]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

Health outcomes after out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are extremely poor, with only 7–9% of patients in the United Kingdom (UK) surviving to hospital discharge. Currently emergency medical services (EMS) use either tracheal intubation or newer supraglottic airway devices (SGAs) to provide advanced airway management during OHCA. Equipoise between the two techniques has led to calls for a well-designed randomised controlled trial. The primary objective of the AIRWAYS-2 trial is to assess whether the clinical effectiveness of the i-gel, a second-generation SGA, is superior to tracheal intubation in the initial airway management of OHCA patients in the UK. Paramedics recruited to the AIRWAYS-2 trial are randomised to use either tracheal intubation or i-gel as their first advanced airway intervention. Adults who have had a non-traumatic OHCA and are attended by an AIRWAYS-2 paramedic are retrospectively assessed against eligibility criteria for inclusion. The primary outcome is the modified Rankin Scale score at hospital discharge. Secondary objectives are to: (i) estimate differences between groups in outcome measures relating to airway management, hospital stay and recovery at 3 and 6 months; (ii) estimate the cost effectiveness of the i-gel compared to tracheal intubation. Because OHCA patient needs immediate treatment there are several unusual features and challenges to the design and implementation of this trial; these include level of randomisation, the automatic enrolment model, enrolment of patients that lack capacity and minimisation of bias. Patient enrolment began in June 2015. The trial will enrol 9070 patients over two years. The results are expected to influence future resuscitation guidelines. Trial Registration ISRCTN: 08256118.
