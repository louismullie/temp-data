## Question

best treatment for diabetic foot ulcer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment for diabetic foot ulcers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why diabetic foot ulcers are hard to heal. Then, I should verify the universally accepted standard of care and its hierarchy. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence for each pillar, including offloading, debridement, infection management, and revascularization. After that, I should review adjunctive therapies and where they fit. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight special scenarios and implementation gaps, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why outcomes are often poor. Diabetic foot ulcers arise from a triad of neuropathy, ischemia, and infection, with high risks of nonhealing, infection, amputation, and mortality; recurrence after healing is common, which means any "best treatment" must address both healing and prevention of recurrence, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework [^e1f7b4a1] [^8043c78a].

> I need to verify the universal foundation of care. Across contemporary guidelines, four pillars constitute the standard of care: pressure offloading, debridement, infection management, and revascularization when indicated; these are repeatedly emphasized in IWGDF and related consensus documents and remain the backbone upon which adjuncts are layered only when standard care fails or is insufficient [^c8f809c5] [^33bcf8e9] [^d7dc3a2e].

> Now, I will examine offloading, because I should confirm whether it is truly the most critical single intervention. Multiple high-credibility sources and meta-analyses indicate that offloading is the most effective intervention for neuropathic plantar ulcers, with nonremovable knee-high devices (total contact casts or irremovable walkers) as first-line, followed by removable knee-high or ankle-high devices if contraindicated, and footwear modifications as a fallback; surgical offloading (e.g. Achilles tendon lengthening, metatarsal procedures) is reasonable when non-surgical offloading fails or is not feasible, and this hierarchy is consistently reflected in IWGDF 2019 and 2023 updates [^f9ce6fef] [^1aafca69] [^e4994894].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit so I don't overstate it. Network meta-analyses show offloading improves early healing rates and shortens time to healing, though some analyses also flag higher adverse event rates with certain offloading modalities, underscoring the need for careful selection, monitoring, and patient education to mitigate device-related complications [^e4994894].

> Next, I should review debridement. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while debridement is standard, I need to check whether any specific method improves healing over another. A high-credibility meta-analysis of randomized trials found no debridement technique clearly superior to others, including hydrogel, surgical, or larval therapy; thus, the key is to perform adequate sharp debridement to remove nonviable tissue and callus while maintaining a moist wound environment, rather than assuming a particular tool confers advantage [^6ec5bf76].

> I will now examine infection management. I should confirm that antibiotics are not used indiscriminately. Current IWGDF/IDSA guidance advises against systemic or local antibiotics for clinically uninfected ulcers, reserving antibiotics for infected wounds with systemic or local signs, and then tailoring therapy to severity, culture results, and the presence of osteomyelitis; this prevents overtreatment and resistance while ensuring timely intervention when infection is present [^c6d59fd0] [^9ff5a071] [^562b2f4f] [^a8d39fa5].

> Let me consider revascularization next. I need to ensure I don't miss ischemia, which is common and prognostically important. Up to half of patients with DFUs have PAD, and guidelines recommend structured vascular assessment with ABI, toe pressures, and waveform analysis, followed by revascularization when ischemia is significant and flow-limiting, as this directly impacts healing and limb salvage; this is a core pillar alongside offloading and infection control [^93a03133] [^8e5b176c].

> Hold on, I should verify where adjunctive therapies fit, because many are tempting but not first-line. Negative pressure wound therapy has supportive evidence, particularly for post-surgical or complex wounds, and is reasonable after 4–8 weeks of standard care without expected progress; growth factors like becaplermin show modest benefit in some analyses but remain controversial and are not routinely recommended by IWGDF due to heterogeneity and bias; hyperbaric oxygen may help selected ischemic ulcers after failure of standard care, but evidence is mixed and resource-intensive; topical oxygen and certain biologics (e.g., placental-derived products, autologous fibrin/leukocyte patches) are conditionally supported in recent IWGDF wound-healing guidance when standard care fails and resources allow; dermal matrices show promise in meta-analyses but should still be framed as adjuncts to standard care rather than replacements [^e6d76559] [^bc65d761] [^cf313f95] [^79fc04c3] [^96133d6b] [^93f53484].

> But wait, what if the ulcer is not plantar or is complicated by deformity or nonadherence? I should double-check that guidelines address these variants. For nonplantar ulcers, pressure relief should be customized to the location; for flexible toe deformities causing apex ulcers, digital flexor tenotomy is recommended; for refractory forefoot ulcers, surgical offloading procedures are appropriate; and for patients who cannot tolerate or adhere to nonremovable devices, removable options with adherence strategies are advised, all within a multidisciplinary plan [^1aafca69] [^f9ce6fef].

> Next, I should review systemic contributors, because I need to ensure we don't overlook modifiable drivers of poor healing. While direct RCT evidence linking intensive glycemic control to ulcer healing is sparse, optimizing glucose, nutrition, and comorbidities is standard practice and plausibly supports healing; moreover, structured follow-up every 1–4 weeks to track wound area and adjust the plan is recommended to catch stalled healing early and pivot therapy as needed [^a941fde1] [^8e5b176c].

> I will now synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm, but I should confirm it aligns with guideline hierarchies. First, assess perfusion and treat ischemia if present; second, classify infection and treat only if infected; third, offload with a nonremovable knee-high device as first choice, adapting if contraindicated; fourth, perform sharp debridement and maintain moist wound care; fifth, reassess at 1–4 week intervals and escalate to adjuncts (NPWT, growth factors, HBOT, biologics) only if there is less than about 40% reduction in area by 4 weeks or failure to progress by 8–12 weeks; sixth, after healing, implement prevention with therapeutic footwear, pressure offloading, and structured surveillance to mitigate the high recurrence risk [^c8f809c5] [^1aafca69] [^cb141594].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation realities, because the "best treatment" is only as good as its delivery. Real-world adherence to guideline-based care is often suboptimal, with studies showing only 20–52% adherence in some settings; modeling suggests that moving to full guideline concordance could improve outcomes and be cost-effective, reinforcing the need for system-level changes, education, and adherence support to translate evidence into practice [^e42df124].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: there is no single "best" therapy beyond the four-pillar standard of care, with offloading as the most critical intervention for neuropathic plantar ulcers. Adjuncts are reserved for nonresponders, and care must be individualized within a multidisciplinary framework to address the triad of neuropathy, ischemia, and infection while preventing recurrence [^8043c78a] [^f9ce6fef] [^c8f809c5].

The best treatment for diabetic foot ulcers is a **multidisciplinary approach** [^8043c78a] centered on **offloading pressure** [^f9ce6fef], **sharp debridement**, infection control [^a8d39fa5], and revascularization when indicated [^93a03133], with adjuncts such as NPWT [^e6d76559], growth factors [^bc65d761], or biologics reserved for non-healing ulcers [^96133d6b]. Non-removable knee-high offloading devices are **first-line** [^1aafca69] for plantar ulcers, and antibiotics are only used if infection is present [^c6d59fd0]. This strategy reduces healing time, lowers amputation risk, and improves outcomes [^e4994894] [^1aafca69].

---

## Core components of standard care

### Pressure offloading

- **Non-removable knee-high devices**: First-line for neuropathic plantar forefoot/midfoot ulcers; total contact casts or irremovable walkers are preferred [^f9ce6fef] [^1aafca69].
- **Removable devices**: Second-line if non-removable devices are contraindicated or not tolerated [^f9ce6fef].
- **Footwear modifications**: Use pressure-relieving footwear with felted foam as an alternative when devices are unavailable [^f9ce6fef].

---

### Wound bed preparation and debridement

Regular **sharp debridement** removes nonviable tissue and reduces bioburden [^8e5b176c]; no specific debridement method has proven superior [^6ec5bf76]. Maintain a **moist wound environment** with dressings that balance moisture and control exudate [^8e5b176c].

---

### Infection management

Use **antibiotics only for infected ulcers** [^c6d59fd0]; avoid routine antibiotics for uninfected ulcers [^9ff5a071]. Base **empiric therapy** on infection severity and local resistance patterns, then tailor to culture results [^a8d39fa5].

---

### Revascularization

Assess for **peripheral artery disease** in all patients with DFUs [^93a03133]; revascularize when ischemia limits healing [^8e5b176c].

---

## Adjunctive therapies for non-healing ulcers

When ulcers fail to heal with standard care, consider:

| **Adjunctive therapy** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) | Post-surgical or complex wounds | Strong [^e6d76559] [^cad4e4ef] |
| Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) | Refractory ischemic ulcers | Moderate [^cf313f95] [^79fc04c3] |
| Growth factors (e.g. becaplermin) | Chronic neuropathic ulcers | Moderate [^bc65d761] [^a6e625ac] |
| Biologic dressings (e.g. placental membranes) | Chronic ulcers | Moderate [^96133d6b] [^085afa01] |

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options such as **stem cell therapy** [^2db2bfd3], **topical oxygen therapy** [^0dbf001e], and **novel biologics** [^da3c6307] are under investigation and may offer future benefits [^cfb0d7a4].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Ulcer characteristics**: Size, depth, location, and duration guide offloading and adjunct selection [^1aafca69].
- **Comorbidities**: Glycemic control, renal function, and cardiovascular status affect healing and risk [^8043c78a].
- **Patient preferences**: Adherence and lifestyle considerations influence device choice and outcomes [^afc0d219].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Multidisciplinary care with offloading, debridement, infection control, and revascularization achieves **higher healing rates** and fewer amputations [^e4994894] [^c8f809c5]. Offloading is the **most effective single intervention** for plantar ulcers, and NPWT and HBOT can aid selected non-healing cases [^f9ce6fef] [^cad4e4ef] [^cf313f95].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

IWGDF 2023 and ADA 2025 endorse a **multidisciplinary approach** with offloading, debridement, infection control, and revascularization, using adjuncts only when standard care fails [^1aafca69] [^bac40a02].

---

The best treatment for diabetic foot ulcers is a **multidisciplinary approach** [^8043c78a] that prioritizes offloading, debridement, infection control, and revascularization, with adjuncts for refractory cases. This strategy improves healing, reduces amputations, and is supported by current guidelines and evidence [^e4994894] [^c8f809c5].

Conclusion

The management of diabetic foot ulcers remains a major therapeutic challenge which implies an urgent need to review strategies and treatments in order to achieve the goals and reduce the burden of care in an efficient and cost-effective way. Questions remain as to which types of intervention, technology, and dressing are suitable to promote healing, and whether all therapies are necessary and cost-effective as adjunctive therapies. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot has conducted two systematic reviews of the evidence and effectiveness of interventions to enhance the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers. The preliminary results are promising, but large randomized controlled trials are necessary in order to establish the cost-effectiveness of the new therapies.

Prevention of diabetic foot ulceration is critical in order to reduce the associated high morbidity and mortality rates, and the danger of amputation. It is essential to identify the "foot at risk", through careful inspection and physical examination of the foot followed by neuropathy and vascular tests.

Regular foot examination, patient education, simple hygienic practices, provision of appropriate footwear, and prompt treatment of minor injuries can decrease ulcer occurrence by 50% and eliminate the need for major amputation in nonischemic limbs. Diabetic foot ulcers should be carefully evaluated and the gold-standard treatments should be strictly applied in order to prevent amputation. Further clinical studies are needed to support the existing evidence regarding the clinical benefit of new approaches for the treatment of diabetic ulcers, and these approaches should be used only as add-on therapies to the gold-standard wound care.

### Best practice offloading treatments for diabetic foot ulcer healing, remission, and better plans for the healing-remission transition [^b378aa08]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes-related foot disease is arguably the world's least known major health problem and causes a disease burden larger than most well-known diseases, such as stroke and breast cancer. This burden is driven by people developing more severe stages of foot disease, such as foot ulcers and infections, and with that worsening quality of life. To reduce this burden, we need treatments that prevent more severe stages of foot disease and improve quality of life. Best practice offloading treatments have been found to be arguably the most effective existing treatments to heal and prevent diabetes-related foot ulcers and infections, but can worsen quality of life. Furthermore, high re-ulceration rates still occur with best practice offloading treatments after healing. This may be because of the gap in guideline recommendations on the transition from ulcer healing to ulcer remission when it comes to offloading treatments. In this paper, we review why we need offloading treatments and what are the best offloading treatments recommended by the latest international guidelines for healing and remission. Further, we propose plans for future best practice offloading treatments for the transition from healing-to-remission to help reduce re-ulceration rates and improve longer-term ulcer remission. These plans could be the catalyst for better transitioning patients from first ulcer presentation through healing and into long-term remission, and in turn delivering better quality of life, and lower diabetes-related foot disease burdens on patients, nations, and the globe in future.

### Unresolved issues in the management of ulcers of the foot in diabetes [^894fab07]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Management of diabetic foot ulcers presents a major clinical challenge. The response to treatment is often poor and the outcome disappointing, while the costs are high for both healthcare providers and the patient. In such circumstances, it is essential that management should be based on firm evidence and follow consensus. In the case of the diabetic foot, however, clinical practice can vary widely. It is for these reasons that the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot has published guidelines for adoption worldwide. The Group has now also completed a series of non-systematic and systematic reviews on the subjects of soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, offloading and other interventions designed to promote ulcer healing. The current article collates the results of this work in order to demonstrate the extent and quality of the evidence which is available in these areas. In general, the available scientific evidence is thin, leaving many issues unresolved. Although the complex nature of diabetic foot disease presents particular difficulties in the design of robust clinical trials, and the absence of published evidence to support the use of an intervention does not always mean that the intervention is ineffective, there is a clear need for more research in the area. Evidence from sound clinical studies is urgently needed to guide consensus and to underpin clinical practice. It is only in this way that patients suffering with these frequently neglected complications of diabetes can be offered the best hope for a favourable outcome, at the least cost.

### The development of global consensus guidelines on the management and prevention of the diabetic foot 2011 [^a0578fa6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers are the source of major suffering and very large costs for both the patient and the health-care system, and every 30 s, a leg is lost somewhere in the world. Investing in a diabetic foot care guideline can therefore be one of the most cost-effective forms of health-care expenditure, provided the guideline is goal focused and properly implemented. The objective of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) is to develop guidelines that will reduce the effect of diabetic foot disease through cost-effective and quality health care, based on the principles of evidence-based medicine. These guidelines are produced by working groups of experts in the field and are endorsed by the more than 100 country representatives of the IWGDF. In 2009, the IWGDF invited again three working groups to write consensus guidelines on peripheral arterial disease, infection, and wound healing. New texts were produced according to a systematic review of the literature in order to inform protocols for routine care and to highlight areas that should be considered for further study. During a meeting of the members of the IWGDF in May 2011, the new set of guidelines was approved and is published in this journal.

### Standards for the development and methodology of the 2019 International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guidelines [^9d14abe1]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot disease is a source of major patient suffering and societal costs. Investing in evidence-based international guidelines on diabetic foot disease is likely among the most cost-effective forms of health care expenditure, provided the guidelines are outcome focused, evidence based, and properly implemented. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published and updated international guidelines since 1999. The 2019 updates are based on formulating relevant clinical questions and outcomes, rigorous systematic reviews of the literature, and recommendations that are specific, and unambiguous along with their transparent rationale, all using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. We herein describe the development of the 2019 IWGDF guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease, which consists of six chapters, each prepared by a separate working group of international experts. These documents provide guidelines related to diabetic foot disease on prevention; offloading; peripheral artery disease; infection; wound healing interventions; and classification of diabetic foot ulcers. Based on these six chapters, the IWGDF Editorial Board also produced a set of practical guidelines. Each guideline underwent extensive review by the members of the IWGDF Editorial Board as well as independent international experts in each field. We believe that adoption and implementation of the 2019 IWGDF guidelines by health care providers, public health agencies, and policymakers will result in improved prevention and management of diabetic foot disease and a subsequent worldwide reduction in the patient and societal burden this disease causes.

### Guidelines on offloading foot ulcers in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^f9ce6fef]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the use of offloading interventions to promote the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes and updates the previous IWGDF guideline. We followed the GRADE methodology to devise clinical questions and critically important outcomes in the PICO format, to conduct a systematic review of the medical-scientific literature, and to write recommendations and their rationale. The recommendations are based on the quality of evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where evidence was not available, and a weighing of the benefits and harms, patient preferences, feasibility and applicability, and costs related to the intervention. For healing a neuropathic plantar forefoot or midfoot ulcer in a person with diabetes, we recommend that a nonremovable knee-high offloading device is the first choice of offloading treatment. A removable knee-high and removable ankle-high offloading device are to be considered as the second- and third-choice offloading treatment, respectively, if contraindications or patient intolerance to nonremovable offloading exist. Appropriately, fitting footwear combined with felted foam can be considered as the fourth-choice offloading treatment. If non-surgical offloading fails, we recommend to consider surgical offloading interventions for healing metatarsal head and digital ulcers. We have added new recommendations for the use of offloading treatment for healing ulcers that are complicated with infection or ischaemia and for healing plantar heel ulcers. Offloading is arguably the most important of multiple interventions needed to heal a neuropathic plantar foot ulcer in a person with diabetes. Following these recommendations will help health care professionals and teams provide better care for diabetic patients who have a foot ulcer and are at risk for infection, hospitalization, and amputation.

### New and experimental approaches to treatment of diabetic foot ulcers: a comprehensive review of emerging treatment strategies [^719d758a]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers occur in up to 15% of all diabetic patients and are a leading cause of nontraumatic amputation worldwide. Neuropathy, abnormal foot biomechanics, peripheral vascular disease and external trauma are the major contributors to the development of a foot ulcer in the diabetic patient. Therapy today includes repeated debridement, offloading, and dressings, for lower grade ulcers, and broad spectrum antibiotics and occasionally limited or complete amputation for higher grades, requiring a team effort of health care workers from various specialties. The large population affected by diabetic foot ulcers and the high rates of failure ending with amputation even with the best therapeutic regimens, have resulted in the development of new therapies and are the focus of this review. These include new off loading techniques, dressings from various materials, methods to promote wound closure using artificial skin grafts, different growth factors or wound bed modulators and methods of debridement. These new techniques are promising but still mostly unproven and traditional approaches cannot be replaced. New and generally more expensive therapies should be seen as adding to traditional approaches.

### Guidelines on the prevention of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^cb141594]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the prevention of foot ulceration in persons with diabetes and updates the 2015 IWGDF prevention guideline. We followed the GRADE methodology to devise clinical questions and critically important outcomes in the PICO format, to conduct a systematic review of the medical-scientific literature, and to write recommendations and their rationale. The recommendations are based on the quality of evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where evidence was not available, and a weighing of the benefits and harms, patient preferences, feasibility and applicability, and costs related to the intervention. We recommend to screen a person at very low risk for ulceration annually for loss of protective sensation and peripheral artery disease and persons at higher risk at higher frequencies for additional risk factors. For preventing a foot ulcer, educate the at-risk patient about appropriate foot self-care and treat any pre-ulcerative sign on the foot. Instruct moderate-to-high risk patients to wear accommodative properly fitting therapeutic footwear, and consider instructing them to monitor foot skin temperature. Prescribe therapeutic footwear that has a demonstrated plantar pressure relieving effect during walking to prevent plantar foot ulcer recurrence. In patients that fail non-surgical treatment for an active or imminent ulcer, consider surgical intervention; we suggest not to use a nerve decompression procedure. Provide integrated foot care for high-risk patients to prevent ulcer recurrence. Following these recommendations will help health care professionals to provide better care for persons with diabetes at risk of foot ulceration, to increase the number of ulcer-free days, and to reduce the patient and health care burden of diabetic foot disease.

### A shift in priority in diabetic foot care and research: 75% of foot ulcers are preventable [^a307a7ef]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot ulceration poses a heavy burden on the patient and the healthcare system, but prevention thereof receives little attention. For every euro spent on ulcer prevention, ten are spent on ulcer healing, and for every randomized controlled trial conducted on prevention, ten are conducted on healing. In this article, we argue that a shift in priorities is needed. For the prevention of a first foot ulcer, we need more insight into the effect of interventions and practices already applied globally in many settings. This requires systematic recording of interventions and outcomes, and well-designed randomized controlled trials that include analysis of cost-effectiveness. After healing of a foot ulcer, the risk of recurrence is high. For the prevention of a recurrent foot ulcer, home monitoring of foot temperature, pressure-relieving therapeutic footwear, and certain surgical interventions prove to be effective. The median effect size found in a total of 23 studies on these interventions is large, over 60%, and further increases when patients are adherent to treatment. These interventions should be investigated for efficacy as a state-of-the-art integrated foot care approach, where attempts are made to assure treatment adherence. Effect sizes of 75–80% may be expected. If such state-of-the-art integrated foot care is implemented, the majority of problems with foot ulcer recurrence in diabetes can be resolved. It is therefore time to act and to set a new target in diabetic foot care. This target is to reduce foot ulcer incidence with at least 75%.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^c92863e6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Treatment of diabetic ulcers: guiding principles — "The primary treatment goal for diabetic foot ulcers is to obtain wound closure as expeditiously as possible". Resolving ulcers and decreasing recurrence "can lower the probability of lower extremity amputation in the diabetic patient". The Wound Healing Society "defines a chronic wound as one that has failed to proceed through an orderly and timely repair process to produce anatomic and functional integrity", and a chronic wound is further defined as one where "the healing cascade has been disrupted at some point, leading to prolonged inflammation and failure to re-epithelialize and allowing for further breakdown and infection". Early advanced or appropriate practices "may be more cost-effective than standard care practices for decreasing the incidence of lower extremity amputations". Essential therapeutic areas are listed as "management of comorbidities; evaluation of vascular status and appropriate treatment; assessment of lifestyle/psychosocial factors; ulcer assessment and evaluation; tissue management/wound bed preparation; and pressure relief".

### Current challenges and opportunities in the prevention and management of diabetic foot ulcers [^41e6ca64]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers remain a major health care problem. They are common, result in considerable suffering, frequently recur, and are associated with high mortality, as well as considerable health care costs. While national and international guidance exists, the evidence base for much of routine clinical care is thin. It follows that many aspects of the structure and delivery of care are susceptible to the beliefs and opinion of individuals. It is probable that this contributes to the geographic variation in outcome that has been documented in a number of countries. This article considers these issues in depth and emphasizes the urgent need to improve the design and conduct of clinical trials in this field, as well as to undertake systematic comparison of the results of routine care in different health economies. There is strong suggestive evidence to indicate that appropriate changes in the relevant care pathways can result in a prompt improvement in clinical outcomes.

### Local management for diabetic foot ulcers: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e4994894]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy of various local management strategies for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).

Background

Several surgical and non-surgical local interventional approaches are available for the treatment of DFUs. The comparative effectiveness of different treatments is unknown, and it remains unclear which approach is the optimal choice for DFUs treatment due to limited direct comparisons.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to select the optimal approach to DFUs local management. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to September 1, 2023, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed data by pairwise meta-analyses with a random-effects model. A network meta-analysis using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was performed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of different interventional approaches in the early (within 12 wk) and late stages (over 12 wk).

Results

141 RCTs involving 14076 patients and exploring 14 interventional strategies were eligible for inclusion. Most studies (102/141) had at least one risk-of-bias dimension. Good consistency was observed during the analysis. Local pairwise comparisons demonstrated obvious differences in the early-stage healing rate and early- and late-stage healing times, while no significant difference in the late-stage healing rate or adverse events were noted. SUCRAs identified the standard of care (SOC) + decellularized dressing (DD), off-loading (OL), and autogenous graft (AG) as the three most effective interventions within 12 weeks for both healing rate (97%, mean rank: 1.4; 90%, mean rank: 2.3; 80.8%, mean rank: 3.5, respectively) and healing time (96.7%, mean rank: 1.4; 83.0%, mean rank: 3.0; 76.8%, mean rank: 3.8, respectively). After 12 weeks, local drug therapy (LDT) (89.5%, mean rank: 2.4) and OL (82.4%, mean rank: 3.3) ranked the highest for healing rate, and OL (100.0%, mean rank: 1.0) for healing time. With respect to adverse events, moderate and high risks were detected in the SOC + DD (53.7%, mean rank: 7.0) and OL (24.4%, mean rank: 10.8) groups, respectively.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that OL provided considerable benefits for DFU healing in both the early and late stages, but the high risk of adverse events warrants caution. SOC+DD may be the preferred option in the early stages, with an acceptable risk of adverse events.

### Practical guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease (IWGDF 2019 update) [^c8f809c5]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot disease results in a major global burden for patients and the health care system. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has been producing evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. In 2019, all IWGDF Guidelines have been updated based on systematic reviews of the literature and formulation of recommendations by multidisciplinary experts from all over the world. In this document, the IWGDF Practical Guidelines, we describe the basic principles of prevention, classification, and treatment of diabetic foot disease, based on the six IWGDF Guideline chapters. We also describe the organizational levels to successfully prevent and treat diabetic foot disease according to these principles and provide addenda to assist with foot screening. The information in these practical guidelines is aimed at the global community of health care professionals who are involved in the care of persons with diabetes. Many studies around the world support our belief that implementing these prevention and management principles is associated with a decrease in the frequency of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations. We hope that these updated practical guidelines continue to serve as reference document to aid health care providers in reducing the global burden of diabetic foot disease.

### The diabetic foot: a historical overview and gaps in current treatment [^9600c525]. Advances in Wound Care (2016). Low credibility.

Significance: The number of patients with diabetes is rapidly increasing around the world. A large percentage of this population can be expected to develop diabetic ulcers. The economic, social, and public health burden of these ulcers is enormous. It is a common problem that is tackled every day by many healthcare workers throughout the world. Recent Advances: Many pioneers contributed to the good standard of care we have today when treating diabetes and its complications. Current treatment of diabetic foot ulcers involves a multidisciplinary team approach, controls the underlying disease, and treats the wounds using debridement, different wound dressings, and redistributes pressure off the wound. Critical Issues: Since the discovery of the association between diabetes and gangrene of the foot 160 years ago, there have been developments and milestones that are the base of our treatment today. However, with all the modern wound treatment available today, there is a group of patients with hard-to-heal ulcers who do not seem to respond to the regular treatment. Future Directions: It is clear that more research has to be done to improve techniques that will enhance wound healing in chronic wounds. Innovative techniques will be discussed and outlined in this article.

### The development of global consensus guidelines on the management of the diabetic foot [^19140eaf]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

The future for diabetes is grave. Now described as the global epidemic of the 21st century, the increasing incidence of diabetes (in 2007 over 246 million people affected by diabetes) will place considerable strain on resources and will bring suffering to many if the preventative measures promoted by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) and other diabetes representative organizations are not put into effect. Ulcers of the foot in diabetes are a source of major suffering and cost. Investing in a diabetic foot care guideline can be one of the most cost-effective forms of healthcare expenditure, provided the guideline is goal-focused and properly implemented. The objective of the IWGDF, founded in 1996, is to develop guidelines that will reduce the impact of diabetic foot disease through cost-effective and quality healthcare, based on the principles of evidence-based medicine. Three IWGDF working groups were invited to write specific consensus guidelines on different subjects, according to the current standards of evidence based medicine. Therefore, for the first time, new 2007 texts were produced according to a systematic review of the literature, in order to inform protocols for routine care and to highlight areas which should be considered for further study. After reaching worldwide consensus, the review reports and specific guidelines were launched in May 2007.

### Diabetic foot ulcer: an evidence-based treatment update [^cc83d5e8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are extremely debilitating and difficult to treat. Multidisciplinary management, patient education, glucose control, debridement, offloading, infection control, and adequate perfusion are the mainstays of standard care endorsed by most practice guidelines. Adjunctive therapies represent new treatment modalities endorsed in recent years, though many lack significant high-powered studies to support their use as standard of care.

Objective

This update intends to identify recent, exclusively high level, evidence-based evaluations of DFU therapies. Furthermore, it suggests a direction for future research.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, Ovid Technologies, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for recent systematic reviews published after 2004, and randomized controlled trials published in 2012–2013 that evaluated treatment modalities for DFUs. These papers are reviewed and the quality of available evidence is discussed.

Results

A total of 34 studies met inclusion criteria. Studied therapies include debridement, off-loading, negative pressure therapy, dressings, topical therapies, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, growth factors, bioengineered skin substitutes, electrophysical therapy, and alternative therapy. Good-quality evidence is lacking to justify the use of many of these therapies, with the exception of standard care (offloading, debridement) and possibly negative pressure wound therapy.

Limitations

There is an overall lack of high-level evidence in new adjunctive management of DFU. Comparison of different treatment modalities is difficult, since existing studies are not standardized.

Conclusions

Many therapeutic modalities are available to treat DFU. Quality high-level evidence exists for standard care such as off-loading. Evidence for adjunctive therapies such as negative pressure wound therapy, skin substitutes, and platelet-derived growth factor can help guide adjunctive care but limitations exist in terms of evidence quality.

### Diabetic foot ulcers: appraising standard of care and reviewing new trends in management [^33bcf8e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most common diabetes complications and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current DFU standard of care (SOC) involves four principles: (1) pressure relief, (2) debridement, (3) infection management, and (4) revascularization when indicated. Despite the current SOC, many DFU persist, warranting a new approach for the management of these complex wounds. This review aims to summarize the current SOC as well as the latest trends in adjunctive therapies that may become the new SOC in DFU management. These include negative pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, bioengineered skin substitutes, growth factors, shockwave therapy, and several others. These novel therapies have shown significant DFU clinical improvement among subsets of DFU patients. However, much of the literature comes from smaller trials with inconsistent patient selection and outcomes measured, making it difficult to assess the true clinical benefit of these treatments. While novel therapies are promising for the interdisciplinary approach to DFU management, many still lack sufficient evidence, and their efficacy remains to be determined.

### Patient education for preventing diabetic foot ulceration [^b1b6ebdc]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of diabetic foot ulceration is very challenging, costly and often needs to be of long duration. This leads to substantial economic burden. Population-based research suggests that a meaningful reduction of the incidence of amputations caused by diabetes mellitus has already been achieved since the St. Vincent resolution in 1989. Still, it cannot be inferred from these studies that the current preventive efforts are (cost-)effective because reduction of amputation incidence can also be the result of improvements in ulcer treatment. Nevertheless, education of people with diabetes is widely advocated and implemented in standard practice. Despite the fact that preventive interventions are often combined in daily practice, there is little scientific evidence demonstrating the effect of those efforts. In systematically reviewing the evidence, there is insufficient evidence that limited patient education alone is effective in achieving clinically relevant reductions in ulcer and amputation incidence. To date, high quality evidence that more complex interventions including patient education can prevent diabetic foot ulceration is not available either. This, however, should be interpreted as lack of evidence rather than evidence of no effect. Future directions for research and practice may be to concentrate preventive effort on those patients who appear to be at highest risk of foot ulceration after careful screening and selection.

### Guidelines on diagnosis, prognosis, and management of peripheral artery disease in patients with foot ulcers and diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^93a03133]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients with foot ulcers and diabetes and updates the previous IWGDF Guideline. Up to 50% of patients with diabetes and foot ulceration have concurrent PAD, which confers a significantly elevated risk of adverse limb events and cardiovascular disease. We know that the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of these patients are markedly different to patients with diabetes who do not have PAD and yet there are few good quality studies addressing this important subset of patients. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to devise clinical questions and critically important outcomes in the patient-intervention-comparison-outcome (PICO) format, to conduct a systematic review of the medical-scientific literature, and to write recommendations and their rationale. The recommendations are based on the quality of evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where evidence was not available, and a weighing of the benefits and harms, patient preferences, feasibility and applicability, and costs related to the intervention. We here present the updated 2019 guidelines on diagnosis, prognosis, and management of PAD in patients with a foot ulcer and diabetes, and we suggest some key future topics of particular research interest.

### Management of diabetic wounds: expert panel consensus statement [^be711360]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Significance: The Wound Healing Foundation recognized the need for consensus-based unbiased recommendations for the treatment of wounds. Consensus statements on the treatment of chronic wounds and acute wounds have been developed and published previously. The current publication on diabetic wounds represents the next step in this process. Diabetic wounds constitute a major problem. Population-based and meta-analytic studies indicate that the presence of foot wounds in patients with diabetes increases their mortality risk by more than twofold. The management of diabetic wounds requires consistent and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides the clinician with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of diabetic wounds. Presented in a structured format, this is a useful guide for clinicians and learners in all patient care settings. Recent Advances: Continuous glucose monitoring and other new tools have facilitated better diabetes management and the management of associated wounds. Diabetic limb salvage should focus on achieving and optimizing function for the patient with diabetes rather than preserving limb tissue at all costs. Critical Issues: Successful management of diabetic wounds requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing comprehensive assessment, timely intervention, and collaborative care by the wound clinician with providers who can address critical aspects to achieve healing, including careful management of blood glucose levels, optimization of off-loading and physical therapy, assessment and treatment of limb ischemia, control and prevention of wound infection, and optimal pain management. Future Directions: Emerging treatments offer hope and promise, but the heterogenicity of diabetic wounds poses a challenge to performing good studies, which will be necessary to advance new treatments for diabetic wounds.

### Intensive versus conventional glycaemic control for treating diabetic foot ulcers [^a941fde1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The estimated likelihood of lower limb amputation is 10 to 30 times higher amongst people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Of all non-traumatic amputations in people with diabetes, 85% are preceded by a foot ulcer. Foot ulceration associated with diabetes (diabetic foot ulcers) is caused by the interplay of several factors, most notably diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and changes in foot structure. These factors have been linked to chronic hyperglycaemia (high levels of glucose in the blood) and the altered metabolic state of diabetes. Control of hyperglycaemia may be important in the healing of ulcers.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intensive glycaemic control compared to conventional control on the outcome of foot ulcers in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Search Methods

In December 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL; Elsevier SCOPUS; ISI Web of Knowledge Web of Science; BioMed Central and LILACS. We also searched clinical trial databases, pharmaceutical trial databases and current international and national clinical guidelines on diabetes foot management for relevant published, non-published, ongoing and terminated clinical trials. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were considered for inclusion where they investigated the effects of intensive glycaemic control on the outcome of active foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Non randomised and quasi-randomised trials were excluded. In order to be included the trial had to have: 1) attempted to maintain or control blood glucose levels and measured changes in markers of glycaemic control (HbA1c or fasting, random, mean, home capillary or urine glucose), and 2) documented the effect of these interventions on active foot ulcer outcomes. Glycaemic interventions included subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral anti-diabetes agents, lifestyle interventions or a combination of these interventions. The definition of the interventional (intensive) group was that it should have a lower glycaemic target than the comparison (conventional) group.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors independently evaluated the papers identified by the search strategy against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors then independently reviewed all potential full-text articles and trials registry results for inclusion.

Main Results

We only identified one trial that met the inclusion criteria but this trial did not have any results so we could not perform the planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses in the absence of data. Two ongoing trials were identified which may provide data for analyses in a later version of this review. The completion date of these trials is currently unknown.

Authors' Conclusions

The current review failed to find any completed randomised clinical trials with results. Therefore we are unable to conclude whether intensive glycaemic control when compared to conventional glycaemic control has a positive or detrimental effect on the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Previous evidence has however highlighted a reduction in risk of limb amputation (from various causes) in people with type 2 diabetes with intensive glycaemic control. Whether this applies to people with foot ulcers in particular is unknown. The exact role that intensive glycaemic control has in treating foot ulcers in multidisciplinary care (alongside other interventions targeted at treating foot ulcers) requires further investigation.

### Guidelines on interventions to enhance healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes (IWGDF 2023 update) [^96133d6b]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Principles of wound management, including debridement, wound bed preparation, and newer technologies involving alternation of wound physiology to facilitate healing, are of utmost importance when attempting to heal a chronic diabetes-related foot ulcer. However, the rising incidence and costs of diabetes-related foot ulcer management necessitate that interventions to enhance wound healing of chronic diabetes-related foot ulcers are supported by high-quality evidence of efficacy and cost effectiveness when used in conjunction with established aspects of gold-standard multidisciplinary care. This is the 2023 International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) evidence-based guideline on wound healing interventions to promote healing of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes. It serves as an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline.

Materials and Methods

We followed the GRADE approach by devising clinical questions and important outcomes in the Patient-Intervention-Control-Outcome (PICO) format, undertaking a systematic review, developing summary of judgements tables, and writing recommendations and rationale for each question. Each recommendation is based on the evidence found in the systematic review and, using the GRADE summary of judgement items, including desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of evidence, patient values, resources required, cost effectiveness, equity, feasibility, and acceptability, we formulated recommendations that were agreed by the authors and reviewed by independent experts and stakeholders.

Results

From the results of the systematic review and evidence-to-decision making process, we were able to make 29 separate recommendations. We made a number of conditional supportive recommendations for the use of interventions to improve healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. These include the use of sucrose octasulfate dressings, the use of negative pressure wound therapies for post-operative wounds, the use of placental-derived products, the use of the autologous leucocyte/platelet/fibrin patch, the use of topical oxygen therapy, and the use of hyperbaric oxygen. Although in all cases it was stressed that these should be used where best standard of care was not able to heal the wound alone and where resources were available for the interventions.

Conclusions

These wound healing recommendations should support improved outcomes for people with diabetes and ulcers of the foot, and we hope that widescale implementation will follow. However, although the certainty of much of the evidence on which to base the recommendations is improving, it remains poor overall. We encourage not more, but better quality trials including those with a health economic analysis, into this area.

### Diabetic foot disease: "The times they are A changin' " [^6478b143]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot disease greatly impacts both affected patients and society, but remains the "Cinderella" of diabetes-related complications. However, recent progress in research and guideline development have led to increased awareness of the problem and improved clinical outcomes. Thus, it is time for a shift in global perception of this increasingly prevalent problem. In this special issue, we present 7 up-to-date clinical guidelines and 10 systematic reviews developed by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, together with 17 informative and stimulating related papers. These guidelines offer new recommendations on ulcer classification, diagnosis of infection severity, and vascular assessment, to assist in ulcer risk stratification, diagnosis and interdisciplinary communication. Key developments include providing guidance on methodological assessment of research papers; expanding the evidence base for ulcer treatment by the use of wound products and offloading treatment and suggestions for improving ulcer prevention through technological advances in patient monitoring of risk factors and footwear. The 17 invited papers discuss related topics ranging from stem cell research to patient psychology and describe the way forward in diabetic foot care. While there is much more to learn, the new knowledge of underlying pathways, advancements in diagnosis, treatment and prevention presented in this supplement should help improve outcomes and reduce the great and growing burden of diabetic foot disease.

In conclusion, after almost 3 decades of producing evidence-based clinical guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetes-related foot disease, IWGDF hopes that the 2023 update will continue to stimulate clinicians to deliver the best care possible for these patients, will motivate researchers to undertake the high-quality trials needed to deliver the new evidence to advance the field further and collectively will support people with diabetes-related foot disease to minimize their disease burdens.

### The advantages and disadvantages of non-surgical management of the diabetic foot [^68fc266d]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

It is frequently stated that diabetic foot ulcers should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, comprising individuals who can deliver all the necessary and wide-ranging skills: medical and surgical, podiatric, nursing and orthotic. Whilst there are some data to support this multidisciplinary approach there is little to guide us in ensuring the patient is seen by the right professional for the right treatment at the right time. This article will examine the evidence supporting the most effective use of the multidisciplinary team. It will look at medical managements of ulcers including dressings, offloading and the treatment of infection, either cellulitis or osteomyelitis. By contrast, the role of surgery in offloading, and the treatment of osteomyelitis will be examined, as well as the role of vascular surgery. The most important aspect of management choice, however, is the need to focus on the needs of the person with a diabetic foot ulcer rather than simply on the treatment of the ulcer in isolation. Other complications of diabetes, which may have an effect on wound healing such as glycaemic control, renal failure and visual disturbance will be explored. Finally, there will be discussion of the relevance of outcome measure, both of ulcers as well as those more patient-centred. The ways in which these can be used to monitor individual clinical responses to treatment will be described, as well as their potential use as an aid to comparison of the effectiveness of treatment protocols adopted in different centres.

### Comparative efficacy of growth factor therapy in healing diabetes-related foot ulcers: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a6e625ac]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes‐related foot ulcers (DFU) have been estimated to cause about four million years of living with disability. Treatment of DFU costs approximately US$8659 per patient annually. Approximately 10 billion US dollars are spent annually on the treatment of DFU. About 85% of diabetes‐related amputations are preceded by a DFU. New treatments for DFU are urgently needed.

Growth factors play an important role in promoting wound healing and therefore have been tested as treatments for DFU. Several meta‐analyses have suggested that the administration of a number of different growth factors significantly improves DFU healing compared with control alone. Despite these findings, The International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot has concluded that the available evidence does not support the use of growth factors in the treatment of DFU. Prior meta‐analyses have mainly focused on the comparison of two treatment strategies such as administration of a growth factor compared to control alone. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) enables the comparison of multiple different treatments. One previous NMA comparing different growth factors suggested that the recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) was the most beneficial growth factor for healing DFU. However, seven clinical trials have been reported since the publication of this prior NMA. Therefore, there is a need to perform an updated NMA to assess the evidence for different growth factors in treating DFU.

The aim of this study was to perform an up‐to‐date NMA of randomised clinical trials (RCT) evidence to test the relative efficacy of growth factor therapy in healing DFU in comparison to control.

### A stepwise approach to nonoperative and operative management of the diabetic foot ulceration [^d7dc3a2e]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

There are multiple factors that lead to the development of the diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). The ultimate goal when treating DFU is to prevent amputation. Initial therapy should include debridement, maintaining a healthy wound environment, and offloading. In the setting of infection or a nonhealing DFU, surgical intervention may be necessary. The goals of this article are to discuss the key aspects of the initial examination, standard nonoperative treatment, and the operative treatment options for patients with DFU.

### Complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration [^1594fa2d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ulceration of the feet, which can lead to the amputation of feet and legs, is a major problem for people with diabetes mellitus, and can cause substantial economic burden. Single preventive strategies have not been shown to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration to a significant extent. Therefore, in clinical practice, preventive interventions directed at patients, healthcare providers and/or the structure of health care are often combined (complex interventions).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of complex interventions in the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus compared with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions. A complex intervention is defined as an integrated care approach, combining two or more prevention strategies on at least two different levels of care: the patient, the healthcare provider and/or the structure of health care.

Search Methods

For the second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 22 May 2015), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 22 May 2015), Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 21 May, 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 21 May, 2015) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 22 May, 2015).

Selection Criteria

Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effectiveness of combinations of preventive strategies, not solely patient education, for the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus, with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors were assigned to independently select studies, to extract study data and to assess risk of bias of included studies, using predefined criteria.

Main Results

Only six RCTs met the criteria for inclusion. The study characteristics differed substantially in terms of healthcare settings, the nature of the interventions studied and outcome measures reported. In three studies that compared the effect of an education-centred complex intervention with usual care or written instructions, only little evidence of benefit was found. Three studies compared the effect of more intensive and comprehensive complex interventions with usual care. One study found a significant and cost-effective reduction, one of lower extremity amputations (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71). One other study found a significant reduction of both amputation and foot ulcers. The last study reported improvement of patients' self care behaviour. All six included RCTs were at high risk of bias, with hardly any of the predefined quality assessment criteria met.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no high-quality research evidence evaluating complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration and insufficient evidence of benefit.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^c597a39f]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Significance: Chronic wounds include, but are not limited, to diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. They are a challenge to wound care professionals and consume a great deal of healthcare resources around the globe. This review discusses the pathophysiology of complex chronic wounds and the means and modalities currently available to achieve healing in such patients. Recent Advances: Although often difficult to treat, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and specific attention toward managing these perturbations can often lead to successful healing. Critical Issues: Overcoming the factors that contribute to delayed healing are key components of a comprehensive approach to wound care and present the primary challenges to the treatment of chronic wounds. When wounds fail to achieve sufficient healing after 4 weeks of standard care, reassessment of underlying pathology and consideration of the need for advanced therapeutic agents should be undertaken. However, selection of an appropriate therapy is often not evidence based. Future Directions: Basic tenets of care need to be routinely followed, and a systematic evaluation of patients and their wounds will also facilitate appropriate care. Underlying pathologies, which result in the failure of these wounds to heal, differ among various types of chronic wounds. A better understanding of the differences between various types of chronic wounds at the molecular and cellular levels should improve our treatment approaches, leading to better healing rates, and facilitate the development of new more effective therapies. More evidence for the efficacy of current and future advanced wound therapies is required for their appropriate use.

### Local management for diabetic foot ulcers: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^38764fd7]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison to Other Studies

Traditional meta-analyses focusing on 1 or 2 kinds of treatment, – or NMA comparing different subgroup approaches or materials belonging to the same type for DFU, have been reported previously.– However, none of these studies comprehensively integrated and evaluated all available intervention approaches. Our NMA fills this gap in the field, facilitating decision-making by clinicians. Several guidelines have proposed that OL, negative-pressure wound therapy, and SOC are the first-line treatments for DFU, but it has remained unclear to date, which was the most effective. This study demonstrated that, all conditions being equal, OL should be selected preferentially. Our review did not assess the treatment options that are still under laboratory investigation and are not yet clinically applied.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in diabetic foot ulceration: useless or useful? A battle [^79fc04c3]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) in the treatment of certain types of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) has been the topic of much debate and disagreement over the last several decades. In this review, the evidence for its use is presented and discussed by two experts in DFU management. Whereas some randomized controlled trials suggest that HBO may speed the healing of certain ischaemic or neuroischaemic ulcers after the failure of standard of care, most recent trials have been negative. No RCT is perfect, and the weaknesses of RCTs in this therapeutic area are discussed. It can be concluded that the indications for the use of HBO remain unclear, and that large, rigorously designed and executed RCTs are required to clarify the use of HBO in DFU treatment.

### Effectiveness and safety of negative-pressure wound therapy for diabetic foot ulcers: a meta-analysis [^cad4e4ef]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The authors conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of negative-pressure wound therapy for diabetic foot ulcers.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify relevant studies published up to February of 2013. All randomized controlled trials comparing negative-pressure wound therapy and non-negative-pressure wound therapy (i.e., standard wound care) for diabetic foot ulcers were included. Results were pooled using meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of negative pressure in managing diabetic foot ulcers.

Results

The databases were derived from eight qualified studies that included a total of 669 patients. Overall, compared with the non-negative-pressure wound therapy-treated diabetic foot ulcers, negative pressure resulted in a significantly higher proportion of healed ulcers (relative risk, 1.52; 95 percent CI, 1.23 to 1.89; p < 0.001), more reduction of ulcer area (standardized mean difference, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.41 to 1.37; p = 0.003), and shorter time to wound healing (standardized mean difference, -1.10; 95 percent CI, -1.83 to -0.37; p = 0.003). Negative-pressure wound therapy patients also experienced significantly fewer major amputations (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent CI, 0.04 to 0.51; p = 0.003), but the rate of minor amputations was not affected (p = 0.837). No significant difference was observed between negative-pressure wound therapy and non-negative-pressure wound therapy (p = 0.683). No heterogeneity among studies was detected.

Conclusion

Negative-pressure wound therapy appears to be more effective for diabetic foot ulcers compared with non-negative-pressure wound therapy, and has a similar safety profile.

### Guidelines on offloading foot ulcers in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2023 update) [^1aafca69]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Offloading mechanical tissue stress is arguably the most important of multiple interventions needed to heal diabetes-related foot ulcers. This is the 2023 International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) evidence-based guideline on offloading interventions to promote healing of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes. It serves as an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline.

Materials and Methods

We followed the GRADE approach by devising clinical questions and important outcomes in the PICO (Patient-Intervention-Control-Outcome) format, undertaking a systematic review and meta-analyses, developing summary of judgement tables and writing recommendations and rationales for each question. Each recommendation is based on the evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where evidence was not available, and a careful weighing of GRADE summary of judgement items including desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of evidence, patient values, resources required, cost effectiveness, equity, feasibility, and acceptability.

Results

For healing a neuropathic plantar forefoot or midfoot ulcer in a person with diabetes, use a non-removable knee-high offloading device as the first-choice offloading intervention. If contraindications or patient intolerance to non-removable offloading exist, consider using a removable knee-high or ankle-high offloading device as the second-choice offloading intervention. If no offloading devices are available, consider using appropriately fitting footwear combined with felted foam as the third-choice offloading intervention. If such a non-surgical offloading treatment fails to heal a plantar forefoot ulcer, consider an Achilles tendon lengthening, metatarsal head resection, joint arthroplasty, or metatarsal osteotomy. For healing a neuropathic plantar or apex lesser digit ulcer secondary to flexibile toe deformity, use digital flexor tendon tenotomy. For healing rearfoot, non-plantar or ulcers complicated with infection or ischaemia, further recommendations have been outlined. All recommendations have been summarised in an offloading clinical pathway to help facilitate the implementation of this guideline into clinical practice.

Conclusion

These offloading guideline recommendations should help healthcare professionals provide the best care and outcomes for persons with diabetes-related foot ulcers and reduce the person's risk of infection, hospitalisation and amputation.

### Diabetic foot ulcers: a quality of life issue [^542632ac]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Foot ulcers are a serious complication of diabetes mellitus that are associated with adverse sequelae and high costs. In addition, such foot ulcers have a significant impact on quality of life (QoL). For example, the loss of mobility associated with foot ulcers affects patients' ability to perform simple, everyday tasks and to participate in leisure activities. These and other consequences of foot ulcers often lead to depression and poor QoL. Notably, several studies have shown that patients with diabetes mellitus and foot ulcers were more depressed and had poorer QoL than those who had no diabetic complications. Given the detrimental effect foot ulcers have on patients, it is essential that these foot ulcers are prevented or treated more effectively than at present. Evidence suggests that many foot ulcers can be prevented by using intensive interventions and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. In addition, preventative strategies may become more effective if new research into how patients with diabetes experience and interpret their health threats (e.g. diagnosis "loss of sensation" or a foot ulcer episode) is taken into account. With regard to treatment, new options should enable ulcers to heal more quickly than with standard therapies. One area of interest is the use of growth factors. For example, recombinant platelet-derived growth factor, in addition to good ulcer care, has been shown to improve the number of ulcers that heal and healing times significantly compared with good ulcer care alone. Other potential new treatments include the use of skin substitutes. In summary, improved preventative measures and wound treatment should reduce the potential for patients with diabetes mellitus to experience impaired QoL caused by foot ulcers.

### Debridement of diabetic foot ulcers [^5ce3ebf7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Foot ulceration is thought to affect 15% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of debridement as a treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.

Search Strategy

Searches of electronic databases, hand searching journals, bibliographies and identification of unpublished work by written communication with recognised experts in the diabetic foot.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating a method of debridement in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The outcome had to include either complete healing or rate of healing. There was no restriction on articles/trials based on language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and assessment of study quality were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by an Editor of the Wounds Group.

Main Results

5 RCTs of debridement were identified; 3 RCTs assessed the effectiveness of a hydrogel as a debridement method, 1 RCT evaluated surgical debridement and 1 RCT evaluated larval therapy. Pooling the 3 hydrogel RCTs suggested that hydrogels are significantly more effective than gauze or standard care in healing diabetic foot ulcers (absolute risk difference 0.23; 95% CI: 0.10,0.36). Surgical debridement and larval therapy showed no significant benefit in these small trials. Other debridement methods such as enzyme preparations or polysaccharide beads have not been evaluated in RCTs of people with diabetes.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is evidence to suggest that hydrogel increases the healing rate of diabetic foot ulcers. More research is needed to evaluate the effects of a range of widely used debridement methods and of debridement per se.

### Priorities in offloading the diabetic foot [^afc0d219]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Biomechanical factors play an important role in diabetic foot disease. Reducing high foot pressures (i.e. offloading) is one of the main goals in healing and preventing foot ulceration. Evidence-based guidelines show the strong association between the efficacy to offload the foot and clinical outcome. However, several aspects related to offloading are underexposed. First, in the management of foot complications, offloading is mostly studied as a single entity, whereas it should be analysed in a broader perspective of contributing factors to better predict clinical outcome. This includes assessment of patient behavioural factors such as type and intensity of daily physical activity and adherence to prescribed treatment. Second, a large gap exists between evidence-based recommendations and clinical practice in the use of offloading for ulcer treatment, and this gap needs to be bridged. Possible ways to achieve this are discussed in this article. Third, our knowledge about the efficacy and role of offloading in treating complicated and non-plantar neuropathic foot ulcers needs to be expanded because these ulcers currently dominate presentation in multidisciplinary foot practice. Finally, foot ulcer prevention is underexposed when compared with ulcer treatment. Prevention requires a larger focus, in particular regarding the efficacy of therapeutic footwear and its relative role in comparison with other preventative strategies. These priorities need the attention of clinicians, scientists and professional societies to improve our understanding of offloading and to improve clinical outcome in the management of the diabetic foot.

### Quality randomized clinical trials of topical diabetic foot ulcer healing agents [^389a2cc8]. Advances in Wound Care (2016). Low credibility.

Significance: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) significantly add to global economic, social, and clinical burdens. Healing a DFU fast and well limits complications that can lead to lower extremity amputation, morbidity, and mortality. Recent Advances: Many promising topical DFU healing agents have been studied in randomized clinical trials (RCT), but only one, becaplermin, has been cleared for this use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Critical Issues: This critical review of DFU topical healing RCTs summarizes issues identified in their design and conduct, highlighting ways to improve study quality so researchers can increase the likelihood of RCT success in propelling effective topical DFU healing agents toward clinical use. Key issues include (1) inadequate sample size, (2) risk of bias, (3) irrelevant or unreported inclusion criteria, (4) substandard outcome measures, (5) unmatched group characteristics that predict nonhealing at baseline, (6) unequal or uncontrolled concurrent interventions or standard of care, (7) heterogeneous subject or DFU samples (8) unblinded allocation, treatment, or outcome measures, or (9) inadequate follow-up for clinical relevance. These can add bias or unexplained variability to RCT outcomes, limiting clinical or statistical significance and accuracy of results. Future Directions: This critical review summarizes ways to overcome these deficiencies to optimize DFU clinical trial design and conduct. It provides a blueprint for future excellence in RCTs testing safety and efficacy of topical DFU healing agents and smoothing the path to their clinical use.

### Evidence-based management of common chronic lower extremity ulcers [^5ef069fb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic lower extremity ulcers are a significant burden on patients and health care systems worldwide. Although relatively common, these wounds can be difficult to treat and present a challenge to physicians. Treatment has often been based on anecdotal accounts; however, there is a growing emphasis on using evidence-based conclusions to guide clinical decisions. In this review article, the standard of care and adjuvant therapies of venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers are presented from an evidence-based perspective.

### Growth factors for treating diabetic foot ulcers [^bc65d761]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Foot ulcers are a major complication of diabetes mellitus, often leading to amputation. Growth factors derived from blood platelets, endothelium, or macrophages could potentially be an important treatment for these wounds but they may also confer risks.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of growth factors for foot ulcers in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Search Methods

In March 2015 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials in any setting, recruiting people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed with a foot ulcer. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared a growth factor plus standard care (e.g., antibiotic therapy, debridement, wound dressings) versus placebo or no growth factor plus standard care, or compared different growth factors against each other. We considered lower limb amputation (minimum of one toe), complete healing of the foot ulcer, and time to complete healing of the diabetic foot ulcer as the primary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Independently, we selected randomised clinical trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We subjected our analyses to both fixed-effect and random-effects model analyses.

Main Results

We identified 28 randomised clinical trials involving 2365 participants. The cause of foot ulcer (neurologic, vascular, or combined) was poorly defined in all trials. The trials were conducted in ten countries. The trials assessed 11 growth factors in 30 comparisons: platelet-derived wound healing formula, autologous growth factor, allogeneic platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor β2, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide matrix, recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (becaplermin), recombinant human epidermal growth factor, recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor, recombinant human lactoferrin, and recombinant human acidic fibroblast growth factor. Topical intervention was the most frequent route of administration. All the trials were underpowered and had a high risk of bias. Pharmaceutical industry sponsored 50% of the trials. Any growth factor compared with placebo or no growth factor increased the number of participants with complete wound healing (345/657 (52.51%) versus 167/482 (34.64%); RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.73; I(2) = 51%, 12 trials; low quality evidence). The result is mainly based on platelet-derived wound healing formula (36/56 (64.28%) versus 7/27 (25.92%); RR 2.45, 95% 1.27 to 4.74; I(2) = 0%, two trials), and recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (becaplermin) (205/428 (47.89%) versus 109/335 (32.53%); RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.76, I(2) = 74%, five trials). In terms of lower limb amputation (minimum of one toe), there was no clear evidence of a difference between any growth factor and placebo or no growth factor (19/150 (12.66%) versus 12/69 (17.39%); RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.39; I(2) = 0%, two trials; very low quality evidence). One trial involving 55 participants showed no clear evidence of a difference between recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor and placebo in terms of ulcer-free days following treatment for diabetic foot ulcers (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.94; P value 0.56, low quality of evidence)Although 11 trials reported time to complete healing of the foot ulcers in people with diabetes, meta-analysis was not possible for this outcome due to the unique comparisons within each trial, failure to report data, and high number of withdrawals. Data on quality of life were not reported. Growth factors showed an increasing risk of overall adverse event rate compared with compared with placebo or no growth factor (255/498 (51.20%) versus 169/332 (50.90%); RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; I(2) = 48%; eight trials; low quality evidence). Overall, safety data were poorly reported and adverse events may have been underestimated.

Authors' Conclusions

This Cochrane systematic review analysed a heterogeneous group of trials that assessed 11 different growth factors for diabetic foot ulcers. We found evidence suggesting that growth factors may increase the likelihood that people will have complete healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. However, this conclusion is based on randomised clinical trials with high risk of systematic errors (bias). Assessment of the quality of the available evidence (GRADE) showed that further trials investigating the effect of growth factors are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. The safety profiles of the growth factors are unclear. Future trials should be conducted according to SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement by independent investigators and using the Foundation of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research recommendations.

### Novel biological therapies for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers [^2db2bfd3]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The number of people with diabetes mellitus (DM) is estimated to exceed 640 million by the year 2040. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a debilitating illness that affects more than 2% of DM patients. DFU is caused by DM-induced neural and vascular lesions leading to a reduced sensation and microcirculation. The increase in the prevalence of DFU has prompted researchers to find new therapies for the management of DFU. Areas covered: This review presents the current status of novel biological therapies used in the treatment of DFU. Literature information and data analysis were collected from PubMed, the website of the American Diabetes Association, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The keywords used in the search were: DM, DFU, complications of DM. Expert opinion: Many biological agents have been investigated in a bid to find an effective therapy for DFU. These include growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor etc), stem cells (epithelial progenitor-, adipose-derived stem cells etc), anti-diabetic drugs (insulin, exendin-4), herbs, urokinase, dalteparin, statins and bio-agents such as acid peptide matrix. Biological agents that can reduce hyperglycaemia, increase sensation, microcirculation and oxygenation and repair lost tissue are the most ideal for the treatment of DFU.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^45dda3c3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot disorders clinical practice guideline (CPG) — based on the consensus of current clinical practice and review of the clinical literature — states that foot ulcerations, infections, Charcot neuroarthropathy, and peripheral arterial disease frequently result in gangrene and lower limb amputation; consequently, foot disorders are leading causes of hospitalization for persons with diabetes and account for billion-dollar expenditures annually in the US, and dramatic reductions in frequency have been achieved by taking a multidisciplinary approach to patient management. The guideline reviews three major pedal complications of diabetes — diabetic foot ulcers, diabetic foot infections, and the diabetic Charcot foot — and provides evidence-based guidance for general patterns of practice without dictating care of all affected patients. In context, an estimated 7% of the US population has diabetes, and if the outlined concepts are incorporated into patient management protocols, a major reduction in diabetic limb amputations is certainly an attainable goal.

### Using evidence in practice. foot care in diabetes [^9ed87ea7]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Foot ulceration and amputation remain all too common complications for people with diabetes mellitus. Overcoming this, however, requires considerable effort. Improved implementation of patient education programs is essential, along with increased access to resources to support optimal foot care and the acquisition of optimal footwear for patients at highest risk of these complications. Well-coordinated screening programs are likely to be highly beneficial. Multidisciplinary care must be available for patients with established lower extremity disease. Equally important, further research into foot ulcer prevention and management is critical. The total number of studies completed to date in the field remains low, especially considering the frequency and devastating nature of lower extremity complications.

### Phototherapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes [^22a2f939]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Foot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Phototherapy is a relatively new, non-invasive, and pain-free treatment method, which promotes the ulcer repair process through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and vascular activity. Phototherapy may be used as an alternative approach for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes, but the evidence for its effect compared with placebo or other treatments has not yet been established.

Objectives

To assess the effects of phototherapy for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (11 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (11 October 2016), Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations) (11 October 2016), Ovid Embase (11 October 2016), EBSCO CINAHL Plus (11 October 2016), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (24 June 2017). We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies on 24 June 2017, and screened reference lists to identify additional studies. We used no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials or cluster randomised controlled trials that 1) compared phototherapy with sham phototherapy, no phototherapy, or other physical therapy modalities, 2) compared different forms of phototherapy, or 3) compared phototherapy of different output power, wavelength, power density, or dose range, in adults with diabetes and an open foot ulcer of any severity, in any setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment. We combined the study outcomes when appropriate.

Main Results

Eight trials with 316 participants met the inclusion criteria. Most of the included studies were single-centre studies that were carried out in clinics or hospitals with a sample size ranging from 14 to 84. We generally considered the included studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias, as they had one domain at high risk of bias, or three or more domains at unclear risk of bias. We did not identify any studies that reported valid data for time to complete wound healing. Meta-analysis of four studies including 116 participants indicated that participants receiving phototherapy may experience a greater proportion of wounds completely healed during follow-up compared with those receiving no phototherapy/placebo (64.5% for the phototherapy group versus 37.0% for the no phototherapy/placebo group; risk ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.28; low-quality evidence, downgraded for study limitations and imprecision). Two studies mentioned adverse events in the results; one study with 16 participants suggested that there were no device-related adverse events, and the other study with 14 participants suggested that there was no clear difference between phototherapy and placebo group. Four studies reported change in ulcer size, but primarily due to high heterogeneity, they were not combined. Results from individual trials (including 16 participants to 84 participants) generally suggested that after two to four weeks of treatment phototherapy may result in a greater reduction in ulcer size but the quality of the evidence was low due to unclear risk of bias in the original trial and small sample size. We based the analyses for quality of life and amputations on only one study each (28 participants and 23 participants respectively); both outcomes showed no clear difference between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review of randomised trials suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy/placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow-up and may reduce wound size in people with diabetes, but there was no evidence that phototherapy improves quality of life. Due to the small sample size and methodological flaws in the original trials, the quality of the evidence was low, which reduces our confidence in these results. Large, well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm whether phototherapy could be an effective option for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.

### Diabetic foot ulcers [^e1f7b4a1]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Ulceration of the foot in diabetes is common and disabling and frequently leads to amputation of the leg. Mortality is high and healed ulcers often recur. The pathogenesis of foot ulceration is complex, clinical presentation variable, and management requires early expert assessment. Interventions should be directed at infection, peripheral ischaemia, and abnormal pressure loading caused by peripheral neuropathy and limited joint mobility. Despite treatment, ulcers readily become chronic wounds. Diabetic foot ulcers have been neglected in health-care research and planning, and clinical practice is based more on opinion than scientific fact. Furthermore, the pathological processes are poorly understood and poorly taught and communication between the many specialties involved is disjointed and insensitive to the needs of patients.

### Hyperbaric oxygen for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers: a systematic review [^cf313f95]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to assess the additional value of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in promoting the healing of diabetic foot ulcers and preventing amputations was performed.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify RCTs in patients with diabetic foot ulcers published up to August 2013. Eligible studies reported the effectiveness of adjunctive HBOT with regard to wound healing, amputations, and additional interventions.

Results

Seven of the 669 identified articles met the inclusion criteria, comprising 376 patients. Three trials included 182 patients with ischaemic ulcers, two trials studied 64 patients with non-ischaemic ulcers, and two trials comprising 130 patients did not specify ulcer type. Two trials were of good methodological quality. Pooling of data was deemed inappropriate because of heterogeneity. Two RCTs in patients with ischaemic ulcers found increased rates of complete healing at 1-year follow-up (number needed to treat (NNT) 1.8 (95% CI: 1.1 to 4.6) and 4.1 (95% CI: 2.3 to 19)), but found no difference in amputation rates. A third trial in ischaemic ulcers found significantly lower major amputation rates in patients with HBOT (NNT 4.2, 95% CI: 2.4 to 17), but did not report on wound healing. None of the RCTs in non-ischaemic ulcers reported differences in wound healing or amputation rates. Two trials with unknown ulcer types reported beneficial effects on amputation rates, although the largest trial used a different definition for both outcomes. HBOT did not influence the need for additional interventions.

Conclusion

Current evidence shows some evidence of the effectiveness of HBOT in improving the healing of diabetic leg ulcers in patients with concomitant ischaemia. Larger trials of higher quality are needed before implementation of HBOT in routine clinical practice in patients with diabetic foot ulcers can be justified.

### Surgical treatment of diabetic foot ulcers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China [^e2f2accb]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers are among the most serious complications of diabetes. If left untreated, these ulcers can lead to severe infection and gangrene; in some instances, they may result in death. Thus, timely treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is extremely important. However, timely patient treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly challenging, because of the higher volume of patients and the need to ensure safety of medical personnel. This article describes a proposed strategy for diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, based on experiences with infection and control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.

### Prevention and management of foot problems in diabetes: a summary guidance for daily practice 2015, based on the IWGDF guidance documents [^41d358fa]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

In this 'Summary Guidance for Daily Practice', we describe the basic principles of prevention and management of foot problems in persons with diabetes. This summary is based on the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) Guidance 2015. There are five key elements that underpin prevention of foot problems: (1) identification of the at-risk foot; (2) regular inspection and examination of the at-risk foot; (3) education of patient, family and healthcare providers; (4) routine wearing of appropriate footwear; and (5) treatment of pre-ulcerative signs. Healthcare providers should follow a standardized and consistent strategy for evaluating a foot wound, as this will guide further evaluation and therapy. The following items must be addressed: type, cause, site and depth, and signs of infection. There are seven key elements that underpin ulcer treatment: (1) relief of pressure and protection of the ulcer; (2) restoration of skin perfusion; (3) treatment of infection; (4) metabolic control and treatment of co-morbidity; (5) local wound care; (6) education for patient and relatives; and (7) prevention of recurrence. Finally, successful efforts to prevent and manage foot problems in diabetes depend upon a well-organized team, using a holistic approach in which the ulcer is seen as a sign of multi-organ disease, and integrating the various disciplines involved.

### Management of diabetic foot ulcers [^ddfcaa81]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment

The gold standard for diabetic foot ulcer treatment includes debridement of the wound, management of any infection, revascularization procedures when indicated, and off-loading of the ulcer. Other methods have also been suggested to be beneficial as add-on therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, use of advanced wound care products, and negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT). However, data so far have not provided adequate evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these add-on treatment methods.

### Local management for diabetic foot ulcers: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6c1f194c]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), defined as the rupture of the epidermis and at least part of the dermis in individuals with diabetes, are a common and highly morbid complication of longstanding and poorly managed diabetes. The underlying mechanisms of DFU formation are not completely understood and may involve ischemia and loss of sensation. According to an epidemiological survey, 19% to 34% of patients with diabetes suffer from DFU in their lifetime. Of these patients, approximately 20% require lower-extremity amputation, and 10% die within 1 year after the initial DFU diagnosis. In addition, the 5-year survival rate of patients diagnosed with DFU is only 50% to 60%, which is worse than that of most common cancers. – Moreover, DFU has been identified as an independent risk factor for mortality, even after 10 years. Moreover, DFU has a recurrence rate of ~40%, 60%, and 65% within 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, after ulcer healing, although the recurrence rates varied widely and had decreased recently. The occurrence of DFU not only damages normal physiological functions and reduces quality of life but also imposes a heavy socioeconomic burden, and the health care service cost for DFU is marked. Every year, the direct cost of treating DFUs in the USA is ~$9 to 13 billion. In the UK, over £1 billion ($1.32 billion) is spent on the management of DFUs annually, which accounts for almost 1% of the National Health Service budget.

Despite considerable advances over the past few decades, the management of DFU remains a marked challenge for clinicians. To date, multiple strategies have been applied to treat DFU, including but not limited to standard of care (SOC), local drug therapy (LDT), natural dressing (ND), synthetic dressing, vacuum sealing drainage (VSD), oxygen therapy (OT), energy-based therapy (EBT), autogenous graft (AG), off-loading (OL), and different combinations of SOC and other treatments. However, an optimal treatment strategy for DFU remains controversial.– In Addition, due to the large number of treatment options for DFU, meta-analyses have focused on only 1 or 2 treatment methods and have not conducted comprehensive and systematic analyses and comparisons of all interventions. This hampered the identification of the optimal approach for treating DFU and outlining the efficacy schema after treatment.

### Efficacy of topical wound oxygen therapy in healing chronic diabetic foot ulcers: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e83688f2]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PROBLEM ADDRESSED

Chronic diabetic foot ulcers are an unfortunate but common complication of diabetes. While consistent SOC can heal many DFUs given enough time, a substantial proportion of these wound types are stuck in the inflammatory phase of wound healing and need an adjunctive treatment to address the issue(s) so that the wound can transition to the proliferative phase. While a variety of treatments have demonstrated efficacy in this regard, many are expensive, and some are not available to all patients. Given that TOT is a possible adjunctive therapy for DFUs, we decided to formally assess the RCTs conducted to date using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), including meta-analysis, to determine if this mode of therapy can be recommended.

### Effect of a novel macrophage-regulating drug on wound healing in patients with diabetic foot ulcers: a randomized clinical trial [^da3c6307]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 80% of lower limb amputations are preceded by chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), resulting in a heavy burden of medical care and expenditure. The current treatment for DFUs in clinical practice focuses primarily on local wound care, including debridement, off-loading, infection control, and maintaining a moist environment with dressings, whereas adjunctive therapies such as the use of growth factors, tissue engineering products, hyperbaric oxygen, and negative pressure wound therapies are applied if the DFUs worsen. Although current treatments featuring tissue repair or the use of anti-inflammatory agents might help in closing or controlling the progression of DFUs, most of these treatments are not well supported by clinical evidence or are not recommended for routine care by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot. In addition, the annual increase in amputations also suggests that treatment improvement is needed. Diabetic foot ulcers are pathologically complex mostly because the ulceration is undermined by the existence of multiple risk factors, such as poor patient adherence to treatment, severity of the ulcer, ulcer location and duration, vascular condition, control of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) levels, smoking habits, and kidney dysfunction. These factors impose a significant clinical need for novel and effective interventions to tackle this life-debilitating and life-threatening disease.

Diabetes-Related Foot Disease

Diabetes-related foot disease is defined as a "disease of the foot of a person with current or previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus that includes one or more of the following: peripheral neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, infection, ulcer(s), neuro-osteoarthropathy, gangrene, or amputation". It is a common, complex, and costly complication of diabetes: common because 199 million people are affected with diabetes-related foot disease according to estimates of the Global Burden of Disease study; complex because the treatment requires coordinated treatment efforts from multiple healthcare professionals within different fields of knowledge (see Table 2 in), and treatment may take several months to over a year taking a great toll on the people's life expectancy and quality of life; costly because when ranking the burden for individuals with diseases, diabetes-related foot disease ranks as the 11th largest condition of global disability burden. It ranks higher than, for example, dementia, ischaemic heart disease or breast cancer; it is costly because of the treatment costs required, with one ulcer episode costing on average 10,000 euros.

Conditions for the successful management of such a common, complex and costly disease, especially with the multiple disciplines involved, include a shared knowledge base and language, a shared sense of urgency and aims, and a systematic multifactorial team approach. It was with these conditions for the management of diabetes-related foot disease in mind that the IWGDF was founded in 1996. Even now, the mission of the IWGDF is still to produce evidence-based guidelines to inform health care providers worldwide on strategies for the prevention and management of diabetes-related foot disease; thus, the IWGDF aims to reduce the high patient and societal burden of diabetes-related foot disease.

### Diabetic foot ulcer microbiome: one small step for molecular microbiology… One giant leap for understanding diabetic foot ulcers? [^ba99fab2]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Foot infections in individuals with diabetes are a major cause of morbidity, constituting the most common reason for both diabetes-related hospitalization and lower extremity amputations. Optimal treatment of these diabetic foot infections requires recognizing which foot ulcers are infected and prescribing pathogen-appropriate antibiotic therapy. Most experts concur that diagnosing infection should be based on the presence of primary or secondary clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation, but the frequent presence of peripheral neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease may confound the diagnosis. Thus, some favor using bacterial density in wound cultures to help diagnose infection. This concept is based on the belief that a high wound "bioburden" leads to "critical colonization", an intermediary state on the way to overt infection that may be responsible for delayed wound healing and that may respond to antimicrobial therapy. Certainly, treatment of clinically overt diabetic foot infection requires appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy, which is best guided by identifying the causative pathogens.

### Lower extremity bypass in patients with diabetic foot ulcers [^7120edea]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The assessment and management of ischemia for the diabetic patient must be a part of an evidence-based treatment algorithm for wound healing. In 1999, the American Diabetes Association published a consensus position to provide guidance to health care professionals who manage foot wounds in patients with diabetes. The consensus panel recognized six approaches that are supported by clinical trials or well-established principles of wound healing: off-loading, debridement, dressings, antibiotics, vascular reconstruction, and amputation or reconstructive foot surgery when necessary. Adjunctive medical therapies include normalization of blood glucose, treatment of comorbid conditions, control of edema, nutritional repletion, and physical and emotional therapy. Education and prevention of recurrence are essential in any treatment algorithm. Box 1 and Box 2 are algorithms developed by the author and used in clinical management of diabetic lower extremity wounds. The author's multidisciplinary team approach is evidenced based with documented healing and a reduction in amputation at every level. For the patient, it best allows a return to function and well-being. Focusing on quality maximizes the cost/benefit ratio.

### Causes, prevention, and management of diabetes-related foot ulcers [^8043c78a]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

In this Review, we aim to complement the 2023 update of the guidelines of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot. We highlight the complexity of the pathological processes that underlie diabetes-related foot ulceration (DFU) and draw attention to the potential implications for clinical management and outcome. Variation observed in the incidence and outcome of DFUs in different communities might result from differences in study populations and the accessibility of care. Comparing differences in incidence, management, and outcome of DFUs in different communities is an essential component of the quality of disease care. Additionally, these comparisons can also highlight the relationship between DFU incidence, management, and outcome and the structure of local clinical services and the availability of staff with the necessary skills. The clinical outcome is, however, also dependent on the availability of multidisciplinary care and the ability of people with DFUs to gain access to that care.

### Efficacy of topical wound oxygen therapy in healing chronic diabetic foot ulcers: systematic review and meta-analysis [^0dbf001e]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

However, what really matters is the difference between the treatment groups in regard to healing rates rather than absolute values. SOC can also be insufficiently detailed in the study publication, which is a reporting issue; for example, only two of the trials described debridement, and offloading details were missing in one trial. This can lead to uncertainty in regard to study assessment, particularly for assessors not familiar with the trials. Third, our recommendations are limited to Wagner grade 1 or 2 DFUs: none of the clinical trials included more severe ulcers. Similarly, the trials primarily treated chronic uninfected ulcers with adequate perfusion. Therefore, the conclusions do not extend to infected or ischemic ulcers. Last, our recommendations are based on only four RCTs; more well-conducted trials would be likely to strengthen or amend our conclusions.

In conclusion, this systemic review and meta-analysis supports the use of TOT as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Wagner 1 and 2 DFUs that have not responded to preliminary treatment with optimal SOC alone.

### Counterpoint: hyperbaric oxygen for diabetic foot wounds is not effective [^e8fd7139]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot ulceration is common, affecting 1.0%-4.1% of diabetic persons per year and up to 25% in a lifetime. Diabetic foot ulcers are multifactorial in origin, and many are slow to heal and/or are complicated by infection, frequently leading to amputation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been suggested for numerous indications, and it is recognized by funding agencies for a smaller number including diabetic foot wounds.

Methods

I reviewed the literature about the history and practice of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and key issues relevant to efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness.

Results

Although recognized for reimbursement by Medicare and major insurers, the evidence base for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for diabetic foot care remains weak. A systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may have value in treating diabetic wounds, but the studies reviewed all had methodological weaknesses, and the positive effect of treatment was not seen in the single reviewed randomized trial to include a sham treatment arm. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy consumes very substantial resources — and has the potential to consume far more — that could be better spent on other aspects of management or prevention of diabetic foot ulceration.

Conclusions

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy should not be offered for diabetic foot wounds until large-scale, adequately blinded, controlled, and powered randomized studies have clearly demonstrated efficacy and cost effectiveness in the healing of ulcers and the prevention of major amputation.

### Identifying pyroptosis-related genes as novel therapeutic targets in diabetic foot ulceration [^fc5407c6]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Data show that there are approximately 463 million individuals with diabetes globally, and the number of patients will increase to 700 million by 2045. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most debilitating complications for diabetic patients; they are the leading cause of nontraumatic lower limb amputations and significantly impact the physical and mental health of approximately 15–25% of the diabetic population. Diabetic wound healing is somewhat similar to normal wound healing; however, the hyperglycemic state in diabetic patients can lead to weakened local immune responses, reduced blood flow, and diminished cellular responsiveness, resulting in delayed wound healing. The 2023 IWGDF (International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot) guidelines present updated strategies for managing diabetic wound healing (DWH), emphasizing a multidisciplinary team approach to develop personalized treatment plans. Conventional treatment methods include optimal blood glucose control, infection management, and surgical debridement. Novel therapies may encompass stem cell-based treatments, growth factor injections, ultrasound therapy, and negative pressure wound therapy, among others, with the aim of accelerating the wound healing process. However, a subset of patients in clinical practice still does not achieve satisfactory outcomes, necessitating amputation to prevent the spread of infection. This highlights the critical requirement for the identification of novel therapeutic avenues to effectively cure diabetic foot ulcers and reduce the associated amputation rates.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^bac40a02]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for diabetic foot, more specifically with respect to other therapies, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering adjunctive treatment with RCT-proven advanced agents (such as negative pressure wound therapy, placental membranes, bioengineered skin substitutes, several acellular matrices, autologous fibrin and leukocyte platelet patches, and topical oxygen therapy) in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers failed to heal with optimal standard care alone.

### Debridement of diabetic foot ulcers: public health and clinical implications-a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression [^6ec5bf76]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

Patients, healthcare providers, policy makers, and all other stakeholders are cautious in altering clinical practice on the basis of findings derived from small trials of unclear or high risk of bias, including non-randomized studies or weakly designed randomized studies.

Stakeholders are careful not to extrapolate findings from DFUs to other wound types, although diabetic wounds are considered among the most recalcitrant of wounds. Findings related to these resistant wound types may be applicable to researchers studying wounds other than DFUs. The findings in the review of the literature on SRs conducted on similar research questions supported the need to design and conduct a comprehensive SR that uses all available human experimental evidence from all RCTs, including those RCTs in the 10 SRs reported previously. This may assist diverse stakeholders in making important clinical, public health, and policy decisions.

Implications for practice

This comprehensive SR of all available human experimental evidence in RCTs supports the conclusion that no specific debridement method used in DFU appears to increase healing rates as compared with other debridement methods. This includes the control using moistened gauze and standard practice. The included studies evaluated debridement interventions on participants with a wide variation in grade/stage of DFUs. It was unclear whether disease severity and comorbidities in the RCTs were balanced between interventional treatment arms. This was apparent in smaller studies despite the use of randomization to balance for confounding.

Practitioners may choose to consider other characteristics such as individualization of therapy, patient tolerability, indications/contraindications, and cost when choosing between alternative methods of debridement. These challenges can be appreciated since uncertainty exists around this treatment decision based on the quality of data available to inform clinical decision making.

### Effectiveness of interventions to enhance healing of chronic foot ulcers in diabetes: a systematic review [^085afa01]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) remains a challenge, and there is continuing uncertainty concerning optimal approaches to wound healing. The International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) working group on wound healing has previously published systematic reviews of the evidence in 2008, 2012 and 2016 to inform protocols for routine care and to highlight areas which should be considered for further study. The working group has now updated this review by considering papers on the interventions to improve the healing of DFU's published between June 2014 and August 2018. Methodological quality of selected studies was independently assessed by a minimum of two reviewers using the recently published 21-point questionnaire as recommended by IWGDF/European Wound Management Association, as well as the previously incorporated Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. Of the 2275 papers identified, 97 were finally selected for grading following full text review. Overall, there has been an improvement in study design and a significant rise in the number of published studies. While previous systematic reviews did not find any evidence to justify the use of newer therapies, except for negative pressure wound therapy in post-surgical wounds, in this review we found additional evidence to support some interventions including a sucrose-octasulfate dressing, the combined leucocyte, fibrin and platelet patch as well as topical application of some placental membrane products, all when used in addition to usual best care. Nonetheless, the assessment and comparison of published trials remains difficult with marked clinical heterogeneity between studies: in patient selection, study duration, standard of usual care provision and the timing and description of the clinical endpoints.

### Diabetic foot disease: "The times they are A changin' " [^22593060]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

There are fewer studies of prevention of foot ulcers than of their treatment, but a recent meta‐analysis provides data on determining which patients are at highest risk. 17 The 2019 prevention guideline offers an updated risk stratification scheme to help tailor prevention to the individual patient, 18 but to improve outcomes we need further precision to get the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. 19 This is particularly true after a patient heals a foot ulcer, as 40% of foot ulcers may recur in 12 months. 2 Technological advances in patient monitoring for early recognition of foot problems, in tracking physical activity and better understanding its role in ulcer development, and in design of therapeutic footwear hold promise in helping to relieve the burden of disease in high‐risk patients. 20, 21, 22

Other achievements demonstrate that research and guidelines on diabetic foot disease are now drawing the attention they deserve. Highly ranked journals have published‐quality studies over the last 2 years. 13, 14 Of the papers in the previous special issue on the diabetic foot in DMRR in 2016 (Volume 32, Suppl. 1), seven ranked in the top 10 of most cited papers for this journal in that year. We now have a multidisciplinary guideline on how to conduct and assess research in this field, based on a 21‐item checklist that can help to improve the quality of future research. 23 We have continued to improve the methodological approach to writing the IWGDF guidelines, which may act as an example for guideline development in other fields. 24 Finally, the IWGDF guidelines have a unique platform for presentation at the International Symposium on the Diabetic Foot. This four‐day global conference held once every 4 years is often called the "Olympic games" of the diabetic foot, attracting 1500 professionals from 100 different countries.

We hope this short discussion illustrates the enormous progress made and the increased exposure and awareness for this important complication of diabetes. While Cinderella has made it to the ball (Figure 1), we know that "the present now will later be past", 4 and call for continued efforts to expand our knowledge even further. The newly acquired knowledge should be implemented in daily practice to further reduce the patient and societal burden of diabetic foot disease and we are already at work on the 2023 IWGDF guidelines!

### Tissue engineering-based strategies for diabetic foot ulcer management [^cfb0d7a4]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a mounting problem with the increasingly frail population. Injuries that would otherwise heal are kept open by risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, and age-related conditions, which interferes with the natural wound healing processes. Recent Advances: This review summarizes recent advancements in the field of tissue engineering for the treatment of DFUs. FDA-approved approaches, including signaling-based therapies, stem cell therapies, and skin substitutes are summarized and cutting-edge experimental technologies that have the potential to manage chronic wounds, such as skin printing, skin organogenesis, skin self-assembly, and prevascularization, are discussed. Critical Issues: The standard of care for chronic wounds involves wound debridement, wound dressings, and resolving the underlying cause such as lowering the glycemic index and reducing wound pressure. Current DFU treatments are limited by low wound closure rates and poor regrown skin quality. New adjuvant therapies that facilitate wound closure in place of or in conjunction with standard care are critically needed. Future Directions: Tissue engineering strategies are limited by the plasticity of adult human cells. In addition to traditional techniques, genetic modification, although currently an emerging technology, has the potential to unlock human regeneration and can be incorporated in future therapeutics.

### Cost-effectiveness of guideline-based care provision for patients with diabetes-related foot ulcers: a modelled analysis using discrete event simulation [^e42df124]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Foot disease contributes to ~60% of the global diabetes disability burden, ~33% of the total diabetes healthcare costs, and is increasingly considered a leading cause of global disease and healthcare cost burdens. Diabetes‐related foot disease, which includes foot ulcers and infections, is caused by the underlying diabetes complications of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease. Diabetes‐related foot ulcers (DFUs) typically take months to heal and result in lower quality of life and higher risks of hospitalisation, amputation and mortality.

Care for people with DFU remains a major clinical challenge. The most recent global evidence‐based guidelines from the International Working Group on Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) recommend adhering to several core principles of DFU care, including regular DFU assessment, sharp debridement, wound dressings, infection treatment, pressure offloading and foot care education. However, adherence to these recommendations in real‐world clinical practice has been reported to be suboptimal and ranges between 20% and 52% in European and US studies. Various reasons have been attributed to this suboptimal DFU care, including attitudes of health professionals, lack of incentives for health providers to change behaviour and challenges with patient adherence.

Evaluation of the cost and health benefits of increasing the provision of guideline‐based care to patients with DFU has been consistently recommended by global IWGDF guidelines, and most recently voted the top national priority research question among diabetes‐related foot disease patients, health professionals, research and industry stakeholders in Australia. A recent systematic review on the cost‐effectiveness of guideline‐based diabetes care found evidence to suggest that guideline‐based DFU care can reduce costs and increases health benefits compared with existing clinical practice. However, the review concluded that most studies to date were based on data from older clinical trials, retrospective cohorts of expert opinion and future economic studies that utilise more recent data from real‐world cohorts were needed.

This study aims to estimate the costs and quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) associated with complete adherence to guideline‐based care, compared with current practice, to understand the current impact of unwarranted variation away from guideline‐based care. Our secondary aim was to estimate the costs and QALYs associated with increasing increments in the proportion of patients receiving guideline‐based care compared with current practice, to understand the likely cost‐effectiveness of greater levels of adherence to guideline‐based care than current practice.

### Present and new techniques and devices in the treatment of DFU: a critical review of evidence [^bb8d810f]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Management of foot ulcer in individuals with diabetes remains a major therapeutic challenge throughout the world. We performed a critical review of evidence of present and new techniques and devices in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer. The golden standard for optimal evidence in the Cochrane system is level I - randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses of several randomized controlled trials. Available evidence on different types of wound debridement; use of antimicrobials; use of dressings in wounds; topical negative pressure, hyperbaric oxygen treatment; electrical, electromagnetic, laser, shockwave, and ultrasound therapies; growth and cell biology factors; cell products and tissue engineering; bioengineered skin and skin grafts; and adjuvant therapies were evaluated. The results of this review show that there is limited evidence on the highest level to justify a change in routine clinical practice. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence, because the studies are often based on inadequate sample size, short follow-up, nonrandom allocation to treatment arms, nonblinded assessment of outcomes, poor description of control, and concurrent intervention. The heterogeneity of the population (of both people and ulcers), with multiple factors contributing to both ulcer onset and failure to heal, makes the trial design difficult in this field. Another fundamental reason for the lack of evidence is the general use of the outcome measure 'complete healing'. In conclusion, when the results of this updated review are taken together with those of the earlier reports, they provide limited evidence to justify a change in routine clinical practice. For this reason, there is an urgent need to increase the quality of clinical studies. A re-evaluation of which type of research is acceptable for producing evidence in the wound area may be important in the future.

### The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot: stories and numbers behind three decades of evidence-based guidelines for the management of diabetes-related foot disease [^5a465b4c]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Foot disease is a devastating complication of diabetes. For almost 3 decades, the mission of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) is to produce evidence-based guidelines to inform health care providers worldwide on strategies for the prevention and management of diabetes-related foot disease. In this publication, we aim to better inform the reader about 'the story behind' the IWGDF Guidelines and thus facilitate improved uptake of the recommendations described in the guidelines. The first IWGDF Guidelines were published in 1999, and these have been successfully updated every 4 years since. With each update, IWGDF has improved the methodological rigour and extended the topics covered. This has been possible thanks to the involvement of > 100 experts from > 60 countries, all voluntarily dedicating their time. We estimate that the 2023 update of the IWGDF Guidelines required a total 10 years of full-time work, which would have cost 2 million euros if the voluntary work had been financially compensated. The IWGDF Guidelines are not only published in English but also translated to support local implementation. Currently available translations serve 2.9 billion people globally in their native language. As an independent and multidisciplinary organisation, IWGDF hopes that the 2023 update will continue to stimulate clinicians from all different disciplines to deliver the best care possible for these patients, will motivate researchers to undertake the high-quality trials needed to deliver the new evidence to advance the field further, and collectively will support people with diabetes-related foot disease to minimize their disease burdens.

### Diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial disease in diabetic patients with a foot ulcer. A progress report of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot [^912f233b]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWDGF) has produced in 2011 a guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial disease in patients with diabetes and a foot ulcer. This document, together with a systematic review that provided the background information on management, was produced by a multidisciplinary working group of experts in the field and was endorsed by the IWDGF. This progress report is based on these two documents and earlier consensus texts of the IWDGF on the diagnosis and management of diabetic foot ulcers. Its aim is to give the clinician clear guidance on when and how to diagnose peripheral arterial disease in patients with diabetes and a foot ulcer and when and which treatment modalities should be considered, taking both risks and benefits into account.

### Treatment of diabetic ulcers [^e3ce26c9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetic ulcers are chronic wounds that are the result of repetitive trauma in the insensate foot. The presence of infection and peripheral vascular disease makes the treatment of these wounds demanding and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The main principles of the management include adherence to the principles of good wound care, such as aggressive debridement of all non-viable tissue, adequate off-loading of pressure, prompt treatment of infection and moist wound dressings. Over the last decade, new therapeutic modalities, including growth factors and living skin equivalents, have been available to the practicing physicians. Judicious use of advanced wound care products may provide the best means of treating these challenging wounds in an efficient and cost-effective way.

### Treatment options for diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^5d050df4]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot ulcers are a common problem and result in more than 85,000 lower extremity amputations each year in the United States. Studies have suggested that between 25% and 50% of costs related to inpatient diabetes care may be directly attributable to the diabetic foot. Novel treatments for these wounds, while expensive, have been reported to improve healing rates, although no formal cost effectiveness analyses have been performed in order to address the cost effectiveness of a given therapy.

Objective

To estimate the cost effectiveness of common treatment strategies for diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers.

Methods

Four main options are available for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers: (1) standard care (SC), (2) standard treatment in a specialized wound care center (WCC), (3) treatment with becaplermin, (4) or treatment with platelet releasate (PR). We utilized effectiveness data from published clinical trials, meta-analyses, and a database that includes data on 26,599 patients with these wounds. Effectiveness was assessed as a percentage of ulcers healed at 20 and 32 weeks.

Results

Baseline effectiveness (with 95% confidence intervals) for SC, becaplermin, PR, and WCC care were 30.9% (26.6, 35.1), 43.0% (37.3, 48.7), 36.8% (35.4, 38.2), and 35.6% (34.8, 36.4), respectively. Cost:effectiveness ratios for PR versus SC and becaplermin versus SC were 414.40 and 36.59, respectively. Therefore the incremental cost of increasing the odds of healing by 1% over standard therapy was $414.40 for PR and $36.59 for becaplermin.

Conclusions

PR, becaplermin, and WCC care all provided improved healing rates over standard care, and becaplermin was less expensive and more effective than PR after 20 weeks of care.

### Society for Vascular Surgery releases guideline on managing the… [^8e5b176c]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

- Patients with diabetic foot ulcers and concomitant peripheral arterial disease should be referred to a vascular subspecialist to be assessed for revascularization. From the AFP Editors. WEAKER RECOMMENDATIONS Custom therapeutic footwear is not recommended for average-risk patients. To lower the risk of diabetic foot ulcers, glycemic control should be maintained, with strategies to minimize hypoglycemia. Offloading for Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers STRONGER RECOMMENDATIONS A total contact cast or irremovable fixed ankle walking boot should be used for offloading in patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcers. In patients with nonplantar wounds, any modality that relieves pressure at the ulcer site can be used, such as a surgical sandal or heel relief shoe.

To prevent recurrence after a healed diabetic foot ulcer in high-risk patients, those with a history of diabetic foot ulcer, partial foot amputation, or Charcot foot, therapeutic footwear with pressure-relieving insoles is recommended. WEAKER RECOMMENDATIONS If frequent dressing changes are required, a removable cast walker can be used. Postoperative shoes and standard or customary footwear should not be used for offloading plantar ulcers. Wound Care for Diabetic Foot Ulcers STRONGER RECOMMENDATIONS Diabetic foot ulcers should be evaluated every one to four weeks, with measurement of wound size to assess healing progress. The patient should be evaluated for infection at presentation, with sharp debridement of devitalized tissue and surrounding callus material. Additionally, urgent surgical intervention for infections involving abscess, gas, or necrotizing fasciitis should be pursued.

Dressing products should be used that maintain a moist wound bed, control exudate, and avoid maceration of intact skin. Treatment should follow current Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Diabetic Foot Ulcer and Peripheral Arterial Disease STRONGER RECOMMENDATIONS In patients with diabetic foot ulcers, pedal perfusion should be assessed annually using ankle-brachial index measurement, ankle and pedal Doppler arterial waveforms, and toe systolic pressure or transcutaneous oxygen pressure. In concomitant peripheral arterial disease, revascularization with surgical bypass or endovascular therapy should be performed.

### Management of diabetic foot problems [^d42b16ca]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot problems and their complications are a medical and economic challenge to the health care system and require an aggressive multidisciplinary approach to achieve limb salvage. The goals of this review article are to delve into this comprehensive topic and summarize key points regarding diabetic foot problems from the perspective of the vascular specialist treating these patients.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was searched to identify articles on this topic.

Results

We found 112 relevant articles. These were used to provide current data on (1) the pathogenesis leading to diabetic foot lesions (ie, the etiologic triad of ischemia, neuropathy, and infection), (2) the clinical presentation of these foot lesions and their systemic manifestations, (3) the optimal methods of diagnostic evaluation, including noninvasive testing and arteriography, (4) treatment selection guidelines to help delineate which patients require revascularization, and (5) medical and interventional treatments, including prevention strategies, wound healing strategies, use of antibiotics, and endovascular and open surgical options for revascularization.

Conclusions

The data presented in this review article allow vascular clinicians to optimize patient care and achieve effective limb salvage for this growing segment of the population.

### The effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy as a novel management of diabetic foot ulcers: an overview of systematic reviews [^0c2c03c9]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one the serious disabling conditions in patients with diabetes. Several approaches are available to manage DFU including Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT). The objective of this overview is systematically reviewing the related reviews about the effectiveness, safety, and cost benefits of NPWT interventions.

Methods

In October 2018, electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Scopous, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Google scholar were searched for systematic reviews about the NPWT's effectiveness and safety in DFUs. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2) checklist was used for the appraisal of the systematic reviews. According to this checklist the studies were categorized as high, moderate, low and critically low quality.

Results

The electronic searches yielded 6889 studies. After excluding duplicates and those not fellfield the inclusion criteria, 23 systematic reviews were considered. The sample size of the reviews ranged between 20 and 2800 patients published since 2004 to 2018. Twenty systematic reviews (86.95%) included only randomized clinical trials (RCT). Regarding the AMSTAR-2 checklist, 7 studies were assigned to high quality, 8 were categorized as low quality and 8 studies belonged to the critically low quality groups. Accordingly, three, two and one out of seven high quality studies approved the effectiveness, safety and cost benefit of the NPWT therapy, respectively. However, some of them declared that there is some flaws in RCTs designing.

Conclusion

This overview illustrated that either systematic reviews or the included RCTs had wide variety of quality and heterogeneity in order to provide high level of evidence. Hence, well-designed RCTs as well as meta-analysis are required to shade the light on different aspects of NPWT.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^a8d39fa5]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes and updates the 2015 IWGDF infection guideline. On the basis of patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICOs) developed by the infection committee, in conjunction with internal and external reviewers and consultants, and on systematic reviews the committee conducted on the diagnosis of infection (new) and treatment of infection (updated from 2015), we offer 27 recommendations. These cover various aspects of diagnosing soft tissue and bone infection, including the classification scheme for diagnosing infection and its severity. Of note, we have updated this scheme for the first time since we developed it 15years ago. We also review the microbiology of diabetic foot infections, including how to collect samples and to process them to identify causative pathogens. Finally, we discuss the approach to treating diabetic foot infections, including selecting appropriate empiric and definitive antimicrobial therapy for soft tissue and for bone infections, when and how to approach surgical treatment, and which adjunctive treatments we think are or are not useful for the infectious aspects of diabetic foot problems. For this version of the guideline, we also updated four tables and one figure from the 2016 guideline. We think that following the principles of diagnosing and treating diabetic foot infections outlined in this guideline can help clinicians to provide better care for these patients.

### The diabetic foot in 2015: an overview [^10ea4784]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

In 2015, it can be said that the diabetic foot is no longer the Cinderella of diabetic complications. Thirty years ago there was little evidence-based research taking place on the diabetic foot, and there were no international meetings addressing this topic. Since then, the biennial Malvern Diabetic Foot meetings started in 1986, the American Diabetes Association founded their Foot Council in 1987, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes established a Foot Study Group in 1998. The first International Symposium on the Diabetic Foot in The Netherlands was convened in 1991, and this was soon followed by the establishment of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot that has produced useful guidelines in several areas of investigation and the management of diabetic foot problems. There has been an exponential rise in publications on diabetic foot problems in high impact factor journals, and a comprehensive evidence-base now exists for many areas of treatment. Despite the extensive evidence available, it, unfortunately, remains difficult to demonstrate that most types of education are efficient in reducing the incidence of foot ulcers. However, there is evidence that education as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to diabetic foot ulceration plays a pivotal role in incidence reduction. With respect to treatment, strong evidence exists that offloading is the best modality for healing plantar neuropathic foot ulcers, and there is also evidence from two randomized controlled trials to support the use of negative-pressure wound therapy in complex post-surgical diabetic foot wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy exhibits the same evidence level and strength of recommendation. International guidelines exist on the management of infection in the diabetic foot. Many randomized trials have been performed, and these have shown that the agents studied generally produced comparable results, with the exception of one study in which tigecycline was shown to be clinically inferior to ertapenem ± vancomycin. Similarly, there are numerous types of wound dressings that might be used in treatment and which have shown efficacy, but no single type (or brand) has shown superiority over others. Peripheral artery disease is another major contributory factor in the development of ulceration, and its presence is a strong predictor of non-healing and amputation. Despite the proliferation of endovascular procedures in addition to open revascularization, many patients continue to suffer from severely impaired perfusion and exhaust all treatment options. Finally, the question of the true aetiopathogenesis of Charcot neuroarthropathy remains enigmatic, although much work is currently being undertaken in this area. In this area, it is most important to remember that a clinically uninfected, warm, insensate foot in a diabetic patient should be considered as a Charcot foot until proven otherwise, and, as such, treated with offloading, preferably in a cast.

### The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot: stories and numbers behind three decades of evidence-based guidelines for the management of diabetes-related foot disease [^51734cf2]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

This independence, and the guideline-writing by multidisciplinary working groups of dedicated and well-trained clinicians and clinical researchers who all work at the coalface of the disease, are key strengths of IWGDF. However, as also depicted in Fig. 2, the workload associated with this is a threat. All contributions are made voluntarily, and IWGDF is dependent on their working group members, especially the chairs and secretaries. With 30 years of history behind us, we hope that these members will continue to pursue our mission to reduce the high patient and society burden of diabetes-related foot disease with high-quality guidelines.

Future developments that are currently not completely clear to us and the wider medical community concern the position of 'static' guidelines. We do not know if the current guidelines, updated every 4 years, will still apply given the changes in health care systems and health care personnel globally. However, these changes also offer opportunities. As IWGDF, we have already showed with our 2023 update that we could adapt and move from guideline writing via one extensive face-to-face meeting to many online meetings. We are positive that we will continue to adapt to changing systems to produce meaningful and usable clinical guidelines.

In addition to clinical guidelines, IWGDF has also been shown to lead the scientific discussion. The systematic reviews underlying the IWGDF Guidelines have continuously shown the weaknesses in existing evidence, especially from a trial design perspective. Subsequently, we have defined in collaboration with the European Wound Management Association, the standards of reporting and required details when publishing results of intervention trials in diabetes-related foot disease. These are now increasingly used in RCTs, improving the quality of the evidence in our field. However, more work needs to be done to improve the quality of clinical research. The dedicated 'future research' sections in each guideline also drive the research agenda. These originate from the evaluation of all the available evidence by each working group, allowing the identification of our present knowledge and future research prioritizations. Third, we developed a set of definitions and criteria to ensure effective communication. The high uptake in research papers, as shown by > 150 citations within 4 years, shows that the field is actively using this document. Together, this results in high-quality evidence on the topics that are most important for daily clinical practice.

### Comment on IWGDF ulcer prevention guidelines [^b0ac3e8b]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes/Metabolism and Related Research has published the updated IWGDF 2019 Guidelines on the prevention of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes. This advisory includes as Recommendation #13, 'We suggest not to use a nerve decompression procedure, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care, to help prevent a foot ulcer in a person with diabetes who is at moderate or high risk of foot ulceration (IWGDF risk 2‐3) and who is experiencing neuropathic pain'. 1 This advice carries a Weak strength of recommendation based upon Low evidence quality. The very brief rationale offered for this guidance points to evidence supporting nerve decompression (ND) being from uncontrolled EBM Level 2 and 3 studies and notes non‐surgical 'standard of care' options being available. It is a repetition of similar 2015 guidance but lacks the previous call for more evidence.

We are struck by the inconsistency of this adverse advice with other guidelines, particularly the immediately preceding #11 and #12 recommendations addressing surgical tendon lengthening and flexor tenotomy procedures. Here, the expert panel authors present supportive opinions for tendon surgery despite an identical Weak/Low recommendation, again noting weakness of supporting evidence. Why the differing recommendation despite similar levels of evidence? No data are presented suggesting greater putative risk to ND compared to tendon procedures. And there is no specific call, as in the prior Guidelines, to seek further evidence of relative value of ND versus current standard treatments.

So how should this negative recommendation, to not use ND, be viewed? Is there evidence that ND carries increased risks of continued pain, repeat ulceration, sepsis, amputation or mortality? Are there published data that show the accepted standards of good quality car e show superior outcomes? Sadly, there is neither. While evidence for ND may not be of Level 1 EBM quality, the evidence against its use does not exist above the level of persistent sceptical opinion. 2, 3 Only with stronger science will such contradictory opinions be resolved.

### Off-loading the diabetic foot for ulcer prevention and healing [^9a551376]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Retrospective and prospective studies have shown that elevated plantar pressure is a causative factor in the development of many plantar ulcers in diabetic patients and that ulceration is often a precursor of lower extremity amputation. In this article, we review the evidence that relieving areas of elevated plantar pressure (off-loading) can prevent and heal plantar ulceration.

Results

There is no consensus in the literature concerning the role of off-loading through footwear in primary or secondary prevention of ulcers. This is likely due to the wide diversity of intervention and control conditions tested, the lack of information about off-loading efficacy of the footwear used, and the absence of a target pressure threshold for off-loading. Uncomplicated plantar ulcers should heal in 6 to 8 weeks with adequate off-loading. The total contact cast and other nonremovable devices are most effective because they eliminate the problem of nonadherence to recommendations for using a removable device. Conventional or standard therapeutic footwear is not effective in ulcer healing. Recent United States and European surveys show a large discrepancy between guidelines and clinical practice in off-loading diabetic foot ulcers. Many clinics continue to use methods that are known to be ineffective or have not been proven effective, while ignoring methods that have been demonstrated to be efficacious.

Conclusions

A number of strategies are proposed to address this situation, notably the adoption and implementation of recently established international guidelines, which are evidence-based and specific, by professional societies in the United States and Europe. Such an approach would change the often poor current expectations for healing diabetic plantar ulcers.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^566b4789]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot prevention and risk stratification — preventive foot care according to published guidelines can improve survival, reduce ulceration and amputation rates, is cost-effective, and can even save on long-term costs when compared with standard care. Risk stratification based on predisposing causal risk factors, including prior history of ulceration, serves as a guide to the frequency of foot care visits, and identifying high-risk patient and tailoring a total foot care prevention program can reduce incidences of ulceration and lower extremity amputations. Therapeutic shoes with pressure-relieving insoles and high toe boxes are important adjunctive treatments that can reduce the occurrence of ulceration and resultant amputation in high-risk patients, although two reports suggest that shoes in the absence of a comprehensive prevention program might not be sufficient to prevent new lesions. For deformities not accommodated by standard therapeutic footwear, patients should have custom shoes that provide appropriate fit, depth, and a rocker insole; if structural deformities still cannot be accommodated, prophylactic surgical correction should be considered, but patients must be carefully selected. Diabetic patients at risk for foot lesions must be educated about risk factors and the importance of foot care, including the need for self-inspection and surveillance, monitoring foot temperatures, appropriate daily foot hygiene, use of proper footwear, and good diabetes control.

### Standards for the development and methodology of the 2023 IWGDF guidelines [^861e92f6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Diabetes-related foot disease is a major source of patient burden and societal costs. Investing in evidence-based international guidelines on diabetes-related foot disease is important to reduce this burden and costs, provided the guidelines are focused on outcomes important to key stakeholders and are evidence-based and properly implemented.

Materials and Methods

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published and updated international guidelines since 1999. The 2023 updates were made using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework. This concerns formulating relevant clinical questions and important outcomes, conducting systematic reviews of the literature and meta-analyses where appropriate, completing summary of judgement tables, and writing recommendations that are specific, unambiguous and actionable, along with their transparent rationale.

Results

We herein describe the development of the 2023 IWGDF Guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetes-related foot disease, which consists of seven chapters, each prepared by a separate working group of international experts. These chapters provide guidelines related to diabetes-related foot disease on prevention; classification of diabetes-related foot ulcer, offloading, peripheral artery disease, infection, wound healing interventions, and active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy. Based on these seven guidelines, the IWGDF Editorial Board also produced a set of practical guidelines. Each guideline underwent extensive review by the members of the IWGDF Editorial Board as well as independent international experts in each field.

Conclusions

We believe that the adoption and implementation of the 2023 IWGDF guidelines by healthcare providers, public health agencies, and policymakers will improve the prevention and management of diabetes-related foot disease, and subsequently reduce the worldwide patient and societal burden caused by this disease.

### Footwear and insole design features for offloading the diabetic at risk foot – A systematic review and meta-analyses [^fab3244d]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

6 RECOMMENDATIONS

A consensus is required regarding how to report and measure the effectiveness of individual insole and footwear features in offloading the DPN foot. A core set of outcome measures and standardized time points would facilitate pooling of results in meta‐analyses to enable more accurate conclusions to be drawn. Standardization of inclusion criteria is further required to ensure all participants enrolled in offloading trials of DPN have DPN. This would also include participants with charcot and foot ulceration. Improved consistency in the reporting of methodology, in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines and International working group on the diabetic foot, is also recommended. 83

### Effectiveness and safety of dermal matrix used for diabetic foot ulcer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^93f53484]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) have become a global health concern, which can lead to diabetic foot infection (DFI), lower leg amputation, and even mortality. Though the standard of care (SOC) practices have been recognized as the "gold standard" for DFU care, SOC alone may not be adequate to heal all DFUs and prevent their recurrence. The use of dermal matrix has emerged as an adjuvant treatment to enhance DFU healing. The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dermal matrix application as an adjuvant treatment to the SOC.

Methods

The databases of PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL were independently searched by two authors, with the following key terms: "diabetic foot ulcer", "acellular dermal matrix", "wound healing", and so on. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dermal matrix in the treatment of DFUs were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes analyzed included time to complete healing and complete healing rate at the final follow-up, while secondary outcomes included wound area, ulcer recurrence rate, amputation risk and complication risk. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effect or fixed-effect models, based on the heterogeneity test.

Results

This study included a total of 15 RCTs with a total of 1524 subjects. Of these, 689 patients were treated with SOC alone, while 835 patients received SOC plus dermal matrix. Compared to the SOC group, significantly shorter time (MD = 2.84, 95%CI: 1.37~4.32, p < 0.001**) was required to achieve complete healing in dermal matrix group. Significantly higher complete healing rate (OR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.33~0.49, p < 0.001**) and lower overall (RR = 1.83, 95%CI: 1.15~2.93, p = 0.011*) and major (RR = 2.64, 95%CI: 1.30~5.36, p = 0.007) amputation risks were achieved in dermal matrix group compared to SOC group. No significant difference was found in the wound area, ulcer recurrence rate, and complication risk between the two groups.

Conclusions

The application of dermal matrix as an adjuvant therapy in conjunction with SOC effectively improved the healing process of DFUs and reduced the amputation risk when compared to SOC alone. Furthermore, dermal matrix application was well tolerated by the subjects with no added complication risk.
