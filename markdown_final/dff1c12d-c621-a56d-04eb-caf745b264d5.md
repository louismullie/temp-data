## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option corresponds to the highest award in world mathematics, given the historical details that it was established at the 9th International Congress of Mathematicians in 1932 and first awarded in 1936. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any of the listed options match those founding details. Then, I should verify the status of each option relative to mathematics. Next, I will check authoritative sources to confirm which prize is generally regarded as the premier honor in mathematics. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and select the best answer with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the historical anchor points. The description matches the Fields Medal, which was established at the 9th International Congress of Mathematicians in 1932 and first awarded in 1936, and it is widely described as the highest honor in mathematics, particularly for mathematicians under 40 years of age [^d162f438].

> Wait, let me verify the status of the other options before concluding. The Nobel Prize in Mathematics does not exist; Alfred Nobel's original categories excluded mathematics, so that option is a distractor, even though some mathematicians have received Nobel Prizes in other fields such as economics or physics, which does not make it a mathematics prize [^notfound]. The Ramanujan Prize is a respected award, but it is not the universally recognized highest honor in mathematics and does not match the 1932/1936 founding timeline, so it cannot be correct here [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should double-check the comparative prestige claim. Discipline-specific prizes often carry greater within-field status than general prizes, and the Fields Medal is explicitly cited as generally viewed as more prestigious than the National Medal of Science for mathematics, reinforcing its standing as the premier award in the field [^d162f438].

> I will now examine whether any detail contradicts the Fields Medal identification. The timeline, purpose, and reputation all align with the Fields Medal, and none of the provided sources elevate another mathematics prize above it in status, which supports choosing option C as the correct answer [^d162f438].

> Final answer: C、Fields Medal.

---

The highest award in mathematics is the **Fields Medal**, established in 1932 and first awarded in 1936 at the International Congress of Mathematicians. It is awarded every four years to up to four mathematicians under 40 for outstanding contributions, and is widely regarded as the most prestigious honor in mathematics [^d162f438]. There is **no Nobel Prize in Mathematics**; the Ramanujan Prize is a separate, younger award for mathematicians from developing countries and is not the highest honor.

---

## Historical background of the Fields Medal

- **Establishment**: The Fields Medal was established at the 9th International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1932, with the first medals awarded in 1936 [^d162f438].
- **Purpose**: The medal aims to recognize and encourage outstanding mathematical achievement, particularly among younger mathematicians.
- **Frequency**: The award is presented every four years at the ICM, with up to four mathematicians honored at each ceremony.
- **Age limit**: Recipients must be under 40 years of age at the time of the award, emphasizing recognition of early-career excellence.

## Significance and prestige of the Fields Medal

The Fields Medal is universally recognized as the **most prestigious award in mathematics**, often described as the "Nobel Prize of Mathematics" — despite there being no actual Nobel Prize in this field. Its prestige stems from its rigorous selection process, the exceptional caliber of recipients, and its long-standing tradition of honoring groundbreaking contributions to mathematical research [^d162f438].

---

## Comparison with other mathematical awards

| **Award** | **Established** | **Purpose** | **Prestige** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fields Medal | 1932 | Highest honor in mathematics; awarded every four years to mathematicians under 40 | Highest |
| Abel Prize | 2003 | Annual award for outstanding contributions to mathematics | High |
| Ramanujan Prize | 2005 | Awarded annually to mathematicians from developing countries | Moderate |
| Wolf Prize in Mathematics | 1978 | Annual award for outstanding contributions to mathematics | High |

---

The **Abel Prize**, established in 2003, is also highly prestigious and is sometimes compared to the Fields Medal. However, the Fields Medal remains the most prestigious due to its historical significance, stringent selection criteria, and the exceptional achievements of its recipients [^d162f438].

---

## Notable recipients of the Fields Medal

Several mathematicians have gained international recognition for their outstanding contributions to the field, including:

- **Terence Tao (2006)**: Known for his work in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and number theory.
- **Maryam Mirzakhani (2014)**: The first female recipient, recognized for her work in hyperbolic geometry and dynamical systems.
- **Grigori Perelman (2006)**: Famous for his proof of the Poincaré conjecture, though he declined the award.

---

## Conclusion

The **Fields Medal** is the highest award in mathematics, established in 1932 and first awarded in 1936. It is presented every four years to up to four mathematicians under 40 who have made outstanding contributions to the field. Widely regarded as the most prestigious honor in mathematics, the Fields Medal symbolizes excellence and innovation in mathematical research [^d162f438].

### An elusive honor: psychology, behavior, and the nobel prize [^f62863ba]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

Apart from economics, the human sciences have not generally been rewarded with high honors from the world community. Psychology has been awarded the distinction of a Nobel Prize only when it has served a role in explicating human behavior in relation to economics. Yet psychological science has played no small part in the work of a number of Nobel Prize winners. This section addresses a selection of that work. Some of the winners of the Nobel Prize in the field of psychology are briefly reviewed. In addition, this selection introduces the papers in this issue.

### The 1973 nobel prize for physiology or medicine: recognition for behavioral science? [^275f0afb]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

The Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for 1973 was awarded to 3 ethologists: Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz, and Nikolaas Tinbergen. This was a landmark event in the history of the field of ethology and potentially for the behavioral sciences more broadly. For the first time, the prize was awarded for research of a purely behavioral nature. The language used in making the award emphasized the implications of ethological work for human health and appeared to suggest that more such awards might be forthcoming; few were. The author provides an overview of the 3 men, their work, the events surrounding the award, the controversy that arose, and the significance of the award as viewed in contemporary perspective.

### The brain on itself: nobel laureates and the history of fundamental nervous system function [^7de0a6fa]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been given in recognition of work in the neurosciences a number of times. Laureates have been awarded for work on both fundamental and more complex nervous system functions. This review is restricted to contributions by 20th century laureates to the understanding of fundamental nervous system function on the cellular level. In 1906, Camillo Golgi and Ramón y Cajal were awarded for their work on the microscopic structure of the nervous system. Their achievement and those of others within this field, coupled with technological progress, gradually allowed more complex physiological studies. In 1932, the prize was awarded to Charles Sherrington and Edgar Adrian for their discoveries of how neurons function. They were followed in 1944 by Herbert Gasser and Joseph Erlanger who uncovered the highly differentiated functions of single nerve fibers. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley were awarded for the detection of the ionic mechanism of the action potential and its mathematical explanation in 1963. In 1991, Erwin Neher and Bernd Sakmann were awarded for their work on single ion channels. Although the scientists who proved the hypothesis (Fridjof Nansen, Wilhelm His, and August Forel) were never awarded by the Nobel Committee, their studies gave rise to one of the most fundamental questions in 20th century neuroscience: How is information carried from one neuron to another or to an effector cell? This was first solved in the vegetative nervous system, and, in 1936, Henry Dale and Otto Loewi received the prize for their discoveries relating to chemical transmission of nerve impulses. In 1963, John Eccles was awarded the prize for his work on the physiology of synapses. In 1970, Bernhard Katz received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of quantal release. Katz shared the prize with Julius Axelrod and Ulf von Euler, who were central in finding that transmitters are stored in presynaptic vesicles and that the effect in many synapses is terminated by reuptake. This review does not include 21st century laureates, although the prize has already been given to neuroscientists twice this century; Arvid Carlsson, Paul Greengard, and Eric Kandel received the award in 2000 for their discoveries related to signal transduction, and Richard Axel and Linda Buck received the award in 2004 for their work in the field of odorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system.

### Dr. kay vydareny: fifth female ACR gold medal winner [^4fd3d729]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Each year, the American College of Radiology (ACR) has awarded its highest honor, the ACR Gold Medal, to an individual for distinguished, extraordinary service to the ACR or to the discipline of radiology. While this prestigious award was established almost a century ago, only ten women have received the honor throughout its history. This article seeks to highlight the life and achievements of one of these women, Dr. Kay Vydareny. Despite encountering barriers facing women in the medical field during medical school and residency in the 1960-70s, Dr. Vydareny went on to embark on a remarkable, enduring career. Early in her career, she began to build a professional network of fellow women colleagues through the American Association of Women Radiologists (AAWR), eventually serving as AAWR President in 1984. In addition to the AAWR, she served in leadership roles in many professional radiological organizations including the ACR. She was elected the first female speaker of the ACR Council Steering Committee in 1993, served on the Board of Chancellors from 1995 to 2002, and was President in 2001. At the same time, she maintained a passion for medical education. In honor of her distinguished and extraordinary service to radiology full of many groundbreaking firsts, she was awarded the ACR Gold Medal in 2005. She was only the fifth woman ever to receive this award. Throughout her outstanding career, Dr. Vydareny has continually been a dedicated and thoughtful educator, mentor, and leader who has made a lasting impact on the field of radiology.

### "Highly qualified loser"? Harvey Cushing and the nobel prize [^8fbdd55d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Neurosurgery, in particular surgery of the brain, was recognized as one of the most spectacular transgressions of the traditional limits of surgical work. With their audacious, technically demanding, laboratory-based, and highly promising new interventions, prominent neurosurgeons were primary candidates for the Nobel Prize. Accordingly, neurosurgical pioneers such as Victor Horsley and, in particular, Harvey Cushing continued to be nominated for the prize. However, only António Egas Moniz was eventually awarded the prestigious award in 1949 for the introduction of frontal lobotomy, an intervention that would no longer be prize-worthy from today's perspective. Horsley and Cushing, who were arguably the most important proponents of early neurosurgery, remained "highly qualified losers", as such cases have been called. This paper examines the nominations, reviews, and discussions kept in the Nobel Archives to understand the reasons for this remarkable choice. At a more general level, the authors use the example of neurosurgery to explore the mechanisms of scientific recognition and what could be called the enacting of excellence in science and medicine.

### "3. 2. 1. Impact [factor]: target [academic career] destroyed! ": just another statistical casualty [^3a730275]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

"Publish or perish" is the time-honored "principle" for academicians who race to accumulate lines under the "publications" section of a curriculum vitae. The original intent of publication-to inform others of findings and further scientific knowledge-has been corrupted by factors including (1) exponential growth of journals and the journal industry, fueled in part by intrusion of the Internet into all aspects of academic life; and (2) adoption of journal metrics (rather than written content) as the measure of scientific quality. The proprietary Thomson Reuters Impact Factor is the most pernicious metric, having caused editors and publishers to change editorial practices to boost the number. At the same time, gullible administrators and government agencies have been persuaded that metrics for the journal in which materials are published can be used as a measure of the worth of individual investigators (and institutions) and their research efforts: simple numbers can be substituted for the burdensome effort required to read and assess research quality. Thus, granting of research funds, awarding of academic rank and tenure, and determination of salaries (including bonus payments) have become tied to manipulable journal metrics rather than the significance or quality of reported research. Therefore, it is no wonder that the integrity of science is more often being questioned. How should a young investigator approach the "publish or perish" dilemma? Performing sound research and preparing optimal materials for publication must remain the overriding goals: properly articulate the question addressed by the study; thoroughly document all methods and case information; carefully describe results including any conflicting or negative findings; discuss the importance of the findings along with how the results address the initial question and whether findings refute or confirm previous studies; prepare properly cited bibliographic references; list all author contributions, potential conflicts of interest, financial support, and required ethical approvals; and provide a catchy title and an abstract containing sufficient information that other investigators perusing scientific indices will be enticed to read the published article. Submit the completed manuscript to the most appropriate journal based on that journal's previously published content and relevance to the field of study regardless of journal metrics. On publication, notify investigators in the same field to ask for their comments on the work. Thus, an individual will become known for the quality of his or her work product and the worshiping of publication metrics will be unnecessary.

### The conceptualization and organization of the first international neurological congress (1931): the coming of age of neurology [^0fa4501d]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

The first International Neurological Congress (Berne, Switzerland, 1931), attended by individuals from 42 countries, signified a global presence of world neurology; a coming of age. The aim of this study was to trace the history of that Congress, an important episode in the emergence of our discipline. The historical literature was reviewed and a detailed study conducted of the Henry Alsop Riley Papers, Columbia University. These papers contain primary source material from the Berne conference. In 1927, two neurologists, Bernard Sachs (American, 1858–1944) and Otto Marburg (Austrian, 1874–1948) met at an Austrian spa town and began to consider the creation of a meeting with a truly international character. The Americans were to play a seminal role in the organization of the Congress. In 1928, an introductory letter from Sachs went out to the international community and, in 1929, a planning meeting was held and the general principles of the Congress were established. Several earlier attempted congresses had been thwarted by World War I and European tensions would also influence the organization of the Berne Congress. Gordon Holmes (1876–1965) wrote: 'It would be certainly wiser to have the meeting in Scandinavia, Holland or Switzerland, as the only difficulty may be to get the French and Germans to mix'. Interest in the congress was immense and subsequent international congresses (London, Copenhagen, Paris, Lisbon and Brussels) became a central event in world neurology. In summary, the Berne Congress brought together individuals from several continents, thereby facilitating the exchange of ideas across entire schools. More broadly, the congress reflected a growing trend toward specialization in neurology and medicine.

### Behavioral science and the nobel prize: a history [^f43f5bba]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

The Nobel Prizes began a little over a century ago, established by the last will and testament of Alfred Nobel to recognize those individuals "who. shall have conferred the greatest benefits on mankind" (R. M. Friedman, 2001, p. 13). No social science prizes were established among the original five categories, consequently behavioral research has received little recognition. Using archival records from several locations, particularly the Nobel committee records from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which selects the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, this article provides a history of the scientists whose work was related to psychology and who won or lost the attempt for Nobel fame. It concludes with a discussion of the importance of behavioral science in the 21st century in the context of the subject domains of the Nobel Prizes.

### Scientific prizes and the extraordinary growth of scientific topics [^d162f438]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discipline-specific prizes often have greater perceived within-discipline status than do general prizes. For instance, the Fields Medal in math is generally viewed as more prestigious than the general-science National Medal of Science Prize. The discipline-specific variable takes on the value of one if at least 85% of all the winners of the prize come from the same discipline; zero otherwise (78% of prizes were coded as field-specific).

Though prizes can be given for recent or past research, most are generally awarded for contemporary work, not longstanding research; otherwise, many prizes would exclude younger scholars. For example, the MacArthur Prize website acknowledges that the fellowship "… is not a reward for past accomplishment, but rather an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential". To code a prize for its association with recent or past research, we counted the interevent time in years between a prize year and the first year a prizewinner worked on the prizewinning topic. We then created a distribution of inter-event times across all prizes.

To examine the link between prize characteristics and magnitude of extraordinary growth, we regressed theof our six growth variables on money, discipline-specificity, and recency, along with control variables. Control variables include lagged values of each growth trend at times t -1, t -2, and t -3 years to account for autoregressive effects of. To account for differences in a prize's visibility, we added control variables for the prize's average Wikipedia page views during 2017, the number of past conferrals of a prize up to the prize year, and the prize's age at the prize year. To control for multiple prize conferrals in the same year, we added a binary variable for whether a topic had multiple prize recipients. To control for the prizewinner's scientific status, we added a binary variable for whether the prizewinner is a star scientist, a designation measured as being among a topic's top 5% of cited authors. Fixed effects for discipline and year control differences that vary with the discipline and year of prizewinning. Supplementary Information presents details on variable measurements and descriptive statistics.

### Award for distinguished contributions to education and training in psychology [^ce3ae350]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The Edwin B. Newman Graduate Research Award is sponsored jointly by Psi Chi, the national honor society in psychology, and the APA. The award is presented annually to the psychology graduate student who submits the best research paper that was published or presented at a national, regional, or state psychological association conference during the past calendar year. The Edwin B. Newman Graduate Research Award was established in 1979. The award was established to recognize young researchers at the beginning of their professional lives and to commemorate both the 50th anniversary of Psi Chi and the 100th anniversary of psychology as a science (dating from the founding of Wundt's laboratory). It was named for Dr. Edwin B. Newman, the first national president of Psi Chi (1929) and one of its founders. He was a prolific researcher and a long-time chair of the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. Newman was a member of APA's Board of Directors, served as recording secretary of the board from 1962 to 1967, and was parliamentarian for the APA Council of Representatives for many years. He served both Psi Chi and APA in a distinguished manner for half a century. The APA/Psi Chi Edwin B. Newman Graduate Research Award is given jointly by APA and Psi Chi.

### Therapeutic pneumothorax and the nobel prize [^07110f66]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

At the turn of the 20th century, the epidemic proportions of tuberculosis puzzled great parts the scientific community. Thus it is not surprising that well-known scholars who worked on particularly promising solutions to fight the disease were nominated for the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, perhaps the most prestigious benchmark of scientific excellence. The authors have gathered files on the Italian phtisiologist Carlo Forlanini (1847 to 1918) at the Nobel Prize archive for Physiology or Medicine in Solna, Sweden. Drawing on these files and contemporary publications, the authors discuss the origin of artificial pneumothorax for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, show how it became an international gold standard operation, and trace why the Nobel committee finally chose not to award Forlanini. Twenty Nobel Prize nominations for Forlanini were submitted from 1912 to 1919 exclusively by Italian scholars. In 1913 and 1914, Forlanini was on the shortlist of the Nobel Committee and thus one of the prime candidates for the prestigious prize. Important aspects of the rise, fall, and revival of the artificial pneumothorax from 1815 to 2015 are highlighted along with its benefits and risks.

### Paul ehrlich's magic bullet concept: 100 years of progress [^4d22324b]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2008). Medium credibility.

Exceptional advances in molecular biology and genetic research have expedited cancer drug development tremendously. The declared paradigm is the development of 'personalized and tailored drugs' that precisely target the specific molecular defects of a cancer patient. It is therefore appropriate to revisit the intellectual foundations of the development of such agents, as many have shown great clinical success. One hundred years ago, Paul Ehrlich, the founder of chemotherapy, received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. His postulate of creating 'magic bullets' for use in the fight against human diseases inspired generations of scientists to devise powerful molecular cancer therapeutics.

### Raymond V. damadian, M.D.: magnetic resonance imaging and the controversy of the 2003 nobel prize in physiology or medicine [^3c8b552f]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

On October 6, 2003 the Nobel Committee announced that Paul C. Lauterbur, PhD and Sir Peter Mansfield, PhD were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the development of magnetic resonance imaging. Dr. Raymond Damadian was excluded and a controversy ensued.

Materials and Methods

Unbiased secondary sources were examined and revealed the chronology of magnetic resonance imaging development. An examination of the patents and publications of Doctor Damadian was included in this documentation.

Results

In 1969 Doctor Damadian proposed the concept of a magnetic resonance scanner to the Human Research Council of New York City. His publication in the journal Science in 1971 also established his priority. He applied for a patent for his scanning method in 1972 and it was granted in 1974. Doctor Damadian published the first magnetic resonance imaging study of a human body in 1977. Doctor Lauterbur produced the first image of a live subject, a clam, and published the results in Nature in March 1973. He neglected to mention Damadian's work but he did include references which cited Damadian. This would start a controversy that continues to the present day.

Conclusions

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine can be awarded to a maximum of 3 scientists for any single discovery but in this instance was only given to 2. Excluding Doctor Damadian seems to be a serious and purposeful omission. The deliberations of the Nobel Committee remain closed for 50 years and only after this time passes will the world know what contributed to the decision to exclude Damadian.

### Prizes, lectures, and awards of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons / congress of neurological surgeons section on tumors [^65776aeb]. Neurosurgical Focus (2005). Low credibility.

An important goal of the Section on Tumors of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) since its founding in 1985 has been to foster both education and research in the field of brain tumor treatment. As one means of achieving this, the Section awards a number of prizes, research grants, and named lectures at the annual meetings of the AANS and CNS. After a brief examination of similar honors that were given in recognition of pioneering work by Knapp, Cushing, and other early brain tumor researchers, the authors describe the various awards given by the AANS/CNS Section on Tumors since its founding, their philanthropic donors, and the recipients of the awards. The subsequent career of the recipients is briefly examined, in terms of the rate of full publication of award-winning abstracts and achievement of grant funding by awardees.

In the tradition of Rudolf Virchow, any foundation using his name should safeguard his legacy. Taking Virchow seriously will require that future Prize winners (including especially groups, movements and organisations) are predominantly entities with outstanding contributions related to the social aspects of global health, fostering a comprehensive, universal, contextualised and just approach within the remits of the right to health. The Prize Committee of the Virchow Committee must declare their competing interests to make them transparent — and should seek to divest the Prize from funds that are tied to entities whose activities are a threat to global health. Otherwise, the Virchow Prize will be nothing but another example of 'the rancid hypocrisy of those wishing to embalm themselves with righteous merit' as recently articulated by Horton in The Lancet.

Moreover, the notion of the Virchow Prize being something like a Nobel Prize for public health is problematic. The Nobel Prize has been rightly criticised for its individualistic approach to granting the awards because except for a few unusual contributions it is difficult and potentially unfair to limit the credits for advancements in public and global health to one individual. Most science (especially in public and global health) and social efforts are conducted collaboratively. It may have been more appropriate to grant the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) the Virchow Prize as an institution developing core public health capacity. This is also indicated by Dr Nkengasong's decision to donate the prize money to the AFENET. The Virchow Prize for Global Health should aim to avoid the mistakes of the Nobel Prize (especially in the sciences) and not reinforce those errors.

Lastly, the authors of this commentary acknowledge their positionality and relative privilege as European, white, male established academics and medical professionals in providing this perspective. They respect, and applaud, Dr John Nkengasong's efforts, as a black, male, African scientist, academic and public health leader in skilfully navigating the complex landscape of Global Health diplomacy and its institutions with the aim to develop local, national and regional public health capacity. The authors would like to emphasise that their main concern is to point out the risk of efforts in decolonising global health and advancing health equity being captured by commercial interests.

### Healthcare strategist&social impact visionary, dr. geraldine mcGinty, 2024 ACR gold medal recipient [^d3c0a5ab]. Clinical Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Dr. Geraldine McGinty is no stranger to both political accolades and medical honors. As an internationally recognized expert in health economics and an advocate for patient centered care, Dr. McGinty has gained global impact as an influential decision maker and leading figure in radiology and imaging informatics. In May 2018, McGinty became the first woman chair of the American College of Radiology(ACR), and in 2020 became the 97th ACR President. 1 During her tenure, she spearheaded numerous initiatives from data science to health equity. In addition, she advocated for new governance structures to further the organization's mission of "empowering the radiologists of the future". 2 This year, we have the honor of highlighting her accomplishments and outlook towards the field's future as the 2024 American College of Radiology Gold Medal recipient- only the 15th female in over 100 years of ACR history to receive this most prestigious award.

The Edwin B. Newman Graduate Research Award is sponsored jointly by Psi Chi, the national honor society in psychology, and the APA. The award is presented annually to the psychology graduate student who submits the best research paper that was published or presented at a national, regional, or state psychological association conference during the past calendar year. The Edwin B. Newman Graduate Research Award was established in 1979. The award was established to recognize young researchers at the beginning of their professional lives and to commemorate both the 50th anniversary of Psi Chi and the 100th anniversary of psychology as a science (dating from the founding of Wundt's laboratory). It was named for Dr. Edwin B. Newman, the first national president of Psi Chi (1929) and one of its founders. He was a prolific researcher and a long-time chair of the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. Newman was a member of APA's Board of Directors, served as recording secretary of the board from 1962 to 1967, and was parliamentarian for the APA Council of Representatives for many years. He served both Psi Chi and APA in a distinguished manner for half a century. The Edwin B. Newman Graduate Research Award is given jointly by Psi Chi and APA.

Any health-care provider knows that the sneezing, wheezing, and itching that are commonplace most often involve a small molecule, namely, histamine. In addition to its inherent physiologic role, this seemingly small "actor" is of profound historical and fiscal significance. This is evidenced in part by the awarding of the 1936 Nobel Prize in physiology or Medicine to Sir Henry Hallett Dale and Dr Otto Loewi who discovered the actions of histamine and the 1957 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine to pharmacologist Dr Daniel Bovet who discovered the first antihistamine, pyrilamine (neoantergan)(1).

### Scientific prizes and the extraordinary growth of scientific topics [^843d7872]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fast growing scientific topics have famously been key harbingers of the new frontiers of science, yet, large-scale analyses of their genesis and impact are rare. We investigated one possible factor connected with a topic's extraordinary growth: scientific prizes. Our longitudinal analysis of nearly all recognized prizes worldwide and over 11,000 scientific topics from 19 disciplines indicates that topics associated with a scientific prize experience extraordinary growth in productivity, impact, and new entrants. Relative to matched non-prizewinning topics, prizewinning topics produce 40% more papers and 33% more citations, retain 55% more scientists, and gain 37 and 47% more new entrants and star scientists, respectively, in the first five-to-ten years after the prize. Funding do not account for a prizewinning topic's growth. Rather, growth is positively related to the degree to which the prize is discipline-specific, conferred for recent research, or has prize money. These findings reveal new dynamics behind scientific innovation and investment.

### A history of international headache society grants and their impact on headache careers [^c5a03cc8]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the leading purposes of the International Headache Society (IHS) is to advance headache science and education worldwide. Over the years, the IHS has created and funded a number of training and grant programs, which have been directed at young trainees who are in the process of developing a career in headache research and clinical practice. These awards have typically been undertaken by young investigators who have traveled to large centers with a strong track record of clinical knowledge and research in headache. Different schemes are in place in order to fulfil different purposes, with some awards being directed to clinical and basic scientists alike, and others being offered to neurology trainees or neurologists in order to enhance their clinical skills in headache.

The IHS Fellowship is a one-year award for a total of £50,000, which was first started in 2011. The scope of the fellowship is to support impactful research from young investigators who are within six years of completing their training (either an MD, a PhD, or medical specialty training). This grant scheme is open to applicants from both a basic or clinical background.

The Trainee/Pioneer Program enables young neurologists or neurology trainees from low, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries as defined by the World Bank to visit an international headache center for up to 12 weeks. The award, which totals $10,000 per recipient, has the scope to actively increase knowledge on headache disorders and specialized headache management. It is also intended to spread this knowledge to the recipients' home countries, for the ultimate benefit of local headache patients.

The Short-Stay Scholarship is a clinical training period of up to 6 weeks at an international headache center, which was first awarded in 2013. In years corresponding with the International Headache Congress (IHC), the program is held in the same region as the congress, and winning scholars are also funded to attend this. When taking place in alternate years with respect to IHC, the scholars receive funding to attend a regional headache conference. Funding for this scheme has been €5,000 up to 2016 and €6,000 from 2017.

Finally, the Allied Specialties Scholarship, which was pioneered in 2021, facilitates clinical training or a research project through a scholarship directed at specialists in fields that are allied to headache medicine, such as nurses and physiotherapists.

### Advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with AI [^883300cb]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The practice of mathematics involves discovering patterns and using these to formulate and prove conjectures, resulting in theorems. Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures 1, most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture 2, a Millennium Prize Problem 3. Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning-demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups 4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.

### Creating the freedom to thrive: honoring the legacy of RSNA gold medalist, deborah levine, MD [^de48ee67]. Clinical Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Awarded the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Gold Medal in 2018, Dr. Deborah Levine's research, journalism, and mentorship have left an indelible mark on the radiology field. Her work in ultrasound led to its use as the standard for monitoring benign adnexal cysts. She helped popularize obstetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through her research on its use in placental accreta and fetal abnormalities, which led to the development of the 'Compendium of Fetal MRI' website. This work in research led naturally to a career in journalism, where she eventually became Senior Deputy Editor of Radiology and founded Radiology Select. Concurrently with her personal achievements, Dr. Levine has dedicated herself to the mentorship of her female trainees. She sought various leadership positions to learn more about and advocate for the promotion and support of female leadership in radiology departments. In many ways, Dr. Levine's career and work have transformed radiology as we know it today for both patients and physicians.

### Polio and nobel prizes: looking back 50 years [^f9ac840e]. Annals of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

In 1954, John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in cultures of various types of tissue".5370 This discovery provided for the first time opportunities to produce both inactivated and live polio vaccines. By searching previously sealed Nobel Committee archives, we were able to review the deliberations that led to the award. It appears that Sven Gard, who was Professor of Virus Research at the Karolinska Institute and an adjunct member of the Nobel Committee at the time, played a major role in the events leading to the awarding of the Prize. It appears that Gard persuaded the College of Teachers at the Institute to decide not to follow the recommendation by their Nobel Committee to give the Prize to Vincent du Vigneaud. Another peculiar feature of the 1954 Prize is that Weller and Robbins were included based on only two nominations submitted for the first time that year. In his speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony, Gard mentioned the importance of the discovery for the future production of vaccines, but emphasized the implications of this work for growing many different, medically important viruses. We can only speculate on why later nominations highlighting the contributions of scientists such as Jonas Salk, Hilary Koprowski, and Albert Sabin in the development of poliovirus vaccines have not been recognized by a Nobel Prize.

### Harold ridley and the invention of the intraocular lens: a reappraisal [^1b35ada7]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

WILLIAM STEWART DUKE-ELDER

William Stewart Duke-Elder was born in Scotland in 1898 (Figure 2). He rode 5 miles to high school in Dundee, Scotland, by horse and open carriage each day, carrying feed for the horse and lunch money. He skipped lunch and used the money to buy candles, so he could read at night at home. Duke-Elder attended the University of St. Andrews. He finished his ophthalmology training at Moorfields in 1928, 7 years before Harold Ridley.

Figure 2.
Sir William Stewart Duke-Elder (Reprinted with permission from the Institute of Ophthalmology)

Duke-Elder was the unchallenged leader of British ophthalmology, and likely the most famous ophthalmologist in the world. (p.100) He was knighted at age 35. In 1936, at the age of 38, he was appointed surgeon oculist to King Edward VIII, a remarkable honor for someone so young. He was best known for the System of Ophthalmology, a massive nineteen-volume multiauthor work that was a comprehensive survey of all that was known about the subject. Before that he had written the single-author, seven-volume Textbook of Ophthalmology, published between 1932 and 1954. He received innumerable international awards, including the Gullstrand medal in 1952, 40 years before Ridley.

A core belief of Duke-Elder was that laboratory research was central to curing disease. He wrote in the introduction to Textbook of Ophthalmology, "This first volume is entirely devoted to the fundamental sciences upon which alone a thorough understanding of clinical ophthalmology can rest, and upon which any advances in the treatment of disease must be based". Nearly 30 years later, his faith in the laboratory was unshaken: "Those who will be leaders in the new ophthalmology of the next century of progress will… be men and women capable of analyzing, criticizing, and weighing the significance of the findings of the scientist… and applying this knowledge to the sick patient in the ordinary practice of everyday life".

Duke-Elder's professional work reflects this belief. Of the 48 peer-reviewed articles he published prior to the onset of World War II, 34 articles reported on laboratory work and its relevance to ophthalmic disease, particularly glaucoma (based on PubMed database search using the term "Duke-Elder[author]").

### Herbert A. simon: nobel prize in economic sciences, 1978 [^d6eb4731]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

In 1978, Herbert A. Simon won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, the same Nobel won by Daniel Kahneman in 2002. Simon's work in fact paved the way for Kahneman's Nobel. Although trained in political science and economics rather than psychology, Simon applied psychological ideas to economic theorizing. Classical and neoclassical economic theories assume that people are perfectly rational and strive to optimize economic outcomes. Simon argued that human rationality is constrained, not perfect, and that people seek satisfactory rather than ideal outcomes. Despite his Nobel, Simon felt isolated in economics and ultimately moved into psychology. Nevertheless, his ideas percolated through the economic community, so that Kahneman, whose research advanced Simon's broad perspective, could be the psychologist who won the Nobel in economics.

### Edwin lawrence kendig, jr. MD DSc (hon) 1911–2003 [^88e94393]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Edwin Kendig, MD is considered one of the founders of pediatric pulmonology. Prompted by his own experience with tuberculosis, he opened a 'chest clinic' for children, where he worked for 50years. He systematically published his observations and was the original editor of the first textbook in pediatric pulmonology in 1967. His book, now called Kendig and Chernick's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children will publish its 9th edition in 2018. All of this was in addition to his primary care pediatric practice, his teaching and his work at the national and international level of pediatric care. In his lifetime, he received many awards, including the establishment of the annual Edwin L. Kendig, Jr. Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics given for lifetime achievement in pediatric pulmonology.

### Optimism, persistence, and our collective crystal ball [^8a10ca4f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

A long-term quest of fundamental discovery.

Max Perutz decided to pursue the structure of hemoglobin in 1937, at a time when genes were generally thought to be proteins, and when proteins acting as enzymes had only recently been recognized to catalyze chemical reactions in living systems. Perutz saw protein structure as a central problem of biology, and he recognized that the only way to approach it was by x-ray crystallography. He also saw hemoglobin as a molecule of immense importance and mystery, especially in the mechanisms by which it transported oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. The existence of regular crystals of hemoglobin suggested to Perutz that the molecule's enormous number of atoms could take a specific shape and that the resulting structure would hold the key to how the molecule worked. However, in 1937, no one knew how to go about solving the structure of such a protein; indeed, there was widespread belief that the prospects for success were bleak and the goal was scarcely realistic, if not unattainable. Perutz, under generous support and advice from William Lawrence Bragg and John Desmond Bernal, nevertheless pursued the structure.

My first exposure to the optimism and persistence with which Max Perutz took on the hemoglobin problem was in my reading of a paper he contributed in 1948 in honor of the British physiologist Sir Joseph Barcroft. At that point his goal must have seemed distant indeed, for he wrote:

"On the face of it… an attempt to analyze the crystal structure of hemoglobin, or of any crystalline protein for that matter, looks about as promising as a journey to the moon".

This at a time when space travel was still a story of science fiction and the dream of reaching the moon was only the stuff of a love song. It was a marvel, I thought, to read Perutz's assessment of the hemoglobin structure problem as a possibly forlorn undertaking. He had no clear route yet to the protein structure — in fact, his model at that time would prove wrong — but he concluded in his paper that there remained "a variety of different ways of approach to the problem of protein structure. Some of these ways have proved dead ends, but many are still leading on". His decades of single-minded pursuit of a distant goal of major importance, by paths not at all clear, not even sure to be possible, struck me as a tremendous model for a career in scientific discovery.

### History of neuroimaging: the legacy of william oldendorf [^35916811]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The field of neuroimaging witnessed remarkable progress in the post-World War II era, resulting in tremendous benefits for healthcare today. One such important milestone was the development of the computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan. This state of the art technique has paved the way for modern diagnostic imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dr William Oldendorf, the first designer of axial tomography, is regarded by some as the true father of neuroimaging. However, because of various reasons, he was unable to succeed with his concept and was also unfortunately denied his due entitlement of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1979. This article discusses his contributions to the fields of neuroimaging and neurosciences, along with the politics that surrounded the awarding of the Nobel Prize of 1979. Another associated topic that is touched on in this article is the ever-growing dispute over the interpretations of neuroimaging between neurologists and neuroradiologists.

### The international polar year, 2007–2008, an opportunity to focus on infectious diseases in arctic regions [^8abcfa56]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

On 3 occasions over the past 125 years, scientists from around the world have worked together to organize scientific and exploration activities in polar regions. The first International Polar Year (IPY) in 1881–1884 marked the first major coordinated international scientific initiative to collect standardized meteorological and geophysical data in polar regions. Fifteen expeditions led by 12 nations amassed a large amount of data, but the scientific value was diminished by disjointed publication efforts and lack of long-term institutional commitment; lessons were learned and corrected in subsequent polar years. The second IPY began in 1932. Forty-four nations led expeditions in the Arctic and Antarctic, resulting in greater understanding of the aurora, magnetism, and meteorology. Air and marine navigation, radio operations, and weather forecasting were greatly improved as a result. The third IPY, in 1957–58, was renamed the International Geophysical Year and capitalized on technologic advances developed during World War II. Technologic and scientific momentum was redirected toward research, particularly to studies of the upper atmosphere, a legacy that continues to the present day. Notable achievements included launching the first satellite, measurement of atmospheric greenhouse gases, delineating the system of mid-ocean ridges, and confirming the theory of plate tectonics.

The current 4th IPY covers the period March 2007 to March 2009, although it is officially designated IPY 2007–2008. It was established by the International Council for Science, the National Academy of Sciences and World Meteorological Organization. This period of focused scientific research promises to ". further our understanding of the physical and social process in Polar Regions, examine their globally-connected role in the climate system and establish research infrastructure for the future, and serve to attract and develop a new generation of scientists and engineers with the versatility to tackle complex global issues". The 2007–2008 IPY also features human health as a research theme for the first time and thus presents an opportunity to do the following: 1) increase global awareness and visibility of health concerns of Arctic peoples, 2) foster human health research, 3) promote health protection strategies, and 4) ultimately improve the health and well being of Arctic peoples.

### The universal standard for safe and secure work with arthropod vectors: the American committee of medical entomology's arthropod containment guidelines [^8d8f9e93]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) is pleased to announce the publication of revised Arthropod Containment Guidelines, developed by the Society's subgroup, the American Committee of Medical Entomology (ACME).

Like the original guidelines, these are published in Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases, are open access, and can be viewed and downloaded at. An editorial providing some historical perspective is available at.

These guidelines have become a universal standard for safe and secure work with arthropod vectors, and are referred to in the highly regarded handbook "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories". They are the result of tireless effort by dedicated member experts, who painstakingly updated the previous 2003 guidelines, also authored by ACME members. In addition, they solicited comments from many outside subject matter experts. The original guidelines took over 2 years to write and served as the go-to-source for the community. In the 15 years since publication, new technologies and approaches that can be applied to research with arthropods have been developed, and an update was warranted. I have been involved with the guidelines since the idea was first discussed at an ASTMH Annual Meeting. As I am interested in history, with a specific interest in the history of our Society and the fields of arboviruses and medical entomology, this new publication provides an opportunity to briefly describe the very significant contributions of the Society to the field of vector-borne diseases.

The ASTMH has a long history of expertise with pathogens transmitted by arthropod vectors. William Crawford Gorgas, famous for his pioneering work in Panama to control yellow fever, was the fourth Society President. The Society recently established a new medal named after Clara Southmayd Ludlow, an entomologist and first woman member of ASTMH. Another medal is named in honor of a famous researcher, Walter Reed, who demonstrated the involvement of mosquitoes in the transmission cycle of yellow fever, and the Harry Hoogstraal medal is awarded for outstanding achievements in medical entomology. Society member Max Theiler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for his work on the development of the vaccine for yellow fever virus that is still in use today.

### Magnetism of materials: theory and practice in magnetic resonance imaging [^c003e734]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomenon discovered and described simultaneously and independently in January 1946 by two teams led by Felix Bloch at Stanford and Edward Mills Purcell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively. For their discovery, Bloch and Purcell were awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.

The idea of MRI was the brainchild of Dr. Raymond Damadian, who prefigured the possibility of using NMR to discriminate between malignant tumors and normal tissue in 1971. Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield further developed MRI, and in 2003 they both received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

MRI provides information on anatomy and physiological processes using strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the body. More precisely, but in a very simple way, MRI can be defined as a grayscale map of the content of hydrogen protons and of their interactions with the surrounding atomic and molecular tissue environment.

In this review, we examine both theoretically and practically the effects of magnetic properties, and specifically of magnetic susceptibility, of human tissues and various endogenous and exogenous substances on MRI. We discuss the implication of these properties on daily MRI practice so as to obtain, exploiting at best MR sequences, high-quality images, thus potentially improving diagnosis and patients' healthcare.

A complete description of the physical basis of MRI is beyond the scope of this article and has been extensively reviewed in numerous papers. However, some basic concepts of MRI physics will be briefly retrieved for the purposes of discussion.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^f77c0e47]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Negotiating between various kinds of medical knowledge — no set hierarchy of knowledge to guide clinical decision making in all situations is possible, and a ranking based on study design or quality measures cannot be directly applied to clinical decisions; clinicians must continue to rely on sound clinical judgment to negotiate between potentially conflicting facts and reasons, and explicitness is to be greatly valued, as clinicians should be able to identify and articulate the sources and kinds of knowledge invoked; the initial step is identifying pertinent medical knowledge, including clinical research, pathophysiologic understanding, and clinical experience, and since no kind of knowledge is always superior, simply relying upon a randomized controlled trial or meta-analysis will be insufficient; clinicians are obligated to consider information and knowledge that might suggest action that would run counter to that suggested by clinical research, and a clinician ought to be able to concisely outline and justify the process of clinical reasoning for scrutiny and revision.

### Fiftieth anniversary of uncovering the tuskegee syphilis study: the story and timeless lessons [^141954da]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In June 1943, while submitting plans for the Terre Haute experiments, Dr. Mahoney began experiments into the efficacy of penicillin on syphilis. The antibiotic caused rapid and complete disappearance of spirochetal activity in infected men. Dr. Mahoney presented the unexpected findings at a meeting of the American Public Health Association in October 1943. The presentation had an electrifying effect on the audience, with one attendee claiming, "This is probably the most significant paper ever presented in the medical field". Penicillin revolutionized the management of sexually transmitted disease. In 1940, the death rate for syphilis was 10.7 per 100,000; in 1950 it fell to 5 per 100,000, and in 1970 it reached 0.2 per 100,000.

As the Guatemalan research was commencing in 1946, Dr. Mahoney was awarded the Lasker Award for his "distinguished service as a pioneer in the treatment of syphilis with penicillin". Other awardees that year included Karl Landsteiner (1868–1943), discoverer of blood groups and Rhesus factor, and Ferdinand Cori (1896–1984), discoverer of the mechanism whereby glycogen is metabolized and resynthesized. The Lasker Award is known as the American Nobel Prize because many awardees receive both, as did Landsteiner and Cori. Accordingly, it is not an exaggeration to say that Dr. Mahoney was the preeminent American physician-scientist in 1946. As Dr. Mahoney received the award, the presenter proclaimed, "Your name will be joined in history with that of Paul Ehrlich".

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

### 2017 bailey K. ashford, Donald mackay, and walter reed medal recipients [^cad786b5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

WALTER REED MEDAL

The Walter Reed Medal recognizes distinguished accomplishment in the field of tropical medicine.

Scott B. Halstead, MD, FASTMH, is the 2017 recipient of the Walter Reed Medal, the Society's highest honor. Dr. Halstead has a long and distinguished career in arbovirology and tropical medicine, and he continues to be a strong advocate for arbovirology–especially the development of safe and effective vaccines.

Front (A) and back (B) of the Walter Reed Medal.

"It is my great honor to nominate Dr. Scott Halstead for the Walter Reed Medal in 2017", Wei-Kung Wang, MD, ScD, wrote in his nominating letter. "Dr. Halstead has made numerous significant contributions to the field of tropical medicine".

He was the first to recover dengue viruses in tissue culture in 1961 (dengue plaquing) and report the association between secondary dengue infections and increased risk of severe disease. He has devoted much of his scientific career to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying severe dengue disease. He described antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection in monkeys in vivo and in human peripheral blood leukocytes in vitro. His hypothesis about antibody enhanced dengue disease is now widely accepted by the scientific community. He has published 293 peer-reviewed articles, 36 invited articles, and 110 book chapters.

In addition, Dr. Halstead contributed importantly to several flavivirus vaccines that are approved or currently being evaluated in clinical trials. He discovered the attenuating properties of the passage of dengue virus in primary dog kidney cells, a discovery that led to the Takeda vaccines currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials. He promoted the SA 14-14-2 live-attenuated Japanese encephalitis vaccine developed by the Chinese Institute for the Control of Biological and Pharmaceutical Products and played a key role in evaluating the vaccine outside China and in its subsequent wide-spread use in many Asian countries. As the founder and director of the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative, supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Rockefeller Foundation, he recruited new investigators to dengue and built a network of researchers across the globe to support the development of dengue vaccines.

### Remembering jeff robbins: the father of cardiac transgenesis [^547bb7b6]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Jeff published more than 230 peer-reviewed scientific articles and his work has earned some of the most prestigious research awards, such as the American Heart Association's Research Achievement Award, the Kaplan Visionary Award, and the Distinguished Scientist Award; the International Society for Heart Research's Distinguished Research Achievement Award; the prestigious Louis and Artur Lucian Award for Research in Circulatory Diseases; the University of Cincinnati's Rieveschel Award and the Daniel Drake Medal; and the William Cooper Procter Medallion, which is the highest award given by Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the first recipient was Dr Albert Sabin in 1960.

Jeff was a world-renowned researcher and lovingly known as the "father of cardiac transgenesis" by his colleagues. His research was acclaimed for systematically dissecting the molecular underpinnings of heart disease and the genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In his early career, Jeff's research provided some of the very first molecular insights into the function of myosin protein in mediating heart contraction, which evolved into a careful annotation of the transcriptional circuity that underlies cardiac-specific gene expression of the myosin gene promoters. From this understanding of cardiac-specific gene expression, he pioneered the generation of tissue-specific promoters to drive gene expression in the heart by transgenesis, which changed the way that basic cardiovascular research is done. Indeed, the cardiac-specific myosin gene promotors that his laboratory generated (and shared) directly led to more than 1,000 additional publications by the field. His work revolutionized disease-based cardiovascular research by the field at large, to interrogate the genes that directly underlie or contribute to genetically driven heart disease as well as acquired heart disease states.

### Generating conjectures on fundamental constants with the ramanujan machine [^75e8911d]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Fundamental mathematical constants such as e and π are ubiquitous in diverse fields of science, from abstract mathematics and geometry to physics, biology and chemistry 1,2. Nevertheless, for centuries new mathematical formulas relating fundamental constants have been scarce and usually discovered sporadically 3–6. Such discoveries are often considered an act of mathematical ingenuity or profound intuition by great mathematicians such as Gauss and Ramanujan 7. Here we propose a systematic approach that leverages algorithms to discover mathematical formulas for fundamental constants and helps to reveal the underlying structure of the constants. We call this approach 'the Ramanujan Machine'. Our algorithms find dozens of well known formulas as well as previously unknown ones, such as continued fraction representations of π, e, Catalan's constant, and values of the Riemann zeta function. Several conjectures found by our algorithms were (in retrospect) simple to prove, whereas others remain as yet unproved. We present two algorithms that proved useful in finding conjectures: a variant of the meet-in-the-middle algorithm and a gradient descent optimization algorithm tailored to the recurrent structure of continued fractions. Both algorithms are based on matching numerical values; consequently, they conjecture formulas without providing proofs or requiring prior knowledge of the underlying mathematical structure, making this methodology complementary to automated theorem proving 8–13. Our approach is especially attractive when applied to discover formulas for fundamental constants for which no mathematical structure is known, because it reverses the conventional usage of sequential logic in formal proofs. Instead, our work supports a different conceptual framework for research: computer algorithms use numerical data to unveil mathematical structures, thus trying to replace the mathematical intuition of great mathematicians and providing leads to further mathematical research.

### Guidelines: from artificial evolution to computational evolution: a research agenda [^f91d9901]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

Computational scientists have developed algorithms inspired by natural evolution for at least 50 years. These algorithms solve optimization and design problems by building solutions that are 'more fit' relative to desired properties. However, the basic assumptions of this approach are outdated. We propose a research programme to develop a new field: computational evolution. This approach will produce algorithms that are based on current understanding of molecular and evolutionary biology and could solve previously unimaginable or intractable computational and biological problems.

### Stamping out cancer [^f53ca754]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

EMINENT PERSONALITIES

Many scientists and physicians appear on stamps for their outstanding contribution in the fight against cancer. WC Roentgen (1845–1923) – discoverer of X-rays in 1895 and the first recipient of the Nobel prize in 1901 (stamp 76). Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) (stamp 77) – discoverer of the phenomenon of spontaneous emanations later termed radioactivity by Madame Marie Curie. Radiotherapy has originated from this discovery. Madame Marie Curie (1867–1934) and Pierre Curie (1859–1906) – world-renowned French scientists who discovered radium in 1898, which was the first radioactive substance used for the treatment. Madame Curie appeared in about 100 stamps either alone (e.g. stamps 9, 78–80) or with her husband Pierre Curie (stamps 81 and 82). In 1938, France and its 21 colonies issued the latter stamps (81 and 82) as a tribute to the 40th anniversary of this discovery. The surtax of these stamps was given to the International Union Against Cancer. Pierre Curie was also remembered alone in some stamps. Irene Joliot Curie (1897–1956), elder daughter of Madame Curie, and Frederic Joliot (1900–1958) son-in-law of Madame. Curie – joint discoverers of artificial radioactivity (stamp 83). Based on their discovery, a number of artificial radioisotopes have been prepared some of which find use in cancer. George N Papanikolaou (1883–1962) (stamps 62 and 84) – discoverer of PAP test for early diagnosis of cervical cancer that has saved the lives of millions of women worldwide. Moritz Kaposi (1837–1902) (stamp 85) – famous physician who identified in 1872 a special type of sarcoma that was named after him as Kaposi's sarcoma. Rudlof Virchow (1821–1902) (stamp 86) – founder of cellular pathology. He discovered and named gliomas and giant cells. He had also named many common tumours.

### Radiation's formulations [^742e12a2]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Radiation is not radiation is not radiation. Alternatively, one might assert that therapeutic radiation comes in such a variety of forms with sufficiently distinct physical and biological properties that clumping them together under a single moniker and assuming equivalence is at best misleading, if not preposterous. This has been apparent since the very discovery of radioactivity. These world-changing events have been meticulously recounted, but please permit a cursory narrative to help illuminate modern developments. In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen, a physicist in Würzburg, Germany, accidentally discovered that rays from a cathode tube passed through many substances leaving shadows from denser objects. He won the 1901 physics Nobel Prize. In 1902, Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, in Paris, France, isolated radioactive radium salts from pitchblende. Together they won the 1903 physics Nobel Prize, and she alone won the 1911 chemistry Nobel Prize for the isolation of pure radium and polonium.

Teletherapy with Röntgen-rays, which Wilhelm Röntgen himself termed x-rays, and brachytherapy with radium were, once discovered, almost immediately applied to human care. Within months of Röntgen's announcement medical uses for x-rays were intimated, and within a year had begun in earnest. In 1896, an American physician in Chicago, Emil Grubbe, was formally evaluating medical uses for x-rays, and external beam radiation treatments were underway.

Radium opened the portal for applying radiation sources directly onto or into tumors. The first reported cancer cure with such an approach dates to 1903, inaugurating brachytherapy, which promptly expanded to many conditions involving readily reachable regions, such as skin, nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, rectum, and vagina, but also to tumors accessed via incision. These separate forms of therapeutic radiation delivery (teletherapy and brachytherapy) have remained distinctive, and modern developments have broadened their idiosyncrasies. Today, an expanding array of options and indications are available or under development with very differing indications and implications, underscoring the fact that radiation is not to be viewed as a single modality with a single mode of action any more than is surgery or pharmacotherapy with their assorted forms, indications, and outcomes.

Stefania Jabłońska (1920–2017) is remembered as a physician extraordinaire, outstanding medical scientist, and superb professor of dermatology. She served as Professor and Chairman of Dermatology at the Warsaw Medical School. Not only is she one of the most cited of Polish physicians, she also was world renowned, being elected to honorary membership in innumerable dermatology societies. Jabłońska in 1972 was the first to describe the relationship between the human papillomavirus and skin cancer in epidermodysplasia verruciformis. She collaborated with Professor Gérard Charles Jacques Orth (1936-), with whom she characterized the molecular structure of the oncogenic virus to be the first to be discovered in dermatologic diseases. They also showed that a viral infection could not spread to people with different genetic patterns. For this discovery, Jabłońska and Orth in 1985 were awarded the Robert Koch Medal, which was presented to them by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Richard Karl Freiherr von Weizsäcker (1920–2015). Jabłońska is the only Polish scientist to be so honored.

### EURAPS at 20 years. A brief history of European plastic surgery from the sociéTéeuropéenne de chirurgie structive to the European Association of Plastic Surgeons (EURAPS) [^15d1b843]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

By the end of WWI, plastic surgery had reached unexpected heights. The high quality of the work done for soldiers with facial injuries and burns, either as an emergency or as a delayed procedure, demonstrated that this new discipline was honourable, worthwhile and socially crucial, thus deserving official recognition and independence. The establishment of new plastic surgery centres, scientific societies and specialised journals were the key to success for the achievement of this goal. In 1936, the Belgian Maurice Coelst (1894–1963) founded the Société Européenne de Chirurgie Structive, the first supranational society, with the aim of gathering once a year all those interested in this new branch of surgery and favouring confrontation of ideas by showing innovative clinical procedures. The very successful first Congress with a large international participation was held in Brussels, with Coelst as the president, the second in London, in 1937, organised by Kilner and the third in Milano, in 1938, arranged by Sanvenero Rosselli. Even live surgery was performed during the meetings. The beginning of the WWII stopped the Societé's activities, which were never resumed. In the late 1980s, when plastic surgery reached its zenith, the necessity was felt to create a new supranational society, different in its purpose from the existing European Section of IPRAS, later European Society of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (ESPRAS), an organisation where all the official European plastic surgery societies merged automatically. The aim was to promote the excellence of plastic surgery in Europe, to furnish an annual forum for the selection of the best scientific works presented at national societies and to stimulate research and education at a European level. Established in 1989, 53 years after the foundation of the Société Européenne de Chirurgie Structive, it was named the European Association of Plastic Surgeons (EURAPS). The first scientific meeting took place in Strasbourg, France, city of the Council of Europe, on 7–9 June 1990. Based on the high scientific level of the clinical and aesthetic presentations, EURAPS soon ranked among the leading associations in Europe for plastic surgery and this leadership is now recognised all over the world. The EURAPS successfully celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009.

### Scientific prizes and the extraordinary growth of scientific topics [^432bcb76]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

If one accepts the ICM's approach to prizes, newly identified linkages among prizewinners and prizes raise related questions about prizes and meritocracy. Ma et al.found that the number of prizes worldwide have proliferated, which presumably offers more opportunity to celebrate scientists and ideas, however, as prizes have proliferated, prizes have become increasingly concentrated within a relatively small network of elite scientists and their mentees. Further, the most successful mentees study topics that differ from their mentor's topics of study, suggesting that skills associated with conducting prizewinning work can be mentored and applied to new research areas. Future research may therefore examine ways in which prizewinning tacit knowledge and research skills can be diffused more broadly across scientists and topics, and how vacancy chains within the prize network may open and close.

Another area of prize meritocracy focuses on representation. New research indicates that women are winning prizes more inline with their participation rates in science but continue to be but statistically less likely to win research prizes than their male peers. Focusing on research areas where women's participation is large and there are many prizes, such as biomedicine, women are winning prizes a rates closer to their representation in the field but the prizes they win have lower prestige and less money than the prizes won by their male counterparts. Those trends coupled with the finding that a prize's prestige and money predict the magnitude of extraordinary growth a prize can have on a topic suggests that future research should investigate how prize committee nomation and decision procedures are linked to diversity, a process already taking place among some prize committees.

### Starvation in the midst of plenty: reflections on the history and biology of insulin and leptin [^91c357f7]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Awards and patents may serve as additional inputs to assigning credit for discoveries. Friedman and Coleman (the latter of whom died in 2014) have been co-recipients of many prestigious awards specifically for their role in leptin's discovery, including the Shaw Prize, the Gairdner Award, and the Lasker Award, the latter in 2010. By including Coleman together with Friedman, these award committees chose to frame "the discovery" as representing more than the molecular cloning of the gene. These award committees, each with their own due diligence and selection panels of scientific luminaries, did not judge Leibel's role as meriting similar recognition. Additionally, in 1994, neither Leibel nor Bahary were identified by Rockefeller officials and their patent attorneys as inventors on the patent. The initial business agreement with Amgen transferred development rights for leptin in exchange for substantial payments to the institution (Rockefeller and HHMI), shared with the inventors. Had leptin become a successful therapy for obesity, royalty payments would have been enormous.

### The 2014 nobel prize in physiology or medicine: a spatial model for cognitive neuroscience [^058ea3fb]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

As with spatial navigation, the work of the 2014 Nobel laureates has provided a strong foundation upon which a mechanistic, neural-level understanding of memory can be built. Knowledge of the relevant neural representations becomes even more powerful in combination with an understanding of how changes in synaptic connectivity between neurons can mediate learning via long-term potentiation, a phenomenon that was also discovered in the hippocampus by Tim Bliss and colleagues. Further advances, such as the application of molecular biology and optogenetics to manipulate hippocampal representations, are beginning to allow investigations and manipulations of memory that would previously have been considered unreachable (e.g. work by Susumu Tonegawa, recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1987 for work on immunology). These experiments include the deletion of fearful memories via disrupted reconsolidation and the artificial creation of memories of fear or reward.

Conclusion

The energy, enthusiasm, and vision of John O'Keefe, Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser, and their colleagues have left the field of cognitive neuroscience with a model system — hippocampal spatial navigation — in which much of the neuronal code has been cracked. This tremendous achievement provides firm foundations for rapid progress in many directions and will be widely recognized as truly meriting the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. There may be a long way to go in fully understanding human memory and how it can fail in neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the foundations for a bridge from molecules through neurons, synapses, and networks to behavior and symptoms have been laid.

### Regional and institutional trends in assessment for academic promotion [^a5475f40]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The assessment of research performance is widely seen as a vital tool in upholding the highest standards of quality, with selection and competition believed to drive progress. Academic institutions need to take critical decisions on hiring and promotion, while facing external pressure by also being subject to research assessment 1–4. Here we present an outlook on research assessment for career progression with specific focus on promotion to full professorship, based on 314 policies from 190 academic institutions and 218 policies from 58 government agencies, covering 32 countries in the Global North and 89 countries in the Global South. We investigated how frequently various promotion criteria are mentioned and carried out a statistical analysis to infer commonalities and differences across policies. Although quantitative methods of assessment remain popular, in agreement with what is found in more geographically restricted studies 5–9, they are not omnipresent. We find differences between the Global North and the Global South as well as between institutional and national policies, but less so between disciplines. A preference for bibliometric indicators is more marked in upper-middle-income countries. Although we see some variation, many promotion policies are based on the assumption of specific career paths that become normative rather than embracing diversity. In turn, this restricts opportunities for researchers. These results challenge current practice and have strategic implications for researchers, research managers and national governments.

### Evaluating cancer etiology and risk with a mathematical model of tumor evolution [^e1120d8d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The mathematical modeling, and associated statistical analysis, of the evolution of mutations in cell populations and bacteria has a relatively long history. When combined with epidemiological or experimental data it has yielded several important findings. For example, the seminal work of Luria and Delbrück, demonstrating the critical role played by randomly occurring mutations arising before — rather than after — the beginning of treatment as the cause behind the development of resistance to antibiotics. Their Nobel Prize winning work led to a flurry of further modeling work to understand the development of resistance to chemotherapy and HIV antiretroviral treatment, highlighting the importance of combination therapy. Another example is provided by the models and analyses produced by Charles and Luce-Clausen, Nordling, and Armitage and Doll, which shed light on the multi-stage nature of cancer evolution.

### Optimal policy for multi-alternative decisions [^29f918c3]. Nature Neuroscience (2019). High credibility.

Everyday decisions frequently require choosing among multiple alternatives. Yet the optimal policy for such decisions is unknown. Here we derive the normative policy for general multi-alternative decisions. This strategy requires evidence accumulation to nonlinear, time-dependent bounds that trigger choices. A geometric symmetry in those boundaries allows the optimal strategy to be implemented by a simple neural circuit involving normalization with fixed decision bounds and an urgency signal. The model captures several key features of the response of decision-making neurons as well as the increase in reaction time as a function of the number of alternatives, known as Hick's law. In addition, we show that in the presence of divisive normalization and internal variability, our model can account for several so-called 'irrational' behaviors, such as the similarity effect as well as the violation of both the independence of irrelevant alternatives principle and the regularity principle.

### The scientific contributions of British plastic surgeons to the revue de chirurgie plastique and the revue de chirurgie structive, brussels (1931–1938) [^f5e0d659]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

In 1931, Maurice Coelst, M.D. from Brussels started the publication of the first international journal of plastic surgery ever published: the Revue de Chirurgie Plastique (1931–1934), which eventually became the Revue de Chirurgie Structive (1935–1938). In 1936, he established the first European Society of Structive Surgery, which held its first congress in Brussels. Further congresses were held in London in 1937 and in Milan in 1938. It is the collaboration and the participation of British plastic surgeons in this Society, this journal, and these meetings that I want to stress, because I am firmly convinced that these documents fill a gap in the history of Plastic Surgery in Great Britain, since — as far as I know — no detailed information concerning this period was ever published in Plastic Surgery literature.

### G protein-coupled receptors: a century of research and discovery [^a89fce37]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

"So we may suppose that in all cells two constituents at least are to be distinguished. The chief substance which is concerned with the chief function of the cell as contraction and secretion and receptive substances which are acted upon by chemical bodies and in certain cases by nervous stimuli. The receptive substance affects or is capable of affecting the metabolism of the chief substance"

Though the identities of the "receptive substances" were a mystery to Langley, these early ideas led to the initial proposal of the receptor concept. The functions of receptors, Langley had clearly postulated, are: first, to interact with external chemical stimuli; and second, to relay these responses to effectors within the cell, generating physiological changes in response. Despite the later-proven accuracy of this theory, these ideas were initially met with considerable skepticism, and the existence of receptors would remain highly contentious for decades. For instance, consider the perspectives of just a few scientists in the following decades.

In 1943, Sir Henry Dale, who received the Nobel Prize in 1936 for studies on adrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmission and himself a former student of John Langley would say:

"It is a mere statement of fact to say that the action of adrenaline picks out certain such effector cells and leaves others unaffected; it is a simple deduction that the affected cells have a special affinity of some kind for adrenaline, but I doubt whether the attribution to such cells of " adrenaline receptors " does more than restate this deduction in another form… "

In 1973, Raymond Ahlquist, a distinguished pharmacologist, and recipient of the Lasker prize for his work on the pharmacological differentiation of α and β adrenoreceptor subtypes would remark:
