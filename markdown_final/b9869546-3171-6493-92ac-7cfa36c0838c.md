## Question

Mark bought 2 pounds of tomatoes for $5 per pound and 5 pounds of apples, at $6 per pound. How much did he spend in total?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much Mark spent in total after buying 2 pounds of tomatoes at $5 per pound and 5 pounds of apples at $6 per pound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cost of the tomatoes. Then, I should verify the cost of the apples. Next, I will add the two subtotals to get the total expenditure. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy before stating the final answer.

> Let me first confirm the tomato calculation: 2 pounds at $5 per pound equals 2 × 5 = $10. Wait, let me verify that multiplication — yes, 2 times 5 is indeed 10, so the tomatoes cost $10.

> Next, I should review the apple calculation: 5 pounds at $6 per pound equals 5 × 6 = $30. Hold on, I should verify that — 5 times 6 is 30, so the apples cost $30.

> Now, I will add the two subtotals to find the total amount spent: $10 for tomatoes plus $30 for apples equals $40. I should double-check the addition — 10 + 30 is 40, so the total is $40.

> Final answer: Mark spent $40 in total.

## Calculation breakdown

| **Item** | **Quantity (pounds)** | **Price per pound ($)** | **Total cost ($)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tomatoes | 2 | 5 | 10 |
| Apples | 5 | 6 | 30 |
| Total | ∅ | ∅ | 40 |

---

Therefore, Mark spent a total of **$40**.

Results

The observed UK diet for the years 2011–2017 among individuals aged ≥ 12 y contained an average of 88 g (just over 1 portion) of fruit per day and an average of 140 g (just under 2 portions) of vegetables per day. The main types of fruits were bananas, apples, pears, and citrus fruits and the main types of vegetables were tomatoes, baked beans, onions, carrots, and peas (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Main types of fruit and vegetables (providing 90% of their respective category) in the observed UK diet, including daily amounts (grams) and proportion (%) of total baseline amounts of fruit or vegetables

Mean dietary energy intake from the whole diet was 1744 kcal per person per day (1750 kcal and 1726 kcal per person per day for adults and children, respectively; Supplemental Table 2). The mean cost of the diet was £6.78 per person per day; mean GHGEs were 6.2 kg CO 2 eq per person per day (Table 3), of which 1.6% and 3.9% derived from fruit and vegetables, respectively (Supplemental Figure 3); and mean blue WF was 611 L per person per day (Table 3), of which 0.9% and 1.0% derived from fruit and vegetables, respectively (Supplemental Figure 3). Aggregating these average daily amounts of CO 2 eq and WFs over 1 y and for a UK population of 66.65 million would amount to ∼148 Mt CO 2 eq and 14.7 km 3 of blue water for total annual food consumption.

Rounding prices in the market

It is common practice for shopkeepers in markets in India to round prices up or down by one or to the nearest multiple of five. In studies 2 and 3, for all market transactions (for working children), pretend market transactions (for school children) and hypothetical transactions (for working and non-working children), we considered the price quoted for an individual good to be correct if it was rounded up or down by one from the exact answer, rounded up or down by five from the exact answer or the exact answer itself. For example, if the exact answer was 35.5 rupees, we would treat 30, 35, 35.5, 36 and 40 as correct answers. We did this because such rounding is common practice and does not reflect the inability of the child to solve problems.

For the combined price of goods 1 and goods 2, we considered any answer that adds the correct (rounded or unrounded) prices of individual goods to be correct. For example, if carrots cost 18 rupees and potatoes cost 32 rupees, we would consider a total price of 52 rupees to be a correct answer; 18 rupees can be correctly rounded to 20 rupees, and 20 rupees plus 32 rupees gives a total of 52 rupees.

For the change provided, we calculated the correct answer by subtracting the true cost of each good from the cash provided (not by subtracting the amount quoted by the child from the cash provided). For example, if we purchased 600 g of apples at 30 rupees per kg and 200 g of potatoes at 20 rupees per kg and gave the child 200 rupees, then we would calculate the exact answer as 200 – (0.6)(30) – (0.2)(20) = 200–18 – 4 = 178, irrespective of what the child quoted for the total amount due. We also allowed the same rounding as described for the combined price of goods 1 and goods 2. For example, we would also treat 200–20 – 5 = 175 to be correct.

### Measuring diet cost at the individual level: a comparison of three methods [^115gtrsa]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Methods 2 and 3, which applied a standard database of supermarket prices, have parallels in nutritional epidemiology, where estimates of energy and nutrient intakes for individuals are derived from common nutrient composition tables. For example, the vitamin C content of fresh, raw apples consumed by participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys is set at 4.6 mg per 100 g edible portion, regardless of the vitamin C content of the apples that were actually consumed. The addition of a price variable was analogous to the inclusion of new nutrient-based variables in the FFQ nutrient database.

All three estimates of diet cost were positively and monotonically associated with household income, consistent with past studies on incomes and household food expenditures. Diet cost estimates based on expenditures (Method 1) were not only the highest but also showed the largest differences across income strata. It is likely that diet costs estimated using a standard prices database (Methods 2 and 3) underestimate the true differences in purchasing power across income groups.

More research on perishable produce supply chains is needed, using direct measurement approaches across multiple supply chains stages; exploring the final uses of diverted products and their costs or benefits; and integrating food quality assessments with FLW estimates. Such evidence can inform on opportunities for FLW reduction policies and initiatives aiming to create sustainable food systems that promote positive health and environmental outcomes. Strategies to reduce FLW should also focus on the underlying reasons for loss, including postharvest handling, seasonality, and market structures.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^111AhguN]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Rather than selecting arbitrary whole fruits and fruit juices for modeling, a composite whole fruit and fruit juice was created based on a weighted estimate using their relative frequency of consumption. For whole fruits, all fresh, canned, frozen and dried fruit that were not part of mixed dishes and consumed by children 4–18y were flagged. For fruit juices, all 100% fruit juices were flagged. The number of times each item was reported was used to derive a weight for the composite fruit (e.g. fresh apples were consumed 426 times and had a weight of 0.223). The most important whole fruits were apples (weight = 0.223), bananas (0.145), oranges (0.097), grapes (0.095), and strawberries (0.067). While canned, frozen and dried fruit are lower-cost fruit sources, they were infrequently consumed (e.g. their collective weight was 0.12). The fruit juices most heavily weighted in the composite fruit juice were orange juice without calcium (weight = 0.270), orange juice with calcium (0.196), apple juice (0.191), fruit juice blends (0.153), and grape juice (0.051).

NHANES participants & dietary assessment

Data analyses were based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2009–2010. Data for 2,647 children 4–18y were available for analysis.

The NHANES 24-h dietary recall utilized a multi-pass method, where respondents reported the types and amounts of all food and beverages consumed in the preceding 24-h. For children 4–5y, the dietary recall was completed entirely by a parent/guardian. For children 6–11y, the child was the primary respondent, but a proxy respondent was present and able to assist. For 12–18y olds, the child was the primary respondent, but could be assisted by an adult.

The NHANES database includes two dietary recalls for most participants. The first was completed in-person at the Mobile Examination Center with an interviewer. The second was completed over the telephone and tends to result in lower estimated energy intakes than in-person. Because the goal of this project was to assess the nutritional and economic consequences of meeting fruit recommendations under different approaches, the first 24-h recall was used for all analyses and is adequate to evaluate average population-level dietary intakes.

To address the shortfall in fruit consumption, current consumption of total fruit, whole fruit, and 100% fruit juice, expressed in terms of cup equivalents, were estimated based on USDA data. A cup equivalent of fruit corresponds to 1 whole fruit, a cup of sliced fruit, ½ cup of dried fruit or 1 cup of 100% juice (8 fl oz). For example, 1.0 cup of fruit corresponds to a small apple (106 g), large banana (136 g), 32 seedless grapes (160 g), large orange (184 g), 8 large strawberries (166 g) or 1 cup of fruit juice (248 g or 8 fluid ounces). Cup equivalents for fruit were obtained from the USDA MyPyramid Equivalents Database (MPED). Because updated MPED data were not available for the 2009–2010 NHANES data, we used the MPED addendum database from the Center for Policy and Promotion (CNPP). Analyses were conducted prior to the September 2013 release of the Food Patterns Equivalent Database, containing updated groups related to 2010 Dietary Guidelines. Whole fruit and fruit juices were differentiated using the 2003–2004 Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) Healthy Eating Index support files, which includes information on the relative content of whole vs. fruit juice per 100 g for each food/beverage.

Results

Table 1 shows mean servings of total fruit, whole fruit and 100% fruit juice, as well as estimated daily diet cost by age group, gender, income to poverty ratio and race/ethnicity. Overall, children and adolescents consumed 1.1 (95% CI 1.0, 1.2) servings of total fruit per day, 59% from whole fruit and the remainder from fruit juice. Most children (68.8%) had a shortfall in fruit consumption. Fruit consumption did not differ substantially by gender. Younger children consumed significantly more total fruit and whole fruit than older children. Differences in total fruit intake were not observed by family income, though children from lower-income families received a greater proportion of their total fruit from fruit juice than those from higher-income families. Total fruit intake did differ by race/ethnicity. Mexican-American children consumed the most total fruit and non-Hispanic black children consumed the most fruit juice. Fifty-two percent of total fruit among non-Hispanic black children came from fruit juice compared to 34% for non-Hispanic white children.

### The economic, agricultural, and food security repercussions of a wild pollinator collapse in Europe [^116tdhAW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our welfare and food intake outcomes represent average national households, limiting the ability to analyze impacts on particularly vulnerable groups. This is a known constraint in multi-regional or global economic simulations. Nonetheless, our findings reveal notable disparities in welfare decline across Europe (Fig. 3B), with low-income countries, where food expenses consume a larger share of household budgets, facing disproportionately high impacts. This likely extends to lower-income households within wealthier countries. The production of pollination-dependent crops, such as oilseeds, vegetables, and fruits, is vital for farmers and rural communities, though the economic effects of a pollinator loss on these communities are complex. Our model suggests that some producers of pollination-dependent crops may benefit from the "King-Davenant law", as higher prices can offset yield reductions for certain crops like sunflower, tomatoes, and apples. Lower yields per area could increase harvest costs, which are not captured in detail in our model. Therefore, the changes in producer surplus need to be interpreted with caution.

The significant correlation between consumer surplus losses and EU member states' resistance to pollinator-friendly policies, measured by the average voting behavior of EU parliament members, is an incidental finding that warrants further investigation. This relationship may suggest that regions facing the greatest economic impacts from a pollinator collapse may be less supportive of biodiversity policies, potentially due to concerns about immediate economic or other reasons, such as doubts about the policies' effectiveness. A similar pattern was observed in a study that showed that countries in the Americas and Asia, despite their increasing reliance on pollination-dependent crops, often expand agricultural practices that undermine pollination services. Our study did not originally set out to examine any political-economic aspects, and it remains limited in scope without investigating causal relationships. Future research could investigate potential confounding factors, such as countries' agricultural dependency as a share of GDP, to better understand why some regions may exhibit higher resistance despite clear economic risks. Additionally, understanding how changes in both consumer and producer surplus interact with policy preferences could offer valuable insights into the socio-economic dynamics of environmental policy support. For instance, while consumer losses correlate negatively with policy support, the positive correlation between producer surplus gains and voting behavior may reflect different economic incentives or concerns about costs (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Perspectives on tomato quality

Using market grade categories, we examined differences of quality intensity and expected price (Figure 3). Across all actors, first-, second-, and third-quality grades were significantly different from each other based on the quality scale. For farmers at the market level, damaged-quality tomatoes were not significantly different in quality scale than third-quality tomatoes; for all other stages, damaged-quality tomatoes were significantly different. At the farmer and vegetable-retailer stages, the first-, second-, third-, and damaged-quality grades were significantly different from each other based on the expected price.

Error bars denoted 95% CIs. Shared letters within the same panel are not significantly different at a P value < 0.05; analyzed by pairwise comparison with Bonferroni correction. Price refers to the price the supply chain actor expects to receive at the market. Total observations (groups of tomatoes) were as follows: farmer, farm level (Quality scale: first quality, n = 97; second quality, n = 132; third quality, n = 62; fourth quality, n = 28; damaged, n = 86. Price: first quality, n = 87; second quality, n = 125; third quality, n = 62; fourth quality, n = 27; damaged, n = 100); farmer, market level (Quality scale: first quality, n = 106; second quality, n = 110; third quality, n = 77; fourth quality, n = 45; damaged, n = 93.

TABLE 3
Food loss and waste estimates by declared and destination loss methods 1

At the tomato and vegetable wholesale stages, traders typically lose < 1% of their lots (Supplemental Table 3). There were no differences in FLW estimates using destination loss methods at the tomato-trader and vegetable-trader stages (data not shown). At the retail stage, vegetable retailers lose tomatoes at the start of selling when they remove tomatoes from their starting inventory; this occurred at 26% of surveys with retailers (Supplemental Table 3). Among retailers with FLW at the start of selling, a median of 2.6% (IQR, 1.5%–6.2%) of their total starting inventory went to nonfood destinations. At the start of selling, the FLW estimated using the nonfood destination criteria was significantly greater than the FLW estimated using the nonproductive destination criteria (data not shown). By the end of selling, vegetable retailers reported they had lost some of their inventory at 88% of surveys. Among retailers with FLW at the end of selling on the previous day, retailers reported they lost a median of 3.6% (IQR, 1.6%–6.0%) of their inventory (Supplemental Table 3).

Drug pricing fosters and directs innovation

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

### Food loss of perishable produce from farm to retail: evidence from tomato supply chains in south India [^111VS5xP]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Tomato prices in India are often highest during the summer season (May to July), when tomato production in most of the country is in an off-season, serving as an advantage to locations with suitable summer growing conditions, like the Chittoor district. Cold storage is not commonly available in fresh tomato supply chains in India. Without adequate cold storage, mature produce quickly deteriorates as bruising, over-ripeness, excessive softening, and biological spoilage cause quality and postharvest losses. Fresh tomatoes typically reach consumers within one week from harvest, and tomato prices can widely fluctuate, making production planning and harvest scheduling difficult for farmers. Smallholder farmers have higher transaction costs, in part because of low economies of scale and low bargaining power. Farmer producer organizations may reduce these costs and address some of the disadvantages of smallholder farmers. Cooperative and contract farming may shift the risk of price fluctuations away from farmers to retailers. Indian farmers might also benefit from access to accurate price information and clear grading standards using the National Agriculture Market (eNAM), India's electronic trading platform that aims to connect APMCs into a central market. However, eNAM only connects 9% of APMC markets, with slow uptake and usage.

Compared to staple crops, the quality of nonstaple crops is more variable. While instrumental measurements reduce variation between supply chain actors, Indian fruit and vegetable wholesale market services and infrastructure remain basic, with limited use of modern technology and methods to identify and communicate quality differences. The eNAM platform indicates commodity quality parameters for fresh fruits and vegetables traded in the wholesale markets, such as the presence of defects, discoloration, the presence of physical injuries, and fruit size. It remains to be seen how quality parameters will be measured and communicated in practice. Further, desirable product attributes for fresh markets and processing markets may differ. Tomato varieties intended for fresh markets are typically evaluated on appearance, taste, and handling, whereas varieties for processing are evaluated on viscosity and soluble solids. In the Chittoor district, we observed tomato traders from juice factories purchasing tomatoes, usually from the lowest quality and price lots. Several "dual purpose" tomato varieties have been developed for fresh and processing uses, but they are not yet commercially available.

Determinants of loss at farmer stages

After adjusting for multiple covariates, the odds of preharvest quality loss occurring in harvests that took place during the peak season (April–July) were 83% lower (OR, 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04–0.75) than those of harvests during the off-peak season (Table 4). Because tomatoes are harvested multiple times per plot, we accounted for the harvest number reported by farmers. At least half of harvests surveyed were between the third to sixth harvest on the respective plot (Supplemental Table 4). Harvests with a later harvest number had odds of preharvest quality loss occurring that were 19% lower (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66–0.98) than those harvests with earlier harvest numbers (Table 4). Among harvests with preharvest quality loss, an increase of 100 rupees per 30 kg in expected price for tomatoes was associated with 15% less quality loss (SE = 0.04, P < 0.001). After adjusting for multiple covariates, the odds of a postharvest FLW occurring in harvests that took place during the peak season are 88% lower (OR, 0.12; 95% CI: 0.05–0.29) than those of harvests that took during the off-peak season (Table 5). Among harvests with postharvest FLW, harvesting during the peak season was associated with 63% less loss compared to harvests during the off-peak season (SE, 0.31; P < 0.01). Larger harvests show increased odds of postharvest FLW. For each additional 30 kg of tomatoes harvested, the odds of postharvest loss increased by 2% (OR, 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00–1.03). Among all harvests, harvests with on-farm grading and sorting had odds of postharvest FLW occurring that are 7.1 times (OR, 7.07; 95% CI: 3.31–15.10) those of harvests without on-farm grading and sorting. However, among harvests with a postharvest FLW > 0% of the total harvest, on-farm grading and sorting was associated with 51% less loss than harvests without on-farm grading (SE, 0.30; P < 0.05). Finally, preharvest damage was associated with postharvest FLW; among harvests with postharvest FLW, a one-percentage-point increase in preharvest damage was associated with a 2% greater postharvest loss (SE, 0.01; P < 0.01). Of note, 100% of farmers used plastic crates for transporting tomatoes to the market (data not shown). At the Madanapalle wholesale market, after adjusting for multiple covariates, harvests that had male family members or female hired laborers involved in either the farm-level packing or market-level grading had increased odds of preauction FLW compared to harvests without male family or female hired labor (Table 6). Among harvests with preauction FLW, the peak season was associated with 72% less preauction loss compared to harvests marketed during the off-peak season (SE, 0.34; P < 0.001).

### Translating advice to eat more vegetables into practice: observations from a 12-month weight loss trial [^114aiukJ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to identify the main vegetable sources of overweight participants during a 12-month randomised controlled trial for weight loss.

Methods

Secondary analysis using data from diet history interviews to determine changes to daily vegetable intake amounts and types throughout the trial at 0, 3 and 12 months.

Results

Pre-trial 77% participants consumed frozen vegetables. At baseline (n = 113, 85F), participants reported 345 ± 170 (56–920)g/day vegetables increasing to 498 ± 180 (146–930)g/day at 3 months and remaining stable at 475 ± 169(170–1053)g/day by 12 months (p = 0.001). At baseline, 32 of 34 different vegetable categories were reported, mainly tomato (69.9g/day) and, potato (58.2g/day). After 3 months (n = 109), seven vegetables remained in the top 10 reported (contributing 72%). Tomato remained top ranked to 12 months.

Conclusion

Following advice to consume more vegetables, consumption increased above the Australian Dietary recommendation of ~375g/day. Tomatoes remained a mainstay regardless of the time of year, but choices changed with time. Frozen vegetables may be a feasible option.

Food loss estimates

We report statistics on FLW estimates at the farmer stages in Table 3 and at the wholesale and retail stages in Supplemental Table 3. Aggregate postharvest FLW from farm to retail totaled between 9.1% to 13.4% of the total tomato quantity, based on the destination FLW and declared FLW methods, respectively (Table 3; Supplemental Table 3). Out of 275 surveyed harvests, farmers reported that they decided to harvest based on the tomato ripeness 82% of the time and typically did not leave harvest-ready tomatoes on the field during a harvest. The majority of harvests included tomatoes that had some form of preharvest quality loss, which typically remained below 14% of harvested tomatoes among harvests with loss. Farmers reported damage from pests, disease, or animals as the major cause of preharvest quality loss over half of the time (61% of harvests with preharvest quality loss), followed by too much sun or rain or a lack of rain (21% and 10% of harvests, respectively). Over half of harvests had declared FLW at the postharvest farm level. Among harvests with losses, 9%–10% of the total harvest was lost (Table 3). The postharvest, farm-level FLW using the declared loss method was significantly different than the loss estimated using the destination loss method (Figure 2). Among all harvests at this stage, the median declared FLW was greater than the destination FLW using the "any, nonuse criteria" (2.3% and 0.0%, respectively; Table 3). The postharvest, farm-level FLW estimates defined by nonfood use were significantly different than the estimates defined by nonproductive use (Figure 2). For harvests brought to the Madanapalle wholesale market, 58% of harvests had some FLW at the preauction, market level. Among those with preauction FLW, typically ≤ 2% of the total harvest was lost (Table 3). The preauction, market-level FLW estimates using the declared method were not significantly different than the loss estimates defined by nonfood use, but were significantly different than the estimates defined by nonproductive use (Figure 2). At both the farm and market levels, tomatoes were diverted either to animal feed or discarded as trash. Farmers typically do not expect remuneration for tomatoes diverted to animal feed. Farmers reported diverting totals of 58 and 77 groups of tomatoes to animal feed at the farm and market levels, respectively, and expected to receive a median price of 0 rupees (IQR, 0–0 rupees). Farmers reported pests, disease, and animals as major causes of postharvest and preauction FLW values (73% and 49%, respectively), followed by too much sun or rain (19% and 26%, respectively).

Results

Supply chain actor characteristics

Among 145 farm households enrolled (Supplemental Figure 1), 48% never harvested tomatoes during the study period (Table 1). We observed significant differences by households with and without harvests for agriculture as a main source of income (P = 0.04), as well as by caste (P = 0.002). There was no significant difference between households and enrollment period (P = 0.34). Among the 56 households without harvests that were enrolled before the 2019 peak harvest season, 71% reported water scarcity as the main reason for never harvesting tomatoes. Unfortunately, no data were collected on the stage at which these farmers stopped production activities. There were no other significant differences between households for the remaining characteristics considered.

TABLE 1
Enrolled household characteristics by households with and without harvest 1

We surveyed a total of 276 harvests at the farm level, of which 201 were brought to the Madanapalle wholesale market and surveyed (Table 2). Most households brought their harvests to the Madanapalle wholesale market at least once during the survey period. We surveyed a median of three harvests per household (IQR, 3–6 harvests). Across a total of 23 plots, 15 different households stopped harvesting tomatoes early. Farmers ended harvests early on 26% of plots (n = 6) because of low market prices. Additional reasons for stopping the harvests early included water scarcity, poor-quality tomatoes, and disease or pest damage. At the farm-level and market-level surveys, there was a median of one respondent per household (IQRs, 1–2 and 1–1 respondents, respectively), indicating that we typically surveyed the same household member across surveys. The majority of respondents at the farm- and market-level surveys were male, and half had at least a secondary education. Most respondents were the household head, followed by the adult child of the household head.

### The effect of food price changes on consumer purchases: a randomised experiment [^113nRN96]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Most evidence on health-related food taxes and subsidies relies on observational data and effects on single nutrients or foods instead of total diet. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of randomly assigned food price variations on consumer purchasing, where sets of prices emulated commonly discussed food tax and subsidy policies, including a subsidy on fruit and vegetables, a sweetened beverage tax, and taxes on foods according to sugar, sodium, and saturated fat content.

Methods

In this study, adult participants (≥ 18 years) in New Zealand completed up to five weekly shops in a virtual supermarket. Each shopping occasion was randomly allocated to control (no change in prices) or one or more pricing options simulating the following: a fruit and vegetable subsidy (20%), a sweetened beverage tax (20% or 40%), a saturated fat tax (NZ$2 per 100 g or $4 per 100 g saturated fat), a salt tax ($0.02 per 100 mg or $0.04 per 100 mg sodium), or sugar tax ($0.40 per 100 g or $0.80 per 100 g sugar). The primary outcome was the healthiness of the total shopping basket for each weekly shop (% of total unit food items defined as healthy). Low and high price change options were combined in analyses (eg, results for a saturated fat tax are an average of $2 per 100 g or $4 per 100 g).

Findings

Between Feb 1, and Dec 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 1132 shoppers, of whom 1038 (91.7%) completed at least one shop and 743 (71.6%) completed all five shops. Overall, data from 4258 shops were included in the analysis, including 645 control shops, 2545 shops where one policy was activated, and 1068 shops with two (or more) policies activated. In the control condition, 67.90% (SD 13.01) of food purchases were classified as healthy. Three of the five policies increased this proportion by a small, but significant amount (saturated fat tax mean absolute difference 1.77%, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.52, p < 0.0001; sugar tax 1.09%, 0.26 to 1.91, p = 0.0099; and salt tax 1.31%, 0.50 to 2.13, p = 0.0016). The sweetened beverage tax and fruit and vegetable subsidy resulted in non-significant increases of 0.18% (95% CI -0.49 to 0.85, p = 0.60) and 0.41% (-0.26 to 1.07, p = 0.23), respectively. Both the saturated fat tax and salt tax resulted in the following important substitution effects: an increase in fruit and vegetable purchases as a percentage by weight of all food purchases (saturated fat tax 4.0%, 0.9 to 7.1; salt tax 4.3%, 0.9 to 7.7); but also an increase in sugar as a percentage of total energy (saturated fat tax 5.0%, 2.1 to 7.9; salt tax 3.2%, 0.0 to 6.5). Interaction terms for combined policies were mostly non-significant, consistent with additive effects of policy combinations.

Interpretation

Price changes representing saturated fat, sugar, and salt taxes increased total healthy food purchases. As we observed important substitution effects, a combination of different tax and subsidy policies might be the most effective way to improve diets and decrease diet-related chronic diseases.

### Potential impacts of post-brexit agricultural policy on fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular disease in england: a modelling study [^115bPPr7]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Table 2
Changes in fruit and vegetable land in the first year of the modelling period (2021), at the end of the agricultural transition period (2027) and at the end of the modelling period (2030) under each modelled scenario

Scenario 1: 10% of Grade 1–2 land (land suitable for F&V production) in England.

Scenario 2: 20% of Grade 1–2 land (land suitable for F&V production) in England.

We translated increases in agricultural land into increases in F&V production, assuming that F&V yield and the relative difference between F&V agricultural land would not change over time. Extra agricultural production of F&V was then translated into extra F&V purchases using a purchases-to-supply ratio and assuming that all extra production would be mirrored by increased consumer demand. The ratio, estimated using data on F&V purchases and supply in the UK, adjusted for potential losses between the farm and the consumer, including losses at the packaging, distribution and retailing stages, as well as F&V used towards production of processed foods. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, we further investigated the impact of this ratio by assuming that only 50% of F&V production would be translated into F&V purchases, based on estimates on F&V production losses from the Food and Agriculture Organization. We observed no persistent trend of the ratio over time, although annual variations were taken into account in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We also assumed a time lag between the decision to shift agricultural land towards F&V and F&V reaching consumer baskets. This was set at 2.5 years on average for all F&V and was allowed to vary between 0 and 5 years in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. This reflected variation in the production cycle of different crops, with some entering the market at the same year of their production, whereas others, such as apple orchards, taking at least 5 years to go through a complete production cycle.

Finally, changes in F&V purchases were translated into changes in F&V intake after accounting for F&V waste at household level. Changes in F&V intake were estimated at national level and translated into changes per person per day using population projections between 2021 to 2030 from the ONS. We assumed that extra F&V intake will be distributed equally among all age, sex and IMD groups. Relevant model inputs are presented in online supplementary appendix table A3.

### Food loss of perishable produce from farm to retail: evidence from tomato supply chains in south India [^1145JqzE]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Case study context

Tomatoes are an important horticultural crop in India. Along with onions and potatoes, tomatoes are among the top three vegetables and tubers produced. India ranks second in global tomato production, behind China. Tomato production in India is primarily carried out by smallholder farmers. Farmers usually sell tomatoes to local aggregators or through public, state-run wholesale markets operated by Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). In urban vegetable wholesale markets, traders source a variety of vegetables, including tomatoes, from wholesale markets and sell to other urban traders and retailers. Less than 1% of tomatoes produced in India are processed.

Andhra Pradesh produced the most tomatoes of any Indian state in 2017–2018, and the Chittoor district is a major producing district in Andhra Pradesh. North of the Chittoor district, Hyderabad is the sixth most populous metropolis in India, and is among the many cities that import tomatoes from the Chittoor district.

Farmers growing tomatoes in the Chittoor district are smallholders, with average operating land areas of 2.1 acres. Most of the population in the Chittoor district is involved in agriculture, either as producers (23%) or laborers (39%). In this region, the peak tomato harvest occurs during April to July. The Madanapalle APMC in the Chittoor district is the largest tomato wholesale market in Andhra Pradesh, and is among the major tomato trading hubs in India. Commission agents coordinate auctions between farmers and tomato traders. In reality, commissions agents are also tomato traders themselves. Once sold, tomatoes are repacked into plastic crates and loaded onto large trucks for transport.

In Hyderabad, vegetable wholesale markets trade tomatoes sourced from within and outside of Telangana, including from Madanapalle. It takes 10 to 12 hours for a truck loaded with tomatoes to travel the 550 km from the Madanapalle market to Hyderabad. Vegetables arrive to the wholesale market before sunrise. Trading is usually finished by late morning or early afternoon. Both traditional and modern vegetable retailers in Hyderabad purchase tomatoes from vegetable wholesale markets.

Descriptive statistics of FLW surveys in the Chittoor district 1

Supplemental Table 2 summarizes tomato-trader, vegetable-trader, and vegetable-retailer characteristics. We enrolled a total of 83 tomato traders. The number of surveys given per tomato trader was skewed, averaging a mean of 2.4 surveys per trader (SD, 3.3 surveys), and a median of one survey per trader. In Hyderabad, of the 224 vegetable traders screened during the census, 78 (35%) vegetable traders were eligible and 52 traders participated (Supplemental Figure 2). Of the 66 vegetable retailers referred by participating vegetable traders, 61 (91%) retailers were eligible and 50 retailers participated (Supplemental Figure 3). Most vegetable retailers were located at daily markets (70%).

### Evaluation of a national supermarket intervention supporting vulnerable families in healthy meal practices: a natural experiment [^11468RAB]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The effects were measured on three dependent variables. First, the primary outcome measure was the proportion of budget spent on vegetables, relative to the "total spending" of each participant every 2 weeks, since the use of vegetables could be directly linked to the use of the recipes. Under vegetables, we considered fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables. Second, there were two secondary outcome measures: (1) the proportion of budget spent on prepackaged meals and (2) the proportion of budget spent on sweet and salty snacks, relative to the "total spending" of each participant every 2 weeks. Under prepackaged meals, we considered ready-to-(h)eat meals such as pizzas, prepared meals, and salads, and under sweet and salty snacks we considered cookies, chips, cakes, etc. In calculating these measurements, we always used the unit price, without the discounts of the intervention, in order to estimate changes in volume before and after enrollment. The proportion of budget spent on these outcome variables was used, because we had information on the price of the products, but not on the exact weights or pieces of the products.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^113V5FQK]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary intakes of fruit by US children fall far short of national recommendations. The Choose MyPlate recommends consuming between 1.0 to 2.5 cups of fruit per day, depending on age, gender, and physical activity. By contrast, the estimated mean daily intakes for fruit (including 100% fruit juice) for 4–18y olds are about 1 cup per day, though older children consume less. For reference, 1.0 cup of fruit corresponds to a small apple (106 g), large banana (136 g), 32 seedless grapes (160 g), large orange (184 g), 8 large strawberries (166 g) or 1 cup of fruit juice (248 g or 8 fluid ounces). Numerous interventions, in pre-school, school, and family settings have been developed to address the shortfall and fruit consumption and to improve the quality of children's diets, though fruit consumption remains well below recommended levels. Consuming adequate amounts of fruit is important in ensuring nutrient adequacy, particularly for vitamin C, potassium, and dietary fiber, and may also reduce the risk of weight gain due to their low energy density. Furthermore, fruit consumption in childhood predicts fruit consumption in adulthood, which may reduce the risk of some chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease.

Approximately, 40% of total fruit consumed by children comes from 100% fruit juice. The consumption of 100% fruit juice, in observational studies, has been found to be associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity, and some prospective studies among adults have observed that juice consumption is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. One argument is that sugar consumption in the absence of dietary fiber is associated with excess weight gain, liver injury and the metabolic syndrome. To this end, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends 100% fruit juice be limited to 4–6 fl oz for children aged 1–6y and 8–12 fl oz for children 7–18y. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 4–6 fl oz of fruit juice per day and the new food package for the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program reduced 100% juice allowances by half.

### Sustainability of three apple production systems [^111NRLF4]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Escalating production costs, heavy reliance on non-renewable resources, reduced biodiversity, water contamination, chemical residues in food, soil degradation and health risks to farm workers handling pesticides all bring into question the sustainability of conventional farming systems. It has been claimed, however, that organic farming systems are less efficient, pose greater health risks and produce half the yields of conventional farming systems. Nevertheless, organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of US and European agriculture during the 1990s. Integrated farming, using a combination of organic and conventional techniques, has been successfully adopted on a wide scale in Europe. Here we report the sustainability of organic, conventional and integrated apple production systems in Washington State from 1994 to 1999. All three systems gave similar apple yields. The organic and integrated systems had higher soil quality and potentially lower negative environmental impact than the conventional system. When compared with the conventional and integrated systems, the organic system produced sweeter and less tart apples, higher profitability and greater energy efficiency. Our data indicate that the organic system ranked first in environmental and economic sustainability, the integrated system second and the conventional system last.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^112C136D]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Models to address fruit shortfall

The shortfall in total fruit intake for each participant was quantified by identifying optimum amounts of total fruit by age and gender group based on the Choose MyPlate recommendations. For children 4–5y and girls 6–8y, 1.0 cup was the reference value. For boys 6–8y, all children 9–12y, and girls 13–18y, 1.5 cups was the reference value. For boys 13–18y, 2 servings was the reference value. The shortfall was defined as the difference between the reference value and the amount consumed by each participant assuming that the participant consumed less than the reference amount.

Models were then developed to obtain the recommended amount of total fruit. In the Fruit Juice plus Whole Fruit (FJ + WF) Model, dietary recommendations for fruit were reached using a combination of 100% fruit juice and whole fruit, though the amount of 100% fruit juice that could be used to achieve the recommended fruit intake was capped at the level recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (1.5 servings of fruit juice for age 8+ and 0.63 for age 4–7) and whole fruit was used thereafter. The limit applied both to fruit juice consumed and juice included in the modeling. An individual consuming more than 1.5 servings of whole fruit would only have up-to 1.5 servings of 100% fruit juice used in the models. While individuals already consuming more than 1.5 servings of fruit juice (or 0.63 for young children) were included in the analysis, in no case did the modeling increase the number of fruit juice servings beyond the recommended maximum number of servings. An alternative Whole Fruit (WF) Model was specified that met dietary recommendations for total fruit using whole fruit alone, including fresh, frozen, canned and dried varieties, which were weighted by their frequency of consumption.

### Association of a fruit and vegetable subsidy program with food purchases by individuals with low income in the US [^114BJAs6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

SuperSNAP

SuperSNAP provided $40 per month in additional funds to SNAP beneficiaries that could be spent on fresh, frozen, or canned fruits and vegetables with no added sugar, fat, or salt. SuperSNAP benefits could be redeemed at any location of a single supermarket chain. Eligible foods were programmed into the supermarket point-of-sale system, and when eligible foods were purchased, the cost of those foods was deducted from the available SuperSNAP balance at the point of purchase. SuperSNAP participants were adults (age, ≥ 18 years) who were current SNAP beneficiaries and identified by staff at their primary care clinic as likely to benefit from the program because of their health status (eg, owing to diabetes or obesity). Participants were enrolled by clinic staff at 9 clinics — primarily federally qualified health care centers — throughout North Carolina. Participants completed a brief enrollment survey with clinic staff; the survey included questions about household composition, food security (using the Hunger Vital Sign 2-item screener), and proportion of food shopping done at the supermarket chain. Access to the program expired if participants did not spend any SuperSNAP benefits for 2 consecutive months, and unused benefits at the end of each month rolled over for 2 months.

### Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis [^1175gp39]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

The EAT-Lancet Commission drew on all available nutritional and environmental evidence to construct the first global benchmark diet capable of sustaining health and protecting the planet, but it did not assess dietary affordability. We used food price and household income data to estimate affordability of EAT-Lancet benchmark diets, as a first step to guiding interventions to improve diets around the world.

Methods

We obtained retail prices from 2011 for 744 foods in 159 countries, collected under the International Comparison Program. We used these data to identify the most affordable foods to meet EAT-Lancet targets. We compared total diet cost per day to each country's mean per capita household income, calculated the proportion of people for whom the most affordable EAT-Lancet diet exceeds total income, and also measured affordability relative to a least-cost diet that meets essential nutrient requirements.

Findings

The most affordable EAT-Lancet diets cost a global median of US$2.84 per day (IQR 2.41–3.16) in 2011, of which the largest share was the cost of fruits and vegetables (31.2%), followed by legumes and nuts (18.7%), meat, eggs, and fish (15.2%), and dairy (13.2%). This diet costs a small fraction of average incomes in high-income countries but is not affordable for the world's poor. We estimated that the cost of an EAT-Lancet diet exceeded household per capita income for at least 1.58 billion people. The EAT-Lancet diet is also more expensive than the minimum cost of nutrient adequacy, on average, by a mean factor of 1.60 (IQR 1.41–1.78).

Interpretation

Current diets differ greatly from EAT-Lancet targets. Improving diets is affordable in many countries but for many people would require some combination of higher income, nutritional assistance, and lower prices. Data and analysis for the cost of healthier foods are needed to inform both local interventions and systemic changes.

### The dynamics of fresh fruit and vegetable pricing in the supermarket channel [^113jTjd1]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This paper explains the major factors that contribute to the complicated price formation process, as several levels, of fresh fruit and vegetables in the US. Several factors are explored: marketing channels, market structure changes, pricing techniques and promotional impacts, retail responses to supply changes, and price versus value. The paper illustrates with recent examples and research findings that the fresh produce system is dynamic and that simplistic solutions to complex problems are not likely. The paper finishes by suggesting some areas for needed additional research.

### Are energy-dense foods really cheaper? Reexamining the relation between food price and energy density [^1118oeie]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The inverse relation between energy density (kcal/g) and energy cost (price/kcal) has been interpreted to suggest that produce (fruit, vegetables) is more expensive than snacks (cookies, chips).

Objective

The objective of this study was to show the methodologic weakness of comparing energy density with energy cost.

Design

The relation between energy density and energy cost was replicated in a random-number data set. Additionally, observational data were collected for produce and snacks from an online supermarket. Variables included total energy (kcal), total weight (g), total number of servings, serving size (g/serving), and energy density (kcal/g). Price measures included energy cost ($/kcal), total price ($), unit price ($/g), and serving price ($/serving). Two-tailed t tests were used to compare price measures by food category. Relations between energy density and price measures within food categories were examined with the use of Spearman rank correlation analysis.

Results

The relation between energy density and energy cost was shown to be driven by the algebraic properties of these variables. Food category was strongly correlated with both energy density and food price measures. Energy cost was higher for produce than for snacks. However, total price and unit price were lower for produce. Serving price and serving size were greater for produce than for snacks. Within food categories, energy density was uncorrelated with most measures of food price, except for a weak positive correlation with serving price within the produce category.

Conclusion

The findings suggest the relation between energy density and food price is confounded by food category and depends on which measure of price is used.

### Influence of price discounts and skill-building strategies on purchase and consumption of healthy food and beverages: outcomes of the supermarket healthy eating for life randomized controlled trial [^114eJBnn]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fiscal strategies are increasingly considered upstream nutrition promotion measures. However, few trials have investigated the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of pricing manipulations on diet in real-world settings.

Objective

We assessed the effects on fruit, vegetable, and beverage purchasing and consumption of a 20% price-reduction intervention, a tailored skills-based behavior-change intervention, and a combined intervention compared with a control condition.

Design

The Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life trial was a randomized controlled trial conducted over 3 mo [baseline (time 1) to postintervention (time 2) with a 6-mo follow-up (time 3)]. Female primary household shoppers in Melbourne, Australia, were randomly assigned to a 1) skill-building (n = 160), 2) price-reduction (n = 161), 3) combined skill-building and price-reduction (n = 160), or 4) control (n = 161) group. Supermarket transaction data and surveys were used to measure the following study outcomes: fruit, vegetable, and beverage purchases and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption at each time point.

Results

At 3 mo (time 2), price reduction-alone participants purchased more total vegetables and frozen vegetables than did controls. Price reduction-alone and price reduction-plus-skill-building participants purchased more fruit than did controls. Relative to controls, in the price-reduction group, total vegetable consumption increased by 233 g/wk (3.1 servings or 15% more than at baseline), and fruit purchases increased by 364 g/wk (2.4 servings; 35% more than at baseline). Increases were not maintained 6 mo postintervention (time 3). Price reduction-alone participants showed a tendency for a slight increase in fruit consumption at time 2 (P = 0.09) that was maintained at time 3 (P = 0.014). No intervention improved purchases of bottled water or low-calorie beverages.

Conclusions

A 20% price reduction in fruit and vegetables resulted in increased purchasing per household of 35% for fruit and 15% for vegetables over the price-reduction period. These findings show that price modifications can directly increase produce purchases. The Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life trial was registered at Current Controlled Trials Registration as ISRCTN39432901.

### Evaluation of economic and health outcomes associated with food taxes and subsidies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116euvxW]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Fiscal policy is a promising approach to incentivizing better food choices and reducing the burden of chronic disease. To inform guidelines on using fiscal policies, including taxes and subsidies, to promote health, the World Health Organization commissioned a systematic review and meta-analysis of the worldwide literature on the outcomes of such policies for food products.

Objective

To assess the outcomes of implemented food taxes and subsidies for prices, sales, consumption, and population-level diet and health.

Data Sources

Eight bibliographic databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature and 14 data sources along with governmental websites were searched for grey literature that were published from database inception through June 1, 2020. There were no language and setting restrictions.

Study Selection

Only primary studies of implemented food taxes and subsidies were considered for inclusion.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. A 3-level random-effects model was used to conduct a meta-analysis of sales and consumption outcomes of fruit and vegetable subsidies. Other outcomes were analyzed in a narrative synthesis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Study estimates in the meta-analysis were combined using a price elasticity measure for sales and consumption outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and τ2. Studies varied in how diet and health were measured.

Results

A total of 54 articles were included in the systematic review, of which 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Most food subsidies targeted fruits and vegetables and populations with low income, whereas the evidence on food taxes was primarily from the nonessential energy-dense food tax in Mexico. Sales of subsidized fruits and vegetables increased significantly, with an estimated price elasticity of demand of -0.59 (95% CI, -1.04 to -0.13 [P = 0.02]; 95% prediction interval, -2.07 to 0.90; I2 = 92.4% [95% CI, 89.0%-94.8%; P < .001]), suggesting inelastic demand. There was no significant change in the consumption of subsidized fruits and vegetables, with an estimated price elasticity of demand of -0.17 (95% CI, -0.49 to 0.15 [P = 0.26]; 95% prediction interval, -1.01 to 0.67; I2 = 76.2% [95% CI, 54.3%-87.6%; P < .001]). Food excise taxes were associated with higher prices and reduced sales. Evidence was limited on the differential outcomes of food taxes and subsidies across subpopulations.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that fruit and vegetable subsidies were associated with a moderate increase in fruit and vegetable sales. Further research is warranted to understand the implications of food taxes and subsidies for population-level consumption, diet, and health outcomes.

### Accounting for consumers' preferences in the analysis of dietary recommendations [^1166Kmcp]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

To illustrate the dietary changes induced by the adoption of a recommendation and the mechanisms that explain the changes, we first present the impact of a 5% increase in F&V consumption. Table 1 displays the intakes (g/day) of the food categories considered in the economic model, the shadow prices corresponding to the F&V recommendation, and the percentage variations in consumption of each food category induced by the rise in F&V consumption, including the F&V contained in ready meals.

Table 1
Initial intakes, shadow prices and variation in the whole diet induced by a 5% increase in F&V consumption (men, well-off consumers)

As shown in Table 1, the shadow prices, which are the prices that would have to prevail to lead spontaneously consumers to increase their F&V consumption by 5%, are lower than current prices for all food groups that contain some F&V. The increase in F&V consumption generates a change in the whole diet. First, the 5% increase in F&V consumption is achieved thanks to a rather large increase in processed F&V, meaning that it is easier for consumers to increase consumption of processed F&V than fresh F&V. The decrease in potatoes and ready-meals consumption is easily understood as a substitution among plant-based foods. The decrease in consumption of milk products (fresh dairy products) is also understood as a substitution with fruits. Finally, there is a decrease in consumption of red and processed meats and an increase in consumption of other meats (poultry), which is likely caused by an income effect.

The adoption cost associated with the adoption of the recommendation is very different for the different consumer groups (Table 2). Thus, the CV ranges from 0.2% of the food budget for the well-off group to 1.6% of the food budget for the modest group, suggesting that the adoption of this recommendation is more difficult for low-income consumers than high-income consumers.

Table 2
Aggregated consumer cost per income groups

If we now turn to the health impact of the seven tested recommendations, it appears that they all improve health as the number of DALYs averted is always positive (Fig. 1). The top three recommendations are the F&V recommendation, which has the largest health impact, recommendations on salty/sweet products, and butter/cream/cheese. Finally, the recommendation targeting consumption of red meat generates the smallest number of DALYs averted.

### Food loss of perishable produce from farm to retail: evidence from tomato supply chains in south India [^114DgMTo]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The current global food system continues to struggle to provide healthy diets in the setting of increasing environmental changes. Shifting towards healthier, environmentally sustainable dietary patterns will require, in part, increased consumption of healthy foods, including fruits and vegetables, improved food production practices, and food loss and waste (FLW) reductions. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, zero hunger, targets agricultural production and nutrition. However, the SDG 2 targets lack coordinated action and overlook value chain actors and activities that connect food production to food consumption. In many global regions, there are already deficits in fruit and vegetable availability to meet dietary recommendations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Fruits and vegetables are among the more perishable food groups and are more at risk of FLW. As part of SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG target 12.3 broadly aims to halve food waste and reduce food loss by 2030. Quantitative FLW refers to a reduction in food mass or volume, whereas food quality loss and waste (also referred to as qualitative FLW) refers to the decrease in food quality (e.g. sensory, nutritional, or food safety attributes) along the food chain without a decrease of dry food matter. The extent of and reasons for FLW can vary widely between supply chain contexts and stages, factors across food groups, the actors involved, and seasons. Understanding the nature, stages, and extent of FLW is essential for FLW reduction. There is also no harmonized FLW definition. There are often inconsistencies in terms of the supply chain stages considered and when unconsumed food is counted as FLW. Several recent studies have used self-report or direct measurement methods to quantify region- and supply chain–specific FLW of perishable foods, finding losses concentrated at the producer level.

Our research examines the extent, stages, and determinants of FLW along perishable vegetable supply chains in South India, from farm to retail. Unique to this study, we use data collected at the harvest and market levels on harvest and market days, respectively, to compare FLW estimates after applying different final use destinations to classify FLW. Using detailed data on production, harvest, and postharvest contexts, we examine the associated determinants of FLW at the farmer stages. Finally, we explore food quality assessments to understand perspectives on desirable food quality attributes across supply chain actors.

### Availability, affordability, and consumption of fruits and vegetables in 18 countries across income levels: findings from the prospective urban rural epidemiology (PURE) study [^1124ZyuL]. The Lancet: Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Several international guidelines recommend the consumption of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day, but their intake is thought to be low worldwide. We aimed to determine the extent to which such low intake is related to availability and affordability.

Methods

We assessed fruit and vegetable consumption using data from country-specific, validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which enrolled participants from communities in 18 countries between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2013. We documented household income data from participants in these communities; we also recorded the diversity and non-sale prices of fruits and vegetables from grocery stores and market places between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2013. We determined the cost of fruits and vegetables relative to income per household member. Linear random effects models, adjusting for the clustering of households within communities, were used to assess mean fruit and vegetable intake by their relative cost.

Findings

Of 143305 participants who reported plausible energy intake in the food frequency questionnaire, mean fruit and vegetable intake was 3.76 servings (95% CI 3.66–3.86) per day. Mean daily consumption was 2.14 servings (1.93–2.36) in low-income countries (LICs), 3.17 servings (2.99–3.35) in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), 4.31 servings (4.09–4.53) in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and 5.42 servings (5.13–5.71) in high-income countries (HICs). In 130402 participants who had household income data available, the cost of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day per individual accounted for 51.97% (95% CI 46.06–57.88) of household income in LICs, 18.10% (14.53–21.68) in LMICs, 15.87% (11.51–20.23) in UMICs, and 1.85% (-3.90 to 7.59) in HICs (ptrend = 0.0001). In all regions, a higher percentage of income to meet the guidelines was required in rural areas than in urban areas (p < 0.0001 for each pairwise comparison). Fruit and vegetable consumption among individuals decreased as the relative cost increased (ptrend = 0.00040).

Interpretation

The consumption of fruit and vegetables is low worldwide, particularly in LICs, and this is associated with low affordability. Policies worldwide should enhance the availability and affordability of fruits and vegetables.

### Food loss of perishable produce from farm to retail: evidence from tomato supply chains in south India [^115RAgT1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Reducing food loss and waste (FLW) may narrow gaps between fruit and vegetable production and recommended intake. However, FLW estimates are inconsistent due to varying estimation methods.

Objectives

Using multiple estimation approaches, we examined the extent and determinants of FLW along tomato supply chains in South India, from farm to retail. We also explored tomato quality assessments.

Methods

We surveyed 75 farm households and 83 tomato traders in the Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, and 52 vegetable traders and 50 vegetable retailers in Hyderabad, Telangana, on harvest and market days. We calculated declared FLW values using participant-reported losses to estimate the preharvest quality FLW and quantitative FLW values at the farmer, vegetable-trader, and vegetable-retailer stages. We calculated the destination FLW based on counted crates diverted to loss destinations, using participant-reported destinations (animal feed, field discard), to estimate the postharvest FLW from farm to retail. We used pile sorting with farmers to explore on-farm quality assessments.

Results

The average preharvest quality FLW was 13.9% of harvested tomatoes. From farm to retail, the quantitative FLW was greatest at the postharvest, farm level. Among all harvests, the median postharvest, farm-level FLW was 0.0% (IQR, 0.0%-7.9%) using the destination FLW approach (tomatoes diverted to nonfood uses) and 2.3% (IQR, 0.0%-12.5%) using the declared FLW approach (P < 0.05). Among harvests with a non-zero postharvest, farm-level FLW, the median FLW was 9.1% (IQR, 2.4%-16.7%) using the destination FLW approach (tomatoes diverted to nonfood uses) and 10.0% (IQR, 2.9%-16.7%) using the declared FLW approach. Harvesting during peak season was a determinant of postharvest, farm-level and preauction, market-level FLW values. Farmers prioritize color/ripeness attributes while harvesting and tomato size while grading.

Conclusions

Single-point estimates may obscure FLW patterns for perishable, indeterminate crops and depend on data collection and estimation methods. Reducing FLW of perishables requires the integration of quantitative and qualitative FLW estimation methods.

### Effect of financial incentives and default options on food choices of adults with low income in online retail settings: a randomized clinical trial [^115dJqCz]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Despite recent growth in online redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, no previous work has tested the impact of economic and behavioral economic strategies on food purchasing behaviors in an online grocery retail setting among adults with low income.

Objective

To examine the extent to which financial incentives and default shopping cart options influence fruit and vegetable purchases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial used an experimental online grocery store for adults who currently or have ever received SNAP benefits. From October 7 to December 2, 2021, participants were instructed to shop for a week's worth of groceries for their household, with a budget tailored to household size; no payment was taken.

Interventions

Random assignment to 1 of 4 conditions: no intervention, 50% discount on eligible fruits and vegetables, prefilled shopping carts with tailored fruit and vegetable items (ie, default options), or a combination of the discount and default options.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of nondiscounted dollars spent on eligible fruit and vegetables per basket.

Results

Of 2744 participants, mean (SD) age was 46.7 (16.0) years, and 1447 (52.7%) identified as women. A total of 1842 participants (67.1%) reported currently receiving SNAP benefits and 1492 (54.4%) reported shopping online for groceries in the previous 12 months. Participants spent a mean (SD) 20.5% (23.5%) of total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables. Compared with no intervention, those in the discount condition spent 4.7% (98.3% CI, 1.7%-7.7%) of more total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables; those in the default condition, 7.8% (98.3% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) more; and those in the combination condition, 13.0% (98.3% CI, 10.0%-16.0%) more (P < .001 for all). There was no difference between the discount and the default conditions (P = 0.06), but the effect in the combination condition was significantly larger than both discount and default conditions (P < .001). Default shopping cart items were purchased by 679 participants (93.4%) in the default condition and 655 (95.5%) in the combination condition, whereas 297 (45.8%) in the control and 361 (52.9%) in the discount conditions purchased those items (P < .001). No variation was observed by age, sex, or race and ethnicity, and results were similar when those who reported never shopping online for groceries were excluded.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, financial incentives for fruits and vegetables and default options, especially in combination, led to meaningful increases in online fruit and vegetable purchases among adults with low income.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^1124F2VV]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The results of modeling to meet the total fruit shortfall among all children (n = 2,647) and children with a shortfall in fruit consumption (n = 1,781) are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Data are presented for all children and by age group. Among all children and those with a shortfall in fruit intake, the average shortfall was 0.75 (95% CI 0.71, 0.80) and 1.09 servings (95% CI 1.06, 1.12), respectively. First, meeting total fruit guidelines by whole fruit (WF) alone or a combination of fruit juice and whole fruit (FJ + WF) would increase total energy intakes by no more than 6% or less than 100 kcal/d, with the WF + FJ model resulting in greater increases in total energy than the WF model. In the FJ + WF model, vitamin C, dietary fiber, calcium and potassium increased by +61% (+48 mg/d), +4.7% (+0.7 g/d), +7.9% (+85 mg/d), and +11.7% (264 mg/d) respectively. In the WF model vitamin C, dietary fiber, calcium and potassium increased by +29% (23 mg/d), +16% (+2.2 g/d), +1.3% (+14 mg/d), and +9.0% (+203 mg/d), respectively. When comparing the impacts of the two models to each other, the FJ + WF model resulted in significant increases in vitamin C (+25.1% [95% CI 22.2, 27.9], comparing WF + FJ to the FJ model), and modest increases in calcium (6.5% [95% CI 5.9, 7.1) and potassium (2.5% [95% CI 2.3, 2.7]), while the WF model resulted in 9.5% (95% CI 8.7, 10.3) lower dietary fiber. The FJ + WF model resulted in a 5.2% (95% CI 4.7, 5.7%) increase in diet costs, while the WF model resulted in a 9.9% increase (95% CI 9.0, 10.8%). Comparing the two models to each other, the WF + FJ model resulted in a 4.3% (95% CI 3.9, 4.6) decrease in diet cost when compared to the WF model. In general, results were similar across age groups (shown in Table 2) and when stratified by race/ethnicity and family income (data not shown).

### Food loss of perishable produce from farm to retail: evidence from tomato supply chains in south India [^1166tcvG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Opportunities exist for FLW reduction along vegetable supply chains to help close the gap between vegetable production and recommended intake and to achieve more sustainable and healthier diets. Particularly for perishable vegetables, factors including preharvest damage, postharvest practices, and market conditions and prices can increase FLW. In this study of tomato supply chains in South India, food quality loss and waste occurred as early as preharvest, and most FLW occurred postharvest, before tomatoes left the farm. On harvest days, market-ready tomatoes were rarely left on the field. These findings differ from results along traditional tomato supply chains in Colombia, where farmers reported an average of 7.5% unharvested tomatoes and 13.6% unsold tomatoes during the last completed tomato crop cycle. Comparability with other studies is challenging because of the different loss estimation methods used, reference periods, and stages considered. When we considered different FLW estimation methods, we arrived at different estimates at the farmer and retailer stages. Postharvest, farmers reported higher FLW than was observed by counting crates for nonfood destinations; however, this difference disappeared at the preauction, market level. At the farmer and retailer stages, higher FLW estimates were observed when classifying nonfood destinations as loss, compared to nonproductive destinations. Losses were lowest at the trader stages, regardless of the destination loss method. Among the several determinants of FLW at the farmer stages, harvesting during the peak season was a significant determinant across all stages, indicating the potential importance of seasonal supply-and-demand factors on food loss as early as during the preharvest. Supply chain actors consider a number of tomato attributes when evaluating quality, primarily size and color. Farmers prioritize the color and ripeness level at the time of harvest and the fruit size at the time of grading.

### Association of a fruit and vegetable subsidy program with food purchases by individuals with low income in the US [^112ftYEj]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Food insecurity is associated with a less healthy diet. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is associated with reduced food insecurity, but benefit levels may be insufficient for beneficiaries to afford healthy foods.

Objective

To evaluate whether participation in SuperSNAP, a program that provides an additional $40 per month for the purchase of fruits and vegetables with no added sugar, sodium, or fat to SNAP beneficiaries, is associated with changes in food purchasing.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This longitudinal cohort study used data from transaction records of a large supermarket chain with approximately 500 stores located across North Carolina from October 2019 to April 2020. Participants were SNAP beneficiaries.

Exposure

SuperSNAP participation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly spending on all fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts (primary outcome); spending on less healthy food categories; and spending on sugar-sweetened beverages as 1 category of less healthy foods. Monthly data on purchases by SNAP beneficiaries before and during SuperSNAP participation were compared with data from SNAP beneficiaries not enrolled in the program who shopped at the same stores. Overlap weighting (a propensity score-based method) was used to account for confounding, and linear mixed-effects models were fitted with random effects to account for repeated measures and clustering by store.

Results

The study included 667 SuperSNAP participants and 33 246 SNAP beneficiaries who did not use SuperSNAP but shopped in the same stores; 436 SuperSNAP participants had preintervention data and were included in the main analysis. SuperSNAP participation was associated with increased monthly purchases of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes ($31.84; 95% CI, $31.27-$32.42; P < .001; 294.52 oz; 95% CI, 288.84–300.20 oz; P < .001). Only a small increase in spending on less healthy food categories compared with the SNAP beneficiaries who did not use SuperSNAP ($1.60; 95% CI, $0.67-$2.53; P < .001) was observed. As total spending increased, the proportion of total food and beverage spending on less healthy foods significantly decreased (difference, 4.51%; 95% CI, 4.27%-4.74%; P < .001). Monthly spending on sugar-sweetened beverages decreased (difference, $1.83; 95% CI, $1.30-$2.36; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, participation in SuperSNAP was associated with meaningful increases in healthy food purchasing. Subsequent studies should investigate whether healthy food incentive programs improve health outcomes.

### Production costs and potential prices for biosimilars of human insulin and insulin analogues [^114BFqPs]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The key limitation of our analysis is the large number of assumptions that were necessary in order to arrive at estimates of biosimilar prices.

There are expenses in biosimilar manufacture that are not individually considered in this analysis, such as capital expenditures, quality assurance and control, registration costs, costs associated with adherence to manufacturing regulations, and maintaining an aseptic manufacturing process. However, we have included a conservative assumption for the total costs of bringing a biosimilar to market. In addition, many of these costs are likely to be already represented in the estimated costs of API, which are based on completed sales and/or price quotes. By removing the cost of paying a profit margin to a third-party API manufacturer, inhouse production of API or domestic rather than international procurement would likely reduce costs and result in lower prices, or afford manufacturers higher profit margins, than the prices estimated in this analysis. Similarly, the assumed cost of formulation for the 'conservative' formula is based on sales prices of finished phial products, which would also include capital, quality control and operating expenditures.

Our estimated prices assume purchase directly from the manufacturer, including a mark-up for transportation costs. Final prices to patients or health systems may include additional mark-ups added during the supply chain. These mark-ups will vary between countries, as they may be subject to local negotiations, regulations and other factors. In some cases, these additional mark-ups can be very large. Beyond a margin for import tariffs and transport, we have not included estimates for these mark-ups as our estimates (and comparisons with current prices) are made from the perspective of government procurement. High supply chain mark-ups, where they exist, would be a priority target for cost-containment measures.

We estimated sustainable prices for the 10 mL phial formulation and did not estimate the price of pen or cartridge formulations. This limits the ability to compare estimated prices with current lowest prices as reported by the ACCISS study, as the figures in the ACCISS study are reported for insulins in any formulation(figure 2). Our analysis is primarily focused on resource-limited countries, where the majority of insulins are formulated in phials. The added costs for producing other formulations, such as self-injections pens, could be the subject of future work.

### Price discounts significantly enhance fruit and vegetable purchases when combined with nutrition education: a randomized controlled supermarket trial [^112TG932]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing fruit and vegetable (F&V) prices is a frequently considered policy to improve dietary habits in the context of health promotion. However, evidence on the effectiveness of this intervention is limited.

Objective

The objective was to examine the effects of a 50% price discount on F&Vs or nutrition education or a combination of both on supermarket purchases.

Design

A 6-mo randomized controlled trial within Dutch supermarkets was conducted. Regular supermarket shoppers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: 50% price discounts on F&Vs, nutrition education, 50% price discounts plus nutrition education, or no intervention. A total of 199 participants provided baseline data; 151 (76%) were included in the final analysis. F&V purchases were measured by using supermarket register receipts at baseline, at 1 mo after the start of the intervention, at 3 mo, at 6 mo (end of the intervention period), and 3 mo after the intervention ended (9 mo).

Results

Adjusted multilevel models showed significantly higher F&V purchases (per household/2 wk) as a result of the price discount (+3.9 kg; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.3 kg) and the discount plus education intervention (+5.6 kg; 95% CI: 3.2, 7.9 kg) at 6 mo compared with control. Moreover, the percentage of participants who consumed recommended amounts of F&Vs (≥ 400 g/d) increased from 42.5% at baseline to 61.3% at 6 mo in both discount groups (P = 0.03). Education alone had no significant effect.

Conclusions

Discounting F&Vs is a promising intervention strategy because it resulted in substantially higher F&V purchases, and no adverse effects were observed. Therefore, pricing strategies form an important focus for future interventions or policy. However, the long-term effects and the ultimate health outcomes require further investigation. This trial was registered at the ISRCTN Trial Register as number ISRCTN56596945 and at the Dutch Trial Register (http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp) as number NL22568.029.08.

### Food is medicine: the time is now [^115xa4VG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Virtually every professional society globally now endorses a plant-forward diet that is lower in fat and processed foods as key components of disease prevention and health promotion. It is characterized by whole grain foods, and predominantly made of fresh foods. With healthcare expenditures at record levels across the globe, implementing a treatment plan that has larger magnitude health improvements than nearly any known medicine, that is extremely inexpensive, and has the power to not only improve human health but also planetary health is critical. That plan is Food is Medicine (FIM) which will be explored in this manuscript.

### Fruit and vegetable consumption among high school students – United States, 2010 [^115JzpQk]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

A diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a decreased risk for many chronic diseases and some cancers, and can aid in weight management. Current daily fruit and vegetable recommendations for adolescents who participate in < 30 minutes of physical activity daily are 1.5 cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables for females and 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables for males (1 cup is approximately equal to one medium apple, eight strawberries, 12 baby carrots, or one large tomato). However, recently published data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2004 revealed that consumption was considerably below these levels. To assess fruit and vegetable consumption among high school students, CDC analyzed data from the 2010 National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS). This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, in 2010, the median number of times per day that high school students consumed fruits and vegetables was 1.2 for both. For vegetables, the median number of times per day was lower for non-Hispanic black students (1.0) and Hispanic students (1.1) than non-Hispanic white students (1.4). Overall, 28.5% of high school students consumed fruit < 1 time daily, and 33.2% of high school students consumed vegetables < 1 time daily. The infrequent fruit and vegetable consumption by high school students highlights the need for effective strategies to increase consumption. Policy and environmental approaches to provide greater access to and availability of fruits and vegetables are among the strategies that schools and communities might choose to achieve this goal.

### The economic, agricultural, and food security repercussions of a wild pollinator collapse in Europe [^117JVhn5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The strong yield reductions in the commodities of Other Vegetables, Apples, and Other Fruits (Table 1) lead to the largest absolute declines in production across Europe (Fig. 2). These commodities together also account for almost two-thirds of the production value of pollination dependent crops in Europe (Table 1). The extent to which global agri-food markets can mitigate these declines varies. For the commodity Other Fruits, strong trade linkages between Europe and non-European countries result in marked production increases outside of Europe (Fig. 2). As a result, despite the sharp drop in European production, trade nearly compensates for Europe's production shortfall, substantially softening the rise in producer prices (Fig. 1) and causing only a slight reduction in the consumption of Other Fruits. In contrast, Europe is less reliant on imports of Other Vegetables and Apples (Table 1). Therefore, the yield declines in these products prompt only a relatively low production response outside Europe, leaving most of the European production losses unaddressed, which leads to pronounced declines in consumption within Europe (Fig. 2), while producer prices increase sharply (Fig. 1).

Aggregate production and welfare impacts on the Global agri-food system

Even though the European agricultural sector comprises only a moderate share in the global agri-food system, the collapse of wild pollinators in Europe results in non-trivial impacts on countries and trade-bloc regions in other continents (Fig. 2). The asymmetric decline in crop output in Europe leads to higher crop prices globally (Fig. 1) which incentivizes increases in crop production outside of Europe (Fig. 2). This particularly benefits farmers in Central- and South America where output increases are reported to be the highest (Fig. 3A). The increases in crop prices benefit farmers and result in higher farm profits in almost all regions (Supplementary Fig. 1) that add up to a global increase in producer surplus of €4.6 billion with a 95% confidence interval of €0.8 billion to €9.5 billion (Supplementary Table 2). These gains rise with the magnitude of the productivity shock, reflecting stronger price responses under more severe pollinator losses. Hence, globally, producers benefit from negative productivity shocks confined to Europe, as prices increase disproportionately.

### Picking the low-hanging fruit: the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic diabetes screening during tuberculosis contact investigations on the Texas-Mexico border [^117CcgDg]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Projecting healthcare

We used the Diabetes Cost-Effectiveness Model (CDC-RTI Model) that was jointly developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Research Triangle Institute to build a Microsoft Excel-based simplified version and updated key parameters (all costs inputs are derived from more recent sources, and characteristics of TB contact population are used to adjust all transition probabilities) to reflect the population served and the impact of this specific intervention. The CDC-RTI Model is a deterministic Markov simulation model of disease progression for diabetes that projects the cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to impact diabetes-related outcomes. It stimulates the development of diabetes-related microvascular (ie, nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy) and macrovascular (ie, CHD and stroke) complications along five separate pathways. Model outcomes include numbers and rates of complications, deaths, cost of care and QALYs. Markov models are state-transition models whereby progression between disease states is governed by transition probabilities that depend on risk factors. In our model, each model cycle represents 1 year. At the beginning of each cycle, an individual can experience a transition along each complication pathway or remain in the same state, and they cannot experience another transition until the following cycle. Relevant risk factors in this case include glycaemic level (HbA1c), blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status and disease duration. Outcomes are projected from the year of diagnosis to either death or age 95, effectively a lifetime horizon. The primary mechanism through which the intervention impacts health outcomes in our model is through its impact on HbA1c, using data from the literature on rates of complications at different HbA1c levels. Our previous research on diabetes screening among TB contacts from the Texas–Mexico border showed that the mean HbA1c at diagnosis of diabetes was 7.6% (table 1). We assume that clinical diagnosis of diabetes occurs 9–12 years after onset of initial metabolic abnormalities and decline of pancreatic beta cell function (mean: 10.5 years). We further assumed that opportunistic screening would cut that in half to 5.25 years, under the assumption that screening is equally likely to detect metabolic abnormalities (ie, pre-diabetes) at any preclinical stage. Prior to clinical diagnosis, HbA1c is assumed to increase by 0.2 percentage points per year to 8.7% at clinical diagnosis, comparable to the value found in the UKPDS (9.0%)and that used by the CDC/RTI group (8.9%). We conservatively estimated that HbA1c would decrease by 1.0 percentage points in the first 12 months, then increasing by 0.156 percentage points per year following diagnosis (for comparison, the UKPDS diet-only group saw an average HbA1c reduction of 2.1 percentage points in the first 12 months). The cost of the programme is calculated from a health system perspective, meaning that it does not differentiate between costs paid by different parties (government, insurance company, patient, etc). A 3% discount rate was applied to both QALYs and healthcare costs. The full technical report on the model is available in online supplemental file 2.

### Effects of discounting fruits, vegetables, and noncaloric beverages in New York city supermarkets on purchasing, intake, and weight [^115TBBUU]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess purchasing, intake, and weight after discounting fruits and vegetables (F&V) and noncaloric beverages in New York City supermarkets.

Methods

A 16-week randomized controlled trial was conducted with a 4-week baseline, an 8-week intervention with 50% discounts on F&V and noncaloric beverages, and a 4-week follow-up. Purchasing was tracked via loyalty cards, and intake was tracked via 24-h dietary recalls. Weights were measured at five in-person visits.

Results

Data from 67 participants were analyzed (38 in the experimental group; 29 in the control group). F&V and noncaloric beverage weekly purchasing was greater in the experimental than the control group (mean difference [SD], $4.64 [$1.44], p < 0.0001; $0.53 [$0.39], p = 0.008) during intervention, with F&V purchasing remaining greater in the experimental versus control group during follow-up (p = 0.005). F&V intake was greater for the experimental than the control group during intervention (142 [105] g/day; p = 0.009) and follow-up (p = 0.001). Although no difference in noncaloric beverage consumption was observed between groups, there was lower alcohol intake in the experimental than the control group during follow-up (-85.8 [60.2] g/day; p = 0.004). The experimental group lost weight compared with the control group (-1.33 [0.92] kg; p = 0.006 intervention and p = 0.106 follow-up). No differences in nutrient composition or high energy-dense product consumption were found.

Conclusions

A 50% discount on F&V and noncaloric beverages promoted increased purchasing and intake of F&V and induced weight loss.

### Pathways to "5-a-day": modeling the health impacts and environmental footprints of meeting the target for fruit and vegetable intake in the United Kingdom [^115r7Z9h]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

The current supply of fruit and vegetables in the United Kingdom is insufficient for meeting a hypothetical 5-a-day demand, something that other industrialized countries are likely to also be facing. In the United Kingdom, there is potential for local producers to close about one-third of this gap (A Wheeler, Food Foundation, personal communication, 2020). Horticulture is currently only ∼3% of United Kingdom's croppable area, of which the vast majority is dedicated to production of cereals and temporary grass for animal fodder. There is an opportunity to expand the UK horticulture sector, but this would require retraining of farmers, rebuilding of food supply chains, and tackling current problems of high input costs and low availability of agricultural workers at harvest time. Similar to successful food policy programs elsewhere, the realization of our proposed pathways to 5-a-day at scale would necessitate collaboration and engagement across sectors and disciplines, involving stakeholders across policy, academia, civil society, and farming communities. However, in an environment where food systems are already rapidly evolving to cope with increasingly frequent climate and disease events, there may never be a better time to make bold changes in favor of healthy and sustainable diets.

In conclusion, there are multiple pathways to consumption of 5-a-day that would benefit both people's health and the environment, providing a range of policy options from which governments can select according to their priorities. Our results show that the pathways prioritizing vegetables over fruit and favoring an increased consumption of UK-produced varieties would achieve a better balance of benefits across health and reduction in GHGEs and water use. Achieving these dietary shifts at scale is likely to require a redesign of policy measures to ensure availability, affordability, and acceptability among both consumers and producers. The proposed dietary changes would not be sufficient to reach national and global sustainability targets; hence, additional measures to reduce the environmental footprints of UK diets are equally critical to consider.

### Lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer [^111MUvf9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer is a common cause of death in developed countries, yet the benefits of screening for prostate cancer still remain controversial. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result greater than 4 ng/mL (nanograms/millilitre) has commonly been used as the cut-off level for seeking further tests to diagnose the presence (or absence) of prostate cancer. An increase in PSA levels may not necessarily be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, as PSA levels may also be increased in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Despite the uncertainty of the net benefit of early detection and treatment, safe and effective methods to prevent prostate cancer are of value. Consumers, seeking greater involvement in their healthcare, are increasingly turning to lifestyle modification and complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) to maintain their health and prevent disease. Lycopene is a member of the carotenoid family, which is found abundantly in tomatoes, tomato-based products, strawberries, and watermelon. It has been hypothesised that lycopene is a strong antioxidant, which may lower the risk of cancer (including prostate cancer) in people who have diets rich in lycopene.

Objectives

To determine whether lycopene reduces the incidence of prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Secondary objectives include changes in PSA levels, prostate symptoms and the nature of adverse events associated with lycopene use.

Search Methods

Electronic searches were conducted across MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. No language or other limitations were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

A search of electronic databases, performed in August 2011, identified 64 citations. All articles were selected for full-text review. From these citations, three studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Handsearching did not provide any additional studies.

Main Results

Three RCTs, with a total of 154 participants were included in this review. None of the studies reported data on prostate cancer mortality. All of the included studies differed with respect to design, participants included and allocation of lycopene. This clinical heterogeneity limits the value on the pooled estimated of the meta-analyses. The methodological quality of two of the three included studies was assessed as posing a 'high' risk of bias. Meta-analysis indicated no statistical difference in PSA levels between men randomised to receive lycopene and the comparison group (MD (mean difference) -0.34, 95% CI (confidence interval) -2.01, 1.32). Only one study reported incidence of prostate cancer (10% in the lycopene group versus 30% in control group). The level of lycopene was also not statistically different in men randomised to receive lycopene and the comparison group (MD 0.39 µg/mL (micrograms/millilitre), 95% CI -0.19, 0.98). No other meta-analyses were possible since other outcomes assessed only had one study contributing data.

Authors' Conclusions

Given that only three RCTs were included in this systematic review, and the high risk of bias in two of the three studies, there is insufficient evidence to either support, or refute, the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer. Similarly, there is no robust evidence from RCTs to identify the impact of lycopene consumption upon the incidence of prostate cancer, prostate symptoms, PSA levels or adverse events.

### Cutting costs, not care: new models for affordable men's health medications [^114x9YRX]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the cost savings that the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company (CDPC) and GoodRx could provide, in comparison to Medicaid, for drugs commonly prescribed in men's health related conditions: erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, premature ejaculation, and male infertility.

Methods

We reviewed several of the most commonly prescribed drugs for each indication at various doses including Tamsulosin, Anastrozole, Clomiphene, Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Vardenafil, Finasteride, Paroxetine, and Sertraline. Using publicly available Medicare data sheets, we determined the total Medicare spending in 2022 for each drug and the total number of drug units dispensed. We then calculated the cost per unit using CPDC and GoodRx pricing and multiplied these by the total number of units dispensed by Medicare. This yielded the potential total spending on each drug if purchased through CPDC or GoodRx. Finally, we compared Medicare's actual spending with the estimated spending under each alternative platform.

Results

The total 2022 Medicare cost for the nine studied drugs was $970 million. If purchased through CPDC, the estimated total costs for 30-, 60-, and 90-count fills would have been $760 million, $447 million, and $340 million, respectively. CPDC was cheaper than Medicare for all drugs except sertraline at 30-count fills, and clomiphene at all count fills. The largest savings were seen in erectile dysfunction treatments. CPDC was also consistently cheaper than GoodRx, except for select paroxetine doses and 60-count tamsulosin.

Conclusions

CPDC provides significant cost savings on men's health medications compared to Medicare and GoodRx.

### Effects of subsidies and prohibitions on nutrition in a food benefit program: a randomized clinical trial [^115xdB17]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Strategies to improve the nutritional status of those participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are of interest to policymakers.

Objective

To evaluate whether the proposed policy of incentivizing the purchase of fruits and vegetables and prohibiting the purchase of less nutritious foods in a food benefit program improves the nutritional quality of participants' diets.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Lower income participants (n = 279) not currently enrolled in SNAP were randomized to 1 of 4 experimental financial food benefit conditions: (1) incentive (30% financial incentive for fruits and vegetables purchased using food benefits); (2) restriction (not allowed to buy sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, or candies with food benefits); (3) incentive plus restriction (30% financial incentive on fruits and vegetables and restriction of purchase of sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, or candy with food benefits); or (4) control (no incentive or restrictions on foods purchased with food benefits). Participants in all conditions were given a study-specific debit card where funds were added every 4 weeks for a 12-week period. Outcome measures were collected at baseline and in the final 4 weeks of the experimental period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes (from 24-hour dietary recalls) included intake of energy, discretionary calories, and overall diet quality.

Results

A number of favorable changes were observed in the incentive plus restriction condition that were significantly different from changes in the control condition. These included (1) reduced intake of energy (-96 kcal/d, standard error [SE], 59.9); (2) reduced intake of discretionary calories (-64 kcal/d, SE 26.3); (3) reduced intake of sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, and candies (-0.6 servings/d, SE 0.2); (4) increased intake of solid fruit (0.2 servings/d, SE 0.1); and (5) improved Healthy Eating Index score (4.1 points, SE 1.4). Fewer improvements were observed in the incentive only and restriction only arms.

Conclusions and Relevance

A food benefit program that pairs incentives for purchasing more fruits and vegetables with restrictions on the purchase of less nutritious foods may reduce energy intake and improve the nutritional quality of the diet of participants compared with a program that does not include incentives or restrictions.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^115EuJKQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

5.5 Recommendation

We suggest that clinicians advocate that policymakers provide incentives to ensure that retailers can offer affordable, high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables to all (2 ⊕○○○).

5.5 Evidence

For the poor, food expense represents an important item in a family's budget (Ref. pp 193–221). At least one study showed that a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein costs more than a diet based on refined grains, added sugars, and fats. But a diet richer in fruits and vegetables can reduce caloric intake and lead to weight control. There are fewer conveniently located supermarkets in poorer neighborhoods but many "convenience stores" selling calorie-dense foods. Urban stores tend to stock fewer of the healthier foods and have less of a variety of foods. Even if supermarket availability were to improve, prices are still lower in the poorer neighborhoods for the higher fat, calorie-dense foods. Some policies (including the federal government farm subsidy program) have encouraged production of high-fructose corn syrup and other commodities used extensively in processed foods. Even when restaurants advertise and make healthy food items available, consumer habits may continue to prefer burgers, fries, and other high-calorie, high-fat items.

### Neurologic medication costs in a direct-to-consumer pharmacy vs commercial insurance plans [^114FfoQk]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Given increasing costs of neurologic medications, there is a need to explore alternative options to minimize medication spending.

Objective

To compare 2024 neurologic medication costs from commercial insurance plans with those available in the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, a direct-to-consumer pharmacy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study compared medication costs through a direct-to-consumer pharmacy with model-estimated 2024 costs from commercial and Medicare supplemental databases. Commercial insurance plan costs from 2012 to 2021 were used. The direct-to-consumer pricing for each medication was obtained from the website on December 10, 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The difference between direct-to-consumer and overall commercial insurance plan annual out-of-pocket (OOP) costs and total costs were calculated. Total and OOP costs were separately compared between direct-to-consumer and generic-only commercial prices. Aggregate cost differences were presented for OOP and total costs.

Results

Among 79 neurologic medications considered, 33 medications (42%) available for purchase through the direct-to-consumer pharmacy were studied. The direct-to-consumer pharmacy OOP costs were 75% higher and total costs were 413% lower than commercial pharmacies. Among observed medications, teriflunomide (-40%) and droxidopa (-18%) had lower OOP and total costs in the direct-to-consumer pharmacy, with no other medications having lower OOP costs in the direct-to-consumer pharmacy. In generic-only costs, no direct-to-consumer pharmacy medications had lower OOP annual cost. In total costs, 55% of the direct-to-consumer pharmacy medications had lower total annual cost. Teriflunomide (-5600%), droxidopa (-4800%), and dimethyl fumarate (-1900%) had the largest percentage reduction in the direct-to-consumer pharmacy. In aggregate, if all commercial prescriptions were filled in a direct-to-consumer pharmacy, the aggregate OOP expenditures would increase by $82 million.

Conclusions and Relevance

Practitioners should be aware of options such as direct-to-consumer pharmacies because they can often deliver similar OOP costs for uninsured patients to conventional pharmacies in commercial insurance plans. If pharmacies with direct-to-consumer pharmacy cost structures were widely used, total prescriptions may be markedly reduced.

### Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and under… [^1125LpD9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables in childhood increases the risk of future chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables or both amongst children aged five years and under.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase to identify eligible trials on 30 September 2016. We searched CINAHL and PsycINFO in July 2016, Proquest Dissertations and Theses in November 2016 and three clinical trial registers in November 2016 and June 2017. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and handsearched three international nutrition journals. We contacted authors of included studies to identify further potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised controlled trials and cross-over trials, of any intervention primarily targeting consumption of fruit, vegetables or both among children aged five years and under, and incorporating a dietary or biochemical assessment of fruit or vegetable consumption. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of identified papers; a third review author resolved disagreements.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies; a third review author resolved disagreements. Due to unexplained heterogeneity, we used random-effects models in meta-analyses for the primary review outcomes where we identified sufficient trials. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for the heterogeneity of fruit and vegetable consumption measures. We conducted assessments of risks of bias and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE approach) using Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

We included 50 trials with 137 trial arms and 10,267 participants. Thirty trials examined the impact of child-feeding practices (e.g. repeated food exposure) in increasing child vegetable intake. Eleven trials examined the impact of parent nutrition education in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Eight studies examined the impact of multicomponent interventions (e.g. parent nutrition education and preschool policy changes) in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. One study examined the effect of a nutrition intervention delivered to children in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Thirteen of the 50 included trials were judged as free from high risks of bias across all domains; performance, detection and attrition bias were the most common domains judged at high risk of bias of remaining studies. Meta-analysis of trials examining child-feeding practices versus no intervention revealed a positive effect on child vegetable consumption (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; n = 1509; 11 studies; very low-quality evidence), equivalent to a mean difference of 4.03 grams of vegetables. There were no short-term differences in child consumption of fruit and vegetables in meta-analyses of trials examining parent nutrition education versus no intervention (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.28; n = 3023; 10 studies; very low-quality evidence) or multicomponent interventions versus no intervention (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.63; n = 1861; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Insufficient data were available to assess long-term effectiveness, cost effectiveness and unintended adverse consequences of interventions. Studies reported receiving governmental or charitable funds, except for two studies reporting industry funding.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite identifying 50 eligible trials of various intervention approaches, the evidence for how to increase fruit and vegetable consumption of children remains sparse. There was very low-quality evidence child-feeding practice interventions are effective in increasing vegetable consumption of children aged five years and younger, however the effect size was very small and long-term follow-up is required. There was very low-quality evidence that parent nutrition education and multicomponent interventions are not effective in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption of children aged five years and younger. All findings should be considered with caution, given most included trials could not be combined in meta-analyses. Given the very low-quality evidence, future research will very likely change estimates and conclusions. Such research should adopt more rigorous methods to advance the field. This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

### Effect of a tomato-rich diet on markers of cardiovascular disease risk in moderately overweight, disease-free, middle-aged adults: a randomized controlled trial [^111D7LZP]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in the United Kingdom. Epidemiologic studies suggest that consumption of tomato-based foods may lower CVD risk. Such potential benefits have been ascribed in part to high concentrations of lycopene in the tomatoes. However, these findings have not yet been validated by comprehensive intervention trials.

Objective

The aim of this study was to conduct a single-blind, randomized controlled intervention trial with healthy middle-aged volunteers to assess whether the consumption of tomato-based foods affects recognized biomarkers of CVD risk.

Design

After a 4-wk run-in period with a low-tomato diet, 225 volunteers (94 men and 131 women) aged 40–65 y were randomly assigned into 1 of 3 dietary intervention groups and asked to consume a control diet (low in tomato-based foods), a high-tomato-based diet, or a control diet supplemented with lycopene capsules (10 mg/d) for 12 wk. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at 6 wk, and after the intervention and were analyzed for carotenoid and lipid profiles and inflammatory markers. Blood pressure, weight, and arterial stiffness were also measured. Dietary intake was also determined during the intervention.

Results

None of the systemic markers (inflammatory markers, markers of insulin resistance and sensitivity) changed significantly after the dietary intervention. Moreover, lipid concentrations and arterial stiffness were also unaffected by the interventions.

Conclusion

These data indicate that a relatively high daily consumption of tomato-based products (equivalent to 32–50 mg lycopene/d) or lycopene supplements (10 mg/d) is ineffective at reducing conventional CVD risk markers in moderately overweight, healthy, middle-aged individuals. This trial was registered at isrctn.org as ISRCTN34203810.

### Red delicious apple [^116Jpwyp]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Allergenic extracts are indicated for use in diagnostic testing and as part of a treatment regime for allergic disease, as established by allergy history and skin test reactivity.

Allergenic extracts are indicated for the treatment of allergen specific allergic disease for use as hyposensitization or immunotherapy when avoidance of specific allergens can not be attained. The use of allergenic extracts for therapeutic purpose has been established by well-controlled clinical studies. Allergenic extracts may be used as adjunctive therapy along with pharmacotherapy which includes antihistamines, corticosteroids, and cromoglycate, and avoidance measures. Allergenic extracts for therapeutic use should be given using only the allergen selection to which the patient is allergic, has a history of exposure and are likely to be exposed to again.

### Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged 5 years and under… [^1116xoPN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables in childhood increases the risk of future chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit and/or vegetables amongst children aged five years and under.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2010, MEDLINE (1950 to 2010 April week 4), EMBASE (1947 to 2010 week 18), CINAHL (up to 12 May 2010), PsycINFO (up to 12 May 2010) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (up to February 2011) were searched to identify eligible trials, as well as electronic trial registers (also up to February 2011). The reference lists of included trials were reviewed and handsearches of three international nutrition journals were also performed. Authors of all included trials were contacted in order to identify further potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-randomised controlled trials, of any intervention primarily targeting fruit and/or vegetable consumption among children aged five years and under and incorporating a biochemical or dietary assessment of fruit and/or vegetable consumption. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified papers. A third review author with expertise in review methodology resolved any disagreements regarding study eligibility.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. A third reviewer resolved disagreements between review authors. Fixed-effect models were used to perform meta-analysis for the primary review outcomes where a sufficient number of trials with suitable data and homogeneity were identified.

Main Results

Five trials, with 13 trial arms and 3967 participants were included in the review. Two trials examined the impact of specific feeding practices (e.g. repeated food exposure) in increasing child intake of a target vegetable. Two trials assessed the effectiveness of home visiting programs implemented in disadvantaged communities and one trial investigated the effect of a preschool-based intervention in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Risk of bias of included studies was low although three of the five trials were judged to be at high risk of performance bias. Meta-analysis of two trials examining repeated food exposure versus a no intervention comparison found no significant difference in target vegetable consumption in the short term (mean difference (MD) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.78 to 5.52). Coupling repeated food exposure with a tangible non-food or social reward, was effective in increasing targeted vegetable consumption in the short term based on one trial. Home visiting programs provided to disadvantaged groups did not significantly increase overall fruit intake in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.11). Similarly, a multi-component preschool-based intervention failed to significantly increase child consumption of vegetables, but did report a small significant increase in mean child consumption of fruit, six months following baseline assessment. None of the trials investigated intervention cost-effectiveness or reported information regarding any adverse events or unintended adverse consequences of the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the importance of encouraging fruit and vegetable consumption among children aged five years and under, this review identified few randomised controlled trials investigating interventions to achieve this.

### It's a long shot, but it just might work! perspectives on the future of medicine [^114K6ek4]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What was the last product you searched for online? Every aspect of the information presented to you, from its position on the screen to whether the text was underlined, was shaped by thousands of online randomized controlled experiments and scads of data being processed in real-time from millions of other customers like you. Contrast this experience with the last time you received a healthcare intervention. If a treatment existed for your problem, then the (very expensive) evidence for it was generated long ago from a tiny and highly unusual group of volunteers who were followed up for a relatively short time period, with all the data gathered by the company with most to gain from a positive result, approved in a binary one-time process, and with a price shrouded in secrecy. Since then, nearly all the outcome data on the success or failure of the treatment for every other person like you was either scrawled on paper in filing cabinets or, most likely, was never written down in the first place. If the outcome data was stored electronically, that was probably only for routine management or reimbursement purposes and extracting meaning from the "data shadow" is challenging. Consequently, neither you nor your doctor know with confidence if the treatment they prescribed is really working for you, the manufacturer does not have much feedback as to what they could do better, and whoever paid for it does not know if they got value for money. This worries me greatly, as it seems like Amazon is leveraging every drop of data on the planet to feed my daughter the best suggestion for which episode of Peppa Pig to watch next, but that the health system has given me a paper booklet on which to record her health data.

### Choosing the best apple: counselling leaflets and technologies of communication in the history of reproduction [^117BLcUC]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

In a first step to broaden audience and multiply encounters, from 1973 to 1974, Genetic Counselling Helps Us… was sent specifically to families who were considered in need of social services (, 125). In a paperback on genetic counselling for publishing house Herder's popular political series 'Social Problems', Wendt explained what was meant by this broad category: households with adults who were classified to have 'basic jobs, under-average intelligence and low income' (, 125–6). We cannot trace in the sources available how these families were defined, identified, reached, or how and if the counselling situations continued, after receiving the leaflet. However, when this campaign proved unsuccessful, Wendt decided to design a brand-new leaflet, embedded into an education initiative in public schools. His reasoning was 'School leavers, should know hereditary and chromosomal diseases, the person should know that diseased offspring is a burden to families and a danger for the hereditary health' (, 125–6). In addition, counselling materials would be used in trainings for MDs, as well as for teachers, especially in biology and social studies. Other points of dissemination would be mass media campaigns in local and nationwide TV; ideally, an evening series on 'hereditary diseases' (, 130); advertisements for the counselling unit in daily newspapers, magazines and in well-established medical mailings sent to people's homes, such as the letter of the German Employees' Health Insurance (DAK). To support communicative practices, Wendt activated his network. In the following year (1975), he signed a contract with a professional public relations (PR) company, on behalf of the FDC, to develop Our Child Shall Be Healthy.

### Comparison of fruit and vegetable intake among urban low-income US adults receiving a produce voucher in 2 cities [^113Frcqi]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Fruit and vegetable vouchers have been implemented by cities and counties across the US to increase fruit and vegetable intake and thereby improve overall nutritional quality.

Objective

To determine whether and why use of fruit and vegetable vouchers are associated with varied nutritional intake across different populations and environments.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a population-based pre-post cohort study of 671 adult participants with low income before and during (6 months after initiation) participation in a 6-month program, fruit and vegetable vouchers were distributed for redemption at local San Francisco and Los Angeles neighborhood grocery and corner stores between 2017 and 2019. A transportability analysis was performed to identify factors that may explain variation in voucher use between cities.

Exposure

Receipt of $20 per month in produce vouchers for 6 months from 2017 to 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in total fruits and vegetables (as defined by the US Department of Agriculture) consumed per person per day (change in cup-equivalents between month 6 and month 0).

Results

A total of 671 adults (median age, 54.9 years [interquartile range, 45.0–65.0 years]; 61.7% female; 30.9% Black; 19.7% Hispanic) were enrolled. An increase in fruit and vegetable intake of 0.22 cup-equivalents per day overall (95% CI, 0.14–0.31 cup-equivalents; P < .001) was observed. However, the observed increase was larger in Los Angeles compared with San Francisco (0.64 cup-equivalents per day; 95% CI, 0.41–0.88 cup-equivalents vs 0.10 cup-equivalents per day; 95% CI, 0.01–0.19 cup-equivalents). When the concurrently sampled San Francisco group (n = 157) was weighted in transportability analysis to demographically match the Los Angeles group (n = 155) in observed covariates, the weighted San Francisco group had an estimated increase of 0.53 fruit and vegetable cup-equivalents per day (95% CI, 0.27–0.79 cup-equivalents, P = 0.03), with income being the variable needed to allow the 95% confidence intervals to overlap between the weighted San Francisco and unweighted Los Angeles populations.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, the use of fruit and vegetable vouchers appeared to be associated with greater benefit among those with lower incomes, suggesting that further investigation of flat-rate rather than income-scaled benefits is warranted.

### Association between vegetable, fruit, and flavonoid-rich fruit consumption in midlife and major depressive disorder in later life: the JPHC saku mental health study [^1112BpJm]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Vegetable and fruit consumption (exposure)

In 1995 and 2000, vegetable and fruit consumption was evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used these data to calculate average vegetable and fruit consumption. Participants reported the frequency and relative portion size of vegetables and fruits consumed in the preceding 12 months. The questionnaire included 29 vegetables (cabbage, Chinese radishes, komatsuna, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, leaf mustard, [Swiss] chard, spinach, Chinese chives, garland chrysanthemums, chingensai, mugwort, green pepper, carrots, tomatoes, pumpkins, tomato juice, onions, cucumbers, bean sprouts, snap beans, lettuce, bitter gourds, and loofah; and the following pickled vegetables: Chinese radishes, green leaf [Nozawana or leaf mustard], Chinese cabbage, cucumbers, and eggplant) and 17 fruits (papaya, apples, persimmons, strawberries, grapes, melons, watermelon, peaches, pears, kiwi fruit, pineapple, bananas, oranges, other citruses, pickled plums, 100% apple juice, and 100% orange juice). Flavonoid-rich fruits were defined as fruits containing a total flavonoid content of 50 mg/100 g. We categorized each item into the following food groups: total vegetables and fruits, total vegetables, total fruits (including juice), total fruits excluding juice, and flavonoid-rich fruits (apples, pears, oranges, other citruses, grapes, and strawberries). Vegetable and fruit consumption was calculated by multiplying the frequency by the relative portion size. The food frequency questionnaire was previously shown to have acceptable validity and reproducibility. Spearman's rank correlations between the food frequency questionnaire and independently evaluated dietary records were 0.22 in men and 0.32 in women for vegetable consumption and 0.41 in men and 0.23 in women for fruit consumption.

Nutrient intakes (exposure)

Nutrient intakes obtained from vegetables and fruits were evaluated using the Fifth Revised and Enlarged Edition of the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan, again with averaging of data from 1995 and 2000. We included α-carotene, β-carotene, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and folate. These measurements of nutrient intake were shown to have acceptable validity.

### The global burden of disease attributable to suboptimal fruit and vegetable intake, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study [^116AdmVA]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Policy recommendations

Addressing the global burden attributable to suboptimal fruit and vegetable intake requires coordinated, equity-oriented policy responses. Although various interventions have demonstrated effectiveness, such as nutrition education, behavioral counseling, and community-based programs, their reach and long-term sustainability remain uneven across regions.

First, economic policies should prioritize affordability and accessibility, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Strategies including subsidies for fruit and vegetables, price incentives, and targeted programs, such as Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) schemes, can help reduce cost barriers for low-income populations and improve dietary quality. In parallel, strengthening local food systems by investing in smallholder agriculture, infrastructure, and market access can also improve availability and reduce reliance on imported produce.

Second, governments and international agencies should strengthen global collaboration to enhance the efficiency and resilience of fruit and vegetables supply chains. This includes promoting transparent trade policies, investing in cold chain infrastructure, and facilitating regional cooperation to mitigate the impact of climate and geopolitical disruptions. Prioritizing resilient supply systems in low-income settings is essential for narrowing access gaps and ensuring year-round availability.

Third, public health strategies should adopt a life-course and population-wide approach. Scaling up school- and workplace-based interventions, mass media campaigns, and culturally tailored nutrition education programs can help normalize fruit and vegetable intake as a core component of healthy diets. These strategies should be integrated into broader noncommunicable disease prevention frameworks and aligned with local dietary habits and cultural contexts.

Finally, establishing a global monitoring mechanism to track fruit and vegetable intake across socioeconomic and demographic groups is critical. Routine surveillance data are essential to inform policy development, identify high-risk populations, and ensure accountability in advancing equity-oriented nutrition targets.

### Red delicious apple [^114KMotG]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

10ml x 100 = Vn x 10,000

0.1 mL = Vn

Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 mL of extract from the 10,000 AU/ml or BAU/ml vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 mL of sterile diluent. The resulting concentration will be 10ml vial of 100 AU/ml or BAU/ml.

Intervals between doses: The optimal interval between doses of allergenic extract has not been definitely established. The amount of allergenic extract is increased at each injection by not more than 50%-100% of the previous amount and the next increment is governed by the response to the last injection. There are three generally accepted methods of pollen hyposensitizing therapy.

1. PRESEASONAL

Treatment starts each year 6 to 8 weeks before onset of seasonal symptoms. Maximal dose reached just before symptoms are expected. Injections discontinued during and following season until next year.

2. CO-SEASONAL

Patient is first treated during season with symptoms. Low initial doses are employed to prevent worsening of condition. This is followed by an intensive schedule of therapy (i.e. injections given 2 to 3 times per week). Fewer Allergists are resorting to this Co-seasonal therapy because of the availability of more effective, symptomatic medications that allow the patient to go through a season relatively symptom free.

3. PERENNIAL

Initially this is the same as pre seasonal. The allergen is administered twice weekly or weekly for about 20 injections to achieve the maximum tolerated dose. Then, maintenance therapy may be administered once a week or less frequently.

Duration of Treatment: The usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment.

### Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and under… [^1122XU5Q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables in childhood increases the risk of future non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Interventions to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, such as those focused on specific child-feeding strategies and parent nutrition education interventions in early childhood may therefore be an effective strategy in reducing this disease burden.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables or both amongst children aged five years and under.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trials registries to identify eligible trials on 25 January 2018. We searched Proquest Dissertations and Theses in November 2017. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and handsearched three international nutrition journals. We contacted authors of included studies to identify further potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised controlled trials and cross-over trials, of any intervention primarily targeting consumption of fruit, vegetables or both among children aged five years and under, and incorporating a dietary or biochemical assessment of fruit or vegetable consumption. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of identified papers; a third review author resolved disagreements.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies; a third review author resolved disagreements. Due to unexplained heterogeneity, we used random-effects models in meta-analyses for the primary review outcomes where we identified sufficient trials. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for the heterogeneity of fruit and vegetable consumption measures. We conducted assessments of risks of bias and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE approach) using Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

We included 63 trials with 178 trial arms and 11,698 participants. Thirty-nine trials examined the impact of child-feeding practices (e.g. repeated food exposure) in increasing child vegetable intake. Fourteen trials examined the impact of parent nutrition education in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Nine studies examined the impact of multicomponent interventions (e.g. parent nutrition education and preschool policy changes) in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. One study examined the effect of a nutrition education intervention delivered to children in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. We judged 14 of the 63 included trials as free from high risks of bias across all domains; performance, detection and attrition bias were the most common domains judged at high risk of bias for the remaining studies. There is very low quality evidence that child-feeding practices versus no intervention may have a small positive effect on child vegetable consumption equivalent to an increase of 3.50 g as-desired consumption of vegetables (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.54; participants = 1741; studies = 13). Multicomponent interventions versus no intervention may have a very small effect on child consumption of fruit and vegetables (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.66; participants = 2009; studies = 5; low-quality evidence), equivalent to an increase of 0.37 cups of fruit and vegetables per day. It is uncertain whether there are any short-term differences in child consumption of fruit and vegetables in meta-analyses of trials examining parent nutrition education versus no intervention (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.28; participants = 3078; studies = 11; very low-quality evidence). Insufficient data were available to assess long-term effectiveness, cost effectiveness and unintended adverse consequences of interventions. Studies reported receiving governmental or charitable funds, except for four studies reporting industry funding.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite identifying 63 eligible trials of various intervention approaches, the evidence for how to increase children's fruit and vegetable consumption remains limited. There was very low- and low-quality evidence respectively that child-feeding practice and multicomponent interventions may lead to very small increases in fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and younger. It is uncertain whether parent nutrition education interventions are effective in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and younger. Given that the quality of the evidence is very low or low, future research will likely change estimates and conclusions. Long-term follow-up is required and future research should adopt more rigorous methods to advance the field. This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

### Picking the low-hanging fruit: the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic diabetes screening during tuberculosis contact investigations on the Texas-Mexico border [^114a2o25]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Objective

There is a known association between type 2 diabetes (diabetes) and tuberculosis (TB), and TB clinics have become hubs for new diabetes diagnosis among active patients with TB. However, despite the potential to identify diabetes patients, resources limit diabetes screening opportunities to close TB contacts. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding opportunistic screening for diabetes during the routine TB contact investigations conducted at TB clinics.

Research Design and Methods

We used a Markov-based model to simulate the costs of diabetes screening, management and health outcomes, including the incidence of complications and death. All costs were considered from a health system perspective. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results to various assumptions. Interventions that fall below US$50000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are commonly considered very cost-effective, while those between $50000 and $100000 are considered moderately cost-effective.

Results

Simulation of diabetes screening among TB contacts resulted in not only increased survival and reduced complications but also increased costs of diabetes management. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $32642 per QALY added, which is well within commonly used willingness-to-pay thresholds for cost-effectiveness. Compared with no screening, screening increased the costs by $8633 and resulted in an increase in QALYs by 0.26 per patient.

Conclusions

In the base case analysis, screening was very cost-effective given that none of the sensitivity analyses resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio above $50000 per QALY. Our results indicate that the expansion of diabetes screening in TB clinics is a cost-effective strategy to improve health outcomes.

### Retail prices, environmental footprints, and nutritional profiles of commonly sold retail food items in 181 countries [^115DtznG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Transitions towards healthier, more environmentally sustainable diets would require large shifts in consumption patterns. Cost and affordability can be barriers to consuming healthy, sustainable diets.

Objective

This study provides the first worldwide test of how retail food prices relate to empirically estimated environmental footprints and nutritional profile scores between and within food groups.

Methods

We use 48,316 prices for 860 retail food items commonly sold in 181 countries during 2011 and 2017, matched to estimated carbon and water footprints and nutritional profiles, to test whether healthier and more sustainable foods are more expensive between and within food groups.

Results

Prices, environmental footprints, and nutritional profiles differ between food groups. Within almost all groups, more expensive items have significantly larger carbon and water footprints. Associations are strongest for animal source foods, where each 10% increment in price is associated with 21 grams higher carbon footprint and 5 liters higher water footprint per 100kcal of food. There is no such gradient for price and nutritional profile, as more expensive items are sometimes healthier and sometimes less healthy depending on the food group, price range, and nutritional attribute of interest.

Conclusions

Our finding that higher-priced items have larger environmental footprints is contrary to expectations that a more sustainable diet would be more expensive. Instead, we find that within each food group, meeting dietary needs with lower environmental footprints is possible by choosing items with a lower unit price. These findings are consistent with prior observations that higher-priced items typically use more resources, including energy and water, but may or may not be healthful as measured by nutrient profile scores.

### A haplotype-resolved, chromosome-scale genome for malus domestica borkh'. WA 38' [^11212n36]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For economically important crop species, having full-resolution reference genomes aids in the understanding of traits associated with commodity quality, disease resistance, long-term storage, and shelf life. Apple (Malus domestica) is the number one consumed fruit in the United States, with a Farm-Gate Revenue of $3.2 billion in the United States and $78 billion globally. There are over 7,000 apple varieties grown worldwide, each with unique colors, flavors, and textures Therefore, a single genome is unlikely to capture the complexity of all cultivars within this highly heterozygous species. One such cultivar is 'WA 38', commercially released as Cosmic Crisp® in 2017 by the Pome Fruit Breeding Program at Washington State University's (WSU) Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center (Fig. 1a, b) and has reached the top 10 best selling apple cultivars in the United States. 'WA 38' is a cross between 'Honeycrisp' and 'Enterprise', made using classical breeding methods in 1997. One parent, 'Honeycrisp', is well-known for its crisp texture, firmness retention in storage, disease resistance, and cold hardiness, but is highly susceptible to production and postharvest issues. The other parent, 'Enterprise', is an easy-to-grow cultivar that has extended postharvest storage capabilities, however, it is not widely cultivated commercially due to its less desirable eating quality. Their resulting cross has been met with favorable reviews for its appealing color, texture, flavor, cold hardiness, long-term storage capabilities (> 1 year), and scab resistance. However, it inherited undesirable traits as well (Fig. 1c, d, e, and f), such as a propensity for physiological symptoms that may be related to mineral imbalances and maturity at harvest, and an "off" flavor that has been brought up by consumers that may be the result of improper picking times, crop load management, handling/packing practices or other postharvest processes. Most concerning is green spot (Fig. 1c, d, and f), a corking disorder that seems to be unique to 'WA 38', but with etiology similar to disorders associated with mineral imbalances such as bitter pit and drought spot. The propensity for and cause of physiological disorders often differs on a cultivar-by-cultivar basis, and a genetic basis for such predispositions is likely. Thus, improved resolution of cultivar-specific genomic differences is critical for advancing our understanding of how economically important traits are inherited and how they can be managed more efficiently.

### The economics of obesity: dietary energy density and energy cost [^111ACSvd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States are found among the lower-income groups. The observed links between obesity and socioeconomic position may be related to dietary energy density and energy cost. Refined grains, added sugars, and added fats are among the lowest-cost sources of dietary energy. They are inexpensive, good tasting, and convenient. In contrast, the more nutrient-dense lean meats, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit generally cost more. An inverse relationship between energy density of foods (kilojoules per gram) and their energy cost (dollars per megajoule) means that the more energy-dense diets are associated with lower daily food consumption costs and may be an effective way to save money. However, economic decisions affecting food choice may have physiologic consequences. Laboratory studies suggest that energy-dense foods and energy-dense diets have a lower satiating power and may result in passive overeating and therefore weight gain. Epidemiologic analyses suggest that the low-cost energy-dense diets also tend to be nutrient poor. If the rise in obesity rates is related to the growing price disparity between healthy and unhealthy foods, then the current strategies for obesity prevention may need to be revised. Encouraging low-income families to consume healthier but more costly foods to prevent future disease can be construed as an elitist approach to public health. Limiting access to inexpensive foods through taxes on frowned upon fats and sweets is a regressive measure. The broader problem may lie with growing disparities in incomes and wealth, declining value of the minimum wage, food imports, tariffs, and trade. Evidence is emerging that obesity in America is a largely economic issue.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Precautions

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permits.

The dosage of allergenic extracts is dependent upon the purpose of the administration. Allergenic extracts can be administered for diagnostic use or for therapeutic use.

When allergenic extracts are administered for diagnostic use, the dosage is dependent upon the method used. Two methods commonly used are scratch testing and intradermal testing. Both types of tests result in a wheal and flare response at the site of the test which usually develops rapidly and may be read in 20–30 minutes.

Diagnostic Use: Scratch Testing Method

Scratch testing is considered a simple and safe method although less sensitive than the intradermal test. Scratch testing can be used to determine the degree of sensitivity to a suspected allergen before using the intradermal test. This combination lessens the severity of response to an allergen which can occur in a very sensitive patient.

The most satisfactory testing site is the patient's back or volar surface of the arms from the axilla to 2.5 or 5cm above the wrist, skipping the anti-cubital space. If using the back as a testing site, the most satisfactory area are from the posterior axillary fold to 2.5 cm from the spinal column, and from the top of the scapula to the lower rib margins.
