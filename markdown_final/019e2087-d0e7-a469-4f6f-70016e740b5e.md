## Question

An 80-year-old woman with a 2-year history of Alzheimer's disease is brought to clinic by her daughter due to a recent change in behavior. Over the past week, she has become increasingly agitated, has been refusing food, and has started wandering at night. Her daughter is concerned that her dementia is rapidly worsening. On examination, the patient is alert but appears uncomfortable. Her vital signs are stable. There is no obvious focal neurological deficit.

Based on current guidelines, what should be your next step in evaluating this patient's new behavioral symptoms?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next step in evaluating new behavioral symptoms in an 80-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease, specifically agitation, refusal of food, and nocturnal wandering over the past week. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this presentation suggests delirium superimposed on dementia. Then, I should verify the immediate workup priorities, including history, exam, and targeted labs. Next, I will consider medication review and nonpharmacologic strategies. After that, I should review when to escalate to neuropsychiatric consultation or neuropsychological testing. Finally, I will outline follow-up and monitoring, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its urgency. A subacute change in behavior over about a week in someone with established dementia raises concern for delirium superimposed on dementia, which is an urgent medical problem requiring prompt evaluation and management to prevent complications and persistent decline [^e9a4d52f] [^0cca0b66].

> Wait, let me verify the key differentials and why this isn't just "dementia progression". Rapid worsening over days to a week is not typical of Alzheimer's alone and should trigger a search for precipitating factors such as infection, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, medication effects, pain, constipation, or sleep disturbance, all of which can precipitate delirium or acute behavioral decompensation in dementia [^e9a4d52f] [^9a7aaa5c].

> I need to check the immediate history elements that will shape the workup. I should obtain a collateral history from the daughter to characterize the time course, fluctuations, sleep-wake cycle, pain cues, and any recent intercurrent illnesses, surgeries, falls, or medication changes, while also screening for delirium features using a validated tool like the Confusion Assessment Method to structure detection of inattention and fluctuation [^e9a4d52f] [^79012c8e].

> Hold on, I should verify the examination priorities. I will perform a focused neurologic exam including attention testing, language, visuospatial function, and praxis, and I will assess for focal deficits, parkinsonism, or myoclonus that might suggest Lewy body disease or another atypical process; I will also examine for pain, constipation, or other sources of discomfort that can drive agitation and refusal of food, and I will use a validated brief cognitive test such as MoCA or Mini-Cog to quantify current status and compare with baseline [^a626dbcd] [^7494b9ca].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory evaluation. I will order a Tier 1 "cognitive lab panel" including CBC, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, glucose, TSH, and vitamin B12, because these are recommended in essentially all patients with cognitive-behavioral syndromes to identify treatable contributors and exacerbating factors, even if they are not the primary etiology of dementia [^9a7aaa5c] [^aa9ba586].

> I will now examine medication contributors. I need to obtain a complete medication and supplement list, including over-the-counter agents, and specifically look for anticholinergics, sedatives, opioids, corticosteroids, and polypharmacy that can worsen cognition or precipitate delirium; deprescribing or dose adjustments are often first-line interventions in this setting [^notfound].

> Let me consider nonpharmacologic management while the workup proceeds. Environmental modifications, reassurance, consistent routines, adequate hydration, toileting support, sensory aids, and caregiver education are foundational; I should also screen for pain using a validated tool such as the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) and treat identified sources of discomfort, as pain is a common and modifiable driver of agitation and refusal of food in dementia [^ee4080bd] [^be6847f6].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the diagnosis remains uncertain after initial assessment? I should confirm referral triggers: prominent language or visuospatial deficits, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, rapid progression, or markedly incongruent history and exam should prompt expedited referral to a dementia subspecialist or geriatric psychiatrist, and neuropsychological testing can help characterize the cognitive-behavioral syndrome and stage functional impact when office-based assessment is insufficient or confounded by education or psychiatric comorbidity [^c959e95d] [^847e0018].

> I should double-check the follow-up cadence. Given the acute nature of these changes, reassessment within 24 to 48 hours is reasonable to track trajectory, confirm delirium resolution with treatment of precipitants, and adjust interventions; if delirium is confirmed, I will monitor severity over time and continue nonpharmacologic strategies, reserving pharmacologic agents for severe agitation posing imminent risk after weighing risks and benefits [^e9a4d52f] [^ee4080bd].

> In summary, I need to ensure the next step is a structured, time-sensitive evaluation for delirium superimposed on dementia, with collateral history, targeted exam including delirium screening, Tier 1 labs, medication review, and immediate nonpharmacologic measures, while maintaining a low threshold for specialist referral if the course is atypical or the diagnosis remains uncertain [^e9a4d52f] [^9a7aaa5c] [^ee4080bd].

---

The next step is to **evaluate for delirium and reversible causes** of acute behavioral change in dementia, using a structured approach that includes a focused history, exam, and targeted labs [^e9a4d52f] [^919c1609]. This is prioritized over attributing symptoms to dementia progression because delirium is common, preventable, and treatable in older adults with dementia [^e9a4d52f]. The evaluation should assess for infection, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, medication effects, pain, constipation, and sleep disturbance, and use validated tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to detect delirium [^e9a4d52f] [^919c1609]. If delirium is identified, manage with nonpharmacologic strategies first and treat the underlying cause; reserve antipsychotics only for severe agitation with imminent risk and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^ee4080bd] [^e552ed23].

---

## Step 1: confirm the presence of delirium

Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating attention and awareness; it is common in older adults with dementia and often reversible if promptly identified and treated [^e9a4d52f]. Use the **Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)** to screen for delirium, which requires:

- **Acute onset and fluctuating course**: Symptoms develop over hours to days and fluctuate.
- **Inattention**: Difficulty focusing or maintaining attention.
- **Disorganized thinking**: Incoherent speech or illogical thoughts.
- **Altered level of consciousness**: Hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed.

If delirium is present, prioritize identifying and treating the underlying cause [^e9a4d52f].

---

## Step 2: identify potential reversible causes

A structured evaluation should systematically identify **reversible contributors** to acute behavioral change:

| **Category** | **Common reversible causes** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Urinary tract infection <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - COVID-19 [^notfound] |
| Metabolic | - Dehydration <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances (Na, Ca, glucose) <br/> - Renal or hepatic dysfunction [^9a7aaa5c] |
| Medication-related | - Polypharmacy <br/> - Anticholinergics <br/> - Sedatives <br/> - Benzodiazepines <br/> - Opioids <br/> - Recent medication changes [^7695ce25] |
| Neurological | - Pain <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Sleep disturbance <br/> - Subdural hematoma [^notfound] |
| Environmental | - Change in living situation <br/> - Sensory impairment (vision/hearing) <br/> - Lack of routine [^a616114a] |

---

## Step 3: perform targeted diagnostic evaluation

### History and examination

Obtain a **collateral history** from the caregiver to characterize the onset, course, and triggers of behavioral change [^79012c8e]. Perform a focused physical and neurologic examination to identify focal deficits, signs of infection, dehydration, pain, or medication effects [^a626dbcd].

---

### Laboratory and imaging studies

Order **targeted tests** based on clinical suspicion:

- **CBC, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, glucose, TSH, vitamin B12**: Identify metabolic or endocrine disturbances [^9a7aaa5c].
- **Urinalysis and culture**: Screen for urinary tract infection.
- **Chest X-ray**: Evaluate for pneumonia if respiratory symptoms present.
- **ECG**: Assess for cardiac arrhythmias or ischemia if indicated.
- **Brain imaging (CT or MRI)**: Consider if focal deficits, head trauma, or rapidly progressive course [^9a7aaa5c].

---

## Step 4: implement immediate management strategies

### Nonpharmacologic interventions (first-line)

- **Environmental modifications**: Provide a calm, well-lit room; minimize noise; maintain familiar objects and routines [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Ensure adequate hydration, nutrition, and toileting; address sensory impairments [^notfound].
- **Caregiver education**: Teach de-escalation techniques and communication strategies [^df61dbe2].
- **Sleep hygiene**: Establish regular sleep-wake cycles; avoid stimulants at night [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions (reserved for severe agitation or imminent risk)

Use **antipsychotics** only when nonpharmacologic measures fail and there is imminent risk of harm; start low, go slow, and monitor closely for adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, and increased mortality risk [^e552ed23] [^324c0733]. Options include risperidone, aripiprazole, or quetiapine, with risperidone having the most evidence for short-term use in dementia-related agitation [^e552ed23] [^f6cc25c5].

---

## Step 5: monitor and reassess

Reassess the patient frequently — initially every 24–48 hours — to track response to interventions and adjust the plan. Continue to **monitor for adverse effects** of medications and taper antipsychotics as soon as clinically feasible [^ea1d3160].

---

## Step 6: address long-term management and prevention

Once the acute episode resolves, address **underlying dementia progression** and implement strategies to prevent future delirium:

- **Medication review**: Regularly review and deprescribe high-risk medications [^7695ce25].
- **Fall prevention**: Assess and mitigate fall risk [^notfound].
- **Advance care planning**: Discuss goals of care and consider palliative care involvement if appropriate [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

In an 80-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease and new agitation, refusal of food, and nocturnal wandering, the next step is to **evaluate for delirium and reversible causes** using a structured approach: screen for delirium, identify reversible contributors, perform targeted diagnostics, and implement nonpharmacologic interventions first, reserving antipsychotics for severe cases. This approach improves outcomes and reduces caregiver burden [^f6cc25c5].

2.1 Framework of the DETeCD‐ADRD guideline

Recognizing that diagnostic and staging criteria for diseases in this field (i.e. AD and ADRD) will evolve, the workgroup focused the scope of this practical and clinically focused guideline on the principles of a patient‐centered diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process in any practice setting. The workgroup considered a major goal of the diagnostic evaluation process to be the development of a three‐step diagnostic formulation. The first step is to delineate the cognitive functional status (i.e. the overall level of impairment). Regardless of the specific symptoms, a patient with dementia requires a different level of support and management from that of a patient with MCI. The second step is to characterize the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome. The particular cognitive–behavioral syndrome recognized by the clinician provides important information about the likely underlying cause(s) and potential contributing factors, and therefore may play a critical role in guiding diagnostic decision making. Also, the specific cognitive–behavioral syndrome communicates the needs of the patient to other professionals and to patients and families who are knowledgeable about these syndromes. By characterizing the full array of cognitive and behavioral symptoms, the clinician establishes the foundation for personalized symptom‐based care and management. Finally, the third step is for the clinician to generate and narrow the differential diagnosis of the brain disease(s) or disorder that is the likely cause(s) of the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, recognizing the importance of differentiating AD from ADRD or other diseases, disorders (e.g. mood disorders), conditions (e.g. sleep apnea), and factors (e.g. effects of medications or alcohol) that may cause or contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Although some segments of the field have evolved to clarify the importance of separating the clinical syndrome from the likely etiology, many diagnostic criteria still consider these conditions clinicopathologic entities; that is, to meet clinical diagnostic criteria, a patient is usually required to exhibit a particular clinical syndrome(s) and some diagnostic test abnormalities supportive of particular neuropathologic changes. The guideline also emphasizes the importance of identifying accompanying factors or conditions that may exacerbate symptoms, which may or may not be possible to ameliorate with medical or behavioral treatments; and of promoting brain‐healthy behaviors (see Box 2).

In mostcases, the goal of the evaluation process is to determine whether the patient has an identifiable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior, formulated in three steps (Recommendation 3). For any given individual, differentiation of what is cognitively behaviorally impaired versus an unimpaired state requires clinical judgment. The first step of the diagnostic formulation is to determine whether a person has subjective cognitive decline, MCI, mild behavioral impairment, or dementia(or mild vs. major neurocognitive disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition terminology; see Table 1 of companion article for primary care). This first‐level diagnosis requires the clinician to integrate reliable history regarding the types, trajectory, and impact of changes in cognitive, behavioral, and daily activity functions with the patient's performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains (attention, memory, language, executive function, visual function, socio‐emotional behavior). The patient's symptoms and performance on tests are both influenced by a variety of individual factors that have to be considered, including education, occupation, culture, living situation, family or other relationship dynamics, developmental history, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. This first step is critical for the clinician to be able to evaluate whether the patient needs or may need specific support, including a surrogate decision maker(s).

Cognitive–behavioral syndromes (syndromic diagnosis) and the differential diagnosis for diseases that cause them (etiologic diagnosis).

The second step — determination of the cognitive–behavioral syndrome — facilitates communication about the specific types of impairments the patient has, regardless of the severity and impact of those impairments (i.e. MCI or dementia). While some patients present classically with one of the recognizable cognitive–behavioral syndromes, others may not fit so clearly into these syndromic categories (Tables 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3). In these cases, additional information or consultation with a subspecialist may be useful. An evaluation by a neuropsychologist proficient in the assessment of AD/ADRD is often invaluable in delineating the cognitive–behavioral syndrome in a patient with a complex presentation and can also be very helpful to suggest the next steps in the evaluation and management process.

In most cases, the goal of the evaluation process is to determine whether the patient has a diagnosable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior. The first step — the determination that a person does or does not have dementia — is critical for the clinician to be able to discuss whether the patient needs or will likely need specific supports, including surrogate decision makers. For any individual, differentiation of what is a cognitive–behaviorally impaired versus an unimpaired state requires clinical judgment. The determination that a person has MCI or dementia (or mild vs. major neurocognitive disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition [DSM‐5] terminology) is the first step of a diagnostic formulation that requires the clinician to integrate reliable history regarding the types, trajectory, and impact of changes in cognitive, behavioral, and daily activity functions with the patient's performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains (attention, memory, language, executive function, visual function, socio‐emotional behavior). The patient's symptoms and performance on tests are both influenced by a variety of individual factors that have to be considered, including education, occupation, culture, living situation, family or other relationship dynamics, developmental history, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities (see Table 1).

Diagnostic workflow for suspected AD/ADRD emphasizes sequential formulation: In most cases, the goal is to determine whether the patient has a diagnosable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior, with the first step being determination that a person does or does not have dementia and integration of reliable history with performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains; the second step — determination of the cognitive-behavioral syndrome — may warrant additional information or specialist consultation, and a neuropsychological evaluation by a neuropsychologist proficient in AD/ADRD assessment is often invaluable and can also be very helpful to suggest next steps; third, clinicians implicate a specific disease and/or consider the likely cause(s) of cognitive impairment or dementia, recognizing a persistent differential diagnosis and using risk and resilience factors and established clinical diagnostic criteria while the field evolves toward separating clinical syndromes from likely neuropathologic changes informed by core and ancillary biomarkers.

2.2.1 Core element one: whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals

The first core element of the process, covered by Recommendations 1 through 3, addresses foundational considerations when initiating and proceeding through a diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process. These include in whom and when to initiate an evaluation; the importance of a patient‐centered and collaborative partnership in the goal‐setting, diagnostic, and disclosure processes; and the three‐step conceptual framework for diagnostic formulation. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG also emphasizes the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process.

Recommendation 1 applies the basic tenets of a high‐quality medical approach to the evaluation of symptoms of cognitive or behavioral decline. The timely evaluation of an individual with cognitive or behavioral symptoms concerning for MCI or dementia represents best medical practice.,

Any middle‐aged or older patient who self‐reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising due to specific neuropathologic changes (Recommendation 1). A clinician should not assume "normality" or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to "normal aging" without an appropriate evaluation. The optimal approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected cognitive or behavioral impairments, whether at the level of subjective cognitive decline, MCI, mild behavioral impairment, or dementia, is grounded in the biopsychosocial model of health and illness.

Clinicians evaluating a patient suspected of having a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising from neurodegenerative disease may face unique challenges arising from impairments that may be present in a patient's awareness of the illness (anosognosia) or understanding and appreciation of medical facts and the ability to use this information to make decisions about medical care or other important activities (capacity). Impairments in awareness and capacity that may be present at the outset or that will arise sooner or later in all patients with dementia due to AD or ADRD dictate the need to engage a care partner in the communication of the diagnosis, optimally from the beginning.

2 METHODS

The methods used in the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG workgroup process are described in the companion article focused on primary care and supplementary material (see supporting information Material). The first 11 recommendations are described in detail in the companion article and summarized very briefly here. Recommendations 12–19 focus on steps in the process typically performed by specialty and subspecialty practitioners and are detailed here (see Box 1 for complete recommendations).

2.1 Framework of the DETeCD‐ADRD guideline

As detailed in the companion article focused on primary care, the workgroup considered a major goal of the diagnostic evaluation process to be the development of a three‐step diagnostic formulation. The first step is to delineate the cognitive functional status (i.e. the overall level of impairment). The second step is to characterize the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, which sets prior probabilities for the likely underlying cause(s) (and potential contributing factors, conditions, and disorders) and plays a critical role in guiding diagnostic decision making. Finally, the third step is for the clinician to generate and narrow the differential diagnosis of the brain disease(s) or disorder(s) that is the likely cause(s) of the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, recognizing the importance of differentiating AD from ADRD or other diseases, disorders (e.g. mood disorders), medical conditions (e.g. sleep apnea), and factors (e.g. effects of medications or substance use) that may cause or contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms. The guideline also emphasizes the importance of identifying accompanying factors or conditions that may exacerbate symptoms, which may or may not be possible to ameliorate with medical or behavioral treatments; and of promoting brain‐healthy behaviors (see Box 2 on brain‐healthy behaviors in companion manuscript for primary care).

To accomplish the three steps of the diagnostic formulation, the evaluation follows a multi‐tiered approach so the clinician can select assessments and tests that follow a structured process but are tailored to the individual patient's circumstances. The three steps of the diagnostic formulation may be relatively straightforward to determine by following a process of seven core elements and using the first tier of assessment and diagnostic tests in a primary care setting, or they may require additional consultation (e.g. neuropsychological evaluation) and tiers of assessments and tests in the primary care, specialty, or dementia subspecialty settings.

DETeCD-ADRD framework — three-step diagnostic formulation centers on a patient-centered diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process and specifies sequential steps: the first step is to delineate the cognitive functional status, the second step is to characterize the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the third step is for the clinician to generate and narrow the differential diagnosis of the likely cause(s) while differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and other contributors; the guideline also emphasizes identifying accompanying factors or conditions that may exacerbate symptoms and promoting brain-healthy behaviors.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Alzheimer's Association convened a Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure Clinical Practice Guideline Workgroup (the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Workgroup). Our emphasis is on good clinical practice for the process of evaluating a patient presenting with an illness (i.e. symptoms, obtained through history, and signs, obtained through examination) that may represent the clinical manifestations of common brain diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD related dementias (ADRD) — in some cases with exacerbating medical conditions or factors. While this guideline applies to a patient with any severity of cognitive or behavioral impairment, it does not consider individuals who do not have symptoms; therefore, it does not address the topic of screening in asymptomatic people. This DETeCD‐ADRD CPG seeks to empower all clinicians, including those in primary, specialty, or subspecialty care, to implement a structured yet individualized patient‐centered approach to diagnostic evaluation that includes clear communication with the patient and an informant or care partner(s).

For any given individual, differentiation of what is a cognitive–behaviorally impaired versus an unimpaired state requires clinical judgment. The determination that a person has mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (or Mild versus Major Neurocognitive Disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition terminology) is the first step of a diagnosis that requires the clinician to integrate reliable history regarding the types and trajectory of changes in cognitive, activities of daily living (ADL), and mood and behavioral functions (from the individual and an informant) with the patient's performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains (attention, memory, language, executive function, visual function, socio‐emotional behavior). The reported symptoms and performance on tests are both influenced by a variety of individual factors that have to be considered, including education, occupation, culture, living situation, family or other relationship dynamics, developmental history, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

FIGURE 3
In a specialty care setting (usually general neurology, geriatric psychiatry, or geriatrics), this diagram briefly illustrates how each primary care clinical practice recommendation fits into the typical workflow (see Figure 2 for details). Additional detail is provided on how higher tier assessments and diagnostic tests fit into the specialty care workflow. In some specialty care settings, the assessments and tests illustrated in Figure 4 are performed to arrive at the 3‐step diagnostic formulation. This diagnostic formulation should then be disclosed clearly and compassionately, and a treatment plan can then be initiated.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or may exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.,

Specialized neurobehavioral assessments and neurologic examinations are also used to monitor status, as well as to disentangle the adverse effects of prior or current treatments (e.g. parkinsonism, dyskinesias, cognitive side effects of medications, sleep and mood changes) from the symptoms of disease(s) and comorbid conditions. Recommendation 12 provides additional detail on patient characteristics that warrant specialist referral.

1

The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD‐ADRD) focuses on recommendations that encourage timely, accurate, and effective diagnosis, staging, and disclosure for individuals living with cognitive‐behavioral decline. The guidelines provide a structured and well operationalized, yet person‐centered, evaluation plan for clinicians in primary and subspecialty care, with the important goal of empowering providers to confidently approach the diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process with their patient and care partner dyads. Furthermore, these recommendations are offered at a time when the financial, societal, and ethical benefits of timely detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective management are being increasingly realized, with dementia prevalence increasing as the population ages, and with the emergence of disease‐modifying treatments being implemented in clinical practice. Thus the timely detection, accurate diagnosis, appropriate disclosure, and proper management of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), is of the utmost importance. In this Perspective, we use ADRD to refer to diseases such as the group of frontotemporal lobar degenerations (tauopathies and TAR DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43) proteinopathies) and cortical Lewy body disease, and specifically discuss the importance of incorporating neuropsychology, as detailed in recommendation 14 of the practice guidelines.

The clinical practice guidelines (CPG) provide a multitiered, three‐step approach to diagnostic formulation, allowing for a structured but individualized process. As outlined in the primary articles, the steps include (1) to delineate the cognitive functional status (i.e. the overall level of impairment); (2) to characterize the patient's cognitive‐behavioral syndrome; and (3) to generate and narrow the differential diagnosis of the brain disease(s) or disorder that is the likely cause(s) of the patient's cognitive‐behavioral syndrome, recognizing the importance of differentiating AD from ADRD or other diseases, disorders (e.g. mood disorders), conditions (e.g. sleep apnea), and factors (e.g. effects of medications or alcohol) that may cause or contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms. A similar approach and diagnostic framework have been proposed to address ongoing challenges in dementia nomenclature.

1.2 History of cognitive symptoms

In the context of a suspected cognitive–behavioral syndrome in an older adult, the potential for complexity, ambiguity, or misdirection of the response to this question is predictably unpredictable. Because diminished insight is common in individuals with a syndrome of cognitive–behavioral impairment, the patient and their care partner (informant) may have divergent opinions about the nature of the symptoms and their consequences. The likelihood of a potential disagreement in perspectives can be communicated up front and be acknowledged as a useful clue for the clinician (e.g. "This is a safe place and time when you should feel free to disagree with each other: it can help me understand and advise you better"). It may be valuable to interview the patient and informant(s) separately because of discomfort with honest reporting or overt friction. Therefore, the clinician needs to be flexible and to encourage and pursue all lines of the story and, informed by these and other information gathered during or after the visit (post‐visit phone calls are often helpful), integrate perspectives and information into an initial narrative that represents the most likely approximation of the actual events.

The meaning of words like "memory loss" or "confusion" used by the patient and informant may differ substantially from the clinician's sense of those words. The clinician must therefore encourage the patient or informant to elaborate by giving specific examples. The loss of episodic memory that occurs in typical MCI or dementia due to AD involves difficulties with learning and recalling newly acquired information and recent life events. Sometimes patients or informants may use the term "memory loss" when referring to word‐finding difficulty, inattention, loss of geographic orientation, or loss of the ability to perform step‐by‐step tasks. It can be very challenging to distinguish the early stages of cognitive decline due to neurodegenerative disease from normal aging. It is important to skillfully communicate that changes which may be common in individuals with advancing age are not always normal and could benefit from further diagnostic evaluation. Several validated instruments offer structured questionnaires to assist in the organization and reporting of symptoms of cognitive impairment (some of these also include mood/behavior and/or daily function (Table 1)).

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

DETeCD-ADRD recommendations — Recommendation 1 (evaluation trigger and scope): For patients who self-report or whose care partner or clinician report cognitive, behavioral, or functional change, the clinician should initiate a multi-tiered evaluation focused on the problem (Strength of Recommendation A). Any middle-aged or older patient who self-reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising as a result of a specific neuropathology, and a clinician should not assume "normality" or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to "normal aging" without an appropriate evaluation, which would constitute suboptimal care. The evaluation process for possible cognitive or behavioral impairment can be initiated and in most cases completed at any of a variety of clinical practice settings: primary care, specialty care, or dementia subspecialty care, and the practitioner's proficiency with this patient population and the profile of the individual patient should guide the evaluation process. The evaluation begins with a history from not only the patient but also — importantly — from someone who knows the patient well (an informant).

US clinical practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or AD and related dementias (ADRD) are decades old and aimed at specialists. This evidence-based guideline was developed to empower all-including primary care-clinicians to implement a structured approach for evaluating a patient with symptoms that may represent clinical AD/ADRD.

This article distills this information to provide a resource to support clinicians in the implementation of this approach in clinical practice. The companion articles provide context for primary care and specialty clinicians with regard to how to fit these instruments into the workflow and actions to take when integration of performance on these instruments with clinical profile and clinician judgment support potential cognitive impairment.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The workgroup attempted to phrase each recommendation as a practical action that is considered one of a series of steps in the evaluation and disclosure process. Recommendations 1 through 11 were purposefully written (and re‐written several times after several rounds of modified‐Delphi discussions and voting by the workgroup) so that they could be assigned the highest strength of recommendation. That is, the benefit of performing the recommended action, as part of the goal‐oriented and dynamic evaluation and disclosure process delineated in Figures 1 and 2, outweighs the potential harm and burden in the majority of circumstances. In so doing, the workgroup sought to describe the fundamental principles and steps of the process of a patient‐centered evaluation that should usually be performed from start to finish.

FIGURE 1
For patients who may be exhibiting symptoms and/or signs of cognitive impairment due to AD or ADRD, the three steps of the diagnostic formulation may be accomplished by following a process of seven core elements. AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADRD, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, Dx, diagnosis; Hx, history.

FIGURE 2
In a primary care setting, this diagram shows the implementation of the seven core elements of the diagnostic evaluation process, illustrating how each clinical practice recommendation fits into the typical workflow, using the first tier of assessments and diagnostic tests. Ultimately, the goal is to evaluate a person with cognitive and/or behavioral symptoms to determine whether they have cognitive impairment and if so its impact on daily function (cognitive functional status), the cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the likely etiology (‐ies) of the impairment. This diagnostic formulation should then be disclosed clearly and compassionately, and a treatment plan can then be initiated. CBC, complete blood count; CRP, C‐reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TSH, thyroid‐stimulating hormone.

The guidance states that "A clinician should not assume 'normality' or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to 'normal aging' without an appropriate evaluation", and that optimal evaluation "is grounded in the biopsychosocial model of health and illness". It highlights "the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process", and notes that dementia-related impairments "dictate the need to engage a care partner in the communication of the diagnosis, optimally from the beginning". For communication and goal-setting, "The clinician should use patient-centered communication to develop a partnership with the patient or with the patient and a care partner to (1) establish shared goals for the evaluation process and (2) assess capacity (understanding and appreciation) to engage", and it affirms that "The timely evaluation of an individual with cognitive or behavioral symptoms concerning for MCI or dementia represents best medical practice".

Basic (Tier 1) diagnostic tests, including a cognitive laboratory panel (Recommendation 8) and structural neuroimaging (Recommendation 9) should be routinely obtained in all patients with a cognitive–behavioral syndrome to inform a confident etiological diagnosis. Importantly, Recommendations 8 through 11 apply to fewer patients than those who begin the process, as some patients in whom there is an initial concern that prompts the evaluation process will, once Recommendations 1 through 7 are followed, be assessed with high confidence to have a cognitive functional status of "cognitively unimpaired" and will not require further testing or evaluation (see Figure 2). Conversely, whether in the primary or specialty setting, for most individuals with typical presentations of AD dementia, the relevant information often would be available at this point to arrive at a confident clinical diagnosis of the likely etiology and to proceed with a disclosure visit emphasizing that such a diagnosis remains probabilistic and clinical judgment based and is not biomarker confirmed. Molecular biomarker confirmation is necessary for consideration of new disease‐modifying therapies that target amyloid plaques.

Several readily treatable common comorbid conditions, including infections, dehydration, hypothyroidism, and vitamin B 12 deficiency, may contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms and may cause subacute or acute clinical decompensation (see Box 4 on delirium in companion article for primary care). Acute mental status changes may be solely due to such conditions, but acute‐on‐chronic decompensations are usually an indication that a patient with a chronic brain disease causing progressive cognitive decline has developed a common comorbid condition.

A description of first‐line routine laboratory testing as "labs for reversible causes of dementia" can be misleading; the conditions being evaluated are rarely the primary etiology of a gradually progressive cognitive–behavioral syndrome but may exacerbate cognitive or behavioral impairment in individuals with underlying neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders (e.g. VCID). The DETeCD‐ADRD Workgroup aimed to provide practical guidance for Tier 1 "cognitive lab panel" testing (Table 4) that should be obtained in all or almost all patients evaluated for suspected cognitive–behavioral syndromes due to their relatively low cost, wide availability, and acceptable yield. The workgroup adopted a multidisciplinary and US health‐care–centric perspective to estimate risk–reward calculus by integrating usual practice, recommendations from other guidelines and practice parameters, and limited evidence.

2 CONCLUSIONS

The cornerstone of the diagnostic assessment of a patient with symptoms concerning AD or ADRD is the history and examination. Although advances in molecular biomarkers of brain diseases leading to cognitive impairment will likely enable their detection in some patients at an asymptomatic stage, the ability of proficient clinicians to recognize and diagnose patients in the early symptomatic stages of these illnesses is critical to optimize early management and hopefully minimize the adverse impact of these diseases on daily function and safety. Although it is common for a history to be taken and an examination to be performed without the use of specific validated instruments, evidence indicates and the DETeCD‐ADRD workgroup strongly believes that the use of such instruments will lead to better outcomes. Instruments to assess symptoms in daily life and their impact on function can be given to patients and informants prior to an office visit and can serve as a mechanism for structuring the history and efficiently identifying areas for focused clinical interviewing while also providing a list of pertinent negatives. A brief neurologic exam tailored to the patient is also important, as is a mental status exam augmented with a validated cognitive assessment instrument. The score on the test should not be interpreted in isolation, but should be integrated with information from the HPI, the patient's demographic background and psychosocial history, family history and other information relevant to the risk profile, medical history, medications, and other relevant information. For proficient clinicians, the synthesis of this information should lead to a diagnostic formulation of the patient's cognitive functional status and cognitive‐behavioral syndrome. In some cases, neuropsychological assessment or additional consultation(s) may be required to develop or further refine these first two steps of the diagnostic formulation.

If a patient has MCI or dementia, an evaluation should be done to determine the likely etiology, if possible, as discussed extensively in the companion articles. These diagnostic elements set prior probabilities on the differential diagnosis of likely etiology (‐ies), which informs clinical decision making regarding Tier 1 to 4 tests and other assessments in the evaluation process. See the primary care companion article for discussion of structural neuroimaging and cognitive lab panel blood tests. In some cases, the steps in this process may be relatively straightforward, and in others they may be quite complex. See the specialty care companion article for discussion of specialized functional and molecular neuroimaging and for fluid molecular biomarkers. Ultimately, the evaluation process should lead to a diagnostic formulation that is communicated clearly and compassionately to the patient and care partner, along with a discussion of management and prognosis.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The second step — determination of the cognitive–behavioral syndrome — facilitates communication about the specific types of impairments the patient has, regardless of the severity and impact of those impairments (i.e. MCI or dementia). While some patients present classically with one of the recognizable cognitive–behavioral syndromes (Table 2), others may not fit so clearly into these syndromic diagnostic criteria. In these cases, additional information or consultation with a specialist may be useful. A neuropsychological evaluation by a neuropsychologist proficient in AD/ADRD assessment is often invaluable in delineating the cognitive–behavioral syndrome in a patient with a complex presentation and can also be very helpful to suggest next steps in the evaluation and management process.

Third, it is important for the clinician to implicate a specific disease and/or condition as the likely cause(s) of cognitive impairment or dementia. While a patient's clinical syndromic profile (cognitive–behavioral syndrome) informs likelihood estimates of underlying disease pathology, there is always a differential diagnosis with regard to the possible neuropathologic changes that may be primarily driving and "responsible" for a given clinical syndrome,(Table 2). A variety of risk and resilience factors can inform the clinician's thinking about the likelihood of specific diseases (e.g. a strong family history of AD increases the likelihood of AD pathology in a symptomatic individual; multiple cerebrovascular risk factors increase the likelihood of VCID). Each of these major disease entities has clinical diagnostic criteria (Tables 3 and 4), although the field is evolving toward a forward‐thinking framework of separation of clinical syndrome from likely neuropathologic changes informed by core and ancillary biomarkers.

2.3 Core element six: iterative diagnostic formulation and multi‐tiered diagnostic testing

By following recommendations to this sixth core element in the evaluation process (see Figures 1, 2, and 3), the clinician should have integrated information about risk profile, history of symptoms, and examination findings to develop an opinion regarding the cognitive functional status and, at least preliminarily, a cognitive–behavioral syndromic diagnosis, if present. There should also be sufficient information for most primary care clinicians to arrive at a first decision point with regard to whether consultative input should be obtained (i.e. from a neuropsychologist, specialist, or dementia subspecialist). In the primary care setting, two or more problem‐focused visits would usually be required to arrive at this point in the diagnostic evaluation process, especially when involving an informant/care partner and allowing sufficient time to assess cognition via a validated standardized instrument.

To achieve the goals of this three‐step diagnostic formulation, the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG recommends a structured and multi‐tiered approach to assessment and testing that begins with a fundamental set of Tier 1 assessments and tests, supplemented as needed by other tests tailored to the patient (see Figures 2, 3). The clinician should formulate the results of the Tier 1 assessments and tests and decide which, if any, additional tests may be required to gain sufficiently high confidence in the presence or absence of a specific diagnosis. A stepped approach to diagnostic evaluation of potential cognitive impairment or dementia is also a cornerstone of other national, European and international guidelines including the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2018 Guidelines on dementia diagnosis and care, Canadian (5th Canadian Consensus Conference on Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia) guidelines, the World Health Organization mhGAP 2016 Intervention Guide, and the 2024 European Intersocietal Recommendations for the biomarker‐based diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders. It is ultimately each clinician who, depending on her or his proficiency, the available data and resources, and the goals of evaluation, must — in partnership with each patient‐care partner dyad — guide the evaluation process to achieve the desired confidence in the syndromic and etiological diagnosis.

Alzheimer's Association DETeCD-ADRD — cognitive assessment tools: In a patient being evaluated for cognitive or behavioral symptoms, clinicians should use validated tools to assess cognition (Strength of Recommendation A), noting that while no single instrument fits all circumstances, the use of a validated instrument to detect cognitive impairment is an invaluable step for identifying potentially clinically significant impairment; interpretation should use the individual's cognitive test score profile, and performance on a validated brief cognitive test should not be interpreted in isolation but integrated with the patient's overall risk profile, history of presenting illness, and other examination and diagnostic findings; when concern exists and a brief test may not be sufficiently informative or may not capture mild but clinically significant impairments, clinicians should strongly consider referral to a neuropsychologist or specialist.

For example, the diagnosis of dementia may be straightforward in a formerly high‐functioning patient whose family reports insidious onset of impaired memory and executive function with impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and who scores a 20/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Yet this first step in the diagnostic formulation may be very challenging in a symptomatic and highly educated person who reports memory loss with an impact on occupational function but who performs in the unimpaired range on a brief cognitive assessment test like the MoCA; such an individual may require a neuropsychological evaluation to document impaired performance or to establish a current baseline that can serve to track changes. Unlike the diagnosis of anemia, hyperkalemia, or proteinuria, there is no test value that determines the diagnosis of MCI or dementia — it requires integration of multiple layers and types of information and, importantly, clinical judgment.

In some cases, a patient with cognitive concerns may be documented to perform normally on detailed neuropsychological evaluation; such a person might be classified as having "subjective cognitive decline", a clinical construct being studied extensively by an international research community. In other cases, a patient has developed an acquired change in personality or behavior but is found to be cognitively intact; such a patient might be classified as having "mild behavioral impairment", another clinical construct being evaluated by the research community.,

The second step — determination of cognitive–behavioral syndrome — facilitates communication about the specific types of impairments the patient has, regardless of the severity of those impairments (i.e. MCI or dementia). While some patients present classically with one of the recognizable cognitive–behavioral syndromes (see Table 2 of companion manuscript), others may not fit so clearly into these syndromic diagnostic criteria. In these cases, additional information from informants may be helpful, or additional office‐based assessments of cognitive, behavioral, and sensorimotor function may be necessary, or consultation with a specialist(s).

Alzheimer's Association DETeCD-ADRD — history taking and individualized risk factors: During history taking for a patient being evaluated for cognitive or behavioral symptoms, the clinician should obtain reliable information about individualized risk factors for cognitive decline (Strength of Recommendation A), recognizing that each person has an individual profile of potentially modifiable risk factors that can modify the likelihood, types, and trajectory of changes and can impact reporting of symptoms and test performance; during the evaluation process, the clinician should systematically obtain knowledge regarding the patient's risk factors and obtain information about the patient's reserve and vulnerability profile, and should integrate this information by contextualizing symptoms and test performance against the risk profile, estimating whether symptoms may be due to effects of diseases or other factors, and incorporating the risk factor profile into the overall care plan through education, counseling, treatment planning, and strategies to mitigate modifiable risk factors.

### The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia [^847e0018]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

As it currently stands, the rate of timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure is inadequately low and is especially protracted for individuals with so‐called "atypical" dementia syndromes such as behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and primary progressive aphasiaor dementias of early onset. It is the hope that these recommendations will be prioritized by providers and resourced by health care systems to be seamlessly integrated into practice. The aim is to aid clinicians in diagnosing the illness in a timely manner, and to define the symptom profile and the likely underlying disease so that a patient‐centered care plan can be developed to optimize quality of life for the patient and family, and to improve outcomes in care settings. With respect to neuropsychology, the guidelines suggest that a more comprehensive evaluation can be especially beneficial when office‐based cognitive assessment is not sufficiently informative or in cases with a level of complexity that leaves the clinician with residual uncertainty surrounding interpretation — we agree that this is well supported by the interpretation of evidence and consensus (as detailed and supported in the CPG evidence review, rationale, and processes), and informed by the principles of good care practices. Indeed, neuropsychological evaluation is critical in these cases and can significantly aid in the assessment of the level of severity of functional status and cognitive syndrome, and in narrowing the probable underlying etiology. Furthermore, we find the positioning, details, and logistics well balanced and appropriate surrounding the addition of neuropsychological evaluation in AD and ADRD care. Specifically, (1) when and where in the evaluation process neuropsychological assessment is necessary; (2) in whom there may be most benefit; (3) what should ideally be assessed, reported, and communicated; and (4) the general "how" to incorporate neuropsychological evaluation in the flow of a patient‐centered and clinician‐orchestrated process in various clinic settings. It is our belief that the overall CPG provides a structured approach with sufficient leeway for clinician proficiency and judgment.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 DETeCD‐ADRD core elements of diagnostic and disclosure process and recommendations: A brief summary

The first 11 recommendations, briefly summarized here, are detailed in the companion article. These recommendations follow a series of seven core elements as illustrated in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
For patients who may be exhibiting symptoms and/or signs of cognitive impairment due to AD or ADRD, the three steps of the diagnostic formulation may be accomplished by following a process of seven core elements. AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADRD, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; Dx, diagnosis, Hx, history.

2.2.1 Core element one: Whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals

The first core element of the process, covered by Recommendations 1 through 3, addresses foundational considerations when initiating and proceeding through a diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG emphasized the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process.

Any middle‐aged or older patient who self‐reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have AD or an ADRD (Recommendation 1). The clinician should use patient‐centered communication to develop a partnership with the patient or with the patient and a care partner to (1) establish shared goals for the evaluation process and (2) assess the patient's capacity (understanding and appreciation) to engage in the goal‐setting process for the evaluation (Recommendation 2). Such a relationship provides a foundation to ensure that all information necessary for an accurate diagnosis is obtained, that an explanation of the illness being faced is effectively communicated, and that a robust plan of care is formulated and implemented. Throughout the process, the clinician's assessment of the patient's awareness and capacity should guide the timing and content of the information shared with the patient and their care partner. A separate article in this special issue summarizes the challenges of and provides guidance on the assessment of capacity in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

Recommendation 12 — Referral for atypical, early-onset, or rapidly progressive cases — A patient with atypical findings or in whom there is uncertainty about how to interpret the evaluation, or that is suspected of having an early-onset or rapidly progressive cognitive–behavioral condition, should be further evaluated expeditiously, usually including referral to a specialist (Strength of Recommendation A). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered to be urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management, and atypical, rapidly progressive or early-onset (young age of onset, age < 65 years) dementias pose unique diagnostic and care challenges that may require comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation and specialist assessment, interpretation, or management.

Abstract

US clinical practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD and related dementias (ADRD) are decades old and aimed at specialists. This evidence‐based guideline was developed to empower all — including primary care — clinicians to implement a structured approach for evaluating a patient with symptoms that may represent clinical AD/ADRD. Through a modified‐Delphi approach and guideline‐development process (7374 publications were reviewed; 133 met inclusion criteria) an expert workgroup developed recommendations as steps in a patient‐centered evaluation process. This summary focuses on recommendations, appropriate for any practice setting, forming core elements of a high‐quality, evidence‐supported evaluation process aimed at characterizing, diagnosing, and disclosing the patient's cognitive functional status, cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and likely underlying brain disease so that optimal care plans to maximize patient/care partner dyad quality of life can be developed; a companion article summarizes specialist recommendations. If clinicians use this guideline and health‐care systems provide adequate resources, outcomes should improve in most patients in most practice settings.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, CCSMH 2025 guidelines recommend to review the underlying etiology of dementia, the stage of dementia (mild, moderate, advanced), and the specific BPSD of concern, including the frequency, duration, severity, and any associated risks when assessing BPSD.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms often precede cognitive decline, and they commonly increase in frequency and intensity as neurodegenerative dementing conditions progress. The 13‐item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), is the most widely used instrument to survey many of these symptoms. Other validated instruments offer structured questionnaires that can assist in the organization and reporting of symptoms of mood or behavioral change (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Validated instruments to assist in the assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD/ADRD.

In contrast, some patients present with late age‐of‐onset depression that may be a primary psychiatric illness (see Box 3 of companion manuscript) or a symptom associated with vascular–ischemic cognitive impairment, prodromal Parkinson's disease, or other conditions not necessarily related to a progressive disease leading to dementia. It can be very difficult to differentiate these clinical depression syndromes from a dementia‐related syndrome with accompanying depression. More in‐depth assessment instruments used to evaluate depression include the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ‐9), or Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). In patients with challenging and complex profiles, formal neuropsychological evaluation can be particularly helpful to assess potential contributions of depression or mood disorders to cognitive–behavioral symptoms and performance, and to aid in the differential etiological diagnosis as well as recommendations for next steps in evaluation and care.

TABLE 1
Validated instruments to assist in the structured reporting of symptoms of cognitive impairment.

A critical element of the compilation of a history of cognitive or behavioral symptoms is its profile of characteristics, intensity, temporal course, and impact. Patients and informants may struggle to explain how symptoms first appeared; how they may have evolved over time in frequency, duration, and intensity; or whether the symptoms were episodic or ever‐present but may have become more noticeable or troubling. It is very common for patients and companions to frame their history‐telling around an event such as a surgery or a major psychosocial trauma that they concluded was solely causal. It can be very challenging for a clinician to dissociate the description of symptoms or behaviors of the patient from the patient's or care partner's view of a possibly (but in many cases not likely solely) causal mechanism. Patients, informants, and many clinicians with limited proficiency with dementia assessment often attribute changes in cognition, daily activities, behavior, or sensorimotor function to "normal aging" or to anxiety, mood, or sleep disorders. While acquisition of some of the critical historical information could be captured using algorithmic approaches, the clinician's understanding of a history of the insidious development of mid‐ to late‐life cognitive or behavioral symptoms is an iterative process, truly an art anchored in clinical experience, diligence, and judgment. Proficiency in this art can be facilitated by a comprehensive and structured approach, but for it to be patient centered and most beneficial, this triadic dialogue, which also provides ample opportunities for psychoeducation, cannot be reduced to an algorithmic inquisition.

NIA-AA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia — diagnosis can be made when the patient "Meets criteria for dementia syndrome" and has "An insidious onset: symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days", with "Clear-cut history of worsening of cognition", and initial prominent deficits in an amnestic presentation or specified non-amnestic presentations. The amnestic presentation "is the most common syndromic presentation of AD dementia" with "impairment in learning and recall of recently learned information" plus another domain deficit, while non-amnestic variants include "Language presentation", "Visuospatial presentation", and "Executive dysfunction", each with additional domain deficits. The diagnosis "should not be applied" when there is evidence of substantial concomitant cerebrovascular disease, core features of dementia with Lewy bodies, prominent behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, prominent semantic variant or non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or another concurrent active disease/comorbidity/medication affecting cognition. "Biomarker evidence increases the certainty" that AD pathophysiology underlies the syndrome; if both amyloid-beta and neuronal injury biomarkers are present the "likelihood is high that dementia is due to AD", if either are absent it is "highly likely not due to AD", and if conflicting, likelihood is "intermediate".

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Atypical or rapidly progressive presentations — urgent evaluation and specialist referral guidance includes that delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management. Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities, sensorimotor impairment, or profound mood and behavioral symptoms, and patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing or studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in cognitive–behavioral neurology or geriatric psychiatry. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Core elements of the evaluation workflow are described in Recommendations 4 through 7 and include structured information gathering, risk profiling, and examinations. Guidance includes use of a structured approach to obtain history and systems review information representing not only the patient's perspective but in most cases also reliable collateral information from an informant, and emphasizes eliciting personalized information regarding risk factors for cognitive decline. The clinician should perform a mental status examination that assesses cognition, mood and behavior, and a dementia-focused neurologic examination, using validated tools whenever feasible, and it is also fundamentally important to consider psychiatric history and psychiatric disorders in the differential diagnosis in patients with cognitive impairment, recognizing that it is not uncommon for neurologic diseases to present with primary psychiatric symptoms.

Diagnostic evaluation process — To accomplish the three steps of the diagnostic formulation, "the evaluation follows a multi-tiered approach so the clinician can select assessments and tests that follow a structured process but that are tailored to the individual patient's circumstances". Depending on practitioner proficiency and patient profile, the evaluation "can be initiated and, in many situations, completed in a primary clinical practice setting". The three steps may be "relatively straightforward to determine by following a process of seven core elements… and using the first tier of assessment and diagnostic tests in a primary care setting", or may require "additional consultation (e.g., neuropsychological evaluation) and tiers of assessments and tests in the primary care… specialty… or dementia subspecialty settings".

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

While multiple barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure of AD/ADRD exist in primary care, individuals with typical AD dementia can and should be readily diagnosed with confidence in the primary care setting. By gaining proficiency with the testing and processes recommended in this guideline, most PCPs should find it relatively straightforward to suspect and then diagnose dementia likely due to AD in a patient with a typical presentation of gradually progressive memory loss and difficulty with judgment and problem solving, and often spatial and/or temporal orientation, which have impacted ADLs, and in whom cognitive lab panel and brain MRI are also supportive (i.e. unrevealing in the former and consistent with AD in the latter). However, some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management.

Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, cortical visual dysfunction), sensorimotor impairment (e.g. visual field cut, limb apraxia or rigidity, myoclonus, eye movement abnormalities, incoordination, gait abnormalities), or profound mood and behavioral symptoms (e.g. disinhibition, manic‐like behavior, flat or indifferent affect, or severe depressive or anxious mood or psychotic thought content). Patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing and studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

1.3 History of mood and/or behavioral symptoms

In many patients, behavioral or mood‐related (neuropsychiatric) symptoms are an early feature of neurodegenerative disease and may or may not be recognized by patients or informants as part of the illness under evaluation. In many cases, the patient or care partner may not recognize them as being related to cognitive decline, a condition or brain disease, and the clinician must probe for these or other neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition to providing diagnostic information, symptoms such as depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, or obsessive‐compulsive behavior may offer targets for symptomatic treatment. Yet the clinician must also make sure that the words being used by the patient or informant to report on symptoms are consistent with the observed changes in behavior. Concerns about "personality change" need to be discussed to determine whether they arise from apathy, depression, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, disinhibition, impulsivity, compulsive behavior, or loss of empathic concern. Similarly, an informant's impression that a patient who is no longer interested in previous activities is depressed might arise when the patient's change in affect and behavior is rather due to apathy and executive dysfunction. A clinician experienced with these problems who carefully probes the history will often be able to differentiate apathy and executive dysfunction from symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder. Correspondingly, reports of the patient appearing anxious, hiding items and then not knowing where they are, being avoidant, and "forgetting" or resisting to take medications or to eat may, upon a deeper dive by a probing clinician, be discovered to be due to paranoid delusions or hallucinations (e.g. see recently updated International Psychogeriatric Association [IPA] criteria for psychosis in major and mild neurocognitive disorders) instead of anxiety and memory dysfunction. The approaches to psychoeducation, counseling, management, and care differ greatly based on these different impressions and conditions.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1.6 History of sleep disturbance

In an evaluation of a patient with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, a clinician should always ask questions about sleep. Instruments useful for this purpose include the Mayo Sleep Questionnaireor the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (SCOPA). Sleep‐related symptoms may be hallmarks of certain neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia, or sleep disorders may adversely impact overall function in any individual, particularly those with MCI or dementia; addressing sleep problems through lifestyle interventions improves general health. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder — with loss of REM‐associated atonia resulting in acting out of dreams, often violently — has a strong association with LBD. Symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorders are even more likely to be under‐reported by informants and, almost never, by patients.REM sleep behavioral disturbances may precede by many years what ultimately evolves to become DLB or Parkinson's‐related dementia. In cognitively unimpaired persons, reduced slow‐wave sleep activity and low sleep efficiency are both associated with accelerated rate of cortical amyloid beta plaque deposition, and hence accumulation of AD‐related neuropathological change.

Sleep disorders have multiple relationships with cognitive and behavioral syndromes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is deleterious to optimal brain function and health. It is common in MCIand can exacerbate impairments in cognition, mood/behavior, and/or function. Treatment of OSA may reverse cognitive and behavioral decline in some patients.

1.7 Examination

Primary care clinicians hold a key relationship with their patients who often trust them for information, guidance, endorsement, recommendations, and referrals. Primary care providers are also often in the best position to detect early signs on examination of a cognitive–behavioral syndrome as it is developing given their longitudinal relationship with the patient, even if mental status was not previously formally assessed. It may be obvious to a primary care clinician that a patient's cognition, mood, or behavior is clearly different relative to their baseline, prompting a formal mental status examination. Or, concerns raised in the history or by information provided from an informant may identify the need for a mental status examination. A first‐tier mental status examination of cognitive ability, mood, and behavior may be efficiently completed within a problem‐focused primary care visit. The goal of such an assessment is to detect, with acceptable sensitivity, the presence of potentially clinically significant lower‐than‐expected or impaired cognitive performance, or abnormal mood or behavior. We recommend that a mental status examination include the use of a validated brief cognitive assessment test instrument(s) (Table 4).

2.4 Which patients might be considered for a referral to a specialist?

Some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. An evaluation by a specialist or a dementia subspecialist should be strongly considered if a patient presents with atypical cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, apraxia, agnosia), sensorimotor dysfunction (e.g. cortical visual abnormalities, movement or gait disorders), accompanying mood/behavioral disturbance (e.g. profound anxiety, depression, apathy, psychosis, or changes in personality), rapid progression, or fluctuating course (e.g. suggestive of potential superimposed delirium, LBD, or VCID; Figure 3). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing within weeks or months) are urgent medical problems requiring prompt examination, and in some cases, in‐patient evaluation and management. Patients with atypical forms of neurodegenerative dementias may have substantially different care and management needs and considerations regarding safety than patients with typical presentations of dementia due to AD. Delays in accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with atypical and young‐onset dementias may cause substantial distress, harm, and costs to patients, families, and society, especially when a patient is working and/or raising children at home.

2.2.2 Core elements two through five: History, systems review, risk profile, and exam

Recommendations 4 through 7 provide guidance regarding the next four core elements of the evaluation process, including the use of a structured approach to obtain history and systems review information in the key domains of cognition, daily function, mood and behavior, and sensorimotor function, representing not only the patient's perspective but in most cases also reliable collateral information from an informant. The clinician should perform a mental status examination that assesses cognition, mood, and behavior, and a dementia‐focused neurologic examination, using validated tools whenever feasible. A separate article in this special issue provides detailed descriptions of instruments that can be used to facilitate these assessments.

When considering risk profile, it is important to recognize that a majority of individuals older than age 80 with cognitive impairment harbor more than one type of brain pathological change. Older persons with AD neuropathological changes often have concomitant changes related to vascular disease — including macroinfarcts, microinfarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy — as well as other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. LBD, TDP‐43 proteinopathy, hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease). In addition, many older adults with cognitive impairment have other potentially contributing conditions (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea, use of cognitively impairing medications, excessive alcohol consumption) that can exacerbate cognitive or behavioral symptoms. It is always important to keep in mind the potential contribution of a primary psychiatric disorder, recognizing that it may be difficult to differentiate from a symptom of an emerging neurodegenerative disease (see Box 3 on psychiatric disorders and dementia in companion manuscript for primary care). Therefore, it is not uncommon, in older individuals and those with multiple comorbidities, that a cognitive–behavioral syndrome has a "mixed etiology", which when causing dementia‐level impairment is called mixed etiology dementia. Patients with mixed etiology dementia are more likely to present with atypical or non‐amnestic symptoms, and the identification of these factors may also provide opportunities for risk mitigation and optimization of care and management, particularly when cardiac, cerebrovascular, sleep, medication/supplement, or alcohol/substance‐related risk factors are present.

Box 4: Delirium — Delirium is described as a sometimes life threatening but often preventable acute disorder of cognition and attention that often occurs during a medical illness or after surgery, and it is common in older vulnerable adults. Diagnosis is clinical with acute onset and fluctuating course involving inattention, impaired level of consciousness, and disturbance of cognition; in typical delirium, changes develop on timescales of hours to days and may fluctuate within minutes to hours. Evaluation benefits from a validated brief cognitive assessment instrument such as a form of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). When delirium is suspected, measures should be initiated to prevent delirium complications, symptoms should be managed using non-pharmacological and, in severe cases, pharmacological strategies, and delirium severity should be measured over time to ensure appropriate response and resolution. A hypoactive subtype is more common among older individuals and is associated with greater risk of morbidity and mortality.

Considerations for implementation — triage urgency and referral: The diagnosis of delirium requires urgent or emergent care across settings, rapidly progressive dementia requires urgency and specialist involvement, and atypical or early-onset presentations should usually involve prompt specialist referral; atypical findings may include attentional impairments, prominent language or social–behavioral abnormalities, sensory or motor dysfunction of cerebral origin, and cognitive performance confounded by educational/occupational attainment.

A description of first‐line routine laboratory testing as "labs for reversible causes of dementia" can be misleading; the term "cognitive lab panel" may be more suitable. The conditions being evaluated in such a panel are rarely the primary etiology of a gradually progressive cognitive–behavioral syndrome, but often exacerbate cognitive or behavioral impairment in individuals with underlying neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders (e.g. VCID). It is highly unlikely for a hormonal or vitamin deficiency, or metabolic, infectious, autoimmune, toxic, neoplastic, or paraneoplastic condition to mimic the clinical phenotype of typical AD/ADRD; it is more likely for a subsyndromal delirium caused by these conditions to secondarily becloud and decompensate cognitive–behavioral function in an individual with underlying AD/ADRD pathological changes. It is also possible, though very uncommon, for some of these conditions to primarily cause atypical dementia syndromes: reports of very rare instances (with insufficient long‐term follow‐up) notwithstanding, meta‐analyses suggest that 0.3% to 0.6% of dementia syndromes may be at least partially "reversible"; while in ≈ 9% of dementia syndromes a common comorbid condition may be observed.

### The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia [^7fe51852]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The provision of recommendations tailored to the patient's specific cognitive‐behavioral profile and level of functioning is also of the utmost importance when considering the quality of life of the individual and their care partner. A neuropsychological evaluation and feedback can assist the family to appreciate the patient's level of impairment and to begin planning for future care and needs. Often, an individual's family or loved ones become frustrated and overwhelmed by behavioral or cognitive changes they observed but had difficulty understanding or managing. The evaluation can help delineate which activities of daily living the patient may need assistance with at the time of the assessment and suggest accommodations to support the individual's maximal level of functioning within their environment, a task that is especially challenging for early‐onset dementia. For example, as expressed in the CPG, neuropsychologists furnish additional value to the care of patients when they provide, as an integral component of the evaluation and feedback process, tailored recommendations to help compensate for areas of impairment such as memory or executive functions, help effectively communicate findings, and deliver recommendations for further assessment (e.g. of home safety, driving, dysphagia) and management. In addition, a full evaluation can help guide medical decision‐making for individuals who are at risk for delirium in the context of preexisting dementia.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^679861f3]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinician should use patient‐centered communication to develop a partnership with the patient or with the patient and a care partner to (1) establish shared goals for the evaluation process and (2) assess capacity (understanding and appreciation) to engage in the goal‐setting process for the evaluation (Recommendation 2). Such a relationship provides a foundation aiming to ensure that all information necessary for an accurate diagnosis is obtained, that an explanation of the illness being faced is effectively communicated, and that a robust plan of care is formulated and implemented. The provider should convey medical information, assess the patient and care partner's knowledge and appreciation of that knowledge, and offer education and support. Throughout the process, the clinician's assessment of the patient's awareness and capacity should guide the timing and content of the information shared with the patient and their care partner.

Although the triadic clinician–patient–informant relationship is unusual in the practice of adult medicine, it is nonetheless essential to assure that an accurate diagnosis is made, an appropriate explanation of the illness being faced by the patient and family is provided, and a comprehensive and practical plan of care is formulated and implemented. Other consensus recommendations and guidelines also emphasize the critical importance of establishing a triadic relationship that involves a patient‐centered communication approach, including a care partner, optimally from the beginning of a structured and iterative process (see Figure 1).,

The practical considerations for achieving the most effective triadic relationship are often complex and can, in some circumstances–and particularly in primary care settings — be challenging to accommodate. For example, the most honest history from an informant may be best obtained in private. In some primary care settings, privacy concerns may make it difficult to involve an informant in the evaluation process. Some clinician's offices may not be physically or operationally designed to optimally accommodate a patient and care partner. Relationship dynamics between the patient and family members or informant/care partners can be complicated and may necessitate several streams of communication and a separate space. It can be very helpful to start the process with a meeting to establish shared goals for the diagnostic evaluation process.

### Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: bridging mechanisms, management, and emerging innovations [^4dee9da7]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are among the most distressing and functionally disruptive features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting the vast majority of individuals across the disease continuum. These symptoms, ranging from apathy and depression to agitation and psychosis, not only worsen quality of life but also predict faster decline, earlier institutionalization, and heightened caregiver burden. Yet, despite their clinical significance, NPS remain under-recognized and undertreated. This review synthesizes current understanding of the biological underpinnings of NPS in AD, highlighting network-level dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalances, neuroinflammation, and emerging roles for tau pathology and circadian disruption. We critically examine current treatment paradigms, noting that pharmacologic interventions offer benefit but often carry significant risks. In contrast, non-pharmacological approaches, particularly those that integrate caregiver training, environmental design, and sensory engagement, hold promise but are inconsistently applied in routine care. Emerging innovations, including neuromodulation, repurposed agents (e.g., beta-blockers, cannabinoids), and digital therapeutics such as virtual reality and AI-enabled monitoring tools, offer new therapeutic avenues. We call for a paradigm shift toward person-centered, mechanistically-informed care that aligns intervention strategies with biological drivers of NPS. Future progress hinges on inclusive clinical trials, implementation of first-line behavioral strategies, and development of biomarker-guided, precision approaches to symptom management. Effective care for NPS in AD demands integration, not substitution, of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies, grounded in a deeper understanding of both disease biology and lived patient experience.

2.6 Status of interventions to date

Despite the significant impact of NPS on AD outcomes, treatment options with strong efficacy and safety are limited. Non‐pharmacological interventions are first‐line treatments and have shown positive results, but their real‐world application is limited due to inconsistent caregiver training. Individuals with severe NPS are often transferred to emergency departments or hospitals, which can worsen symptoms and increase health‐care costs. Keeping individuals in familiar environments is a key clinical goal. While non‐drug interventions are preferred, emerging evidence supports pharmacological options when needed.

In 2022, Freedman et al. reported on the results of their Virtual Behavioral Medicine Program (VBM), a model of virtual care that implements both non‐pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to support the management of patients with NPS in their own environment. The authors reported that individuals referred to VBM reduced transfers to the behavioral unit by > 60%. While this program may be scalable at the international level, this study will need to be replicated in a larger sample size to confirm findings.

Oftentimes, non‐pharmacological interventions need to be supplemented with pharmacological interventions for the management of NPS. With regard to pharmacological interventions, only one medication has been approved for the management of NPS in AD in Canada and Europe: risperidone for the short‐term management of agitation. In 2022, six trials were actively investigating novel and repurposed agents for agitation in AD: two separate trials investigated synthetic cannabinoids, and one trial each investigated the use of an antidepressant (escitalopram), an atypical antipsychotic (brexipiprazole), a serotonin‐6 receptor antagonist (SUVN‐502), and the deuterated form of dextromethorphan/quinidine (AVP‐786). Details of those trials are provided in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Summary of ongoing clinical trials for agitation in AD.

A review of the updated evidence on pharmacological interventions supports the use of aripiprazole, given its demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of AD‐related psychosis, with some promise for pimavanserin based on clinical trial evidence. Though there are no approved treatments for apathy to date, methylphenidate has demonstrated improvements in apathy compared to placebo in phase II clinical trials.

### Speech and language features as indicators of neuropsychiatric symptoms in a memory clinic population [^5efa0ca3]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), defined as behavioral non‐cognitive disturbances, can manifest before measurable cognitive impairment in neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) and persist throughout the disease course. Present in 35% to 85% of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), they are key prognostic factors for dementia progression, linked to higher MCI incidence, and to disease‐specific cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and tau biomarkers. Agitation, anxiety, and apathy are among the NPSs most strongly associated with incident MCI, while depression was identified at the Lancet Commission's latest report as one of the 14 modifiable dementia risk factors. More importantly, the review by The Real‐World Outcomes Across the Alzheimer's Disease Spectrum for Better Care: Multi‐Modal Data Access Platform (ROADMAP) initiative emphasized that behavioral and psychiatric outcomes (including emotions of anxiety, depression, apathy, verbal/physical aggression, and irritation) were consistently prioritized and deemed meaningful by patients, caregivers, and professionals directly impacted by Alzheimer's disease (AD) across all stages. Consequently, NPSs are crucial focus areas for disease prognosis and prevention. Early NPS understanding and management can enhance diagnosis, indicate a high risk of dementia progression, and mitigate negative impacts on patients and caregivers.

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Recommendations for dosing in patients with ARIA-E depend on clinical symptoms and radiographic severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Recommendations for dosing in patients with ARIA-H depend on the type of ARIA-H and radiographic severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Use clinical judgment in considering whether to continue dosing in patients with recurrent ARIA-E.

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 24 weeks of treatment with KISUNLA. If a patient experiences symptoms suggestive of ARIA, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

There is limited experience in patients who continued dosing through asymptomatic but radiographically mild to moderate ARIA-E. There are limited data for dosing patients who have experienced recurrent episodes of ARIA-E.

Providers should encourage patients to participate in real world data collection (e.g., registries) to help further the understanding of Alzheimer's disease and the impact of Alzheimer's disease treatments.

### A brief history of a β imaging [^b1828ab7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

3.5 Appropriate use criteria and clinical impact of Aβ imaging

Clinical criteria for the appropriate use of Aβ imaging have been established, emphasizing the importance of integrating Aβ imaging with a thorough clinical and cognitive evaluation conducted by a clinician experienced in dementia assessment. This approach aims at ensuring a positive impact on patient management. These criteria clearly outline the specific situations in which Aβ imaging should be utilized, such as in patients with persistent or progressive unexplained cognitive impairment, progressive atypical or unclear clinical presentations of dementia, or when dementia onset occurs in individuals aged 65 years or younger. The criteria also specify situations where Aβ imaging is inappropriate, including cases of probable AD with a typical age of onset, assessment of dementia severity, asymptomatic individuals or those with unconfirmed cognitive complaints, individuals with a family history of dementia or carriers the APOE ε4 allele, and nonmedical uses such as for litigation or insurance purposes.

These criteria were tested in a multicenter trial, the Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS), assessing the clinical utility of Aβ imaging in the evaluation of patients with MCI or dementia of uncertain origin. The initial findings from this trial indicated that Aβ imaging results led to more than a 60% change in the clinical management of these patients within 90 days. This change was often reflected in an adjustment of their acetylcholinesterase inhibitor medication. Overall, Aβ imaging also resulted in a change in diagnostic confidence and patient management in up to 60% of cases seen in memory clinics.

SNMMI/EANM brain [18F]FDG PET — common clinical indications in cognitive impairment and dementia — notes that in Alzheimer disease (AD), [18F]FDG PET is viewed as a marker of neurodegeneration and progression, and a recent study suggests it is an independent biomarker to predict AD conversion in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) along with amyloid-β and tau, independent of hippocampal volume and amyloid PET status. [18F]FDG PET is recommended to support early diagnosis of AD in MCI, early diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD), and is also recommended to support the differential diagnosis between AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), AD and DLB, AD and vascular dementia, and between clinical variants of FTLD including behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and primary progressive aphasia. Consensus algorithms have been proposed emphasizing its greater value as a first-line evaluation when a non-AD disorder is clinically suspected, typical topographic patterns of relative hypometabolism associated with AD, FTLD, and DLB are summarized, and beyond vascular dementia [18F]FDG PET can help distinguish degenerative from nondegenerative cognitive impairment.

### Real-world evidence of brexpiprazole use and 6-month mortality, hospitalization, and emergency department visits among persons with dementia [^324c0733]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer disease and dementias of other types are accompanied by myriad behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms that adversely affect the quality of life of persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners. The most common neuropsychiatric symptoms are depression, apathy, and agitation with 66 percent of PLWD having a diagnosis of these symptoms in a single year. Over the course of disease, it is estimated that up to 50% of PLWD experience agitation symptomsand up to 90% among persons with Alzheimer disease. Use of CNS active drugs, including antidepressants, atypical and typical antipsychotics, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants, is prevalent among PLWD.

In 2024, the International Psychogeriatric Association published a consensus algorithm to guide agitation reduction and prevention in persons with neurocognitive disorders through integration of psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. Until recently, there were no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacologic treatments for agitation for PLWD and prescribing was "off label". There are relatively few studies of the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy for agitation in PLWD. Antipsychotics are the most commonly used pharmaceutical agents for PLWD with moderate-to-severe agitation. Although double-blind placebo-controlled studies of risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazolereported small reductions in agitation, only brexpiprazole was studied in a large, phase 3 trial intended to obtain FDA approval.

In May 2023, the FDA announced approval of the atypical antipsychotic, brexpiprazole, under the brand name Rexulti, for treating agitation in persons with Alzheimer disease citing favorable efficacy and safety profiles in clinical trials. However, a serious consideration for use of antipsychotics is that they have been shown to increase the risk of death in persons with dementia, and thus brexpiprazole, like other antipsychotics, includes a FDA black box warning. The trials of 345 persons with Alzheimer's disease assessed the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in persons with Alzheimer disease and demonstrated improvement in agitation over a 12-week period, relative to placebo. Across all 3 published trials, 7 patients died during the phase 3 trial–6 participants treated with brexpiprazole and one in the control group. Study investigators reported that the deaths were unrelated to treatment but acknowledged that with limited duration of treatment, longer-term safety data were needed.
