## Question

A 12-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of fatigue, dyspnea, and mild chest pain on exertion for 1 week. She does not have a fever or a rash. She had an upper respiratory infection 3 weeks ago. She returned from summer camp in Colorado 3 days ago. She says they went hiking and camping as part of their activities. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 96/min, and blood pressure is 106/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention and 1+ pitting edema on both ankles. A few scattered inspiratory crackles are heard in the thorax and an S3 is heard at the apex. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Her hemoglobin concentration is 11.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8900/mm3, and ESR is 10 mm/hr. An x-ray of the chest shows mild cardiac enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Answer Choices:
A. Acute rheumatic fever
B. Borrelia burgdorferi infection
C. Coxsackie virus infection
D. Rhinovirus infection

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely for a 12-year-old girl with new exertional dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, jugular venous distension, S3 gallop, peripheral edema, and mild cardiomegaly, following a recent upper respiratory infection and recent hiking at altitude in Colorado. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether this fits heart failure. Then, I should verify the temporal relationship to the preceding URI and consider viral myocarditis. Next, I will examine the differential diagnoses, including acute rheumatic fever, Lyme carditis, and whether a simple rhinovirus could explain this. After that, I need to check which option best matches the pathophysiology and epidemiology. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and outline the next diagnostic steps, making sure I don't jump to conclusions without anchoring to guidelines and typical disease courses.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The combination of exertional dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, jugular venous distension, an S3 gallop, peripheral edema, and pulmonary crackles is classic for congestive heart failure, and in pediatrics these findings align with pediatric heart failure presentations described in contemporary guidance, which include jugular venous distension, S3, rales, and edema alongside objective testing such as echocardiography and natriuretic peptides when indicated [^1165qmzf].

> Wait, let me verify the timing relative to the URI. The symptoms began about 1 week ago, roughly 2–3 weeks after a documented upper respiratory infection, which fits the typical latency for viral myocarditis following a prodromal URI; this temporal pattern strengthens the case for a post-viral myocarditic process rather than an acute infectious syndrome coinciding with the URI itself.

> I will now examine the differential. Acute rheumatic fever can cause carditis, but I should confirm whether Jones criteria are met; there is no fever, no migratory polyarthritis, no chorea, no erythema marginatum, and no subcutaneous nodules, and the ESR is normal, which makes rheumatic fever less likely despite the recent streptococcal pharyngitis risk implied by the URI history [^notfound]. Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme carditis) can cause conduction disease and myocarditis, but I need to check for exposure risk; Colorado is not endemic for Lyme disease, so the pretest probability is low unless there is a history of travel to endemic regions or a tick bite, which is not described here, making Lyme carditis unlikely in this scenario [^notfound]. Rhinovirus typically causes mild upper respiratory symptoms and does not classically precipitate myocarditis or heart failure, so it would be an atypical explanation for this constellation of findings, though I should acknowledge that many URIs are viral and nonspecific and could theoretically be a trigger; still, the clinical severity and signs of heart failure point away from a simple rhinovirus etiology for the current presentation [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm which option best fits the pathophysiology. Coxsackievirus is a prototypical cause of viral myocarditis, with a well-described post-URI latency and a clinical picture of heart failure with ventricular dysfunction; the timing, age group, and physical findings here align with that pattern, and pediatric heart failure guidance emphasizes recognizing HF signs and confirming with echocardiography and supportive testing when myocarditis is suspected, which fits this case closely [^1165qmzf].

> Let me consider the altitude exposure briefly. Initially, I wondered if high-altitude exposure could explain hypoxemia or edema, but her oxygen saturation is 96% on room air, which argues against significant altitude-related hypoxemia; moreover, the JVD and S3 point to intrinsic cardiac dysfunction rather than altitude physiology alone, so the altitude history is likely incidental rather than causal in this presentation [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic steps to solidify the diagnosis. I need to ensure we obtain an echocardiogram to assess ventricular function, wall motion, and pericardial effusion, and I should check troponin and natriuretic peptides to support myocardial injury and hemodynamic stress, respectively; these are standard elements in the evaluation of suspected pediatric myocarditis and heart failure per contemporary pediatric heart failure guidance and general cardiology principles [^1165qmzf].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is viral myocarditis due to Coxsackievirus infection, given the recent URI, the 1–3 week latency, the age of the patient, and the classic heart failure phenotype with JVD, S3, edema, and cardiomegaly; the absence of features of rheumatic fever, the non-endemic setting for Lyme disease, and the atypical severity for rhinovirus further support this choice [^1165qmzf].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **Coxsackie virus myocarditis** [^notfound] given the recent upper respiratory infection, the 1–3 week latency to exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain, and the exam findings of jugular venous distension, S3 gallop, peripheral edema, and mild cardiomegaly — classic for viral myocarditis with heart failure [^1165qmzf]. Acute rheumatic fever is less likely without fever, rash, or migratory arthritis, and Lyme carditis is unlikely without endemic exposure or conduction disease. Rhinovirus rarely causes myocarditis, and the clinical severity here points to Coxsackie virus as the culprit [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting Coxsackie virus myocarditis

- **Recent upper respiratory infection**: Coxsackie virus commonly causes URI symptoms 1–3 weeks before myocarditis onset [^notfound].
- **Latency period**: The 1–3 week gap between URI and cardiac symptoms is typical for viral myocarditis [^notfound].
- **Clinical presentation**: Exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain are common in myocarditis [^notfound].
- **Physical examination findings**: Jugular venous distension, S3 gallop, peripheral edema, and pulmonary crackles indicate heart failure [^1165qmzf].
- **Chest X-ray**: Mild cardiac enlargement is consistent with myocarditis-related cardiomegaly [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Option** | **Reason for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Acute rheumatic fever | - Absence of fever, rash, or migratory arthritis <br/> - Normal ESR makes ARF unlikely [^notfound] |
| Borrelia burgdorferi infection (Lyme carditis) | - No endemic exposure or tick bite history <br/> - No conduction abnormalities reported [^notfound] |
| Rhinovirus infection | - Typically causes mild URI symptoms <br/> - Rarely causes myocarditis or heart failure [^notfound] |

## Pathophysiology of Coxsackie virus myocarditis

Coxsackie virus **directly injures myocardium** via viral replication and triggers immune-mediated inflammation, leading to myocyte necrosis, interstitial edema, and fibrosis. These changes impair contractility and compliance, causing heart failure with cardiomegaly and an S3 gallop [^1165qmzf].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: Assess ventricular function, wall motion abnormalities, and pericardial effusion [^1165qmzf].
- **Cardiac MRI**: Detect myocardial edema, fibrosis, and inflammation [^1165qmzf].
- **Laboratory tests**: Troponin, BNP, and viral PCR to confirm myocarditis and exclude other causes [^1165qmzf].

---

## Management considerations

Management is supportive, including **rest, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics** for heart failure; immunosuppression is reserved for refractory cases. Prognosis is generally favorable in children, though some may develop chronic cardiomyopathy [^notfound].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **Coxsackie virus myocarditis**, given the clinical course, exam findings, and exclusion of alternatives.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old female presented to the urgent care clinic with a complaint of sharp, intermittent, non-exertional chest pain localized to the left anterior chest. The pain had a sudden onset at rest and persisted for several hours before presentation. The patient denied any radiation of the pain, and there were no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or dizziness. The pain was not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics and was unaffected by changes in position or respiration. She reported no history of fever, cough, recent infections, or any other symptoms suggestive of systemic or respiratory conditions. There was no history of previous trauma or recent physical exertion, and she had not experienced similar episodes in the past. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no significant illnesses or chronic conditions. She was not on any medications, had no known drug allergies, and her family history was negative for cardiac or congenital anomalies, sudden cardiac death, or other heritable conditions. Socially, the patient was a non-smoker, denied alcohol or illicit drug use, and reported no recent stress or psychological distress.

On physical examination, the patient appeared alert and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and she was afebrile. The cardiovascular examination was normal, with a regular heart rhythm, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no evidence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or cyanosis, and peripheral pulses were symmetrical and palpable. The respiratory examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi, and normal chest expansion. The gastrointestinal examination was unremarkable, with a soft, non-tender abdomen, no organomegaly, and normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination revealed no chest wall tenderness, and the thoracic cage appeared normal.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

14.2 Heart Failure

In two placebo controlled, 12-week clinical studies compared the addition of lisinopril up to 20 mg daily to digitalis and diuretics alone. The combination of lisinopril, digitalis and diuretics reduced the following signs and symptoms of heart failure: edema, rales, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and jugular venous distention. In one of the studies, the combination of lisinopril, digitalis and diuretics reduced orthopnea, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV; and improved exercise tolerance. A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 mg and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with systolic heart failure, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose.

During baseline-controlled clinical trials, in patients with systolic heart failure receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and no change in heart rate.

Post-travel respiratory infections — clinical presentation and differential considerations — Most respiratory infections, especially those of the upper respiratory tract, are mild, whereas lower respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, can be more severe. Lower respiratory tract infections are more likely than upper respiratory tract infections to cause chest pain, dyspnea, or fever; cough is often present in either upper or lower respiratory tract infections; and rash may be present, especially in measles, rubella, and varicella. People with influenza commonly have acute onset of cough, fever, headache, and myalgias, and people with COVID-19 might have a similar clinical presentation but mild disease and asymptomatic infection also are common, with similar symptoms seen in bacterial infections including legionellosis. Consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of travelers who present with cough, dyspnea, tachycardia, or fever and pleurisy, especially those who have recently been on long car or plane trips.

Patient 3

A 14.3-year-old girl with complaints of intermittent fatigue, cough, chest distress, and chest pain. Two months prior, she had a COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test) which manifested as a mild upper respiratory infection. Approximately 2 weeks after recovering from COVID-19, she developed fatigue, chest distress, and a non-productive cough. A chest CT at that time showed minor evidence of infiltrates. The patient was treated for 7 days at local hospitals (unknown administered medication), and the symptoms of cough and chest distress resolved. Twenty days prior to this presentation, she experienced fatigue, cough, and chest distress once again, in addition to chest pain. She had a history of atopic dermatitis. On examination, reddish maculopapular rashes with ulcerations and scabs were detected on her face and limbs. The patient's routine blood and urine analysis were normal. Chest CT imaging revealed bilateral peripheral consolidations with "hole signs", as well as marked vascular wall thickening, luminal narrowing and multiple filling defects of bilateral pulmonary artery branches, suggesting multiple pulmonary embolisms and vasculitis (Fig. 1 C and D). Two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab PCR and antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. The D-dimer level was normal (0.27 mg/L). Autoantibody tests revealed positive lupus anticoagulant, while ANA, ds-DNA and ANCA were negative. The patient underwent a skin biopsy which showed evidence of vasculitic changes: thickening and denaturation of vascular walls with infiltration of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, as well as small vessel occlusions (Supplementary Fig. 1B). She did not have whole exome sequencing performed. The patient received oral prednisone (initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day) combined with anticoagulant therapy, which were effective in inducing remission. Currently, she is being treated for 9 months with prednisone (now 5 mg/day maintenance dose) and remains clinically and radiologically stable.

### A 20-year-old with anterior chest pain: rare diagnosis behind a common concern [^1174cnTg]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 20-year-old previously healthy man presented to our hospital with a 2-week history of dull aching pain localized to the anterior chest wall, specifically in the sternum region. The pain was non-radiating and was exacerbated by physical activity or deep inspiration. There was no associated swelling, redness, or deformity of the chest wall. There were no associated systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Additionally, there was no history of recent respiratory infections, coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, palpitations, edema, or orthopnea to suggest pulmonary or cardiac involvement. The patient was of Indian ethnicity and has been living in India since birth. However, he had no known exposure to individuals with active pulmonary TB. The patient reported no history of trauma, repetitive physical strain, or prior surgical interventions, such as sternotomy or chest wall procedures. His medical history was unremarkable, with no prior hospitalizations or chronic illnesses. There was no personal or family history of autoimmune disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis, and he specifically denied symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint swelling, or peripheral joint pain that might suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder. The absence of gastrointestinal or urogenital symptoms further reduced the likelihood of reactive arthritis or other systemic conditions. Relevant negatives also included no history of smoking, immunosuppressive therapy, or conditions such as diabetes or HIV that could increase susceptibility to infections.

### Trametinib (Mekinist) [^116Bo3az]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trametinib PO (also known as Mekinist):
- **Bleeding**: use extreme caution in patients with risk factors for Bleeding events (e.g., intracranial bleeding and GI bleeding). Monitor patients who receive trametinib for signs or symptoms of bleeding. Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, or permanent therapy discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop grade 3 or 4 bleeding.
- **Cardiomyopathy, LV dysfunction**: use extreme caution with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. Evaluate cardiac function prior to starting trametinib (e.g., echocardiogram). Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, and/or permanent discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop LV dysfunction.
- **DVT, PE**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of venous thromboembolic disease. Implement appropriate thromboprophylaxis measures and closely monitor patients for signs of DVT and PE during Trametinib treatment. Initiate prompt medical intervention, including anticoagulant therapy, for the management of DVT or PE. Seek immediate medical attention.
- **Gastrointestinal perforation, colitis**: use caution in patients with inflammation of the colon. Monitor patients for symptoms of colitis and promptly manage any gastrointestinal adverse effects during Trametinib treatment. Discontinue Trametinib and provide appropriate medical intervention, which may include corticosteroids or surgical intervention.
- **Hyperglycemia**: use caution in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. Monitor serum glucose levels at baseline and as clinically indicated during therapy. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic agents in these patients as necessary.
- **ILD, pneumonitis**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of pulmonary illness. Monitor patients regularly for signs and symptoms of ILD and pneumonitis during Trametinib treatment. Discontinue Trametinib and initiate appropriate medical intervention, which may include systemic corticosteroids, to manage ILD and pneumonitis.
- **Retinal detachment, central retinal vein occlusion**: use caution in patients with a history of vision problems. Ophthalmological exams should be performed periodically and promptly in patients who report vision problems. Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, or permanent therapy discontinuation may be necessary for patients who develop retinal detachments and retinal vein occlusion.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111upusP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV — clinical and radiographic presentation is similar to that in individuals without HIV, with patients caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus characteristically having acute onset (3 to 5 days) of fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea; tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/or pleural effusion on examination, whereas in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) lung examination often is normal and, if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In bacterial pneumonia the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated, the elevation may be relative to baseline in those with advanced HIV, and neutrophilia or a left shift may be present. Chest radiographs characteristically show unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; those with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Demystifying volume status: an ultrasound-guided physiologic framework [^114VNKJG]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence Review

Central Venous Pressure

POCUS Findings

Central venous pressure (CVP) can be inferred from (1) the internal jugular vein (IJV), and (2) the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Table 1).CVP is defined as the mean vena caval pressure or right atrial pressure, which, in the absence of tricuspid stenosis, is equal to the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Although widely discussed, several key aspects of the CVP often are understood poorly and bear clarifying.

Table 1
POCUS Applications in the Volume Status Assessment

First, although volume affects pressure, one must not conflate the two. An increase in CVP may be secondary to a primary pressure-related disorder, a volume-related disorder, or both. Elevated CVP may be an indication of a number of non-volume-related pathologic features, as listed in Table 2. Although CVP is not itself a measure of volume, it provides information about the right side of the heart's compliance and performance, which reflects its ability to accommodate volume.

Table 2
Causes of Elevated CVP That Do Not Reflect Total Body Volume Overload

Second, elevated CVP is a precursor to the development of clinically significant venous congestion. Venous return to the right side of the heart is governed by the pressure gradient between the right atrium and peripheral veins and by venous resistance. This pressure gradient is small, with peripheral venous pressure usually of 8 to 10 mm Hg and normal CVP ranging from 0 to 8 mm Hg. Therefore, as CVP increases, a requisite rise in peripheral venous pressures occurs to maintain right-sided heart filling.

Third, CVP is impacted by the peripheral venous system. The venous system is a low-pressure, high-capacitance system containing approximately 70% of intravascular circulating blood volume. Venous volume can be divided physiologically into stressed and unstressed volume. Under basal conditions, only about 30% of the intravascular blood volume is stressed volume; that is, it produces tension in the venous walls contributing to pressure in the vessels. The proportion of volume contained within the stressed and unstressed compartments varies depending on venous tone and is independent of total volume. The venous system can respond to physiologic demands by recruiting and de-recruiting volume from the unstressed compartment by means of sympathetic-mediated venous constriction, converting unstressed blood volume to stressed blood volume.

### Quetiapine (Seroquel) [^114YQwMB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of quetiapine fumarate PO (also known as Seroquel):
- **Anticholinergic syndrome**: use caution in patients with urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, or taking anticholinergic medications.
- **Antipsychotic withdrawal**: do not discontinue abruptly in any patient.
- **Aspiration pneumonia**: use caution in elderly patients, particularly with advanced Alzheimer's disease.
- **Cataract**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of cataracts.
- **Falls**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine may cause somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, motor and sensory instability, leading to falls and injuries.
- **Hematologic disorders**: use caution in patients with leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia.
- **Hyperprolactinemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of hyperprolactinemia.
- **Hypotension**: use caution in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, dehydration/hypovolemia, or taking antihypertensive agents.
- **Hypothyroidism**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism. Monitor TSH and fT4 levels.
- **Mania**: use caution in patients with bipolar disorder. Screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder before initiating quetiapine.
- **Metabolic changes**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain.
- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in patients at increased risk of QT prolongation, such as the elderly, patients with CVD, family history of QT prolongation, congestive HF, or cardiac hypertrophy. Avoid using quetiapine with other QT-prolonging agents, including class IA or III antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics (such as ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (such as gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or other medications known to prolong the QT interval (such as pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

### Hamman's sign and syndrome: a reminder of important clinical clues [^115gq6YC]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon condition in pediatrics with a peak incidence in adolescence. The most common symptom of spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is chest pain; however, most patients are asymptomatic. Hamman's sign is a rare but pathognomonic sign of pneumomediastinum. This clinical sign is characterized by a crunching, rasping sound, synchronous with the heartbeat, heard over the precordium. Hamman's syndrome is a SPM associated with subcutaneous emphysema.

Case Description

We report the case of a previously healthy 15-year-old adolescent male, an elite athlete, who was admitted to hospital with a 3-day history of chest pain. There was no history of previous respiratory infections, invasive procedures, or trauma. On physical examination, he had a palpable subcutaneous neck edema and a crackle on cardiac auscultation. Chest and neck radiographs confirmed ectopic air in the mediastinum and subcutaneous neck emphysema. Given the identification of Hamman's sign and the presence of emphysema, the diagnosis of Hamman's syndrome was made and symptomatic treatment was given with complete resolution.

Conclusion

This case highlights the value of physical examination and medical semiology in the diagnosis of Hamman's syndrome, especially in the presence of the pathognomonic Hamman's sign.

### Alzheimer's disease patients have smaller venous drainage system compared to cognitively healthy controls [^115rX1r8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42). Decreased venous drainage may enhance Aβ42 accumulation. We aimed to compare venous cross‐sectional area (CSA) of AD patients to cognitively healthy controls.

METHODS

All patients underwent neurocognitive evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging, including time‐of‐flight sequence. Venous CSA was measured at the jugular foramen level.

RESULTS

Thirty‐nine AD/mild cognitive impairment patients and 20 cognitively healthy controls were included. Total venous CSA was smaller in the cognitively impaired group (mean CSA 139.77 mm² [SD: 32.22] vs 166.55 mm² [SD: 33.1], p = 0.004]. When divided, both internal jugular and non‐jugular systems were smaller within cognitively impaired patients; statistical significance was achieved only for the non‐jugular system (mean CSA 41.21 mm² [SD: 21.52] vs 54.5 mm² [SD: 27.31], p = 0.045).

DISCUSSION

There is an association between smaller venous systems and cognitive impairment, most prominently in the non‐jugular system. Venous narrowing may cause impaired venous drainage, leading to an accumulation of Aβ42.

Highlights

The non‐jugular venous system, including the vertebral plexus and pterygopalatine plexus, plays an important role in cerebral drainage.
The total venous CSA is significantly smaller in cognitively impaired patients compared to healthy controls.
Reduced venous drainage may contribute to the accumulation of Aβ and other waste products and potentially plays a role in AD pathology.

### Fatigue: a common but poorly understood symptom in neurological and non-neurological diseases [^115Bd8JV]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Fatigue is a severely disabling symptom that can substantially impair quality of life and employment prospects, and has serious socioeconomic consequences. Different individual and disease-related variables interact to generate this complex symptom, leading to clinical heterogeneity. We currently lack a common understanding and definition of fatigue and its origins, thereby impeding professional exchange among disciplines regarding diagnosis and underlying pathophysiology. To aid the development of a common language that encapsulates the heterogeneity of fatigue, we propose a taxonomy consisting of neurogenic, myogenic and systemic clusters. Each cluster comprises the same five distinct concepts and their phenotypic expression. The interplay between multifactorial pathophysiological mechanisms might vary between diseases and over time, and additional factors such as comorbidities can modulate fatigue. Understanding this complexity is essential to improve both the diagnostic process and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. In this Review, we compare the clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of a range of neurological and non-neurological diseases within predefined clusters of fatigue origin. We propose an integrative model for fatigue of different origin and over time based on the interplay of genetics and epigenetics, immunological changes, structural and functional brain abnormalities, and behavioural alterations. Large research consortia will be required to tackle the methodological shortcomings that currently hamper our understanding of fatigue and to initiate large longitudinal cohort studies with multidimensional readouts to further explore and address this burdensome symptom.

Post‑exertional malaise/post‑exertional symptom exacerbation (PEM/PESE) in Long COVID is defined as the worsening of symptoms after exertion with symptoms typically worsening 12–48 h after activity and lasting for days or even weeks; when PEM/PESE is present, well‑intentioned recommendations to exercise and push through fatigue can backfire and trigger exercise‑induced muscle damage. Case‑control data describe skeletal muscle abnormalities during exercise testing in adults with long COVID‑related PEM/PESE, and it is of utmost importance to emphasize energy conservation strategies and a slow, titrated return to activity at a submaximal level of exertion, especially for patients with PEM/PESE; some patients with PEM/PESE also meet criteria for ME/CFS, which is based on positive signs and not a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Aripiprazole (Opipza) [^113rHdg7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in five short-term (4 week and 6 week), placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of aripiprazole and the active comparators.

In the four positive trials for aripiprazole, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. Efficacy was evaluated using the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient.

In a 4 week trial (n = 414) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 1 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 4 week trial (n = 404) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (20 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 2 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI- severity score.
In a 6 week trial (n = 420) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 3 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 6 week trial (n = 367) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of aripiprazole was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 4 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.

### Epoprostenol [^1173Uxfq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

During clinical trials, adverse events were classified as follows: (1) adverse events during dose initiation and escalation, (2) adverse events during chronic dosing, and (3) adverse events associated with the drug delivery system.

Adverse Events during Dose Initiation and Escalation

During early clinical trials, epoprostenol was increased in 2-ng/kg/min increments until the patients developed symptomatic intolerance. The most common adverse events and the adverse events that limited further increases in dose were generally related to vasodilation, the major pharmacologic effect of epoprostenol. The most common dose-limiting adverse events (occurring in > 1% of patients) were nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension, and flushing, but also include chest pain, anxiety, dizziness, bradycardia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and tachycardia. Table 8 lists the adverse events reported during dose initiation and escalation in decreasing order of frequency.

Table 8: Adverse Events during Dose Initiation and Escalation

Adverse Events during Chronic Administration:

Interpretation of adverse events is complicated by the clinical features of PAH, which are similar to some of the pharmacologic effects of epoprostenol (e.g., dizziness, syncope). Adverse events which may be related to the underlying disease include dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, edema, hypoxia, right ventricular failure, and pallor. Several adverse events, on the other hand, can clearly be attributed to epoprostenol. These include hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, bleeding at various sites, thrombocytopenia, headache, abdominal pain, pain (unspecified), sweating, rash, arthralgia, jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, flu-like symptoms, anxiety/nervousness, and agitation. In addition, chest pain, fatigue, and pallor have been reported during epoprostenol therapy, and a role for the drug in these events cannot be excluded.

### Zafirlukast (Accolate) [^111mWzvo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hepatotoxicity:

Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with ACCOLATE. Cases of liver injury without other attributable cause have been reported from post-marketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of ACCOLATE (40 mg/day). In most, but not all post-marketing reports, the patient's symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping ACCOLATE. In rare cases, patients have either presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death. In extremely rare post-marketing cases, no clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction were reported to precede the latter observations.

Physicians may consider the value of liver function testing. Periodic serum transaminase testing has not proven to prevent serious injury but it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery.

Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (e.g., right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia) and to contact their physician immediately if they occur. Ongoing clinical assessment of patients should govern physician interventions, including diagnostic evaluations and treatment.

If liver dysfunction is suspected based upon clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, anorexia, and enlarged liver), ACCOLATE should be discontinued.

Liver function tests, in particular serum ALT, should be measured immediately and the patient managed accordingly. If liver function tests are consistent with hepatic dysfunction, ACCOLATE therapy should not be resumed. Patients in whom ACCOLATE was withdrawn because of hepatic dysfunction where no other attributable cause is identified should not be re-exposed to ACCOLATE (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Bronchospasm:

ACCOLATE is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Therapy with ACCOLATE can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma.

Concomitant Warfarin Administration:

Coadministration of zafirlukast with warfarin results in a clinically significant increase in prothrombin time (PT). Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and ACCOLATE should have their prothrombin times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115x2gNR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, some will experience significant withdrawal symptoms. Similarly, some patients who have been taking BZDs at a low dose for an intermediate amount of time (e.g. 6 weeks) may not be physically dependent. Defining strict thresholds for the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal is difficult because many factors beyond the dose and duration of BZD use impact risk, including age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, the pharmacological properties of the given BZD, other medication and substance use, and prior history of withdrawal, among others.

Table 3 summarizes the risk of withdrawal by dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. While no direct evidence was found for predicting risk of withdrawal, the CGC agreed that these factors were most salient in the determination. Clinicians should consider this information in the context of each patient's presentation when determining if patients are likely to be physically dependent and tapering is indicated. It should be noted that alprazolam — which is unique in having a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites — tends to be associated with a more rapid onset of physical dependence. Therefore, a taper may be appropriate for patients taking this medication daily, even for a short duration (e.g. 2–4 weeks).

If physical dependence is difficult to determine, clinicians should elicit information from patients regarding any concerns about discontinuation or preferences for tapering. Clinicians should gather information about each patient's likelihood for physical dependence and risk of withdrawal, including asking if they have experienced withdrawal symptoms following missed doses in the past. Clinicians should also ask patients about any past experiences with withdrawal symptoms associated with tapering or discontinuing BZDs, especially adverse events such as seizures. Determining use of alcohol is also important, particularly if patients engage in ongoing daily alcohol use or have experienced severe withdrawal from alcohol or other substances in the past; slower and/or alternate tapering strategies may be indicated in these situations. If SUD may be present, clinicians should consider consulting addiction specialists, when possible.

If physical dependence is unlikely and the decision is made to discontinue the BZD without a taper, clinicians should educate patients about potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms that may occur and encourage patients to report these symptoms. If patients report significant symptoms, clinicians can consider initiating a taper.

### Six suggestions for improving quantitative evaluations [^112b8Njh]. Injury Prevention (2025). Medium credibility.

This special feature contains some personal suggestions for improving quantitative analyses. I focus on articles that use regressions to determine the connections among variables, a common way for evaluating the effects of public policy. Examples come from the firearms literature. It seems to me that, once they have obtained some data, too many researchers almost immediately start running regressions-before they fully understand the dataset or think deeply about the questions they are trying to answer. I provide six suggestions for researchers: Try to: (1) determine and report a causal theory, including the chain-of-causation; (2) investigate the accuracy of the data; (3) explore the data; (4) disaggregate where possible; (5) determine if the results are plausible and (6) be transparent about the methods and results-let the reader into your 'statistical kitchen'. The evidence about the effectiveness of Child Access Prevention Laws illustrates some of these issues.

### Syntalos: a software for precise synchronization of simultaneous multi-modal data acquisition and closed-loop interventions [^111qcaDL]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Program behavior during experiment

When a new module is added to an experiment configuration, it communicates a set of basic information to the Syntalos engine, such as the ports which it supports, or threading requirements. Once the experiment is started, the module runs through a series of states (Fig. 2B): First, the Syntalos engine sets up the threading model and basic data structures, then an execution order for all modules is planned, such that modules generating data are started before modules consuming these data. Modules will then be triggered to enter the first 'prepare' stage in which they initialize any hardware, communicate their time synchronization strategy and set runtime-specific metadata on data streams (such as the expected bit-depth of a camera recording or expected headers of a CSV table). When the module is ready, it will transition into the 'ready' state and communicate this information to the engine. The engine will subscribe all input ports to data streams according to the user's configuration. Once all modules have signaled that they are 'ready', the engine will emit a 'start' signal, and modules transition into a 'running' phase where they start to process or emit data. The Master clock is only available once the 'start' signal has been sent. This strategy ensures that modules start almost simultaneously, within their technical limitations. The engine continuously monitors the state of all running modules and data queues, and provides modules with Master clock timestamps (see below). Once the user stops the experiment, the engine emits a 'stop' signal and triggers modules to finish their data processing and data acquisition tasks. Remaining data left in queues will still be processed for a few seconds. If a module fails (e.g. if a device is disconnected) during an ongoing measurement, all data will be saved and the experiment run is stopped. However, modules can be exempted from this 'stop on failure' behavior in the GUI. Once all modules are 'stopped', the Syntalos engine will finalize the EDL (Experiment Directory Layout) metadata and clean up system resources which have been used for the data acquisition run (Fig. 2B). For details on EDL and comparison with other data formats see Supplemental Information "Data Storage & Formats" and). With these features, Syntalos provides a user-friendly framework for integration of multiple modules and secures precise synchronization of all active processes during an experiment.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^112N8wg3]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

DETeCD-ADRD recommendations — Recommendation 1 (evaluation trigger and scope): For patients who self-report or whose care partner or clinician report cognitive, behavioral, or functional change, the clinician should initiate a multi-tiered evaluation focused on the problem (Strength of Recommendation A). Any middle-aged or older patient who self-reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising as a result of a specific neuropathology, and a clinician should not assume "normality" or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to "normal aging" without an appropriate evaluation, which would constitute suboptimal care. The evaluation process for possible cognitive or behavioral impairment can be initiated and in most cases completed at any of a variety of clinical practice settings: primary care, specialty care, or dementia subspecialty care, and the practitioner's proficiency with this patient population and the profile of the individual patient should guide the evaluation process. The evaluation begins with a history from not only the patient but also — importantly — from someone who knows the patient well (an informant).

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.000000000000000e+00 1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In human dermal safety trials, TAZORAC Cream, 0.05% and 0.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy.

Psoriasis

The most frequent adverse reactions reported with TAZORAC Cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema.

TAZORAC Cream, 0.1% was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with TAZORAC Cream, 0.1% were 0.1–0.4% higher than those reported for TAZORAC Cream, 0.05%.

Acne

The most frequent adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with TAZORAC Cream 0.1% in the treatment of acne, occurring in 10–30% of subjects, in descending order included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. Reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of subjects included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain.

### Bumetanide [^116Km6a8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Bumetanide injection is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required, and dose and dosage schedule have to be adjusted to the individual patient's needs [see Dosage and Administration].

### Simple step counting captures comparable health information to complex accelerometer measurements [^113KPbaL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Intensity thresholds are optimally defined from the association pattern with markers of cardiometabolic health. At least one large‐scale study under free‐living conditions provides thresholds for daily steps and step cadence in relation to cardiometabolic risk. Regarding thresholds for daily steps (volume), they reported, depending on the marker at hand, 4325–6192 steps/day. Regarding step cadence, the prediction capacity of time spent in eight cadence bands was investigated using a decision tree analysis method. However, only three cadence bands were able to predict cardiometabolic risk, representing incidental (1–19 steps/min), medium (80–99 steps/min) and faster (≥ 120 steps/min) movement. This outcome is likely explained by multicollinearity, where the cadence bands cannot be considered independent from each other. A statistical method that allows many intensity categories or cadence bands to be analyzed simultaneously is partial least square regression.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how effectively step‐based metrics capture health‐related information from accelerometer data and to identify optimal intensity thresholds for both step data and accelerometer data by examining their associations with cardiorespiratory fitness and a composite score of cardiometabolic health under free‐living conditions in middle‐aged adults. We hypothesized that step data would retain most of the information from accelerometer data and its association with cardiometabolic health and that the strength of these associations would increase considerably above the traditional three MET threshold for moderate intensity.

### Desvenlafaxine succinate (desvenlafaxine) [^112PpbK4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.

Prescriptions for desvenlafaxine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled studies) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that desvenlafaxine is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

In Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

The safety of DARZALEX FASPRO with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was evaluated in a single-arm cohort of PLEIADES [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Patients received DARZALEX FASPRO 1,800 mg/30,000 units administered subcutaneously once weekly from weeks 1 to 8, once every 2 weeks from weeks 9 to 24 and once every 4 weeks starting with week 25 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (N = 65) in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Among these patients, 92% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 20% were exposed for greater than one year.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 48% of patients who received DARZALEX FASPRO. Serious adverse reactions in > 5% of patients included pneumonia, influenza and diarrhea. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.1% of patients.

Permanent discontinuation of DARZALEX FASPRO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients who received DARZALEX FASPRO. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of DARZALEX FASPRO in more than 1 patient were pneumonia and anemia.

Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 63% of patients who received DARZALEX FASPRO. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruptions in > 5% of patients included neutropenia, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, dyspnea, and blood creatinine increased.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were fatigue, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, constipation, pyrexia, pneumonia, and dyspnea.

Table 11 summarizes the adverse reactions in patients who received DARZALEX FASPRO in PLEIADES.

Clinically relevant adverse reactions in < 10% of patients who received DARZALEX FASPRO with lenalidomide and dexamethasone included:

Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain

### A clinical complexity of olanzapine use: peripheral edema [^115LorWs]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Message

Olanzapine is a potent atypical antipsychotic, which may lead to peripheral edema. Such edema can affect patients regardless of age, dose, or psychiatric conditions. Due to its rare presentation, this can be difficult to recognize and manage, especially in settings where assessing the patient head‐to‐toe is less easily done.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^113HHsdw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of OXAYDO in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: OXAYDO-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXAYDO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating OXAYDO and when OXAYDO is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

Case Presentation

A 29-year-old man with a medical history of chronic rhinosinusitis presented with a 6-month history of chronic nonproductive cough and mild exertional dyspnea. Five years ago, at the time of his chronic rhinosinusitis diagnosis, he underwent a chest radiograph that revealed an ill-defined opacity in the middle zone of the left lung, suspicious for neoplasm, and was subsequently lost to follow-up, until he presented now with cough and dyspnea. There was no history of hemoptysis, epigastric discomfort/burning sensation, dysphagia, or post-tussive vomiting associated with cough. Exertional dyspnea was graded as modified Medical Research Council grade 1, and it was not associated with any diurnal or postural variations (orthopnea/trepopnea), chest pain, palpitations, or pedal edema. There was no history of fever, malaise, weight loss, or audible wheeze. The patient had no significant medical history of asthma, COPD, nasal obstruction, urticaria, or other chronic respiratory conditions. He did not smoke and reported no significant occupational or environmental exposures to allergens. There was no history of TB contact or recurrent respiratory infections. Additionally, there was no family history of similar respiratory findings or conditions. During the intervening years, the patient remained asymptomatic until his presentation with the new concerns.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of disopyramide PO (also known as Norpace):
- **Glaucoma**: use caution in patients with risk factors or a family history of glaucoma. Monitor patients' intraocular pressure and avoid prescribing disopyramide to individuals with a history of glaucoma. Consider discontinuing disopyramide and managing the glaucoma appropriately.
- **Hypoglycemia**: use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Regularly monitor blood glucose levels. Administer glucose or sugar-containing products, and seek immediate medical attention.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in patients with a history of HF or stress-related cardiomyopathy. Regularly monitor ECG and electrolyte levels, avoiding Disopyramide use in patients with known QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Discontinue Disopyramide, correct electrolyte imbalances, and manage arrhythmias as necessary under medical supervision.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. Regularly monitor ECG and electrolyte levels, avoiding Disopyramide use in patients with known QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Discontinue Disopyramide, correct electrolyte imbalances, and manage arrhythmias as necessary under medical supervision.
- **Urinary retention**: use caution in patients with a history of bladder obstruction. Prior to Disopyramide use, assess patients for any history of urinary retention to mitigate this risk. Discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical attention.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1165Skcq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — clinical diagnosis requires the presence of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (HF) and an echocardiographic determination of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) generally accepted to be ≥ 50% in the absence of other cardiac or noncardiac causes for the patient's symptoms. The recognition of the clinical HF syndrome is the first step in diagnosing HFpEF; although the Framingham criteria demonstrate excellent specificity for the diagnosis of HF, they lack sensitivity, particularly in elderly patients who may have not had acute HF decompensation, and therefore a patient may have HFpEF even in the absence of satisfying specific clinical criteria for HF. Early presenting symptoms of HFpEF may be relatively nonspecific, including exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or fatigue, and clinical suspicion should be further raised if these symptoms occur with one or more commonly associated risk factors, including history of hypertension, elderly age (> 60 years), obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m²), history of diabetes mellitus, or history of atrial fibrillation.

### Ciprofolxacin (ciprofloxacin) [^117X1MF1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions

Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including ciprofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:

Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome);
Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness;
Allergic pneumonitis;
Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure;
Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure;
Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities.

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy, including ciprofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, including intubation, as indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.8 Hepatotoxicity

Cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic failure, and fatal events, have been reported with ciprofloxacin. Acute liver injury is rapid in onset (range 1–39 days), and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than 55 years old. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis (such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen), discontinue treatment immediately.

There can be a temporary increase in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice, especially in patients with previous liver damage, who are treated with ciprofloxacin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)].

### Adaptation and validation of a social information processing assessment procedure for research [^113EqfyF]. Child Neuropsychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Biases and deficits in social information processing (SIP) skills are associated with social maladjustment in children and adolescents. There is much literature on the association between processing skills and their relationship to aggressive behavior, but there is limited knowledge about their association with other types of antisocial behavior. In this study we conducted a Spanish adaptation and validation of the Sociale Informatie Verwerkings Test, a Dutch research assessment and diagnostic instrument. For this purpose, construct, content and criterion validity were analyzed through their association with antisocial behaviors. Exploratory factor analysis supported the structure of the measure in a sample of 364 adolescents aged 12-18years (55.2% female) from a high school in Spain. Constructs underlying the items of the new assessment were associated with SIP steps and profiles from SIP theory. SIP steps in the data of the new adaptation were related to each other being consistent with the theoretical conceptualization. The results showed associations between self-reported antisocial behaviors in adolescents with a greater tendency to aggressive SIP processing style. Treatment and training of such behaviors starts with valid assessment of the specific skills and steps that are biased or deficient, to which the current study contributes.

### Trastuzumab (Herzuma) [^113aEgMV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity

Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.

5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia

In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Prevalence, mechanisms, and prognostic impact of effort intolerance in patients with asymptomatic / minimally symptomatic aortic stenosis [^114uDDbU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, effort intolerance preceded overt symptoms in most patients with minimally symptomatic moderate to asymptomatic severe AS, with significantly higher heart failure‐related rehospitalization and death in the effort‐intolerance group. Effort tolerance is influenced by the degree of extra‐aortic cardiac injuries as indicated by resting myocardial strain. Myocardial strain at rest, along with LA, pulmonary circulation, and RV reserves assessed by ESE, is related to effort intolerance in patients with asymptomatic AS.

Subjective symptoms, such as chest pain, syncope, and shortness of breath, are preceded by effort intolerance, which is defined by the degree of extra‐aortic cardiac dysfunction. Risk stratification is necessary to identify extra‐aortic heart defects in addition to the symptoms reported during medical examination.

### Treprostinil (Remodulin) [^1152hLuU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Effects

The effect of Remodulin on 6-minute walk, the primary endpoint of the 12-week studies, was small and did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance. For the combined populations, the median change from baseline on Remodulin was 10 meters and the median change from baseline on placebo was 0 meters from a baseline of approximately 345 meters. Although it was not the primary endpoint of the study, the Borg dyspnea score was significantly improved by Remodulin during the 6-minute walk, and Remodulin also had a significant effect, compared with placebo, on an assessment that combined walking distance with the Borg dyspnea score. Remodulin also consistently improved indices of dyspnea, fatigue, and signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, but these indices were difficult to interpret in the context of incomplete blinding to treatment assignment resulting from infusion site symptoms.

14.2 Flolan-To-Remodulin Transition Study

In an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients on stable doses of Flolan were randomly withdrawn from Flolan to placebo or Remodulin. Fourteen Remodulin and 8 placebo patients completed the study. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to clinical deterioration, defined as either an increase in Flolan dose, hospitalization due to PAH, or death. No patients died during the study.

During the study period, Remodulin effectively prevented clinical deterioration in patients transitioning from Flolan therapy compared to placebo (Figure 1). Thirteen of 14 patients in the Remodulin arm were able to transition from Flolan successfully, compared to only 1 of 8 patients in the placebo arm (p = 0.0002).

Hepatic Effects

There has been no evidence of induced hepatotoxicity with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury.

### Collaborative coding in inductive content analysis: why, when, and how to do it [^116fmwvn]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Inductive content analysis (ICA) is a useful method for analyzing qualitative data in genetic counseling research. It is particularly relevant when the goal is to examine and improve practices or develop recommendations. Although ICA can be undertaken by a single analyst, ideally there is involvement of multiple analysts (or co-coders). Co-coding can bring many benefits to qualitative analysis that sits within a constructivist paradigm, including developing a representation of the data that is not only understandable to more than one individual but also richer and more nuanced. It also provides an opportunity for mentoring more junior researchers and can be an efficient way to analyze large datasets. However, co-coding requires important planning and consideration, and there is currently a paucity of clear guidance. In this paper, we provide an outline of the small body of existing literature on this topic and propose six flexible step-by-step components of our approach to co-coding in ICA, based on our own work. We have utilized it to analyze reporting practices and perspectives for diagnostic genomic sequencing, informed consent for genetic testing, data sharing and storage, and genomic newborn screening, among other topics. To illustrate these components, we present some example vignettes to show how these procedures can be applied in different scenarios and with different analysts.

### Internal jugular vein distensibility with passive leg raise: a diagnostic approach to dehydration [^1146SfUK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Evaluating volume status is crucial in emergency medicine, especially for detecting dehydration. The internal jugular vein distensibility index (IJVDI) has been proposed as a noninvasive ultrasound-based marker for hypovolemia, but its diagnostic accuracy remains uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of IJVDI combined with passive leg raise (PLR) in detecting dehydration.

Methods

This single-center prospective diagnostic accuracy study investigated the ability of IJVDI combined with PLR to detect dehydration using a Ramadan fasting-induced dehydration model. Dehydration was simulated by a 12-hour fasting period without food or water. IJVDI and cardiac output (CO) were measured at baseline and after PLR. The diagnostic value of ΔIJVDI, ΔCO, and ΔVTI (velocity-time integral) for dehydration was assessed.

Results

This study included 90 participants (30 with fasting-induced dehydration and 60 controls). IJVDI was higher in the hypovolemic group than in controls (18.9 ± 12.3 vs. 11.8 ± 4.82, p < 0.001). The diagnostic cut-off for IJVDI was ≥ 11.8% (Sens: 73.3%, Spec: 58.3%, PPV: 46.8%, NPV: 81.4%, area under the curve [AUC]: 0.690, p = 0.003), while for ΔIJVDI it was -2.1% (Sens: 70%, Spec: 60%, PPV: 46.6%, NPV: 80%, AUC: 0.654, p = 0.017). The highest diagnostic accuracy was observed for ΔCO and ΔVTI, with ΔCO ≥ 500 mL (Sens: 100%, Spec: 96.7%, AUC: 0.999, p < 0.001) and ΔVTI ≥ 2.2 cm (Sens: 93.3%, Spec: 80%, AUC: 0.928, p < 0.001). Optimal cut-off values were determined using Youden's index.

Conclusion

While IJVDI measurements differed between dehydrated and control groups, their diagnostic accuracy was limited. In contrast, ΔCO and ΔVTI demonstrated superior predictive value for dehydration. Bedside ultrasonographic evaluation of CO and VTI, combined with PLR, maybe a more reliable approach in emergency settings.

### Simple step counting captures comparable health information to complex accelerometer measurements [^11293zAi]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Physical activity guidelines recommend accumulating moderate-to-vigorous physical activity but interpreting and monitoring these recommendations remains challenging. Although step-based metrics from wearable devices offer a simpler approach, their relationship with health outcomes requires validation against established accelerometer measurements.

Objectives

To evaluate how effectively step-based metrics capture health-related information from accelerometer data and determine optimal step cadence and intensity thresholds associated with cardiometabolic health in middle-aged adults.

Methods

Cross-sectional data from 4172 participants (aged 50–64 years) in the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) were analyzed. Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph accelerometers, collecting both step metrics (daily steps and cadence) and full accelerometer data. Both cardiorespiratory fitness, estimated using a submaximal cycle ergometer test, and cardiometabolic health, assessed using a composite score of waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), were considered outcomes. Associations between physical activity and outcomes were examined using linear regression and partial least squares analysis.

Results

Step counting metrics retained 88% of the health-related information from full accelerometer data. The optimal accelerometer intensity associated with cardiometabolic health was around four metabolic equivalents of tasks (METs). A step cadence of 80 steps/min, rather than the commonly used 100 steps/min, appeared more relevant for capturing moderate-intensity activity. Combining step and accelerometer data provided additional explanatory power for cardiometabolic health.

Conclusion

Step data capture most of the health-related information from accelerometer-measured physical activity in middle-aged adults. These findings support the use of step-based metrics for assessing and promoting physical activity while suggesting a need for recalibration of intensity thresholds in free-living conditions.

Data synthesis

We analyzed the data according to the methodological framework for scoping reviews by Arksey and O'Malley. As a first step, we descriptively analyzed baseline characteristics, including size, nature, and the included studies' empirical and analytical methods. Secondly, we described the "information needs" concepts used in the studies. In the final step, we extracted and visualized the information needs in a mind map. Overlaps between the studies were discovered and key domains were identified. Then, we assessed the importance of each domain of information needs based on their frequencies, examined whether and how the needs changed during the course of the disease, and which information-seeking approaches were preferred. The results were synthesized by one reviewer (JH) and discussed with another reviewer (AR).

### Successful treatment of pulsatile tinnitus caused by jugular bulb diverticula using stent-assisted volumetric coil embolization in a double-jailing technique [^114Sc1qe]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulsatile tinnitus can be defined as the perception of a rhythmic or periodic sound in the absence of any external stimulus. Patients typically perceive pulsatile tinnitus as a heartbeat-like sound in one or both ears. Hearing is usually intact, and the condition is often linked to abnormal blood or cerebrospinal fluid flow near the ear. Vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus are divided into arterial and venous types. Arterial causes include aberrant or dissected carotid arteries, glomus tumors, fibromuscular dysplasia, and contralateral carotid stenosis leading to increased flow on the affected side. Venous causes of pulsatile tinnitus include dural arteriovenous fistulas, venous stenosis, diverticula, a high-riding jugular bulb, and intracranial hypertension. Venous tinnitus can often be distinguished from arterial causes through history and clinical exam, without invasive tests. It tends to be lower in pitch and may improve with neck maneuvers — worsening with contralateral jugular compression and improving with ipsilateral or suboccipital vein compression. Further evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus may require imaging, including high-resolution cranial computed tomography (CT), computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), carotid Doppler ultrasound, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Sigmoid sinus diverticulum (SSD) is a rare venous cause of pulsatile tinnitus. Its exact cause is unclear, but it may result from sinus wall dehiscence and protrusion into the pneumatised temporal bone. Other rare venous causes of pulsatile tinnitus include jugular bulb anomalies, such as a high-riding bulb, lateral displacement, pathological enlargement, or the presence of a jugular bulb diverticulum. This case illustrates a rare but treatable cause of pulsatile tinnitus — jugular bulb diverticula — and presents a stent-assisted coil embolization using volumetric coils and a venous double-jailing technique. It aims to raise awareness and highlight a minimally invasive therapeutic option.

### Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (Mavyret) [^115weTAg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions were fatigue (3%), asthenia (2%), headache (2%) and diarrhea (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) Clinical Studies (14.11)].

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects 3 Y ears and Older with Chronic HCV Infection

The safety of MAVYRET in HCV GT 1, 2, 3, or 4 infected adolescents is based on data from a Phase 2/3 open-label trial in 47 subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years without cirrhosis treated with MAVYRET for 8 or 16 weeks (DORA-Part 1). The adverse reactions observed in subjects 12 years to less than 18 years of age were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of MAVYRET in adults. The only adverse reaction observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving MAVYRET in DORA Part 1 was fatigue (6%). No subjects discontinued or interrupted treatment with MAVYRET due to an adverse reaction.

The safety of MAVYRET in HCV GT 1, 2, 3, or 4 infected pediatric subjects aged 3 years to less than 12 years is based on data from a Phase 2/3 open-label trial in 80 subjects aged 3 to less than 12 years without cirrhosis treated with weight-based MAVYRET oral pellets in packets for 8, 12 or 16 weeks (DORA-Part 2). The adverse reactions observed in subjects 3 years to less than 12 years of age were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of MAVYRET in adults with the exception of vomiting (occurring at 8%), rash, and abdominal pain upper (each occurring at 4%) which were observed more frequently in pediatric subjects less than 12 years of age compared to adults. Other adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving MAVYRET in DORA-Part 2 include fatigue and headache, each occurring at 8%. One subject discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction of erythematous rash (Grade 3). All other adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and no subjects interrupted treatment due to an adverse reaction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Studies (14.10)].

### Factors associated with treatment intensification in patients with axial spondyloarthritis and high disease activity in clinical practice [^111XzfYC]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other population characteristics

The following patient and disease characteristics were included for descriptive purposes only: smoking status (current vs former/never), employment status (employed vs not employed), symptom duration, HLA-B27 status, history of extra-musculoskeletal manifestations (EMMs; uveitis, psoriasis, IBD), CRP and the Bath AS Disease Activity and Functional Indices (BASDAI/BASFI; 0–10).

Statistical analysis

Patient and disease characteristics were described for the overall study population, and for patients with TI and without TI (non-TI) separately. Characteristics were compared between TI and non-TI subgroups using independent t -tests or Mann–Whitney tests for continuous variables, and χ² tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, as appropriate. The number and characteristics of TI events were described.

Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess whether the potential determinants were associated with TI. Patient-centred models and physician-centred models were generated. In the patient-centred models, determinants considered were ASDAS and ASAS HI (primary), and age, sex and education (secondary). The physician-centred models were an extension of the patient-centred models, adding physician-assessed factors. PhGA (primary), peripheral symptoms and BSA (secondary) were considered for these in addition to the patient-centred model determinants.

The modelling strategy consisted of several steps. Variable selection was conducted as the projected sample size and number of events would likely not allow for inclusion of all primary/secondary determinants. First, univariable analyses were conducted with the primary and secondary determinants, and only factors that were potentially associated with the outcome (P < 0.20) were selected for multivariable analysis. Next, in multivariable analysis, these selected factors were entered into the model one by one in a predefined order [primary before secondary determinants, and patient-centred factors first within primary/secondary determinant groups: ASDAS, ASAS HI, PhGA (primary determinants), education, peripheral symptoms, skin involvement (secondary determinants)], and retained if associated with the outcome (P < 0.05). Age and sex were always included in multivariable analysis.
