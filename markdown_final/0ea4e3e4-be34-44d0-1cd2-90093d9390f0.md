## Question

Low potassium low magnesium and low vitamin D

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical significance, mechanisms, and management of concurrent low potassium, low magnesium, and low vitamin D. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and clinical relevance of each deficiency. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological interrelationships among potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D. Next, I will review clinical consequences and risk stratification. After that, I need to check diagnostic thresholds and testing strategies. Finally, I will outline a prioritized management plan, including supplementation, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical relevance and prevalence of each deficiency. Hypokalemia is common in hospitalized patients and in those with gastrointestinal or renal losses, and it often coexists with hypomagnesemia, which itself is prevalent in ICU and chronic disease populations and is frequently underrecognized because serum magnesium reflects less than 1% of total body stores, so normal serum Mg can mask deficiency [^114EfVdo] [^117PqpLC]. Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is widespread globally, with NHANES-era data showing 12% under 12 ng/mL and 30% 12–20 ng/mL, and contemporary cohorts of older adults show over 90% with inadequate vitamin D intake, underscoring the need for supplementation in many settings [^117CjXWk] [^115Q2FdG].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic links between magnesium and potassium. Magnesium is a required cofactor for Na-K-ATPase; when magnesium is low, Na-K-ATPase dysfunction increases renal potassium wasting via ROMK channels, producing refractory hypokalemia that will not correct unless magnesium is repleted first, which is a classic clinical pearl I should emphasize [^114EfVdo] [^115op6oZ]. Hold on, I should also confirm the magnesium–vitamin D axis: magnesium is a cofactor for 25-hydroxylase and 1-α-hydroxylase, and low magnesium impairs vitamin D activation and binding protein function; conversely, vitamin D enhances intestinal absorption of magnesium, creating a bidirectional relationship that can perpetuate deficiency if either is uncorrected [^116T4Hqe] [^113obtx1]. I need to ensure I note that low vitamin D can drive secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases renal magnesium and potassium losses, further worsening the triad in a vicious cycle [^notfound].

> Next, I should review clinical consequences and risk stratification. Concurrent deficiencies increase risks of arrhythmias, neuromuscular irritability, and refractory electrolyte disturbances; in critical illness, low magnesium may both reflect and contribute to metabolic failure, and magnesium repletion can be a foundational part of metabolic support rather than an afterthought [^111qkvnm]. Let me consider special populations: older adults in nursing homes have very high rates of suboptimal vitamin D, magnesium, and potassium status despite supplements, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency have malabsorption-driven deficits that require proactive screening and replacement strategies [^115Q2FdG] [^117PqpLC] [^116Spwxa]. I should double-check that pregnancy and chronic diuretic or PPI use also elevate risk and warrant closer monitoring and supplementation planning [^113obtx1] [^1152wokK].

> I will now examine diagnostic thresholds and testing strategy. For vitamin D, I should confirm that most guidelines define deficiency as 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 20–29 ng/mL, and sufficiency as 30 ng/mL or higher, with toxicity risk rising above 150 ng/mL; routine screening is not recommended in healthy adults without risk factors, but targeted testing is appropriate in high-risk groups or when hypocalcemia is present [^115v6pA5] [^113VHJ8R] [^113MKBT4]. For magnesium, serum magnesium less than 0.7 mmol/L is hypomagnesemia, but because serum levels can be normal despite intracellular depletion, I should consider clinical context and, when available, use a magnesium load test or ionized magnesium to refine assessment, especially in refractory cases or when symptoms persist despite correction of serum levels [^114EfVdo] [^11281BqL]. For potassium, less than 3.5 mmol/L is hypokalemia, but I need to remember that total-body potassium can be low even with normal serum potassium in the setting of acid-base disturbances or refeeding, so clinical context guides urgency and repletion strategy [^112fayVP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment sequencing. I should confirm that magnesium must be corrected before potassium, because hypomagnesemia perpetuates renal potassium wasting; otherwise, potassium repletion will be transient and ineffective, a principle repeatedly validated in clinical practice and reviews [^114EfVdo] [^115op6oZ]. For magnesium, oral magnesium oxide 300–600 mg daily is reasonable in stable patients, while IV magnesium sulfate 2–4 g over 10–20 minutes is appropriate for severe deficiency, symptomatic patients, or when oral intake is unreliable; I need to ensure renal function is adequate and monitor for hypermagnesemia, especially in CKD [^notfound]. For potassium, oral potassium chloride 20–40 mEq daily is typical, with IV potassium reserved for severe or symptomatic cases and always infused with caution; again, magnesium repletion should precede or accompany potassium therapy to sustain correction [^notfound]. For vitamin D, cholecalciferol 1,500–2,000 IU daily is a practical starting dose to achieve serum 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL in most adults, with higher loading doses in deficiency; I should recheck 25(OH)D after 3–4 months and adjust maintenance dosing, while monitoring calcium and renal function to avoid toxicity [^114Hfpqn] [^113dFp3a].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios. In refeeding syndrome, baseline potassium, magnesium, and phosphate should be checked and repleted proactively, with close monitoring every 12 hours for the first 3 days because insulin-driven intracellular shifts can precipitate sudden, life-threatening drops even when initial levels are normal; feeding should not be advanced until electrolytes are stabilized to mitigate cardiopulmonary complications [^112fayVP] [^114MogXr]. In chronic kidney disease, potassium restriction may be necessary, so magnesium repletion may require dialysate magnesium adjustments rather than high oral loads; I should confirm dialysate magnesium targets and individualize to avoid hypermagnesemia while correcting deficiency [^113trMFi]. In pregnancy, vitamin D supports maternal-fetal calcium and magnesium homeostasis, and deficiencies should be corrected with attention to obstetric risk and medication interactions; I should double-check that 25(OH)D recovery may lag and that repeat testing is not always required if clinical response is adequate [^113obtx1].

> Let me reconsider the broader clinical implications and synthesize. Concurrent low potassium, low magnesium, and low vitamin D reflect a systems-level disturbance in mineral homeostasis with overlapping mechanisms and amplified risks; correcting magnesium first improves the likelihood of durable potassium repletion and restores vitamin D activation, which in turn enhances magnesium absorption and supports bone and neuromuscular function, creating a virtuous cycle rather than a vicious one [^114EfVdo] [^116T4Hqe]. I should confirm that population data link adequate magnesium and vitamin D status with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and that dietary patterns rich in potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D are associated with better bone outcomes and lower chronic disease risk, reinforcing the clinical priority of addressing this triad when identified [^117CjXWk] [^116b7jSy].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and follow-up are explicit. Vitamin D toxicity is rare but serious; I should avoid unlicensed high-dose products, monitor calcium and renal function during repletion, and recognize that toxicity typically occurs when 25(OH)D exceeds 150 ng/mL, which is well above usual therapeutic targets [^113MKBT4] [^114jjzc7]. Magnesium and potassium repletion should be titrated to symptoms, serum levels, and renal function, with ECG monitoring when arrhythmias are a concern; I should double-check for drug–nutrient interactions, including PPIs, diuretics, and agents that prolong QT, and adjust the plan accordingly to minimize recurrent losses and adverse effects [^114EfVdo] [^113obtx1].

Low potassium, low magnesium, and low vitamin D often coexist and share **common causes** such as poor diet, diuretics, GI losses, and chronic disease [^114EfVdo] [^116V4GBD]. Magnesium deficiency impairs vitamin D activation and causes renal potassium wasting, so **magnesium must be corrected first** to enable vitamin D repletion and to correct hypokalemia [^116T4Hqe] [^114EfVdo]. Clinically, this triad increases risks of arrhythmias, neuromuscular symptoms, and bone loss; management includes dietary improvement, targeted supplementation, and monitoring of electrolytes and 25(OH)D, with special attention to high-risk groups such as older adults, patients with CKD, and those on diuretics or PPIs [^114EfVdo] [^115Q2FdG] [^1152wokK].

## Pathophysiological interrelationships

### Magnesium and potassium

Magnesium is essential for Na+/K+-ATPase function; **hypomagnesemia impairs this pump**, increasing renal potassium wasting and causing refractory hypokalemia that persists until magnesium is repleted [^114EfVdo]. Low magnesium also increases arrhythmia risk by destabilizing cardiac electrophysiology [^114EfVdo].

---

### Magnesium and vitamin D

Magnesium is a **required cofactor** for vitamin D metabolism, including 25-hydroxylation and 1-α-hydroxylation; deficiency impairs activation of vitamin D and can cause magnesium-dependent vitamin D resistance [^116T4Hqe] [^114CFuBp]. Low vitamin D reduces intestinal magnesium absorption, worsening deficiency [^notfound].

---

### Vitamin D and potassium

Vitamin D promotes intestinal calcium and magnesium absorption; **deficiency can indirectly worsen potassium balance** by impairing magnesium status and increasing renal potassium losses [^113obtx1] [^114EfVdo].

---

## Clinical consequences

Combined deficiency of potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D can cause:

- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmias, prolonged QT, torsades de pointes, hypertension, and increased CVD risk [^114EfVdo] [^1158nXBt].
- **Neuromuscular**: Muscle cramps, weakness, tetany, seizures, and neuromuscular irritability [^114EfVdo] [^115op6oZ].
- **Skeletal**: Osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk [^116b7jSy] [^114JzkK3].
- **Metabolic**: Insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and increased inflammation [^112EP3Qo] [^112oU28B].

---

## Common causes and risk factors

| **Category** | **Causes and risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Dietary | - Poor intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains <br/> - Excess sodium <br/> - Processed foods <br/> - Alcoholism [^116igsEZ] [^113yWYu4] [^114EfVdo] |
| Medications | - Diuretics <br/> - Proton pump inhibitors <br/> - Metformin <br/> - Antibiotics (e.g. aminoglycosides) [^114EfVdo] [^1152wokK] |
| Medical conditions | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. IBD, diarrhea) <br/> - Hyperaldosteronism <br/> - Refeeding syndrome [^114EfVdo] [^117PqpLC] [^111Dqbv2] |
| Lifestyle | - Sedentary lifestyle <br/> - Limited sun exposure <br/> - Smoking [^112EP3Qo] [^116V4GBD] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Potassium**: Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L; assess acid-base status and renal function [^notfound].
- **Magnesium**: Serum magnesium < 0.7 mmol/L; consider ionized magnesium or retention test if suspicion remains high [^114EfVdo].
- **Vitamin D**: Serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) indicates deficiency; < 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) indicates severe deficiency [^115v6pA5] [^114JzkK3].
- **Additional tests**: Calcium, phosphate, PTH, renal function, and ECG as indicated [^111eYXmM] [^115op6oZ].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

Management should prioritize **magnesium repletion first** to enable vitamin D activation and to correct refractory hypokalemia [^116T4Hqe] [^114EfVdo]. Address underlying causes — such as medications, dietary patterns, and comorbidities — to prevent recurrence [^114EfVdo] [^116igsEZ]. Monitor electrolytes and 25(OH)D during repletion and adjust therapy accordingly [^112fayVP] [^113dFp3a].

---

### Specific interventions

- **Magnesium**: Oral magnesium oxide 300–600 mg/day; IV magnesium sulfate 2–4 g for severe deficiency or intolerance [^notfound].
- **Potassium**: Oral potassium chloride 20–40 mEq/day; IV potassium for severe deficiency or arrhythmias, with close monitoring [^notfound].
- **Vitamin D**: Cholecalciferol 1,500–2,000 IU/day; higher doses (e.g. 50,000 IU weekly × 8 weeks) for severe deficiency, then maintenance [^114Hfpqn] [^113dFp3a].
- **Dietary modifications**: Increase intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish; reduce sodium and processed foods [^116igsEZ] [^116EhWhh].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly**: High prevalence of combined deficiencies; consider routine screening and supplementation [^115Q2FdG] [^11281BqL].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Magnesium and potassium repletion require caution due to impaired excretion; monitor closely [^113trMFi].
- **Refeeding syndrome**: Prophylactic magnesium, potassium, and phosphate repletion before feeding initiation [^116HRU8J] [^112fayVP].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **public health measures** — dietary guidance, food fortification, and sun exposure recommendations — and on **individualized strategies** such as risk assessment, targeted supplementation, and regular monitoring in high-risk patients [^116igsEZ] [^113VHJ8R].

---

Low potassium, low magnesium, and low vitamin D are **interconnected deficiencies** with significant clinical consequences. Magnesium repletion is the cornerstone of management, enabling vitamin D activation and correcting refractory hypokalemia; comprehensive care includes dietary change, targeted supplementation, and monitoring, with special attention to high-risk populations.

Vitamin D status and its predictors

The present data are consistent with the assumption that deficient vitamin D levels are an important health issue that may affect not only musculoskeletal health but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. The high prevalence of deficient 25OHD blood levels in the population is believed to be primarily due to inadequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin, together with inadequate dietary intake. However, circulating 25OHD levels also depend on body weight and genetic factors, and a significant portion of the variance in circulating 25OHD remains unexplained at present. Therefore, Deng et al. are to be commended for investigating potential interactions between Mg and vitamin D status. Especially with regard to vitamin D, there is still ongoing debate regarding the optimal oral intake and the adequate circulating 25OHD level. The IOM recommends a daily vitamin D intake of 600 international units and considers circulating 25OHD levels of 20 to 50 ng/ml as adequate, and 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml as potentially harmful. However, according to the Endocrine Society, the circulating 25OHD level should be within the range of 30 to 100 ng/ml. To raise the 25OHD level consistently above 30 ng/ml, they recommend a daily vitamin D intake of 1,500 to 2,000 international units.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^115eysuz]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present study must be praised for bringing potential interactions between individual nutrients into the focus of interest. Because the intake of Mg is often inadequate and several other factors are also known to impair Mg supply (for example, diuretics use, diabetes mellitus, chronic alcohol consumption, stress factors), more attention should in future be paid to possible consequences of insufficient or deficient Mg supply in the general population. Further studies on the interactions between Mg supply and vitamin D status should include a more detailed assessment of individual Mg status (for example, by measuring biochemical parameters of Mg status or by adjusting statistical analysis for stress factors, diuretics use, alcohol consumption and concomitant diagnoses such as diabetes); a more detailed investigation of different components of the vitamin D-parathyroid hormone axis in general populations; clarification of the dose?response relationship; and the realization of randomized controlled trials to verify whether oral Mg is indeed able to improve vitamin D status and survival.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^116T4Hqe]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Like vitamin D deficit, magnesium deficit is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several steps in the vitamin D metabolism, such as vitamin D binding to its transport protein and the conversion of vitamin D into the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by hepatic and renal hydroxylation, depend on magnesium as a cofactor. A new analysis of two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data sets, published in BMC Medicine, investigated potential interactions between magnesium intake, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status, and mortality. Data indicate a reduced risk of insufficient/deficient vitamin D status at high magnesium intake and an inverse association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, among those with magnesium intake above the median. The study provides important findings concerning potential metabolic interactions between magnesium and vitamin D and its clinical relevance. However, results should be considered preliminary since biochemical data on individual magnesium status were lacking, confounding cannot be excluded and questions on the dose?response relationship still remain to be answered.

### Osteoporosis: the role of micronutrients [^116b7jSy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis and low bone mass are currently estimated to be a major public health threat. Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D. Calcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone mass at all ages, although the results are not always consistent. Higher doses than the current US recommendation (600 IU) of vitamin D in the elderly (age ≥ 65 y) may actually be required for optimal bone health (800–1000 IU/d). The elderly can clearly benefit from increased vitamin D intakes; however, the potential importance of vitamin D in peak bone mass is just being investigated. Vitamin D has been related to falls, with supplementation reducing the number of falls. There are clear fracture benefits demonstrated in randomized clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The other micronutrient needs for optimizing bone health can be easily met by a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables to ensure adequate intakes for magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, and other potentially important nutrients. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes (easily monitored by serum 25(OH)D) for optimal bone health, as well as the prevention of falls and fractures. In addition, a healthy diet that includes 5 servings a day of fruits and vegetables should optimize the intake of micronutrients required for bone health.

Open questions

Like vitamin D deficit, Mg deficit is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Thus, the presented interactions between Mg, vitamin D and cardiovascular mortality fit well together. Nevertheless, for several reasons, data should be considered preliminary. First, associations are based on oral Mg intake. The assessment of oral Mg intake does not take into account inter-individual differences in intestinal Mg absorption and renal and cutaneous Mg loss. It would have been more appropriate to use biochemical data, such as plasma Mg levels (levels of 0.79 to 0.76 mmol/l have been classified as inadequate and levels < 0.76 mmol/l as deficient), to assess individual Mg status. Unfortunately, plasma levels of Mg are still rarely assessed, whereas measurement of circulating 25OHD levels has exploded in the clinical setting in recent years. Second, total Mg intake, 25OHD status and physical activity level were clearly interrelated. High Mg intake may thus only be an indicator for high physical activity, which is known to influence 25OHD status (and cardiovascular mortality). Even adjustment for physical activity may not completely solve the problem of potential bias. Third, no data on circulating levels of the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, were presented. Circulating 1,25(OH) 2 D is probably a better predictor of total mortality compared with circulating 25OHD, at least if mid-term mortality is assessed. Circulating 1,25(OH) 2 D declines significantly (and parathyroid hormone levels increase substantially) at 25OHD levels below 10 ng/ml, whereas levels of both hormones seem to plateau at 25OHD levels of 20 ng/ml. Notably, three out of the four 25OHD categories in the mortality analysis of the present investigation were above 20 ng/ml, and none covered the range that the IOM has classified as deficient. It would have been interesting to see whether the combination of inadequate Mg intake with 25OHD levels below 12 ng/ml is associated with a further mortality increase.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^117CjXWk]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study results

Deng et al. used two large National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data sets to assess interactions between Mg intake, vitamin D status and outcome. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) classification, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status, was within the deficit range (< 12 ng/ml) in 12% of participants and the insufficiency range (12 to 20 ng/ml) in 30%. Mean energy-adjusted total Mg intake (dietary and supplemental) was clearly below the recommended daily allowance, which is between 310 and 420 mg depending on age and gender. High Mg intake was associated with reduced risk of vitamin D deficit or insufficiency. Data also indicate an inverse association between circulating 25OHD and mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, among those with Mg intake above the median.

### Micronutrient status in nursing home residents: associations with dietary supplementation and health characteristics in the cross-sectional multicentre nutricare study [^11479HZT]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in nursing home residents, particularly for vitamin D, magnesium and potassium.
63% reported supplement use but suboptimal micronutrient status remained common.
Most non-supplementers had insufficient vitamin D levels year-round, highlighting the inadequacy of diet and sun exposure alone.
Low haemoglobin and ferritin levels were frequent, with implications for anaemia and overall health in older adults.
These findings underscore the urgent need for improved NH menus, individualised supplementation, and preventive micronutrient strategies guided by clear protocols.

### Magnesium, vitamin D status and mortality: results from US national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2001 to 2006 and NHANES III [^114CFuBp]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets among children and osteomalacia in adults. Many epidemiologic studies suggest that low vitamin D status may also be associated with risk of non-skeletal chronic diseases, such as, all-cause mortality, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and colorectal cancer. However, findings have not been entirely consistent. Large-scale clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation are ongoing. Despite food fortification and dietary supplementation, some studies have observed that low vitamin D status is still relatively common in the US while a large portion of the interperson variation in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels is unexplained.

Magnesium, the second most abundant intracellular cation, plays a critical role in the synthesis and metabolism of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. Previous studies have shown that the activities of three major enzymes determining 25(OH)D level and vitamin D binding protein are magnesium dependent (Figure 1). Magnesium deficiency, which leads to reduced 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D and impaired PTH response, has been implicated in 'magnesium-dependent vitamin-D-resistant rickets'. Magnesium supplementation substantially reversed the resistance to vitamin D treatment. Interestingly, a study conducted among osteoporosis patients showed much higher prevalence rates of magnesium deficiency or insufficiency among people with insufficient 25(OH)D than those with sufficient 25(OH)D. Two small clinical trials of magnesium-deficient patients found that magnesium infusion alone led to a non-significant increase in 1,25(OH) 2 D and 25(OH)D whereas magnesium infusion plus oral vitamin D substantially increased both serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D. These findings suggest a potential interaction between vitamin D and magnesium treatments and a possible moderate effect of magnesium on 25(OH)D status.

### Are low intakes of calcium and potassium important causes of cardiovascular disease? [^111gvyeh]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Inadequate levels of calcium and potassium intake have long been associated with higher blood pressures. Epidemiologic data have suggested these associations and many clinical trials have indicated causal relationships. However, the intervention data are plagued with inconsistent study designs, populations, and results, and there remain many questions regarding dietary recommendations of these nutrients for cardiovascular health. Until recently, nutrition research focused on single-nutrient interventions, generally with disparate results. Recognizing that nutrients are not consumed individually but as combined constituents of a varied diet, efforts in this area have shifted to the role of the overall diet, or dietary patterns, in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. The suggestions of epidemiologic surveys nearly two decades ago that the total diet has a greater influence on cardiovascular health than do specific components, are now being borne out by randomized controlled trials demonstrating this effect. From these dietary pattern studies, it has become increasingly clear that it is not merely excesses of single nutrients but also deficiencies of multiple nutrients in combination, such as calcium and potassium, that have the greatest dietary effects on cardiovascular health. Several risk factors for cardiovascular disease have now been shown to be reduced with diets that meet the current recommended dietary guidelines, ie, that provide appropriate levels of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and macronutrients. In addition, new data indicate that regular consumption of these diets is associated with decreased mortality. Adequate intake of minerals such as calcium and potassium-specifically derived from foods, where they coexist with other essential nutrients-contributes to cardiovascular as well as overall health.

### What diseases are causally linked to vitamin D deficiency? [^114JzkK3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The classical clinical consequence of vitamin D deficiency is osteomalacia, presenting as rickets in children. This remains a common problem in parts of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, and occurs when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are < 25nmol/L. Osteomalacia remains the only problem that is unequivocally a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are observed in a wide range of conditions, but consistent trial evidence of amelioration of these conditions with vitamin D is lacking. Monotherapy with vitamin D has not been found to be effective in meta-analyses of trials assessing its effects on bone density, fractures or falls. At present, supplements should be advised for individuals at risk of having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the 25-40nmol/L range, or below, with a view to prevention of osteomalacia.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^117PqpLC]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.3.2 Blood tests for specific nutritional deficiencies

Statement 102. We recommend that IBD patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should have relevant screening blood tests to assess for macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies. This may include measurement of iron stores, vitamin B12, folate, vitamins A, C, D and E, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, zinc and selenium (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93.6%).

Measurement of macronutrient and micronutrient status in IBD is important for ongoing monitoring in patients who have or are at risk of malnutrition; however, interpretation of results can be challenging. Some micronutrients are influenced by disease activity so serum levels should consider C-reactive protein (CRP) when interpreting these micronutrients. A reliable clinical interpretation can be made only if the CRP is < 20 mg/L (plasma zinc), < 10 mg/L (plasma selenium, vitamin A and vitamin D) or < 5 mg/L (vitamin B6 and vitamin C). Magnesium deficiency has been reported to occur in 13–88% of patients with IBD, but serum magnesium is not an accurate measurement of magnesium status because less than 1% of magnesium stores are in the blood. The remainder is in bone, soft tissue and muscle. Magnesium deficiency in IBD is likely to be caused by increased gastrointestinal losses. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency include abdominal cramps, impaired healing, fatigue and bone pain. Magnesium supplementation can be given orally or intravenously, although oral supplementation can worsen diarrhoea. Up to a third of patients with IBD fail to meet the recommended dietary intake for calcium and calcium supplementation should be considered alongside vitamin D supplementation (see Section 5.2.8.3: Common Disease Considerations, Calcium and vitamin D supplementation). Plasma potassium levels should be monitored and supplemented as required. There are existing ECCO guidelines for monitoring and management of iron, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. General advice about iron replacement is shown in box 9.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^113yWYu4]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Dietary factors affecting magnesium status

'Although magnesium intakes have been gradually falling since the beginning of the century, there were sharply increased intakes of nutrients that increased its requirements [particularly high vitamin D and phosphorus intakes]… The major source of phosphorus derives from soft drinks that contain phosphoric acid, the consumption of which has been rising markedly in the last quarter of a century'.

Since 1940 there has been a tremendous decline in the micronutrient density of foods. In the UK for example, there has been loss of magnesium in beef (−4 to −8%), bacon (−18%), chicken (−4%), cheddar cheese (−38%), parmesan cheese (−70%), whole milk (−21%) and vegetables (−24%). The loss of magnesium during food refining/processing is significant: white flour (−82%), polished rice (−83%), starch (−97%) and white sugar (−99%). Since 1968 the magnesium content in wheat has dropped almost 20%, which may be due to acidic soil, yield dilution and unbalanced crop fertilisation (high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, the latter of which antagonises the absorption of magnesium in plants). One review paper concluded: 'Magnesium deficiency in plants is becoming an increasingly severe problem with the development of industry and agriculture and the increase in human population'. Processed foods, fat, refined flour and sugars are all devoid of magnesium, and thus our Western diet predisposes us to magnesium deficiency. Good dietary sources of magnesium include nuts, dark chocolate and unrefined whole grains.

### Relationships between hyperinsulinaemia, magnesium, vitamin D, thrombosis and COVID-19: rationale for clinical management [^116H4wV2]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods may include implementing a well-formulated ketogenic diet (WFKD), low carbohydrate healthy fat diet (LCHF), low glycaemic load (GL) diet and dietary carbohydrate restriction in as much a practicable way as possible approach. Choice in approach may vary for a myriad of reasons; while nutritional ketosis is demonstrated to be safe, it is not necessarily the primary focus in this instance. Whereas lowering hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia are at the forefront of the pathophysiological development of increasing risk factors for poorer outcomes in at risk individuals.

Implementing a method that helps get patients into a 'fasting mimicking state' using any of these fasting mimicking diets, which has a phenotype of healthy blood glucose (3.5–6.0 mmol/L), insulin (< 200 pmol/L) and ketones (< 7.0 mmol/L in healthy individuals, ketones at ≤ 3.0 mmol/L is a respectable concentration in metabolically unhealthy patients), where there is no drive to calorie restrict. Again bearing in mind, during acute care settings, the focus is on lowering both glucose and insulin through carbohydrate restriction, whereas the focus is not on achieving any particular ketosis goal, aside from ensuring avoidance of ketoacidosis — ketones ≥ 7.0 mmol/Land/or presence of ketones plus lowered serum bicarbonate < 15–18 mmol/L, with concomitant hyperglycaemia (glucose levels > 13.8 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)) — the triad of diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitoring serum bicarbonate provides a sensitivity test for any metabolic acidosis with presence of ketones. Ketoacidosis does not occur unless there are presence of ketones with hyperglycaemia and bicarbonate levels start trending downwards, indicating insulin insufficiency, as seen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who do not produce enough, if any insulin to regulate ketogenesis with hyperglycaemia.

### Hypomagnesemia: exploring its multifaceted health impacts and associations with blood pressure regulation and metabolic syndrome [^117W24Lt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Association between hypomagnesemia and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS)

Excessive aldosterone stimulates endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory cell infiltration, promoting the development of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as arteriosclerosis and calcification. Relevant studies have shown a close association between abnormal aldosterone regulation and hypomagnesemia. Specifically, low levels of magnesium can prompt aldosterone upregulation and further lead to hypertension by downregulating the function of the TRPM7 transporter. This series of reactions can also exacerbate magnesium deficiency. Conversely, magnesium supplementation can effectively reduce serum aldosterone levels. When aldosterone escape occurs, segmental sodium transport is inhibited, which may be related to reduced magnesium reabsorption. In addition, magnesium supplementation seems to affect aldosterone secretion produced by thiazide diuretics used to treat hypertension. These diuretics not only lead to magnesium depletion but also stimulate aldosterone secretion through a fluid contraction mechanism. Magnesium may exert this effect by directly influencing glomerular cells that secrete aldosterone or by regulating the upstream renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Magnesium also helps activate vitamin D as a cofactor for enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism. Adequate magnesium levels ensure the function of these enzymes, thereby improving the utilization of active vitamin D. Long-term vitamin D deficiency can lead to hyperactivation of the RAAS, which is one of the important mechanisms of blood pressure regulation.

Interestingly, while magnesium depletion can promote aldosterone secretion, it does not necessarily lead to increased levels of renin and angiotensin II. Whether this increase in aldosterone is reversible or leads to continuous secretion remains to be further explored. Additionally, how the reduction of extracellular Mg 2+ precisely activates relevant cellular mechanisms is an important direction for future research (Fig 1).

Fig. 1
Magnesium deficiency weakens calcium antagonism, enhances NADPH oxidase activity, leading to increased oxidative stress, inhibits eNOS activity, and reduces NO production, causing endothelial dysfunction. Simultaneously, it diminishes the inhibition of calcium channels, increases calcium influx, and vasoconstriction of vascular smooth muscle, and exacerbates vascular tension by reducing Na + -K + -ATPase activity. Furthermore, low magnesium activates the RAAS, elevating Ang II levels, which directly contracts blood vessels and promotes sodium and water retention. Ang II further aggravates oxidative stress, creating a vicious cycle. The concomitant metabolic disorders also contribute to elevated blood pressure

### Relationships between hyperinsulinaemia, magnesium, vitamin D, thrombosis and COVID-19: rationale for clinical management [^1152wokK]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Additional medications to take into account include:

Gliptins or glitazones – tailored and titrated down on an individualised approach.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists – may be continued.
Metformin – continued if well tolerated, has been shown to improve insulin sensitisation and thus potentially decrease higher insulin requirements, along with enabling the lowering of glucose without a high risk of hypoglycaemia. If a risk of lactic acidosis presents, discontinue.

Addressing hypertension and antihypertensive medications: refined carbohydrate restriction leads to lowered endogenous and/or exogenous insulin requirements; this results in increased renal sodium secretion and diuresis resulting in hypotension. Vigilant and frequent monitoring of blood pressure to avoid hypotension is vital, with according adjustments to antihypertensive medications. Increased sodium intake and/or monitoring for hyponatraemia may likely be needed if patients experience headaches or light-headedness. It is also important to discontinue sodium restriction recommendations when implementing carbohydrate restriction as low sodium diets have been shown to increase MgD and IR, thus potentiating hyperglycaemia.

Metformin, diuretics and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) drugs have been shown to increase incidence of hypomagnesaemia and are commonly prescribed to patients with T2DM, a condition of hyperinsulinaemia. A reduction in gastric acidity production by PPI drugs decrease Mg 2+ solubility, thus decreasing absorption potential in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; metformin causes GI Mg 2+ loss, while diuretics and hyperglycaemia decrease renal tubular reabsorption of Mg 2+. Patients implementing very low carbohydrate restriction, where compliance was confirmed by presence of capillary BHB, in a remote setting non-randomised intervention with online medical supervision, were prescribed daily supplementation doses for vitamin D3 and Mg 2+ at: 1000–2000 IU vitamin D3, 500 mg magnesium oxide or 200 mg magnesium chloride.

Other safe and likely beneficial therapies include zinc supplementation (11 mg for men and 8 mg for women, with an upper tolerable limit of 40 mg regardless of sex)and high-noon sensible sun exposure (sans sunscreen), especially given these therapies have been demonstrated to be safe. Given the rationale for the clinical management of COVID-19, it would be potentially of benefit for clinicians to advise patients and at-risk individuals who are at home to implement these practices, as prevention and earlier management will be more efficacious.

### Magnesium, vitamin D status and mortality: results from US national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2001 to 2006 and NHANES III [^112XU6bK]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

A previous clinical study found that parenteral magnesium treatment without vitamin D replacement in 23 magnesium-deficient patients led to a 12% rise in 25(OH)D and 30% increase in 1,25(OH) 2 D, but both changes were not statistically significant. In a subsequent study of five magnesium-deficient patients, intramuscular treatment with magnesium alone also did not significantly increase 25(OH)D, but magnesium infusion together with pharmacological dose of 25(OH)D substantially increased both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D among patients with magnesium deficiency. One interpretation is that magnesium treatment does not affect 25(OH)D status. However, we postulate that several factors may have contributed to the insignificant increase in 25(OH)D status. First, the subjects participating in these studies had low concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D as well as pre-vitamin D 3 and vitamin D 3 as a result of limited sunlight exposure, underlying disease and/or lack of oral supplementation. Therefore, concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D did not substantially increase during short-term magnesium repletion because pre-vitamin D3 was not available in sufficient amounts. Second, there was a modest increase in the conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2 D and, thus, a reduction in 25(OH)D level was expected due to this conversion. Finally, the sample size in these two studies was very small particularly if the direct effect of magnesium treatment on vitamin D status is only moderate.

### Hypomagnesemia in intestinal lymphangiectasia: a case report and review of the literature [^115XKZG2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

There could be several potential clinical consequences of hypomagnesemia in IL patients. Severely lowered serum magnesium can cause arrhythmias, including PR interval prolongation, progressive QRS widening, and, most notably, torsades de pointes. Additionally, hypomagnesemia can give rise to neuromuscular hyperactivity, causing tetany and seizures. Hypomagnesemic tetany was reported in one IL patient. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia are common findings in IL patients. Since magnesium plays a regulatory role in potassium and calcium metabolism, hypomagnesemia could have further complicated these two electrolyte disturbances. In one case, hypocalcemia was recalcitrant to vitamin D and calcium supplementation and was only corrected by magnesium injections.

The treatment for hypomagnesemia in IL patients should be individualized. For severe hypomagnesemia with symptoms, intravenous magnesium sulfate is the preferred option. Days may be needed for the restoration of normal concentrations because as much as 50% of the injected magnesium would be lost from the urine. For moderate to mild asymptomatic situations, oral replacement might be adequate. The serum level should be closely monitored, especially in patients with impaired renal function, for whom the risk of hypermagnesemia is high.

In conclusion, hypomagnesemia may be an overlooked complication of IL, and the monitoring of serum magnesium concentration is essential, especially in patients with concomitant neuromuscular and ionic abnormalities, as well as a magnesium-deficient dietary habit.

### Evidence-based policy on dietary calcium and vitamin D [^1167np1J]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine's report on calcium and vitamin D makes a positive contribution by grounding its recommendations on the available evidence base. The committee does not substantially change recommended dietary intakes for calcium and modestly increases those for vitamin D based on the need for a median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40 nmol/L. They do not support the suggestion that all adults should have levels > 75 nmol/L. The committee concludes that current evidence does not support nonskeletal benefits for vitamin D or calcium, and notes that higher intakes of both could have adverse health consequences. The present authors are generally in agreement with these conclusions, with some caveats regarding the evidence base used. However, we believe that the central role of sunlight exposure in determining vitamin D status needs to be explicitly reflected in public policy in this area.

### Electrolyte and acid-base disorders in inflammatory bowel disease [^116V4GBD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease

A study assessing 63 patients with CD for electrolyte disorders demonstrated that 33% of them had low levels of serum sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium either alone or in combination.

In vitro measurements of the net transport and simultaneous bidirectional flux rates of water and electrolytes across the human colonic epithelium demonstrated that in CD there was a reversal of Na + and water flux, and K + secretion was increased. Additionally, it was noticed that where the disease was of such extent and severity as to demand panproctocolectomy and ileostomy, the losses of K +, Na + and water were equal to or even exceeded those found in UC.

In another study, sodium absorption was studied in CD (n = 10) proctocolectomized patients with radiologically normal small bowel. It was found that despite clinical and radiographic remission, sodium absorption was markedly diminished in the intestine of CD patients. This was attributed to the fact that CD comprises a more generalized disease.

The ionic composition of fecal fluid from 13 patients with CD limited to the colon had lower mean sodium and chloride but higher potassium concentration and osmolality compared with fecal fluid from patients with diffuse UC. Thus, differences in the composition and perhaps the pathogenesis of the diarrhea of CD and UC could not be excluded. Of note, in comparison with normal subjects, increased potassium secretion and decreased sodium absorption were noticed in both inflammatory bowel syndromes.

Notable seasonal variations in vitamin D status and bone turnover markers have been reported in CD patients. Specifically, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly lower (up to 65%) in CD patients compared with healthy subjects, potentially due to reduced intestinal absorption, disturbed enterohepatic circulation and reduced nutrient intake of vitamin D. Moreover, additional factors increasing hypocalcemia risk include winter season, smoking and ethnicity.

### Overview of the conference "Vitamin D and health in the 21st century: an update" [^111MDWhe]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

We summarize the key findings, strength of the evidence, and research needs identified in the National Institutes of Health conference "Vitamin D and Health in the 21st Century: an Update", which was held in September 2007; a systematic evidence-based review; and a National Institutes of Health roundtable discussion held after the conference by scientists with relevant expertise. The evidence-based review addressed 5 questions on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and functional outcomes across the life cycle and response to exposure, bone health outcomes of supplementation, risks and benefits of sun exposure, and adverse outcomes. These questions also framed the conference and roundtable discussions. Researchers have made considerable progress in understanding the relation of 25(OH)D to bone health outcomes in the elderly and in postmenopausal women, but we know less about its impact on other stages of the life cycle and in racial and ethnic groups. Limitations of the existing data include the failure of many studies to control for important confounders [baseline 25(OH)D concentration, skin pigmentation, body mass index, compliance, etc], sparse data on key vulnerable populations (dark-skinned persons, reproducing women, infants, children, and adolescents), problems of accuracy and excessive variability in measuring 25(OH)D, lack of established relation of 25(OH)D with functional outcomes except in the elderly, and limited information on the effects of vitamin D independent of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. Future research should determine and validate across the life cycle relevant functional outcomes for bone and other health factors as well as adverse outcomes for the biomarker of exposure, 25(OH)D, to enable assessment of the role of vitamin D status in health maintenance and disease prevention.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^113obtx1]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

QT-prolonging medications and vitamin D considerations in pregnancy include that opioids, antiarrhythmic drugs, and polypharmacy with multiple QT-prolonging drugs have been associated with excessive QT prolongation, especially in the presence of electrolyte, mineral, or vitamin D deficiencies, and these should be corrected if possible. While therapeutic response is seen in the patient, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels themselves rarely show a major recovery until after the pregnancy, and thus repeat assessment of levels is not required. Vitamin D serves a critical function of promoting absorption of calcium and magnesium from the gut, and it can be difficult to correct these when 25-hydroxy vitamin D is low.

### A review of the health consequences of the vitamin D deficiency pandemic [^114c9q6T]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis and myopathy are among the better known consequences of a low to very low vitamin D status. Over the past several years various predominantly epidemiological and prospective cohort studies have found associations between low vitamin D levels and various extraskeletal conditions. These findings may particularly become important over the next years since large proportions of the population have low vitamin D levels. Increasing incidence rates of obesity, adverse life-style factors and active avoidance of sunlight seem to decrease average population mean vitamin D levels further. This article gives a brief overview of known and also less well-established potential detrimental effects of a low vitamin D status.

### Magnesium biology [^114EfVdo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

MAGNESIUM PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Mg 2+ deficiency (serum Mg 2+ < 0.7 mmol/L) can result in symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramps and arrythmias, and in severe cases developmental delay and seizures. Risk factors for the development of hypomagnesemia include age, gastrointestinal track diseases, type 2 diabetes and excessive alcohol consumption, as well as the use of certain pharmacological drugs. With a prevalence of ± 2.5% in the general population and about 12%–20% in hospitalized patients, hypomagnesemia is especially important in patients with pre-existing comorbidities, and needs to be treated adequately.

Patients rarely present with hypermagnesemia, which can be caused by excessive amount of Mg 2+ ingestion either through Mg 2+ supplementation or drugs high in Mg 2+ such as laxatives and Epsom salts.

Notably, hypomagnesemia often is accompanied by hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased inhibition of ROMK in the collecting duct in response to hypomagnesemia. ROMK is inhibited by Mg 2+, stimulating basolateral excretion of K +. Therefore, low Mg 2+ levels lead to decreased inhibition of ROMK, resulting in increased efflux of K + into the pre-urine resulting in hypokalemia and increased excretion of K +.

Low Mg 2+ levels lead to increases CaSR signaling in the parathyroid gland, resulting in decreased PTH secretion ultimately resulting in decreased Ca 2+ levels via secondary mechanisms such as decreased vitamin D levels needed for Ca 2+ absorption. However, the exact mechanism and regulation of Ca 2+ levels in response to hypomagnesemia remain elusive.

Alcohol-induced hypomagnesemia

Hypomagnesemia is often seen in people with increased alcohol consumption. It has already been shown decades ago that chronic alcohol consumption is associated with decreased serum Mg 2+ levels and hypermagnesuria. Next to the direct effect of alcohol on urinary Mg 2+ wasting, secondary effects such as vomiting or diarrhea may further contribute to hypomagnesemia in alcohol-dependent patients. Furthermore, other comorbidities of alcohol abuse, such as acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis, have been shown to be associated with decreased serum Mg 2+ levels. Mg 2+ supplementation has been suggested to ease alcohol withdrawal, while it is remains inconclusive whether Mg 2+ positively influences this process. A recent study demonstrated that 60% of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome have hypomagnesemia, which was associated with an increased 1-year mortality risk.

### Decreased magnesium status may mediate the increased cardiovascular risk associated with calcium supplementation [^115Myzja]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Balanced supplemental intakes of calcium and magnesium may be advisable

If high calcium intakes in humans can indeed impair magnesium balance when magnesium intakes are low, the clear implication is that calcium, when supplemented, should be given in conjunction with a balanced dose of magnesium; some authorities recommend a 2:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium (by weight) as most appropriate, both for supplementation and the total daily intake. This seems appropriate considering that good magnesium status also appears to favourably impact bone structure. The concept of 'balancing' calcium and magnesium in supplements has, in fact, been the accepted wisdom in 'health food' circles for decades, owing to Seelig's research and its promulgation by popular health food pundits. However, the calcium supplements featured in pharmacies and supermarkets — where most people shop — typically feature only calcium and vitamin D. Research and promotional efforts sponsored by the dairy industry have insured that calcium is highly valued by the general public, whereas magnesium, no less crucial to health, is essentially an 'orphan nutrient', lacking the advocacy of commercial interests.

It should be noted that calcium/magnesium balance may cut both ways. In China, where the use of dairy products is low, dietary calcium/magnesium ratios tend to be much lower than in the West (1.7 vs 3). A recent analysis of prospective cohort studies in Shanghai has observed that, among people with a calcium/magnesium ratio under 1.7, an increasing intake of magnesium correlates with increased total mortality, whereas in those with a calcium/magnesium ratio above 1.7, increases in intake of magnesium and/or calcium correlated with reduced mortality risk. Hence, a high supplemental intake of magnesium may be inadvisable when calcium intakes are low.

Thus, more clinical studies examining the impact of varying calcium intakes on magnesium balance in subjects with low-normal magnesium intakes are clearly needed, as is a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms, whereby calcium can both positively and negatively influence magnesium absorption and retention. Future epidemiological studies should make an effort to differentiate calcium supplementers into those who either do or do not use supplemental magnesium concurrently, and also take into consideration dietary magnesium intake. In the mean time, people (especially those consuming a relatively refined diet) who wish to supplement with calcium might be well advised to take a supplement that also includes highly bioavailable magnesium, targeting a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio in the overall diet.

### Relationships between hyperinsulinaemia, magnesium, vitamin D, thrombosis and COVID-19: rationale for clinical management [^115oLcae]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

A low vitamin D status is associated with hyperinsulinaemia's pathologies (obesity, T2DM, CVD and metabolic cancers). Insulin mediates de novo lipogenesis and adipogenesis. Hyperinsulinaemia sequesters lipophilic vitamin D3 into adipocytes. Insulin stimulates bone resorption and calcium (Ca 2+) and phosphate release. Elevated plasma Ca 2+ and phosphate inhibits renal enzymatic 25OHD-1α-hydroxylation (CYP27B1) activation of inactive 25OHD-calcidiol to biologically active 1,25(OH)2D-calcitriol.CYP27B1 is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 hydroxylase situated on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. CYP27B1 function is dependent on OxPhos NADPH production and healthy robust mitochondrial electron transport machinery.

Hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia both increase mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production while decreasing ROS management capacity via depletion of NAD+, resulting in diminished MnSOD2 and a decreased GSH:GSSG ratio. A decreased ability to hydroxylate and thus activate 25OHD-calcidiol to its active form 1,25(OH)2D-calcitriol, due to poor ETC health and diminished NADPH generation, may complicate research findings in plasma measurements that typically measure total 25OHD-calcidiol. Additionally, it does not take into account vitamin D binding protein bound 25OHD-calcidiol. Furthermore, some hydroxylation of inactive to active vitamin D occurs intracellularly within other tissues and may be inhibited by excessive mitochondrial ROS and NAD+ glucose metabolism depletion. This aspect of vitamin D metabolism may not be picked up with blood plasma measurements, where plasma total inactive 25OHD is the typical form of measure. Interestingly, in a year-long weight loss intervention study, 56 obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m²) participants were randomised to a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) or a standard hypocaloric Mediterranean diet (SHMD). Both groups had significant increases in their serum 25OHD-calcidiol status with weight loss, as measured by chemiluminescence. However, the VLCKD group had a greater significant increase relative to the SHMD, from 18.4 to 29.3 ng/mL, p < 0.0001 versus 17.5 to 21.3 ng/mL, p = 0.067, as well as decreases in C reactive protein. These results indicate the role of dietary macronutrient distribution on insulin secretion stimulus and its consequential effect on mitochondrial vitamin D hydroxylation activity and possible inflammation mediated depletion (usage) of vitamin D.

Magnesium in human biology

'Magnesium is the seventh most abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass or molarity… In vertebrates, magnesium is extremely abundant and it is the second most common intracellular cation (potassium being the first). Extracellular magnesium accounts for only ∼1% of total body magnesium, which is found primarily in serum and red blood cells'.

Magnesium is the fourth most common cation in our body, the second most common intracellular cation and the most common intracellular divalent cation. The human body contains around 25 g of magnesium. Magnesium is necessary for the functioning of over 300 enzymes in human, with 90% of total body magnesium being contained in the muscles and bones (~27% and ~63%, respectively), 90% of which is bound and with only 10% being free. In the serum, 32% of magnesium is bound to albumin, whereas 55% is free.

Some of the main functions of magnesium in human biology include the maintenance of ionic gradients (keeping intracellular sodium and calcium low and potassium high), cellular and tissue integrity, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (ATP production and activation), and DNA, RNA and protein synthesis and integrity.

The elimination of magnesium is mainly controlled by the kidneys, increasing in the urine when there is magnesium surplus and falling to just 1 mEq of magnesium (~12 mg) during deficits. However, despite renal conservation, magnesium can be pulled from the bone (as well as muscles and internal organs) in order to maintain normal serum magnesium levels when intakes are low. Thus, a normal serum magnesium level does not rule out magnesium deficiency, which predisposes to osteopaenia, osteoporosis and fractures.

An excess of heavy metals due to soil contamination and a lack of minerals due to soil erosion also may predispose to micronutrient deficits. The importance of the mineral content of soil and water, once greatly appreciated, think low iodine levels in soil and the increased prevalence of goitre, has all but been forgotten. Furthermore, refined foods are depleted of magnesium during their processing. In order to prevent chronic diseases, we need to change our mindset away from exclusively treating acute illness and instead focus more on treating the underlying causes of chronic diseases, such as magnesium deficiency.

### Life course dietary patterns and bone health in later life in a British birth cohort study [^1151bHiV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

An alternative to purely exploratory dietary pattern methods is reduced rank regression (RRR), which incorporates a priori information to identify hypothesis‐driven dietary patterns. This has the advantage of testing hypotheses regarding specific nutrients while taking account of all foods consumed and dietary composition.

Longitudinal dietary data have been collected from the MRC National Survey for Health and Development (NSHD), a post‐war UK birth‐cohort of men and women born during 1 week in March 1946. Dietary data were collected throughout adulthood. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements conducted at age 60 to 64 years. The NSHD provides an opportunity to investigate how life course lifestyle might relate to healthy ageing and therefore the main aim of this study was to investigate how diet through adulthood might influence bone phenotype in early old age. We generated a hypothesis based on those single nutrients or food groups where there has been strong evidence for a positive role in musculoskeletal health, ie, in ameliorating bone loss or increasing BMD, and taking into account the UK diet and food supply. Those nutrients that require biomarker measurement, such as urinary sodium excretion for sodium status, were not considered. Calcium was selected as the main bone‐forming mineral, protein because of the associations reported between protein intake and bone and muscle health, and potassium as a component of the acid‐base balance and marker of fruit and vegetable intake. 1, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 We also took into consideration the possibility of confounding; for example, we chose potassium rather than magnesium because the strength of evidence for potassium is most consistent for bone health, and also knowing that potassium and magnesium intakes are closely correlated. Therefore adding magnesium would be unlikely to substantially improve our dietary pattern model fit. Vitamin D was not chosen because dietary intakes of vitamin D in the UK population are extremely low; with the exceptions of spreads and margarines, which at the time of the study (1940–2013) was mandatory and remains common, food fortification with vitamin D is on a voluntary basis. 30 Therefore, RRR was used to identify dietary patterns or combinations of food intake that best characterize calcium, protein, and potassium intakes. We hypothesized that an increasing trajectory in scores for a positive dietary pattern characterized by high calcium, potassium, and protein (PrCaK‐rich) intakes during adulthood would be associated with greater BMD at 63 years of age. We also determined, at a population level, how such a dietary pattern tracked through the adult years.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^114jUrFA]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Nutrient supplementation and repletion after bariatric surgery — vitamin B1 (thiamine) — include preventive and therapeutic dosing. For prevention, ≥ 12 mg thiamine daily; preferably a 50–100 mg daily dose of thiamine from a B-complex supplement or high-potency multivitamin. Bariatric patients with suspected thiamine deficiency should be treated before or in the absence of laboratory confirmation and monitored/ evaluated for resolution of signs and symptoms. Repletion dosing varies by route: Oral therapy: 100 mg 2–3 times daily until symptoms resolve; IV therapy: 200 mg 3 times daily to 500 mg once or twice daily for 3–5 d, followed by 250 mg/d for 3–5 d or until symptoms resolve, then consider treatment with 100 mg/d orally, indefinitely, or until risk factors have been resolved; IM therapy: 250 mg once daily for 3–5 d or 100–250 mg monthly. Magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus should be given simultaneously to patients at risk for refeeding syndrome.

### Relationship between dietary magnesium intake and incident heart failure among older women: the WHI [^114C9Vs8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Among 103 240 participants in the WHI OS or the placebo arm of the hormone therapy trials, 97 725 were included in the primary analysis. We observed 2153 HF cases over a median follow‐up of 8.1 years. The median dietary magnesium intake across quartiles were 149 mg/day for women in the lowest quartile (mean 144.4 ± 26.9), 212 mg/day (mean 212.3 ± 17.1) for those in the second quartile, 272 mg/day (mean 273.3 ± 19.3) for the third quartile, and 363 mg/day (mean 383.1 ± 69.1) for the highest quartile of intake. Women in the lower quartiles of dietary magnesium intake were more likely to be aged 70 years or older, less likely to be white, had lower education and income, more likely to be current smokers, had lower recreational physical activity and slightly higher systolic blood pressure, and more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and prior coronary heart disease. They also had lower dietary intake of alcohol, calcium, phosphorus, protein, potassium, sodium, vitamin D, and multivitamins and had lower total energy; and higher use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and proton pump inhibitors (Table 1).

### IGF-1 and risk of morbidity and mortality from cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and all causes in EPIC-heidelberg [^1143HbAU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Another potential explanation, particularly regarding low levels IGF-1 and increased risk of mortality was that of reverse causation. It is probable that individuals with underlying preclinical conditions, particularly those affecting the liver, have low circulating levels of IGF-1 and that their underlying diseases were responsible for the observed increased risk of mortality. We explored this question by using liver enzymes and other liver-related conditions, such as hepatitis, liver cancer, and liver cirrhosis as markers of liver function and health status. We found that, among participants with low IGF-1, the risks of cancer and all-cause mortality were substantially attenuated in analyses that included participants without indications of liver diseases but were elevated in analyses restricted to participants with liver conditions. Our findings suggest that the health and functional status of the liver may explain some but not all of the mortality risk associated with low levels of IGF-1.

Another important factor in understanding the relationship between IGF-1 and mortality is nutritional status, in particular, protein intake. Earlier studies among EPIC participants reported associations between IGF-1 levels and intake of vitamins B6 and B2, proteins, milk, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous. In our recent analyses, we found that animal intake was associated with increased risk of mortality, largely driven by increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Others analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and reported that protein intake is associated with increased risk of total mortality and that IGF-1 moderates this association. In particular, intake of carbohydrates, dairy products, and B vitamins have been implicated to be associated with IGF-1 levels. Whether IGF-1 moderates the relationship between protein intake/overall nutritional status and cancer, cardiovascular, and total mortality endpoints in the context of the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort is a subject of ongoing research.

### Micronutrient status in nursing home residents: associations with dietary supplementation and health characteristics in the cross-sectional multicentre nutricare study [^115Q2FdG]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Micronutrient deficiencies are common in institutionalised older adults due to chronic diseases, functional decline and age-related changes, increasing their risk of poor health outcomes. The study aim was to assess the usual daily intakes and status of selected micronutrients in nursing home (NH) residents, and to examine the relationship between dietary supplementation, micronutrient status and health characteristics. Additionally, we aimed to identify factors associated with serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) and haemoglobin levels. The Nutricare study included 387 NH residents with low to moderate care needs from 20 NH. Collected data included resident characteristics, usual dietary intake (two 24-hour recalls, food frequency questionnaire), blood/serum biomarkers (25(OH)D, folate, vitamin B12, haemoglobin, ferritin), hand grip strength and body composition, estimated by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. Over 90% of study participants had inadequate intakes of vitamin D, magnesium and potassium. Despite 63% of participants reported use of supplements, suboptimal micronutrient status was common, with those aged 80+ and with higher care needs being more at risk. Most of participants who did not supplement vitamin D had insufficient 25(OH)D levels-both during winter (98%) and summer (71%). Low haemoglobin (< 130 g/L) was found in 43% and ferritin < 30 μg/L in 9%. These findings highlight the need for optimised NH menus and personalised supplementation strategies. Year-round vitamin D supplementation is essential, as diet and sun exposure are insufficient. Priority should be given to prevention over treatment, supported by clear guidelines for micronutrient management in this vulnerable population.

### Refeeding syndrome in pediatric age, an unknown disease: a narrative review [^114oXm8q]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

RS, particularly in vulnerable children, should be viewed as a potentially fatal condition caused by rapid refeeding after an indefinite period of malnutrition. Hypophosphatemia is characteristic, which is associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalances as well as metabolic and clinical complications. Awareness of pediatric RS and identification of at-risk patients is crucial, since this disorder is preventable, and metabolic complications are avoidable. High-risk patients include chronically malnourished patients and those who have had little or no energy for more than 10 days, who needs for daily monitoring of electrolytes levels. Refeeding should be started at a low level of energy replacement. Lastly, vitamin supplementation should be started with refeeding and continued for at least 5–7 days. Correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances prior to feeding is not necessary and should be done at the same time as feeding.

To prevent RS, it is important to slowly reintroduce food and monitor the patient's electrolyte levels. This can be accomplished by gradually increasing the number of calories in the diet and monitoring potassium, magnesium, and phosphate. If RS occurs, treatment may include correction of electrolyte imbalances with dietary supplements or intravenous fluids, and supportive measures such as oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation as needed. Overall, RS is a serious but preventable condition that can be managed with careful monitoring and controlled treatment. At-risk patients should be closely monitored by health care professionals to ensure their safety and well-being. This review underscores the need to establish new pediatric recommendations for refeeding in at-risk patients, as the lack of consensus and pediatric guidelines can lead to an underestimation of RS.

### Effects of potassium or sodium supplementation on mineral homeostasis: a controlled dietary intervention study [^115QQdi6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Western diet is characterized by a high sodium and low potassium content, and it has been associated with noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular, chronic kidney, and mineral and bone disorders. More specifically, high intake of sodium and low intake of potassium have been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Mechanistically, these associations are likely at least in part mediated by blood pressure, but additional factors may be involved.

Deregulations in bone and mineral metabolism, including hyperphosphatemia, 25-hydroxy vitamin D 3 (25[OH]-vitamin D 3) deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and high levels of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), have been associated with adverse outcomes in various populations. 25[OH]-vitamin D 3 is converted to biological active 1,25[OH]2-vitamin D 3 predominantly in the kidneys by 1-α-hydroxylase. Active vitamin D stimulates calcium and phosphate reabsorption in the gut, thus increasing plasma calcium. 25[OH]-vitamin D 3 deficiency may lead to decreased plasma calcium, which triggers PTH production. PTH increases bone resorption of calcium, suppresses renal phosphate reabsorption, and increases conversion of vitamin D. FGF23 inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and 1-α-hydroxylase, inhibiting conversion of 25[OH]-vitamin D 3 to 1,25[OH]2-vitamin D 3. Vitamin D, PTH, and FGF23 are part of intertwined feedback loops regulating the calcium and phosphate balance.

FGF23 is more and more identified to be a cardiovascular-related detrimental factor, and several strategies to reduce FGF23 levels have been studied extensively. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that lower potassium intake is associated with a higher FGF23 level and that changes in potassium or sodium homeostasis may influence bone and mineral parameters and bone health. A study found that a varying amount of salt and a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, which is among other things high in potassium, could improve bone turnover markers and calcium metabolism. However, the specific effects of altered potassium or sodium intake on bone and mineral parameters, and particularly calcium/phosphate-regulating hormones including FGF23, in humans remain unclear.

Here, we performed a post hoc analysis in a dietary controlled randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial in prehypertensive individuals. In the current study, we investigated the effects of sodium or potassium supplementation, in the context of a controlled diet, on bone and mineral parameters.

### Relationships between hyperinsulinaemia, magnesium, vitamin D, thrombosis and COVID-19: rationale for clinical management [^116Y6rQt]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Implementing glucose restriction aids to resolve hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia and their twin effects in poorer outcomes in patients at risk or with COVID-19. Chronic stimulus of insulin secretion results in hyperinsulinaemia and its downstream pathological sequelae. Glucose drives insulin secretion, excessive dietary high GL carbohydrates consumed frequently and chronically drives pathological development of hyperinsulinaemia. Clinical management should be focused on lowering carbohydrate consumption to manage both hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia, coupled with the lowering and describing of glucose management and antihypertensive medications, such as fast-acting and basal insulin. A decrease in dietary carbohydrate and its subsequent effects on lowering insulin secretion leads to rapid changes in blood pressure, requiring vigilant monitoring with describing of antihypertensive drugs, as carbohydrate restriction and resultant decrease in insulin facilitates return of homeostatic regulation of blood pressure. Thus, through carbohydrate restriction, three primary factors — hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and hypertension — that increase inflammation, coagulation and thrombosis risk are rapidly managed.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^113azMEN]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

XII. NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICINE AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS

What is known and what is new?

Nonprescription medicines include an array of medications ranging from anti-inflammatories to herbal medications. Herein, we focused on specific nutrient supplements and their relationship with BP, excluding herbal medicines and nonnutritional foods.

Although the link between vitamin intake and hypertension is indicated, evidence-based research studies are scarce. Studies suggested multivitamin supplementation decreases high-BP-related mortality. However, these effects were not observed in middle-aged and older women. Several studies support the role played by hydrosoluble vitamins in maintaining both SBP and DBP in various populations and a meta-analysis of 29 RCTs revealed that vitamin C supplementation reduced SBP and DBP. Circulating micronutrient status is associated with adiposity, SBP and cardiometabolic risk factors, such as vitamin D with obesity parameters in women, imposing alternative pathways for the vitamin D role in sustaining optimal BP. Importantly, vitamin D metabolism is dependent on the appropriate intake of calcium and magnesium. It was reported that daily magnesium supplementation lowers BP. Furthermore, a meta-regression also indicated a decrease in BP with long-term potassium supplementation of 3500 mg/day, especially in subjects not taking antihypertensives. Similarly, chlorogenic acids, compounds contained in apples, coffee, tomatoes and other vegetables, might decrease BP, also indirectly through effects on adiposity, then hypoglycaemic, hypouricemic effects and similar.

Additionally, intake of functional foods based on onion and garlic, rich in flavanols, as well as catechin-containing green tea with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties, can be a food-based nutritional strategy to aid BP management and CVD prevention.

Importantly, extensive research on the impact of these supplementations is needed and evidence of effects on BP is still minimal.

International perspective

Lack of adequately powered RCTs does not allow streamlined and efficient implementation process for the suggested intake of dietary supplements and nonprescription medications for BP optimization.

Micronutrient and bioactive intake personalization based on individual characteristics, mainly related to ethnicity and genetic background, is an envisaged strategy for the future of hypertension primary prevention.

Recommendation

1 Vitamins, minerals and micronutrients intake should be obtained as part of a healthy, nutrient-rich and balanced diet.
2 Health supplements are not a replacement for a balanced diet and are not recommended as a treatment to hypertension.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113MKBT4]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^111Dqbv2]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of refeeding syndrome outlines starvation‑related depletion and insulin‑mediated electrolyte shifts with critical consequences. As starvation becomes more profound, energy stores, vitamins, and intracellular electrolytes are depleted; when glucose appears in the bloodstream, insulin secretion rises, and in the presence of total‑body deficits of potassium, phosphorus, or magnesium, serum concentrations may drop as these minerals are drawn from serum into cells. These decreases may occur even if serum levels are initially normal, may be sudden and severe, and can be deadly in a starved or catabolic state. Phosphorus is the principal ion implicated in reports of RS, although potassium and magnesium may be equally important. Phosphate depletion can cause respiratory muscle dysfunction with progression to acute respiratory failure, decreased cardiac contractility, cardiac arrhythmias, and tissue hypoxia due to decreased 2,3‑diphosphoglycerate with increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity.

### Vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, and their interaction in relation to colorectal cancer recurrence and all-cause mortality [^112oU28B]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

A high calcium intake at diagnosis was inversely associated with all-cause mortality in CRC patients; however, after correcting for magnesium the HR for the association between calcium and all-cause mortality attenuated from 0.58 to 0.70. Results of previous studies suggest an inverse association between high postdiagnostic calcium intake and all-cause mortality in CRC survivors. However, these previous studies did not correct for magnesium intake. Although it seems that the association between calcium and mortality is partly caused by magnesium, it should be noted that magnesium and calcium intake are correlated (r = 0.6), thus the effect of magnesium and calcium can probably not be disentangled completely. Of note, albeit not statistically significantly, a high calcium intake appears to be associated with a lower risk of recurrence as well. Therefore, based on our data, we can carefully conclude that calcium is at least not harmful for CRC patients.

The lowest risk of all-cause mortality was found in patients who had both high vitamin D concentrations and a high magnesium intake. In addition, the association between vitamin D concentrations and all-cause mortality is only present in those with a high magnesium intake. This is in line with previous research in the general population, showing a stronger association between vitamin D concentrations and all-cause mortality in those with a higher magnesium intake. Thus, if the observed associations are causal, the presence of an adequate status of both nutrients is essential in lowering the risk of all-cause mortality. Considering the importance of magnesium for the enzymatic conversion of vitamin D into its active form, magnesium might be crucial in maintaining a sufficient vitamin D status. The active form of vitamin D is hypothesized to have beneficial effects on cancer prognosis. There are also indications that vitamin D influences CRC mortality by modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. In addition, magnesium deficiency is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Because vitamin D and magnesium are both suggested to influence systemic inflammation, it is tempting to speculate that vitamin D and magnesium contribute to a lowered inflammatory status via shared mechanisms, possibly resulting in better survival rates.

Vitamin D — screening in generally healthy adults: In healthy adults, we suggest against routine screening for 25(OH)D levels.

### Magnesium, vitamin D status and mortality: results from US national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2001 to 2006 and NHANES III [^1176rfs7]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The critical roles of magnesium in the synthesis of VDBP, PTH, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D may partially explain why the inverse associations between serum 25(OH)D and risk of total mortality and mortality due to colorectal cancer and CVD primarily existed among those with magnesium intake above the median. High magnesium may increase the availability of 1,25 (OH)2D through activating the synthesis of 25(OH)D and 1,25 (OH)2D and increasing the transfer to target tissues by elevating vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) (Figure 1). This explanation is also supported by the observation in previous clinical studies that magnesium supplementation substantially reversed the resistance to vitamin D treatment among magnesium-deficient patients.

Previous studies found PTH level was elevated when serum 25(OH)D was under 20 ng/ml. In the current study, we found magnesium intake was associated with a reduced risk of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency only among those in the highest or the lowest tertile of PTH. This finding is possible because magnesium plays an important role in PTH regulation. This finding is also supported by observations made in a study of 30 women with osteoporosis that were investigated for magnesium deficiency using a magnesium tolerance test. The subjects were divided into three groups: ten with vitamin D insufficiency (low vitamin D and raised PTH); ten with functional hypoparathyroidism (low vitamin D and low/low normal PTH); and ten who were vitamin D replete (normal vitamin D and normal PTH). All ten subjects with functional hypoparathyroidism were found to be magnesium deficient; five magnesium-deficient and five magnesium-insufficient patients were found in the subjects with vitamin D insufficiency, and only one magnesium-deficient and four magnesium-insufficient patients were found in the vitamin D replete group. Furthermore, intravenous magnesium infusion led to a significant rise in PTH in the group with functional hypoparathyroidism and a reduction in PTH in the subjects with vitamin D insufficiency.

### Social isolation, loneliness and low dietary micronutrient intake amongst older people in england [^112FRzHd]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points

Existing studies show that social isolation and loneliness are correlated with low fruit and vegetable consumption, and with a lower overall diet quality.
No previous study has focused on micronutrient intake.
In older adults in the UK, we found associations between social isolation and suboptimal intake of micronutrients: magnesium, potassium, vitamin B6, folate and vitamin C, adjusting for confounders.
No association was found between loneliness and micronutrient intake.
Low intake of micronutrients may be a mechanism through which social isolation increases risk of age-related health problems.

Normal serum values of total calcium in children

A decrease in serum albumin results in a higher proportion of total calcium existing in the ionized form. In instances of low albumin levels, despite a potential decrease in total calcium levels, the ionized calcium level may remain within the normal range. Additionally, calcium counteracts the actions of magnesium and potassium at the cell membrane. This ability allows it to be highly effective in addressing the consequences of both hypermagnesemia and hyperkalemia.

### How is vitamin D deficiency… [^115v6pA5]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The role vitamin D deficiency plays in the development of rickets and osteomalacia is established. 5 Osteomalacia is a relatively rare condition characterized by replacement of resorbed bone with unmineralized osteoid. It has various causes, including prolonged severe vitamin D deficiency; improvement over weeks to months is typically dramatic with vitamin D repletion. 6, 7 It is standard of care to ensure adequate exposure to vitamin D and calcium in patients with osteoporosis, 8 although trials of pharmacologic treatment of osteoporosis to prevent fracture have not evaluated the independent contribution of vitamin D. 9–12. 5 Persons with levels less than 12 ng per mL are at significant risk of bone disease, and
97. 5% of persons with levels higher than 20 ng per mL have adequate vitamin D for bone health. 5 For an individual, a specific value in the normal range may not reflect sufficiency.

For example, a value of 12 ng per mL will reflect adequate vitamin D for those with low biologic need, but it may be inadequate for those with a high biologic need. These values are not universally accepted. For instance, the 2011 Endocrine Society guideline defines vitamin D insufficiency as a level between 21 and 29 ng per mL, citing early biochemical studies showing increased calcium absorption and decreased parathyroid hormone levels up to a threshold of 30 ng per mL. 17, 24 although the harms of long-term supplementation are unknown. 5 The National Academy of Medicine considers a 25-OH-D level of 50 ng per mL as reflective of the safe upper tolerable intake. Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are the hallmarks of excess vitamin D exposure and can eventually lead to nephrolithiasis, soft tissue calcification, and renal and cardiovascular damage.

Vitamin D intoxication produces nonspecific symptoms that may include anorexia, weight loss, polyuria, and heart arrhythmias.
5. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Fatigue or Depression. A study of Women's Health Initiative trial participants showed that vitamin D deficiency was not associated with an increased rate of menopausal symptoms at baseline, 46 and daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D plus 1, 000 mg of calcium did not improve energy, sleep, or mood over six years of follow-up.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^1155z1gP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus criteria — adult refeeding syndrome (RS) risk identification specifies two tiers: Moderate Risk requires "2 Risk Criteria" while Significant Risk requires "1 Risk Criteria". Body mass index (BMI) thresholds are "16–18.5 kg/m²" for Moderate Risk and " < 16 kg/m²" for Significant Risk. Weight loss thresholds are "5% in 1 month" for Moderate Risk and "7.5% in 3 months or > 10% in 6 months" for Significant Risk. Caloric intake thresholds for Moderate Risk include "None or negligible oral intake for 5–6 days OR < 75% of estimated energy requirement for > 7 days during an acute illness or injury OR < 75% of estimated energy requirement for > 1 month", whereas Significant Risk includes "None or negligible oral intake for > 7 days OR < 50% of estimated energy requirement for > 5 days during an acute illness or injury OR < 50% of estimated energy requirement for > 1 month". Abnormal prefeeding electrolytes (potassium, phosphorus, or magnesium) are "Minimally low levels or normal current levels and recent low levels necessitating minimal or single-dose supplementation" for Moderate Risk versus "Moderately/significantly low levels or minimally low or normal levels and recent low levels necessitating significant or multiple-dose supplementation" for Significant Risk. Loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle mass require "Evidence of moderate loss" or "Evidence of mild or moderate loss" for Moderate Risk compared with "Evidence of severe loss" for Significant Risk, and higher-risk comorbidities are "Moderate disease" versus "Severe disease". A footnote cautions that "electrolytes may be normal despite total-body deficiency, which is believed to increase risk of refeeding syndrome".

### Magnesium intake, plasma C-peptide, and colorectal cancer incidence in US women: a 28-year follow-up study [^117BiaLJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

We calculated person-time for each participant from the date of baseline questionnaire return to the date of death, colorectal cancer diagnosis, or the end of follow-up (1 June 2008), whichever came first. We used a Cox proportional hazards regression model to calculate RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted simultaneously for age (in months) and year of questionnaire return. We observed no violation of the proportional hazard assumption based on the likelihood ratio test that compared the model with and without the interaction terms between magnesium intake and age or follow-up time.

To take advantage of the large number of cases and to examine relative extreme intake categories, we categorised energy-adjusted magnesium intakes into deciles based on the distribution in the study population. We assigned the median values of these categories and entered these values as continuous variables into the model to conduct trend tests. In addition to adjusting for age, in the multivariate models, we further adjusted for established non-dietary risk factors (models 2 and 3) and additional dietary factors (model 3 only, see Table 2 footnote for the list of these variables and their categorisations). We further conducted additional analyses in which we adjusted for multivitamin use, total intakes of zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, fibre, retinol, β -carotene, potassium, vitamin E, saturated fat, phosphorous, and glycemic load. Further adjustment of these factors, one at a time or simultaneously, did not materially alter the results and thus were not included in the final model. We modelled all covariates as time-varying variables to take into account potential changes over follow-up. To represent better long-term dietary intake and to minimise the impact of random measurement errors using dietary assessments, we calculated the cumulative average intakes of total and dietary magnesium intake. In addition, we analysed magnesium from supplemental sources using tertile categories because intake of supplemental magnesium was low in this study population (contributing to < 8% of total magnesium).

### Social isolation, loneliness and low dietary micronutrient intake amongst older people in england [^112NcuYk]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study of dietary micronutrient intake amongst older men and women in England demonstrated that consumption was below recommended levels in a substantial number of participants. Risk of low intake was associated with social isolation for five micronutrients — magnesium, potassium, folate, vitamins B6 and C — after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, total energy intake, education, marital status, smoking and physical activity. Estimates ranged from a 15%–23% increased odds of deficiency per unit increase on the social isolation scale. The relationship was somewhat more robust for older (≥ 65 years) than younger (50–64 years) participants, and were unchanged when dietary supplements, and impaired activities of daily living were taken into account. The pattern of results was the same when food insecurity was included as an additional covariate in a subset of respondents.

Striking numbers of respondents in this study had levels of vitamin and mineral intake below recommended levels, potentially placing them at increased risk for a range of adverse health outcomes. Whilst a large majority reported consuming sufficient vitamins B12 and E, ~10%–20% consumed insufficient iron and vitamins C and B6, and even higher proportions had low calcium, magnesium, potassium and folate in their diets. A comparison of the prevalence of inadequate micronutrients with that detailed in a systematic review of studies involving older community-dwelling people shows similar levels for folate and iron, but a lower proportion in the present study for calcium, magnesium and vitamins B6 and C. These variations relate in part to different criteria for adequate intakes; the thresholds used by ter Borg et al. were based on the Nordic Nutrition or US Institute of Medicine recommendations, whereas we used the UK SACN. Methods of dietary data collection are also relevant, with different studies using 24 h dietary recall, food frequency questionnaires and weighed records. The most relevant comparison for the present study is with UK Biobank because the same online 24 h recall instrument was used. The average intakes of micronutrients recorded in ELSA compare well with those recorded in UK Biobank.

### Management of a severe case of gitelman syndrome with poor response to standard treatment [^1142Nuz5]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal recessive distal renal tubular disorder caused by defective sodium chloride transporters. Biochemically, it presents with hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria. It is usually managed with oral potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman whose condition worsened during pregnancy; she became resistant to standard management after delivery of her second child. She was managed in a specialist metabolic clinic through a comprehensive approach including perseverance with oral potassium supplement, weekly intravenous potassium and magnesium infusion, correction of vitamin D level and the offering of appropriate dietary advice; this controlled the patient's symptoms and prevented repeated hospital admissions. In this case report, we illustrate a patient's presentation and diagnosis with Gitelman syndrome, discuss triggers of exacerbation, review the relevant literature in terms of differential diagnoses and provide practical advice on the management of difficult cases in a specialist clinic.

The individual study results show that the majority of reported nutrient intakes were significantly below both the UK RNI and US RDA for vitamin D, potassium and magnesium and below the US RDA for calcium, vitamin E, folate, phosphorous and iron. Zinc intakes reported as the mean intake over pregnancy were low whereas this was not the case in the studies reporting intakes in the second or third trimesters specifically.

Results of the pooled analyses however showed that only intake of vitamin D remained significantly below both the UK RNI and US RDA, and intakes of potassium below the US RDA. Sub-group analysis showed that micronutrient intake was lower in UK based studies than those based in the USA for all micronutrients with the exception of vitamin C, however vitamin D was the only micronutrient where the percentage of the DRV in UK based studies was below the UK RNI (21.4%, CI 0–63.5%) and US RDA (14.3%, CI 0–42.3%). Results of the pooled analysis of micronutrients are shown in Fig. 2. Detailed results of the sub-group analysis of nutrient intakes are available in Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 1: Table S3.

Fig. 2
Pooled weighted mean micronutrient intake compared to UK and US dietary reference values

Micronutrient analysis by stage of pregnancy showed that intake of vitamin D in the second (28% of the UK RNI, CI 26–30%) and third (31.2% of the UK RNI, CI 0–47%) trimesters was below recommendations; this was not the case for measures reported as a mean over pregnancy (54% of the UK RNI, CI 0–114.3%). In the third trimester the percentage of the US RDA represented by intakes of magnesium (19.9%, CI 20.4–98.6%) and potassium (62.8%, CI 32.5–93.1%) were also below recommendations.

### Verifying the nonreporting hemolysis index for potassium, phosphate, magnesium, AST, LDH, iron, CA 19–9, and vitamin D, using beckman coulter AU5800 and DxI800 automated analyzers [^114KoMuK]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolysis is a common reason for nonreporting results in biochemistry and is measured using the hemolysis index (HI), with nonreporting limits set for analytes by manufacturers.

Objective

To verify the nonreporting HI limit for potassium, phosphate, magnesium, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), iron, CA19-9, and vitamin D on the Beckman Coulter AU5800/DxI800 analyzers.

Method

Hemolysate was created from EDTA-lined tubes of whole blood using an osmotic shock procedure. The hemolysate underwent serial dilutions with saline and was spiked in paired serum. The delta changes in HI and analyte concentration were measured, assessed using regression analysis, and compared against calculated reference change values.

Results

A linear relationship between increasing HI and increasing analyte concentration (R2 > 0.9) was observed for potassium (y = 0.8864x), phosphate (y = 0.1079x), magnesium (y = 0.0678x), AST (y = 29.035x), and LDH (y = 350x). Increasing HI values did not have a linear effect on iron (y = -0.2544x), CA19-9 (y = 2.7019x), or vitamin D (y = 8.036x) concentrations.

Conclusion

The results from this experiment support increasing the HI nonreporting limit to 100 mg/dL for potassium; 200 mg/dL for magnesium; and 300 mg/dL for phosphate, CA19-9, and vitamin D. The iron assay is not affected by hemolysis as high as 500 mg/dL. The current HI nonreporting limit of 50 mg/dL is appropriate for LDH.

WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS:

This product is intended for use as directed by your healthcare provider. Do not share with others. Vitafol®Fe+must be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to soy.

Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur.

Iodine should be used with caution in patients with an overactive thyroid.

Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.

Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended.

Avoid Overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Medications for an overactive thyroid (anti-thyroid drugs) used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may lead to hypothyroidism.

Medications for hypertension used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may increase potassium levels in blood.

High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs; carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid. Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate.

Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones.

### Hypovitaminosis D and morbidity in critical illness: is there proof beyond reasonable doubt? [^116pYGqJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The observational studies available do not suggest causation, and hypovitaminosis D may be simply a marker of poor health, which predicts patients who would have poorer outcomes. Reports that supra-physiological levels of 25-hydroxy-D3 may be associated with adverse outcomes are also emerging. The only means to clarify the role for supplementation is to conduct appropriate dose-response studies followed by a high-quality placebo-controlled randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation in this vulnerable population. Vitamin D is inexpensive and, if it is shown to be beneficial, there is no barrier to rapid implementation into routine clinical practice worldwide.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^112fayVP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — electrolyte management during refeeding in at-risk adults — advises to "Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition" and to "Monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients. May be more frequent based on clinical picture". It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal". If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition", it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation", with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously".

### Dietary micronutrient adequacy and risk of multimorbidity in community-dwelling older adults [^115RPfy5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Multimorbidity refers to the coexistence of multiple chronic health conditions. The effect of nutritional adequacy on multimorbidity is mostly unknown.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the prospective association between dietary micronutrient adequacy and multimorbidity among community-dwelling older adults.

Methods

This cohort study included 1461 adults aged ≥ 65 y from the Seniors-ENRICA II cohort. Habitual diet was assessed at baseline (2015–2017) with a validated computerized diet history. The intakes of 10 micronutrients (calcium, magnesium, potassium, vitamins A, C, D, E, zinc, iodine, and folate) were expressed as percentages relative to the dietary reference intakes, with higher scores indicating greater adequacy. Dietary micronutrient adequacy was computed as the average of all the nutrient scores. Information on medical diagnosis was obtained from the electronic health records up to December 2021. Conditions were grouped into a comprehensive list of 60 categories and occurrence of multimorbidity was defined as having ≥ 6 chronic conditions. Analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for relevant confounders.

Results

The mean age was 71.0 y (SD: 4.2) and 57.8% of participants were males. During a median follow-up of 4.79 y, we documented 561 incident cases of multimorbidity. Participants in the highest (85.8%-97.7%) versus the lowest tertile (40.1%-78.7%) of dietary micronutrient adequacy had a low risk of multimorbidity [fully adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.75 (0.59–0.95); P-trend: 0.02]. A 1-SD increment in minerals and vitamins adequacy was associated with a low risk of multimorbidity, although estimates were attenuated after additional adjustment for the opposite subindex [minerals subindex: 0.86 (0.74–1.00); vitamins subindex: 0.89 (0.76–1.04)]. No differences were observed by strata of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

Conclusion

A high micronutrient index score was associated with low risk of multimorbidity. Improving the dietary micronutrient adequacy could prevent multimorbidity among older adults.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114jjzc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^115op6oZ]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical signs of magnesium deficiency

'… magnesium is essential for the normal metabolism of potassium and of calcium… the occurrence in clinical situations of otherwise unexplained hypokalemia and hypocalcemia should suggest the possibility of significant magnesium depletion'.

Among the most common laboratory signs of magnesium deficiency are low potassium and calcium levels, as well as low urine and/or faecal magnesium. The most common neurological side effect with magnesium depletion is the Trousseau sign; that is, 'To elicit the sign, a blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and held in place for 3 min. This will occlude the brachial artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient's hypocalcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP and PIP joints extend, and the fingers adduct'. Other signs of magnesium deficiency included tremor, fasciculations ('a brief spontaneous contraction that affects a small number of muscle fibres'., spontaneous carpopedal spasm (painful cramps of the muscles in your hands and feet) and generalised spasticity. Other clinical features of magnesium deficiency include mental disturbances such as depression, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, weakness, neuromuscular irritability (tremor), athetoid movements and convulsive seizures.

A full list of potential clinical and lab signs of magnesium deficiency are summarised in box 3 and box 4.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^11281BqL]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Magnesium deficiency has been found in 84% of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis diagnosed by low magnesium trabecular bone content and Thoren's magnesium load test. Among apparently healthy university students in Brazil, 42% were found to have subnormal magnesium status (based on plasma or erythrocyte magnesium levels). The average magnesium intake was only around 215 mg/day. Magnesium depletion has been found in 75% and 30.8% of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes based on serum and intracellular magnesium status, respectively.

Magnesium deficiency can be present despite normal serum magnesium levels. Approximately 20% of 381 unselected elderly men and women (most of them in their 80s) were found to have low erythrocyte potassium and magnesium levels. The authors of the study concluded: 'This study underlines the large prevalence of magnesium and potassium deficiencies in the elderly'. Another study concluded: 'The commonly designated low limit of the normal range… is below levels that exist in patients with marginal deficiencies that can predispose to development of pathologic findings, so that the prevalence and importance of this disease is insufficiently considered… It is a statistical error to use the confidence limits of the normal population as the exclusion limit for those with abnormal Mg status'. In other words, our normal range of serum magnesium is inaccurate and that serum magnesium levels at the lower end of normal likely suggest marginal magnesium deficiency. Indeed, 'The magnesium content of the plasma is an unreliable guide to body stores: muscle is a more accurate guide to the body content of this intracellular cation'.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^116HRU8J]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

Table 1 — Other recommendations for refeeding syndrome (RS) risk focus on electrolytes and fluids with specific cautions. Items include Restore circulatory volume, Check electrolyte levels with Electrolyte replacement to correct deficiencies and Monitor fluid balance, and Check potassium, magnesium, phosphorus. Guidance includes Do not discontinue feeding if electrolyte levels fall and When serum potassium, magnesium, or phosphorus levels are significantly low, feeding should not be advanced further until supplementation has occurred. Calculations should Consider all sources of calories and fluids in your calculations (including dextrose), and clinicians should Check baseline electrolytes (especially potassium, magnesium, phosphorus) and replace any low levels promptly. Fluid management notes Unless hemodynamically unstable, keep sodium-containing IV fluids to < 2 L/d initially in severely malnourished patients, such as those with anorexia nervosa, who may have a component of cardiomyopathy. Patients at high risk for RS should receive electrolytes substitution of lower than normal/in low normal range, and Prophylactic supplementation of electrolytes.

### Rethinking hypomagnesemia: diagnostic thresholds and metabolic implications in critical illness [^111qkvnm]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Taken together, these observations suggest that magnesium deficiency may not simply accompany metabolic failure but may actively contribute to it. Recognizing magnesium repletion as a fundamental element of metabolic support could help bridge the gap between biochemical correction and physiological recovery. A broader understanding of magnesium physiology, encompassing redistribution, diagnostic thresholds, and metabolic function, may facilitate earlier recognition and guide more context-sensitive supplementation. Timely magnesium replacement, even in patients with low-normal concentrations, could help restore mitochondrial efficiency, stabilize lactate dynamics, and support recovery from critical illness. A renewed focus on magnesium may therefore offer a simple and physiologically grounded opportunity worthy of further investigation to improve outcomes in the critically ill.

### Nutrition in clinical practice-the refeeding syndrome: illustrative cases and guidelines for prevention and treatment [^111T5o2x]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

The refeeding syndrome is a potentially lethal complication of refeeding in patients who are severely malnourished from whatever cause. Too rapid refeeding, particularly with carbohydrate may precipitate a number of metabolic and pathophysiological complications, which may adversely affect the cardiac, respiratory, haematological, hepatic and neuromuscular systems leading to clinical complications and even death. We aimed to review the development of the refeeding syndrome in a variety of situations and, from this and the literature, devise guidelines to prevent and treat the condition. We report seven cases illustrating different aspects of the refeeding syndrome and the measures used to treat it. The specific complications encountered, their physiological mechanisms, identification of patients at risk, and prevention and treatment are discussed. Each case developed one or more of the features of the refeeding syndrome including deficiencies and low plasma levels of potassium, phosphate, magnesium and thiamine combined with salt and water retention. These responded to specific interventions. In most cases, these abnormalities could have been anticipated and prevented. The main features of the refeeding syndrome are described with a protocol to anticipate, prevent and treat the condition in adults.

### Healthy eating tips | Nutrition… [^116igsEZ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Most people in the United States need to increase their intake of dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. This page includes a few quick and easy tips on how to make healthy dietary choices. Most people in the United States need to eat more foods with dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. At the same time, we need to consume less added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Here are some ways to get started. Increase calcium and vitamin D Calcium and vitamin D work together to promote optimal bone health. Our bodies can make vitamin D from sunshine. However, some people may have a hard time producing enough vitamin D. And too much sun exposure can increase the risk of skin cancer. Foods and beverages are often fortified with this essential nutrient. See food sources of calcium and vitamin D.

To increase calcium and vitamin D intake, try this:

- Drink a fortified dairy beverage with your meals.
- Add sardines to your lunch once a week.
- Canned salmon is another great option.
- Sardines and salmon with bones have more calcium than these products without bones.
- Canned salmon is another great option.
- Cook with spinach, collard greens, bok choy, mushrooms, and taro root.
- Look for foods that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D.
- Fortified foods may include soy beverages, soy yogurt, orange juice, and some whole-grain cereals.
- Just be sure they don't include added sugars.
- Fortified foods may include soy beverages, soy yogurt, orange juice, and some whole-grain cereals. Add more potassium Potassium helps the kidneys, heart, muscles and, nerves function properly. Not getting enough potassium can increase blood pressure, deplete calcium in bones, and increase the risk of kidney stones.

People with chronic kidney disease and people taking certain medications may have too much potassium in their blood. But most people in the United States need to consume more potassium. See food sources of potassium. To add more potassium, try this:

- Try new recipes that use beets, lima beans, or Swiss chard.
- Try a variety of drinks high in potassium.
- 100% prune, pomegranate, or orange juice.
- Fat-free milk and low-fat kefir.
- 100% prune, pomegranate, or orange juice.
- Have a banana as a snack.

WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS

Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur.

Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.

Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Avoid Overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children.

Low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets — safety and tolerability: Safety concerns "vary depending on the level of CHO restriction and the characteristics of individuals". With VLCHF/KDs, gastrointestinal complaints "are the most common adverse effects… experienced in the first few weeks", and some may develop "keto flu" "within 2 to 4 days", which "may last a few days to one week" and includes lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, poor sleep, and constipation. Other reported effects include "headache, muscle cramps, weakness, diarrhea, dehydration, hypoglycemia, increased levels of blood uric acid, and vitamin/mineral deficiencies". "Increased urination can lead to reduced levels of electrolytes, including sodium, magnesium, and potassium", with hypovolemia symptoms and medication-related dizziness. Management language on-page states: "Educating individuals to consume protein from whole foods vs supplements will promote an adequate intake of sodium, potassium, and magnesium", and "Ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake is essential to avoid symptoms of initiating a VLCHF/KD".

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^112EP3Qo]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency, as well as high BMI or obesity, are frequent and the (potential) consequences of both on health are overlapping. However, the precise contribution of a poor vitamin D status to obesity, its complications, and health in general are not well established.

The contribution of a poor vitamin D status to the health consequences of a high BMI or obesity is not known, but many consequences of both situations are overlapping. Indeed, all conditions known to be part of the metabolic syndrome are associated with a poor vitamin D status in both adults and adolescents. One of the most consistent associations is with type 2 diabetes. For example, low serum 25OHD levels (< 52.5 nmol/L)) are associated with a nearly twofold increased risk of fasting hyperglycemia or diabetes and a 1.5-fold increased risk of hypertension or hypertriglyceridemia. Such low 25OHD levels are also linked to a twofold increase in the overall prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. Longitudinal cohort studies, summarized in recent meta-analyses, have estimated an ∼40% risk reduction for incident diabetes in the highest vs the lowest category of blood serum 25OHD level. However, the observational nature of these studies precludes a definitive assessment of cause and effect because reverse causation or residual confounding cannot be excluded. Confounders are especially problematic in this area because blood 25OHD level is an excellent marker of good health. In relation to type 2 diabetes mellitus, higher serum 25OHD level is monotonically associated with a lower diabetes risk, suggesting no apparent threshold for benefit.

Vitamin D excess and intoxication — definitions and thresholds are outlined with specific serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)-D] levels. Individuals with 25(OH)-D levels of ≥ 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) are described as having vitamin D excess and as being at risk for intoxication, while some laboratories set an upper limit of normal at 200 nmol/L (80 ng/mL). Observational contexts note that sunbathers and lifeguards can have 25(OH)-D levels of > 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) without evidence of intoxication, and supplementation leading to 25(OH)-D levels of 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) is not associated with harmful effects. Conversely, hypercalcemia is definitely associated with 25(OH)-D levels of > 325 nmol/L (150 ng/mL).

### The impact of low serum and dialysate magnesium levels on clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients: a literature review [^113trMFi]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Given its physiological benefits in CKD pathophysiology and the range of negative consequences of deranged sMg levels, magnesium deserves greater awareness among clinicians. Few clinicians monitor their patients' sMg levels regularly, and even if detected, hypomagnesemia may not be considered a concern that requires an action unless it is significantly low. Therefore, since awareness is the first step to improving quality of care, it is suggested that sMg levels be checked every six months, especially when a low dMg of 0.25 mmol/L is employed. Ionized sMg is not measured in routine clinical practice and therefore, while implementing iMg levels into clinical practice may require further assessment and may not be possible, it may still deserve further consideration due to the importance of sMg for bodily functions and related clinical outcomes.

It is suggested that if sMg levels are low, this should be corrected to normal levels whenever possible. A magnesium-rich diet (i.e. spinach, whole grains, beans, nuts, avocado, seafood, etc.) may result in an undesirable load of potassium for dialysis patients, and thus may not be the therapeutic measure of choice. Peride et al. recommend the oral supplementation of 600 mg/day of magnesium, and the authors report the successful correction of hypomagnesemia by administering oral supplements without inducing hypermagnesemia.

Considering the already high pill burden of dialysis patients and the complexity of managing nutritional choices of the patients, increasing dMg concentrations may be the most convenient and effective way of correcting low sMg levels as it is not dependent on gastrointestinal absorption. Eisenman et al. successfully implemented this approach in their small group of hypomagnesemic patients. After discussing the consequences of hyper- and hypomagnesemia on the cardiovascular system and bone in a review, Alhosaini et al. recommended applying a dMg concentration of 0.5 mmol/L in general, with a minority of patients requiring a higher dMg concentration to maintain normal sMg levels. The authors advise against the routine use of dMg concentrations lower than 0.5 mmol/L, as magnesium will be lost to the dialysate, even if sMg levels are already low, resulting in magnesium depletion over time, especially in patients on proton pump inhibitors and those with a low intake.

### Relationships between hyperinsulinaemia, magnesium, vitamin D, thrombosis and COVID-19: rationale for clinical management [^115g7e7n]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for COVID-19 patients with poorer outcomes include pre-existing conditions: obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure, hypertension, low oxygen saturation capacity, cancer, elevated: ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer. A common denominator, hyperinsulinaemia, provides a plausible mechanism of action, underlying CVD, hypertension and strokes, all conditions typified with thrombi. The underlying science provides a theoretical management algorithm for the frontline practitioners. Vitamin D activation requires magnesium. Hyperinsulinaemia promotes: magnesium depletion via increased renal excretion, reduced intracellular levels, lowers vitamin D status via sequestration into adipocytes and hydroxylation activation inhibition. Hyperinsulinaemia mediates thrombi development via: fibrinolysis inhibition, anticoagulation production dysregulation, increasing reactive oxygen species, decreased antioxidant capacity via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion, haem oxidation and catabolism, producing carbon monoxide, increasing deep vein thrombosis risk and pulmonary emboli. Increased haem-synthesis demand upregulates carbon dioxide production, decreasing oxygen saturation capacity. Hyperinsulinaemia decreases cholesterol sulfurylation to cholesterol sulfate, as low vitamin D regulation due to magnesium depletion and/or vitamin D sequestration and/or diminished activation capacity decreases sulfotransferase enzyme SULT2B1b activity, consequently decreasing plasma membrane negative charge between red blood cells, platelets and endothelial cells, thus increasing agglutination and thrombosis. Patients with COVID-19 admitted with hyperglycaemia and/or hyperinsulinaemia should be placed on a restricted refined carbohydrate diet, with limited use of intravenous dextrose solutions. Degree/level of restriction is determined by serial testing of blood glucose, insulin and ketones. Supplemental magnesium, vitamin D and zinc should be administered. By implementing refined carbohydrate restriction, three primary risk factors, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and hypertension, that increase inflammation, coagulation and thrombosis risk are rapidly managed.

### Essential nutrient interactions: does low or suboptimal magnesium status interact… -publications… [^115NT5ju]. cdas.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential Nutrient Interactions: Does Low or Suboptimal Magnesium Status Interact with Vitamin D and/or Calcium Status. __Adv Nutr__. 2016 Jan; Volume 7: Pages 25–43
- Center for Magnesium Education and Research, Pahoa, HI; arosanoff@gmail. com.
- Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; and.
- Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. Although much is known about magnesium, its interactions with calcium and vitamin D are less well studied. Magnesium intake is low in populations who consume modern processed-food diets. Low magnesium intake is associated with chronic diseases of global concern, as is low vitamin D status. No simple, reliable biomarker for whole-body magnesium status is currently available, which makes clinical assessment and interpretation of human magnesium research difficult.

Between 1977 and 2012, US calcium intakes increased at a rate 2–2. 5 times that of magnesium intakes, resulting in a dietary calcium to magnesium intake ratio of > 3.
0. Calcium to magnesium ratios < 1. 7 and > 2. 8 can be detrimental, and optimal ratios may be ∼2.
0. Background calcium to magnesium ratios can affect studies of either mineral alone. For example, US studies showed benefits of high dietary or supplemental magnesium for CVD, whereas similar Chinese studies showed increased risks of CVD. Oral vitamin D is widely recommended in US age-sex groups with low dietary magnesium. Magnesium is a cofactor for vitamin D biosynthesis, transport, and activation; and vitamin D and magnesium studies both showed associations with several of the same chronic diseases. Research on possible magnesium and vitamin D interactions in these human diseases is currently rare.

Increasing calcium to magnesium intake ratios, coupled with calcium and vitamin D supplementation coincident with suboptimal magnesium intakes, may have unknown health implications. Interactions of low magnesium status with calcium and vitamin D, especially during supplementation, require further study.

### Vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, and their interaction in relation to colorectal cancer recurrence and all-cause mortality [^117GY9Mp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The present study had some limitations. First, we did not analyze concentrations of magnesium and calcium. Blood concentrations of these minerals are tightly regulated and < 1% of the total body magnesium and calcium is circulating, thus measuring magnesium and calcium blood concentrations would not likely have resulted in more information. Second, the number of events was relatively low in our study population (n = 155 for recurrence; n = 191 for mortality), which limits the power to detect statistically significant associations, especially in the interaction analyses. Nonetheless, a significant interaction between magnesium and vitamin D was observed for all-cause mortality. Third, it could be that participants of our study are relatively health conscious, which probably led to an attenuation of the real effect. Furthermore, we had no data available about the cause of death. Therefore, we were not able to perform analyses with disease-specific mortality as an outcome. Finally, results of this study can only be generalized to the Western population. The present study also had some important strengths. First, to the best of our knowledge this study was the first to investigate 25(OH)D 3 concentrations and magnesium and calcium intakes, individually and jointly, in relation to CRC recurrence and all-cause mortality. Second, we could investigate the influence of total magnesium and calcium intakes, because we obtained information about dietary as well as supplemental intakes. Finally, because of the availability of detailed data on diet and other clinical and lifestyle factors, we could adjust for the most relevant confounders, although residual confounding can never be fully excluded.

To conclude, we observed that 25(OH)D 3 and magnesium may work synergistically in decreasing the risk of all-cause mortality in CRC patients. Although our results should be confirmed in diet and lifestyle intervention studies, our findings could contribute to improving recommendations regarding magnesium and vitamin D intake for newly diagnosed CRC patients.

Consequences of magnesium deficiency

Hypertension

'Magnesium status has a direct effect upon the relaxation capability of vascular smooth muscle cells and the regulation of the cellular placement of other cations important to blood pressure - cellular sodium:potassium (Na:K) ratio and intracellular calcium (iCa(2+)). As a result, nutritional magnesium has both direct and indirect impacts on the regulation of blood pressure and therefore on the occurrence of hypertension'.

It must be remembered that there is magnesium-ATP-driven sodium-potassium pump and calcium pump. Magnesium deficiency leads to dysfunction of the Na-K-ATPase depleting intracellular K and increasing intracellular sodium and calcium in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. This can cause vasoconstriction of venous smooth muscles and arteries causing hypertension. Magnesium deficiency may also predispose to an increased response to vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and catecholamines.

Many patients with hypertension are treated with thiazide and loop diuretics, both of which deplete the body of magnesium, and giving patients with hypertension who are receiving long-term thiazide diuretics oral magnesium supplementation significantly reduces blood pressure. In fact, the high intracellular calcium induced by magnesium deficiency may induce both insulin resistance and hypertension. A meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in normotensive and hypertensive adults found that 368 mg/day of magnesium for a median of 3 months significantly reduces systolic blood pressure by 2.00 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.78 mm Hg. In fact, a meta-analysis of seven studies encompassing 135 patients with hypertension on antihypertensive medications with a mean starting blood pressure > 155 mm Hg found that magnesium supplementation reduced blood pressure by −18.7/–10.9 mm Hg. Another meta-analysis of 22 trials using a mean dose of 410 mg of magnesium found a significant reduction in systolic (3–4 mm Hg) and diastolic (2–3 mm Hg) blood pressure. The effect on blood pressure was greater when magnesium doses > 370 mg/day were used.

Low magnesium levels can promote endothelial cell dysfunction, potentially increasing the risk of thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Magnesium deficiency also promotes a proatherogenic phenotype in endothelial cells. Hypomagnesaemia can impair the release of nitric oxide from the coronary endothelium, while magnesium therapy can improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease. Since nitric oxide is both a vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, this makes magnesium supplementation a promising therapy in the treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease. Indeed, magnesium therapy may enhance prostacyclin release from the vascular wall.

### Is there a relationship between sleep quality, dietary intake and weight gain in Turkish pregnant women? [^1177zWcR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to physiological and hormonal changes during pregnancy, vitamin and mineral deficiencies significantly impact sleep duration and quality. Studies have reported that nutritional factors, particularly micronutrient deficiencies, play a key role in the development of various sleep disorders during this period, even in women with no prior history of sleep disturbances. It is important to note that only a limited number of studies have examined the relationship between micronutrient intake and sleep quality during pregnancy. A systematic review that included various age groups found that sleep duration was positively correlated with iron, zinc, and magnesium levels, while negatively correlated with copper, potassium, and vitamin B 12 levels. Increased intake of biotin, B vitamins, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and manganese during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy in New Zealand was associated with a decrease in sleep duration. Our findings revealed that zinc intake was positively associated with sleep duration, while calcium and copper intake were positively associated with sleep disturbance. Studies examining the relationship between micronutrient intake and sleep quality during pregnancy are needed. Additionally, differences in the methods used to assess nutrition and sleep status, as well as variations in dietary culture and participant characteristics, may explain the discrepancies between studies.

Our study has several limitations. The limited sample size across all three trimesters hindered a detailed analysis of complex relationships. Additionally, the cross-sectional design prevents the establishment of causal relationships. The self-reported assessment of sleep quality using the PSQI–a subjective scale–carries the risk of not accurately reflecting participants' sleep experiences, which may lead to misreporting. However, the PSQI has been recognized in literature as a valid and reliable scale for assessing sleep quality. Additionally, the fact that 53.3% of the pregnant women had more than one child may influence the interpretation of sleep data, which could be considered a limitation of the study. Data were collected through a survey. The presence of an experienced researcher during survey administration aimed to minimize potential biases. Additionally, the simultaneous assessment of sleep and dietary intake may limit our ability to fully explore the potential interaction between these two variables. To minimize errors in dietary intake and accurately estimate usual intake, 3-day food consumption records were collected. Participants received training from the research dietitian before completing the dietary records.
