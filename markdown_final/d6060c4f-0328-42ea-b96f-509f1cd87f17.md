## Question

Can a person with cirrhosis take Lopressor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a person with cirrhosis can take Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate), and if so, how to dose, monitor, and reconcile this with portal hypertension management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and hepatic metabolism of metoprolol. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about hepatic impairment. Next, I will review guideline positions on beta-blockers in cirrhosis, especially the distinction between cardioselective and nonselective agents. After that, I need to check dosing adjustments, monitoring, and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, indication-specific recommendation and a concise bottom line with safety caveats.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its disposition. Metoprolol tartrate is a beta-1 selective blocker primarily cleared by hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6, so impaired hepatic function predictably increases exposure and can prolong half-life, which is why dose reduction and slow titration are advised in hepatic impairment [^114G4mmc] [^115dZM3w].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory guidance. Multiple FDA sources consistently advise that in patients with hepatic impairment of any severity, metoprolol should be started at a lower dose than usual and titrated slowly, with attention to clinical response and, when available, serum concentrations, because blood levels are likely to increase substantially when hepatic function is poor [^114G4mmc] [^112uFJN6] [^116vongD] [^115bvhCb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about portal hypertension indications. I initially thought metoprolol might be appropriate for variceal bleeding prophylaxis because it is a beta-blocker, but wait, I should double-check the mechanism. Nonselective beta-blockers (propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol) reduce portal pressure via beta-1 (cardiac output) and beta-2 (splanchnic vasodilation) blockade; metoprolol's beta-1 selectivity means it lacks the beta-2–mediated splanchnic vasoconstriction needed for portal pressure reduction, so it is not recommended for primary or secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^116EPHyu] [^113Y7dEs] [^111iDC8x].

> I need to check the comparative data. Carvedilol, with added alpha-1 blockade and nitric oxide–mediated effects, achieves greater HVPG reduction than traditional NSBBs and is preferred in compensated cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension; metoprolol has not demonstrated comparable portal pressure effects and is not a substitute for NSBBs in this context [^116EPHyu] [^115KQjya] [^112MuHk1].

> Next, I should review dosing strategy when metoprolol is indicated for cardiovascular reasons in cirrhosis. Let me think about practical starting doses. For hypertension or angina, typical oral metoprolol tartrate doses range from 50–300 mg/day in divided doses; in hepatic impairment, a conservative approach is to start at about half the usual starting dose (for example, 12.5–25 mg twice daily) and titrate slowly every 1–2 weeks based on heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms, with tighter monitoring early in therapy [^113WfUdP] [^114G4mmc] [^115dZM3w].

> I should confirm monitoring parameters and thresholds. I need to ensure we track resting heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms of hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, fatigue, and worsening edema or dyspnea; in decompensated cirrhosis or when systolic blood pressure is borderline, I should be cautious and consider holding or reducing the dose if SBP approaches or falls below 90 mmHg, aligning with guidance for NSBBs in advanced disease where hemodynamic vulnerability is common [^112ARDiE] [^112kBg3j].

> But wait, what about drug interactions that could amplify exposure or bradycardia risk. I should double-check for CYP2D6 inhibitors and other negative chronotropes. CYP2D6 inhibitors like paroxetine or fluoxetine can raise metoprolol levels; hydralazine can increase metoprolol exposure by roughly 30–50% in some settings; and combining with non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block, so I need to avoid or use the lowest effective doses with close monitoring if combinations are necessary [^114QKbgp] [^113WfUdP].

> Let me consider special situations. In compensated cirrhosis without clinically significant portal hypertension, metoprolol can be used for standard cardiovascular indications with hepatic dose adjustments. In decompensated cirrhosis with refractory ascites or systemic circulatory dysfunction, I should be particularly conservative with beta-blockade overall and prioritize hemodynamic stability, recognizing that NSBBs, not metoprolol, are the agents with portal pressure benefit when indicated [^116EPHyu] [^112ARDiE].

> I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, a person with cirrhosis can take Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate) when there is a cardiovascular indication such as hypertension, angina, atrial fibrillation rate control, or post–myocardial infarction care, but I need to start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for hypotension, bradycardia, and drug interactions; metoprolol should not be used for portal hypertension or variceal bleeding prophylaxis because it lacks the nonselective beta-2 effects required to lower portal pressure, where carvedilol or traditional NSBBs are preferred when indicated [^114G4mmc] [^116EPHyu] [^113Y7dEs].

---

Patients with cirrhosis can take Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate) when clinically indicated, but **start at a lower dose and titrate slowly** due to reduced hepatic clearance and higher drug exposure [^114G4mmc] [^115dZM3w]. Monitor closely for bradycardia, hypotension, and worsening hepatic encephalopathy or renal function, and adjust the dose as needed [^111ijHcE]. Metoprolol is not first-line for portal hypertension; **prefer nonselective beta-blockers** (propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol) for variceal bleeding prophylaxis [^113Y7dEs] [^116EPHyu]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal to prevent rebound hypertension or ischemia [^1163VZ6a].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of metoprolol in cirrhosis

Metoprolol is extensively metabolized by the liver via CYP2D6; **impaired hepatic function increases exposure and half-life**, necessitating dose adjustments [^114G4mmc] [^115dZM3w].

| **Parameter** | **Normal hepatic function** | **Cirrhosis (compensated)** | **Cirrhosis (decompensated)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bioavailability | ~50% | Increased (~60–70%) | Significantly increased (> 80%) |
| Half-life | 3–7 hours | Prolonged (7–12 hours) | Markedly prolonged (> 12 hours) |
| Clearance | Normal | Reduced (~30–50%) | Significantly reduced (> 50%) |

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

### Dosing adjustments

Start low and titrate slowly — begin at **25–50% of the usual dose** and titrate cautiously based on heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical response [^114G4mmc] [^115dZM3w]. Monitor for adverse effects — watch for bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness, and signs of hepatic encephalopathy or renal dysfunction [^115ntKMP] [^111ijHcE].

---

### Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Bradycardia and hypotension**: Common due to increased exposure; monitor closely [^115dZM3w].
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Beta-blockers may worsen encephalopathy in advanced cirrhosis; use caution [^notfound].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Monitor renal function, especially in decompensated cirrhosis or refractory ascites [^112ARDiE].
- **Masking of hypoglycemia**: Use caution in diabetic patients or those with poor nutritional status [^114yGm7p].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Portal hypertension**: Nonselective beta-blockers (propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol) are preferred for variceal bleeding prophylaxis; metoprolol is not first-line due to beta-1 selectivity [^113Y7dEs] [^116xQDHR] [^112PwC64].
- **Cardiovascular indications**: Metoprolol is appropriate for hypertension, angina, or arrhythmias in cirrhosis, with careful dosing and monitoring [^113WfUdP].
- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: Use caution; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if hypotension, renal dysfunction, or encephalopathy occurs [^112ARDiE].

---

## Alternative beta-blockers

- **Carvedilol**: Preferred for portal hypertension due to nonselective beta and alpha-1 blockade; more effective in reducing hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) [^116EPHyu].
- **Propranolol and nadolol**: Traditional nonselective beta-blockers for variceal bleeding prophylaxis [^113Y7dEs].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Regularly assess heart rate and blood pressure during titration and maintenance [^111Lzgbn].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Periodic liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrolytes.
- **Clinical assessment**: Watch for signs of hepatic encephalopathy, worsening ascites, or renal dysfunction [^112ARDiE].

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients with cirrhosis can receive Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate) when clinically indicated, but **start at a lower dose and titrate slowly** due to increased exposure and prolonged half-life [^114G4mmc] [^115dZM3w]. Monitor closely for bradycardia, hypotension, and worsening hepatic or renal function, and adjust therapy as needed [^notfound]. For portal hypertension, prefer nonselective beta-blockers (propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol); metoprolol is not first-line for variceal bleeding prophylaxis [^113Y7dEs] [^116xQDHR]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal to prevent rebound hypertension or ischemia [^1163VZ6a].

Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions

While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.

Information for Patients

Advise patients to take metoprolol tartrate regularly and continuously, as directed, with or immediately following meals. If a dose should be missed, the patient should take only the next scheduled dose (without doubling it). Patients should not discontinue metoprolol tartrate without consulting the physician.

Advise patients (1) to avoid operating automobiles and machinery or engaging in other tasks requiring alertness until the patient's response to therapy with metoprolol tartrate has been determined; (2) to contact the physician if any difficulty in breathing occurs; (3) to inform the physician or dentist before any type of surgery that he or she is taking metoprolol tartrate.

Drug Interactions

Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol tartrate plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^111g3km7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In other studies, verapamil did not generally induce significant negative inotropic, chronotropic, or dromotropic effects in patients with preserved left ventricular function receiving low or moderate doses of propranolol (less than or equal to 320 mg/day); in some patients, however, combined therapy did produce such effects. Therefore, if combined therapy is used, close surveillance of clinical status should be carried out. Combined therapy should usually be avoided in patients with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities and those with depressed left ventricular function.

Asymptomatic bradycardia (36 beats/min) with a wandering atrial pacemaker has been observed in a patient receiving concomitant timolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) eyedrops and oral verapamil.

A decrease in metoprolol and propranolol clearance has been observed when either drug is administered concomitantly with verapamil. A variable effect has been seen when verapamil and atenolol were given together.

Digitalis: Clinical use of verapamil in digitalized patients has shown the combination to be well tolerated if digoxin doses are properly adjusted. However, chronic verapamil treatment can increase serum digoxin levels by 50% to 75% during the first week of therapy, and this can result in digitalis toxicity. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, the influence of verapamil on digoxin kinetics is magnified. Verapamil may reduce total body clearance and extrarenal clearance of digitoxin by 27% and 29%, respectively. Maintenance and digitalization doses should be reduced when verapamil is administered, and the patient should be reassessed to avoid over-or under-digitalization. Whenever over-digitalization is suspected, the daily dose of digitalis should be reduced or temporarily discontinued. On discontinuation of verapamil hydrochloride use, the patient should be reassessed to avoid under-digitalization.

### Carvedilol for prevention of variceal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QgN3d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are used for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of carvedilol for primary or secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and gray literature sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carvedilol with placebo or any active intervention. We synthesized data using random effects models. We summarized the strength of evidence using GRADE criteria.

Results

We included 13 trials with 1598 patients. Carvedilol was as efficacious as endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) (4 RCTs, risk ratio [RR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–1.49) or propranolol (3 RCTs, RR 0.76, 95%CI 0.27–2.14) for primary prevention of variceal bleeding. Likewise, carvedilol was as efficacious as EVL (3 RCTs, RR 1.10, 95%CI 0.75–1.61), non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate (2 RCTs, RR 1.02, 95%CI 0.70–1.51) or propranolol (2 RCTs, RR 0.39, 95%CI 0.15–1.03) for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding. Carvedilol was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared to EVL (3 RCTs, RR 0.51, 95%CI 0.33–0.79). There was no difference in any other efficacy outcome. Finally, there were no significant differences in the safety profiles compared with EVL and NSBBs. Our confidence in the effect estimates for all outcomes was very low.

Conclusion

Carvedilol is as efficacious and safe as standard-of-care interventions for the primary and secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.

Prevention of first variceal hemorrhage in patients with medium/large esophageal varices — treatment selection — meta-analyses found a beneficial effect of nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) versus no therapy/placebo, and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) was associated with lower rates of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and variceal hemorrhage without mortality differences; however, this EVL benefit was not confirmed in subgroup analyses limited to seven trials or to 12 fully published studies, so it has been recommended, by consensus, that either NSBBs (propranolol, nadolol) or EVL can be used, with carvedilol added to the NSBB options based on two trials showing greater or comparable efficacy.

Variceal bleeding

The protective effects of NSBBs in preventing variceal haemorrhage are known to be mediated by several mechanisms, including decreased cardiac output and splanchnic vasoconstriction — the classic pathways leading to a reduction in portal pressure. Patients who reach these objectives are usually classified as 'responders'. Nevertheless other NSBB effects are thought to be essential even in classic NSBB non-responders, such as a decrease in azygous or collateral blood flow and a reduction in variceal pressure. In spite of these expected benefits, the size of varices must be considered before deciding treatment. Qi et al conducted a meta-analysis and concluded that NSBBs should not be recommended for patients with no or small varices. The study included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NSBBs (propranolol, timolol and nadolol) with placebo. The NSBBs did not show any significant benefits in terms of preventing the development of large varices, decreasing the incidence of first bleeding, or improving survival. In contrast, they found a significantly higher incidence of adverse events in the NSBBs group compared with the placebo group. Despite the limitations (limited number of studies, small sample sizes and high rates of patients lost to follow-up), it is reasonable to accept Qi et al 's contraindication as being correct. On the other hand, some recent trial data have suggested that carvedilol delays the progression of small varices with no adverse effects in two similar baseline arms. In a very recent RCT, Bhardwaj et al showed that carvedilol was effective in delaying the progression from small-to-large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis compared with placebo, despite maintaining a modest 8–10% portal pressure reduction over a long period (24 months of follow-up). There were no deaths related to variceal bleeding or liver disease in either of the groups, reaffirming the relative safety of the long-term use of carvedilol in this subset of patients with cirrhosis. This again raises the question as to which NSBB-treated patients should begin treatment and with what variceal sizes.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^116xQDHR]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) and screening in decompensated cirrhosis — Patients with decompensated cirrhosis not taking NSBBs who have never bled from varices should undergo annual endoscopic screening. If high-risk varices are detected, NSBBs or endoscopic band ligation are recommended; preference is given to NSBBs (including carvedilol) because of benefits beyond prevention of variceal hemorrhage. NSBBs should be dose reduced or discontinued in patients who develop persistently low systolic arterial pressure < 90 mm Hg or severe adverse effects, and NSBB discontinuation should prompt endoscopic evaluation for presence of high-risk varices requiring band ligation.

### Primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding: β-blockers, endoscopic ligation, or both? [^115jUTbN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the complications of cirrhosis that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. It is recommended that all patients with cirrhosis be screened for gastroesophageal varices and those with large varices should be offered primary prophylaxis. Nonselective beta-blockers (nadolol or propranolol) are the treatment of choice for primary prophylaxis but there are a number of limitations to their use. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of variceal band ligation (VBL) in providing primary prophylaxis, either in comparison to no treatment or to beta-blockers. VBL is very effective in preventing the initial bleed when compared to no treatment, but it is not superior to beta-blockers. In this issue of the journal the effect of beta-blockers on bleeding in patients undergoing VBL is examined and no benefit compared to VBL alone is shown. Thus, patients with large varices should be treated with beta-blockers and VBL should be offered to those cirrhotics who are unable to take beta-blockers. Further study is required to determine if VBL in combination with beta-blockers is more effective than the beta-blockers alone.

Concluding remarks

Despite some debate about the relative benefit of NSBB in patients with refractory ascites, they are still considered the "aspirin of hepatologists", both due to their hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic effects. The distinction of hemodynamic responders and non-responders does not fully take into account the complexity of the effects of this class of drugs, which represents one of the most frequently used in patients with cirrhosis over the last thirty years.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of variceal hemorrhage, secondary prevention, AASLD 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that refractory ascites and SBP are not absolute contraindications for treatment with nonselective β-blockers. Avoid using high doses of nonselective β-blockers (> 160 mg/day of propranolol or > 80 mg/day of nadolol) in these patients.

### Selection of β-blocker in patients with cirrhosis and acute myocardial infarction: a 13-year nationwide population-based study in Asia [^116Ua9ic]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Study Patients

By searching electronic medical records from the NHIRD between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2013, we retrieved patients with a principal diagnosis of AMI admission. We further identified patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis (2 consecutive outpatient diagnoses or 1 inpatient diagnosis). The diagnoses of AMI and liver cirrhosis in NHIRD have both been validated against hospital electronic medical records in previous studies, with AMI and liver cirrhosis having positive predictive values of 88% and 100%, respectively. 12, 13 The date of discharge from the index admission was defined as the index date. Patients who were < 20 years old, had experienced previous AMI, or had a contraindication to the use of a β‐blocker such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or atrioventricular conduction disease without pacemaker implantation were excluded. In addition, patients who died during the index admission, follow‐up < 6 months, medication possession ratio of either β 1 ‐selective blocker or nonselective β‐blocker < 80% (β 1 ‐selective blockers include bisoprolol, metoprolol, atenolol; nonselective β‐blockers include carvedilolol, propranolol) and switching between the 2 kinds of β‐blockers were excluded (Figure 1). The remaining patients using β 1 ‐selective blockers and nonselective β‐blockers were propensity score matched in the categories of age, sex, comorbidity, hospital level, coronary intervention at the index admission, post‐AMI medication, and the index date (Table 1). In addition, liver cirrhosis–related clinical characteristics of the patients were also propensity score matched in the variables of disease leading to cirrhosis (alcohol, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus), gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma, complication of cirrhosis, severity of cirrhosis, and catastrophic illness certificate (Table 2).

### Beta blockers and cirrhosis, 2016 [^113E2V8Q]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

To date, non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of portal hypertension. During the last years, our understanding of the potential benefits of early initiation of NSBB treatment, their effects beyond the prevention of variceal bleeding (i.e., their non-hemodyamic effects), as well as potential detrimental effects in patients with advanced disease has continuously evolved. In addition, we have learned that not all NSBBs are equal. Due to its additional anti-α1-adrenergic activity, carvedilol has been shown to be more potent in decreasing portal pressure, but might lead to more pronounced decreases in systemic arterial pressure, when compared to conventional NSBBs. It might be particularly beneficial in 'early' portal hypertension, when potential detrimental effects on systemic hemodynamics are less critical. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the use of carvedilol or high NSBB doses should be carefully scrutinized in patients with severe or refractory ascites. Our review summarizes the current knowledge on the use of NSBBs for preventing variceal bleeding and other decompensating events and provides guidance for their safe use in hemodynamically 'vulnerable' patient populations. Finally, we also highlight areas for further research.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of variceal hemorrhage, gastric varices, BSG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider initiating nonselective β-blockers for primary prophylaxis in selected high-risk patients with large gastroesophageal varices type 2 after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgment.

### Selection of β-blocker in patients with cirrhosis and acute myocardial infarction: a 13-year nationwide population-based study in Asia [^115PNfsR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In previous studies β‐blockers have been shown to be effective in the clinical therapy of patients with heart failure, but only bisoprolol, metoprolol, and carvedilol had evidence from large randomized trials. 20, 21, 22 Some reports have noted that β 1 ‐selective blockers are slightly more effective in terms of antihypertensive action than the nonselective blockers. There were data from an early investigation with the β 2 ‐selective blocker ICI 188 551 that blocking of β 2 receptors does not offer the antihypertensive effect of β‐blockade 23; in fact, there was a greater rise in blood pressure due to blocking its β 2 vasodilating effect. 24 Blocking of β 2 receptors by use of nonselective β‐blockers may antagonize the slightly vasodilating effect of 2‐ to 3–mm Hg greater fall in blood pressure observed with blocking at β 1 receptors. 25 β‐Blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are observed to show reduced clinical benefits in patients after AMI; therefore, these drugs should be avoided in this situation. 26 And in this study, our findings supported the pharmacological characteristics of these β‐blockers.

In summary, this is the first study to directly compare β 1 ‐selective blockers and nonselective β‐blockers in patients with cirrhosis and AMI. Our study suggested lower risks of MACCE in patients at 2‐year follow‐up on selective β 1 ‐blockers compared with nonselective β‐blockers. However, there was no difference of all‐cause mortality between these 2 groups.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112kBg3j]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) in decompensated cirrhosis with refractory ascites or after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis — current observational evidence does not support a harmful effect in most patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and in these patients the dose should be carefully titrated; in refractory ascites or SBP, high doses should be avoided and the dose should be reduced or discontinued with severe circulatory dysfunction such as severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L), or unexplained deterioration in renal function. NSBBs might be reintroduced after correction of renal function/ circulatory state, and refractory ascites and SBP are not absolute contraindications for treatment with NSBBs; in these patients, high doses of NSBBs (over 160 mg/day of propranolol or over 80 mg/day of nadolol) should be avoided, given that they might be associated with worse outcomes.

### Metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor) [^114yGm7p]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of metoprolol tartrate PO (also known as Lopressor):
- **Bronchospasm**: use caution in patients with bronchospastic disease. Use the lowest possible dose. Consider administering concomitant β-2 agonists.
- **Exacerbation of arterial insufficiency**: use caution in patients with PAD.
- **Exacerbation of HF**: use caution when up-titrating metoprolol in patients with HF. Increase diuretics and ensure clinical stability before up-titration.
- **Hypertensive crisis**: use caution in patients with pheochromocytoma. Administer in combination with an α-blocker and only after α-blockage has been initiated.
- **Mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism**: use caution in patients with thyroid disease.
- **Mask symptoms of hypoglycemia**: use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus or patients who are fasting (surgery, not eating regularly, or vomiting).
- **Thyroid storm**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients with thyroid disease suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^116EPHyu]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Nonselective beta-blockers for portal hypertension — the beneficial effects of NSBBs in PH derive from their ability to decrease portal pressure through a reduction in portal and collateral blood flow, achieved by decreased cardiac output (β-1 blockade) and splanchnic arterial vasoconstriction (β-2 blockade). Carvedilol additionally exerts intrinsic anti-alpha-1-adrenergic activity and facilitates the release of nitric oxide, induces intrahepatic vasodilation further reducing portal pressure, allows for a significantly more pronounced decrease in HVPG than traditional NSBBs (such as propranolol and nadolol), and achieves a marked reduction in HVPG at low doses without requiring titration based on resting heart rate.

### Nonselective β-blockers and survival in patients with cirrhosis and ascites: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114cYmkN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Nonselective β-blockers (NSBBs), given to reduce the risk of variceal bleeding, have been associated with increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites in some, but not all, studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of NSBBs on all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases through January 2015, supplemented with a manual search. Trial-specific risk ratios (RRs) were pooled using the random-effects model.

Results

Our analysis included 3 randomized control trials and 8 observational studies of propranolol, carvedilol, nadolol, and metoprolol, reporting 1206 deaths among 3145 patients with ascites. The control groups received other interventions to prevent variceal bleeding. NSBB use was not associated with increased all-cause mortality in all patients with ascites (RR, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–1.35); nonrefractory ascites alone (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.50–1.82), or refractory ascites alone (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.57–1.61). Results were similar in randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Use of NSBBs was not associated with increased mortality at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Overall, the included studies had a medium to high risk of bias, except for 3 clinical trials in which the risk of biased was determined to be low.

Conclusions

The use of NSBBs was not associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and ascites or refractory ascites. Certainty in the available estimates is low; a randomized trial of only patients with ascites is needed to answer this question. This meta-analysis does not support the position that NSBBs routinely be withheld from patients with ascites.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol) [^116vongD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In worldwide clinical trials of metoprolol tartrate injection in myocardial infarction, where approximately 478 patients were over 65 years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial infarction has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals taking metoprolol tartrate injection cannot be categorically ruled out. Therefore, in general, it is recommended that dosing proceed with caution in this population.

8.6	Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with metoprolol in patients with hepatic impairment. Because metoprolol is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication.

### Use of nonselective β-blockers in patients with end-stage liver disease and select complications [^117LpFMf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the literature and recommendations for nonselective β-blockers (NSBBs) in the setting of variceal bleeding prophylaxis and decompensated liver disease. Data Sources: Literature search of MEDLINE was performed (1988 to October 2019) using the following search terms: cirrhosis, advanced cirrhosis, β-blocker, decompensation, prophylaxis. Abstracts, peer-reviewed publications, clinical practice guidelines, and product monographs were reviewed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant English language studies and those conducted in humans were considered for analysis and inclusion. Data Synthesis: Evidence that suggests that NSBBs are harmful in advanced cirrhosis is overshadowed by confounding variables and small patient populations. The majority of the available evidence suggests neutral or beneficial effects on mortality with continuation of NSBBs despite liver disease progression. Based on the available literature, guidelines, and expert consensuses, NSBBs can be considered within this patient population and may have a positive impact on the majority of these patients. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review summarizes current place in therapy for NSBBs in the setting of cirrhosis and variceal bleeding prophylaxis. It also includes a discussion of the literature for use of NSBBs within the setting of different acute decompensations in which the data and recommendations for use are less clear. Conclusions: Recent evidence shows neutral or positive results for NSBB use in particular decompensation subgroups, which suggests that NSBBs can be used cautiously with close monitoring in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Questions still remain regarding optimal agent and dose and whether agents can be safely restarted after an acute decompensation episode.

### Metoprolol tartrate [^112zGjsq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Metoprolol tartrate in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

In worldwide clinical trials of Metoprolol tartrate in myocardial infarction, where approximately 478 patients were over 65years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial infarction has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with Metoprolol tartrate in patients with hepatic impairment. Because Metoprolol tartrate is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

8.7 Renal Impairment

The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. No reduction in dosage is needed in patients with chronic renal failure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Beta-blockers in the era of precision medicine in patients with cirrhosis [^113f34im]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

For decades, non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) have been the standard of care for the primary and secondary prevention of bleeding from oesophageal varices. However, several questions regarding the best clinical use of NSBBs remain unanswered and new data continue to emerge. Herein, we aim to delineate the therapeutic window of NSBBs in cirrhosis from a more individualised perspective. We address the current controversy of widening the therapeutic window and prescribing NSBBs to all patients with clinically significant portal hypertension. Although transient elastography is useful to rule-in clinically significant portal hypertension, we lack robust data supporting the use of NSBBs in patients without varices. While most data are based on propranolol, accumulating evidence suggests that carvedilol is superior and should be the first-line treatment until the decompensated stage. The clinical risk-to-benefit ratio appears to deteriorate in advanced decompensated stages and the risk of harm is high in patients with refractory ascites, low blood pressure and renal impairment, which clinically define closure of the therapeutic window. We also critically review non-invasive surrogates and biomarkers for predicting the haemodynamic response to NSBBs and confirm that the absence of reliable non-invasive methods is one of the main challenges facing the field.

### Isosorbide mononitrate in the prevention of first variceal bleed in patients who cannot receive β-blockers [^111pUwh5]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Nonselective beta-blockers (beta-blockers) are very effective in preventing first variceal bleeding (FVB) in patients with cirrhosis. However, 15%-25% of patients have contraindications or develop severe side effects precluding its use. The present study evaluates whether isosorbide-5-mononitrate (Is-MN) effectively prevents variceal bleeding in patients with contraindications or who could not tolerate beta-blockers.

Methods

One hundred thirty-three consecutive cirrhotic patients with gastro-esophageal varices and contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers were included in a multicenter, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial. Sixty-seven were randomized to receive Is-MN, and 66 to receive placebo.

Results

There were no significant differences in the 1- and 2-year actuarial probability of experiencing a FVB between the 2 treatment groups. Presence of variceal red signs at endoscopy was the only variable independently associated with an increased risk of variceal bleeding on follow-up (relative risk 3.4; P < 0.01). Survival and adverse events were similar in the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in the incidence of ascites or changes in renal function.

Conclusions

Is-MN does not reduce the incidence of FVB in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices who cannot be treated with beta-blockers because contraindications or intolerance to these drugs, suggesting that Is-MN has no place in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.

### Beta-blockers in liver cirrhosis [^115suhHQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Since the original description of the effectiveness of β-blockers in lowering the portal pressure and therefore the risk of variceal bleeding, more than 500 articles in the English literature on the use of non selective β-blockers (NSBB) in cirrhosis have been published. The use of NSBB in pre-primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is currently not indicated. In primary prophylaxis, patients with high risk small varices or large/medium varices should receive primary prophylaxis either with NSBB or with endoscopic band ligation if there are contraindications to NSBB. For secondary prophylaxis the current recommendation is to receive a combination of NSBB and endoscopic variceal ligation. In addition to lowering portal pressure, NSBB can also reduce bacterial translocation, potentially exerting multiple beneficial effects which go beyond the reduction of bleeding risk. Carvedilol is a NSBB with intrinsic anti-α(1)-adrenergic activity, possibly more effective than propranolol in lowering portal hypertension. A potential harmful effect of propranolol in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites deserves further confirmation. NSBB remain the cornerstone of therapy in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.

### Carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective β-blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices [^111LixYH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Non-selective beta-blockers are recommended for the prevention of bleeding in people with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with additional intrinsic alpha 1 -blocking effects, which may be superior to traditional, non-selective beta-blockers in reducing portal pressure and, therefore, in reducing the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of carvedilol compared with traditional, non-selective beta-blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices.

Search Methods

We combined searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary's Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index with manual searches. The last search update was 08 May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, irrespective of publication status, blinding, or language. We included trials evaluating both primary and secondary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and verified gastroesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors (AZ, RJ and LH), independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and I 2 values as a marker of heterogeneity. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary domains and the quality of the evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

Eleven trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One trial did not report clinical outcomes. We included the remaining 10 randomised clinical trials, involving 810 participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices, in our analyses. The intervention comparisons were carvedilol versus propranolol (nine trials), or nadolol (one trial). Six trials were of short duration (mean 6 (range 1 to 12) weeks), while four were of longer duration (13.5 (6 to 30) months). Three trials evaluated primary prevention; three evaluated secondary prevention; while four evaluated both primary and secondary prevention. We classified all trials as at 'high risk of bias'. We gathered mortality data from seven trials involving 507 participants; no events occurred in four of these. Sixteen of 254 participants receiving carvedilol and 19 of 253 participants receiving propranolol or nadolol died (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.53; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). There appeared to be no differences between carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers and the risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.37; 810 participants; 10 trials; I² = 45%, very low-quality evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42; 810 participants; 10 trials; I² = 14%, low-quality evidence). Significantly more deaths, episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events occurred in the long-term trials but there was not enough information to determine whether there were differences between carvedilol and traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, by trial duration. There was also insufficient information to detect differences in the effects of these interventions in trials evaluating primary or secondary prevention. There appeared to be no differences in the risk of non-serious adverse events between carvedilol versus its comparators (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.29; 596 participants; 6 trials; I² = 88%; very low-quality evidence). Use of carvedilol was associated with a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than traditional, non-selective beta-blockers both in absolute (MD -1.75 mmHg, 95% CI -2.60 to -0.89; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence) and percentage terms (MD -8.02%, 95% CI -11.49% to -4.55%; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). However, we did not observe a concomitant reduction in the number of participants who failed to achieve a sufficient haemodynamic response (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 42%; very low-quality evidence) or in clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no clear beneficial or harmful effects of carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers on mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, serious or non-serious adverse events despite the fact that carvedilol was more effective at reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient. However, the evidence was of low or very low quality, and hence the findings are uncertain. Additional evidence is required from adequately powered, long-term, double-blind, randomised clinical trials, which evaluate both clinical and haemodynamic outcomes.

### Selection of β-blocker in patients with cirrhosis and acute myocardial infarction: a 13-year nationwide population-based study in Asia [^117HaVHE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study had several findings. (1) This is the first study to directly compare the clinical outcome of β 1 ‐selective blockers versus nonselective β‐blockers in patients with liver cirrhosis and new‐onset AMI using extensive propensity score matching. (2) Use of β 1 ‐selective blockers provided clinical benefits with significantly decreased MACCE with trends toward less all‐cause mortality and liver outcomes compared with the use of nonselective β‐blockers in the patients with combined cirrhosis and AMI.

In patients with liver cirrhosis, nonselective β‐blockers remain the cornerstone of medical treatment of portal hypertension due to the evidence derived from prospective trials of their efficacy in preventing variceal bleeding. However, with increasing knowledge of portal hypertension–induced changes in systemic hemodynamics, cardiac function, and renal perfusion, emerging studies have raised concerns about the harmful effects of nonselective β‐blockers. Clinicians are facing an ongoing controversy about the use of nonselective β‐blockers in patients with advanced cirrhosis. 18

A literature search for patients with liver cirrhosis and concurrent AMI showed a small number of studies that specifically addressed the selection of β‐blocking agents for the treatment of coincident high‐risk diseases. 9, 10 Although there was a possible class effect distinguishing the β 1 ‐selective blocker bisoprolol from the nonselective β‐blockers carvedilol and propranolol in the treatment of AMI, 19 the same cannot be extrapolated to β‐blocking agents used in the treatment of liver cirrhosis, 18 and currently no data exist regarding the appropriate selection of β‐blockers in these patients. Because of the difference in the management strategies in the 2 diseases, we investigated the use of nonselective β‐blockers in patients with cirrhosis versus β 1 ‐selective blockers recommended in patients with coexistent AMI and cirrhosis. Propensity score matching was performed in the baseline cardiovascular and liver parameters for 2 groups of patients to study the outcome.

Advise patients to take LOPRESSOR regularly and continuously, as directed, preferably with or immediately following meals. If a dose is missed, the patient should take only the next scheduled dose (without doubling it). Patients should not interrupt or discontinue LOPRESSOR without consulting the physician.

Advise patients (1) to avoid operating automobiles and machinery or engaging in other tasks requiring alertness until the patient's response to therapy with LOPRESSOR has been determined; (2) to contact the physician if any difficulty in breathing occurs; (3) to inform the physician or dentist before any type of surgery that he or she is taking LOPRESSOR.

Inform patients or caregivers that there is a risk of hypoglycemia when LOPRESSOR is given to patients who are fasting or who are vomiting. Instruct patients or caregivers how to monitor for signs of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Trends in initial antihypertensive medication prescribing among > 2.8 Million veterans newly diagnosed with hypertension, 2000 to 2019 [^111cUBAL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

β‐Blocker Initiation Among Veterans Without Compelling Indications

The number of Veterans overall without a compelling indication for BB treatment at the time of antihypertensive initiation was 2 521 696 (89.0% of the overall cohort). Of these, 587 175 initiated a BB (23.3%) overall. BB use in this population increased from 22% in 2000 to 26% to 27% in 2001–2006, then declined to 19% in 2019 (Figure 2), most commonly with metoprolol and atenolol in 2000, and metoprolol and carvedilol in 2019.

Figure 2
Initiation of β‐blockers among Veterans without compelling indications for β‐blocker use, by year of initiation.

The figure shows the proportion initiating antihypertensive regimens with and without a β‐blocker over the 20‐year study period among 2 521 696 Veterans without compelling indications for a β‐blocker (89.0% of the overall cohort). Compelling indications for a β‐blocker at the time of antihypertensive medication initiation included a history of history of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, heart failure, angina, other CHD/angina, atrial fibrillation, and aortic aneurysm or disease. CHD indicates congestive heart disease.

Among the 587 175 Veterans who did not have a compelling indication but initiated a BB, the most commonly initiated regimen was BB monotherapy (47.3%) (Table S6). There was a slight increase in BB+CCB (4.3% to 5.3%) and decrease in BB+thiazide (5.4% to 3.8%).

In 1981, Lebrec et al performed the first randomized clinical trial involving 74 cirrhotic patients with a history of variceal bleeding. This study documented a significant reduction in rebleeding in patients on propranolol as compared to placebo. Since then, there has been a growing interest among hepatologists regarding the role of non-selective β-blockers (NSBB) in decreasing portal hypertension and preventing its complications.

### Use of non-selective B-blockers is safe in hospitalised decompensated cirrhosis patients and exerts a potential anti-inflammatory effect: data from the ATTIRE trial [^116Js5xj]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analyses demonstrate that the use of non-selective B-blockers (NSBBs) at baseline in hospitalised decompensated cirrhosis patients is safe with no increased renal or cardiovascular dysfunction observed during days 3–15 of the ATTIRE trial, despite elevated serum creatinine at hospitalisation. These data also support an anti-infective role at hospitalisation for NSBBs in decompensated cirrhosis that was associated with a reduction in circulating IL-8 and white cell count. However, there was no reduction in hospital acquired infections (HAIs) in patients taking NSBBs and no beneficial impact on mortality at 28-days, 3 and 6-months following trial enrolment.

Overall, the use of NSBBs, with median doses of 40 mg Propranolol and 6.25 mg Carvedilol per day, led to an expected 10% reduction in heart rate but no increased renal or cardiovascular dysfunction, nor increased grade 3/4 hepatic encephalopathy. NSBBs were discontinued in relatively few patients, 20.8% within 5 days of trial entry, although one-third of these had either died or been discharged. These patients had no significant differences in clinical characteristics at baseline to those in which NSBBs were continued and the only clinical feature measure that separated those that stopped or continued NSBBs was heart rate. Given the established benefits of NSBBs to prevent variceal bleeding, these data strongly advocate for use in this cohort and data were very similar for patients taking either propranolol or carvedilol. Although there was a trend for reduced renal dysfunction in those taking NSBBs, given the confidence intervals crossed one we believe our data should be interpreted as excluding a difference between groups and that use was safe. However, serum creatinine was significantly higher at baseline in patients taking NSBBs and evidently these drugs must be monitored carefully in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

### An evidence-based medicine approach to β-blocker therapy in patients with cirrhosis [^113VxNUw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Disease management strategies have gained attention in recent years because of their potential to improve health-related quality of life and prevent excessive resource use. Despite recognition as an important cause of mortality, cirrhosis with portal hypertension has not been widely discussed as a condition amenable to planned care management. Given the effect of variceal hemorrhage as the most immediate life-threatening complication of portal hypertension, a number of high-quality controlled clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis. Despite the existence of practice guidelines that incorporate this information, specific clinical scenarios that demand consideration for beta-blocker therapy have not been well described. In this article, a number of hypothetical patient-based cases drawn from the authors' experiences are utilized to illustrate these issues.

Table 3 — management of patients with moderate/large varices that have not bled — details dosing, targets, and follow-up for propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol, and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Propranolol is 20–40 mg orally twice a day, adjusted every 2–3 days to achieve resting heart rate of 55–60 beats per minute while systolic blood pressure should not decrease < 90 mm Hg; maximal daily doses are 320 mg/day without ascites and 160 mg/day with ascites, with checks at every outpatient visit to ensure heart rate target, continued indefinitely, and no need for follow-up EGD. Nadolol is 20–40 mg orally once a day, adjusted every 2–3 days with the same goals (resting heart rate of 55–60 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure should not decrease < 90 mm Hg); maximal daily doses are 160 mg/day without ascites and 80 mg/day with ascites, continued indefinitely without need for follow-up EGD. Carvedilol starts with 6.25 mg once a day with a maximal dose of 12.5 mg/day (except in patients with persistent arterial hypertension); the goal is that systolic arterial blood pressure should not decrease < 90 mm Hg, therapy is continued indefinitely, and there is no need for follow-up EGD. EVL is performed every 2–8 weeks until eradication of varices with variceal eradication (no further ligation possible) as the goal, followed by first EGD at 3–6 months after eradication and every 6–12 months thereafter.

### Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride [^114QKbgp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatic Impairment - The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of hydralazine alone has not been determined. Isosorbide dinitrate concentrations increase in patients with cirrhosis.

Drug-Drug Interactions

No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride tablets.

Hydralazine: Administration of hydralazine can increase the exposure to a number of drugs including beta-blockers. In healthy males administered a single oral dose of hydralazine 50 mg and propranolol 1 mg/kg, the Cmax and AUC for propranolol approximately doubled. In healthy subjects administered a single oral dose of hydralazine 50 mg and metoprolol 100 mg, the Cmax and AUC for metoprolol increased by 50% and 30%, respectively. In pre-eclamptic women, twice-daily doses of hydralazine 25 mg and metoprolol 50 mg increased the Cmax and AUC for metoprolol by 90% and 40%, respectively.

In healthy males administered single oral doses of hydralazine 25 mg and either lisinopril 20 mg or enalapril 20 mg, Cmax and AUC for lisinopril were each increased 30%, but enalapril concentrations were unaffected.

Intravenous co-administration of 0.2 mg/kg hydralazine HCl and 40 mg furosemide in Japanese patients with congestive heart failure resulted in a 20% increase in the clearance of furosemide.

Isosorbide dinitrate: The vasodilating effects of coadministered isosorbide dinitrate may be additive to those of other vasodilators, including alcohol.

A single dose of 20 mg of isosorbide dinitrate was administered to healthy subjects after pretreatment with 80 mg propranolol three times daily for 48 hours, resulting in no impact on the pharmacokinetics of isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide-5-mononitrate.

When single 100-mg oral doses of atenolol were administered 2 hours before isosorbide dinitrate at a 10-mg dose no differences in the pharmacokinetics of isosorbide dinitrate or its mononitrates were observed.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^112MuHk1]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — carvedilol dosing for portal hypertension in compensated cirrhosis: It is recommended that therapy is started at a dose of 6.25 mg per day and, if tolerated, increased to 12.5 mg per day after 2–3 days, with down-titration to 6.25 mg daily if not tolerated or if systolic blood pressure falls below 90 mm Hg. Lower starting doses may be more appropriate in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B and C cirrhosis. In compensated cirrhosis with arterial hypertension, carvedilol doses may be further up-titrated (up to 25 mg/day) for blood pressure control, and carvedilol is the preferred NSBB for management of PH.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116Yh1wC]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Secondary prophylaxis after recovery from acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage — patients have high risk and require prevention: those who recover from the first episode of VH have a high rebleeding risk (60% in the first year) with mortality of up to 33%, and therapy to prevent rebleeding is mandatory before discharge. If TIPS was performed during the acute episode, patients do not require specific portal hypertension or variceal therapy but should be referred for transplant evaluation, and TIPS patency should be assessed by Doppler ultrasound every 6 months. For all other patients, first‑line therapy is the combination of NSBBs (propranolol or nadolol)+EVL; meta‑analysis shows combination therapy is significantly more effective than EVL alone in preventing all‑source GI hemorrhage but only marginally more effective than drug therapy (NSBB ± nitrates) with a tendency toward more side effects, and if NSBB are not tolerated, TIPS should be considered, particularly when another indication (e.g., ascites) is present. NSBB plus low‑dose isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) has a greater portal pressure–reducing effect than NSBB alone but a higher rate of side effects; in meta‑analysis, NSBB+ISMN was no different than NSBB alone regarding overall rebleeding or mortality but had more side effects. Regarding carvedilol, it has not been compared to standard of care with NSBB+EVL, there are not enough data to recommend carvedilol in the prevention of rebleeding, and particularly at doses > 12.5 mg/day it may decrease arterial pressure and should not be used in patients with refractory ascites.

### Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^11748oRz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details.

Main Results

We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The follow-up in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included beta-blockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates, nitrates, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received non-selective beta-blockers ('beta-blockers') - the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) - died during 8-month to 60-month follow-up. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (beta-blockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; beta-blockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than beta-blockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than beta-blockers alone (OR 3.41, 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in beta-blockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with high-risk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than beta-blockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of beta-blockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.

### Use of non-selective B-blockers is safe in hospitalised decompensated cirrhosis patients and exerts a potential anti-inflammatory effect: data from the ATTIRE trial [^113Dphyb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Comparison of patients taking non-selective B-blockers or not at trial entry

Baseline characteristics

At randomisation, there were 139 (17.9%) identified patients taking B-blockers out of 777 randomised patients, with 69 prescribed Carvedilol, median dose 6.25 mg (IQR 6.25–12.5) once a day, and 70 Propranolol, median dose 40 mg (IQR 40–80) once a day. Patients prescribed NSBBs at baseline had similar age, gender, presence of ascites, MELD score serum albumin and CRP to those not, but significantly increased incidence of suspected variceal bleeds and serum creatinine and significantly reduced WCC (Table 1). In patients diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis at baseline, a similar number were taking NSBBs (28/139, 20.1%) as not (163/638, 25.5%), p = 0.18.

### Beta-blockers in liver cirrhosis [^111xDFF9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Only one randomized non-blinded trial compared the role of carvedilol for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding with endoscopic band ligation (EBL), demonstrating a significantly lower bleeding rate in patients on carvedilol as compared to those treated with EBL, but without any differences in mortality between the two groups. The study however did not include hemodynamic measurements. A recent study also showed that carvedilol achieved a hemodynamic response in 56% of hemodynamic non responders to propranolol.

It is advised that carvedilol should be started at low doses (6.25 mg/day). If tolerated, the dose is increased stepwise up to a maximum of 25 mg b.i.d. (50 mg in patients weighing > 85 kg). Titration should be done slowly, increasing the dose at intervals of 1–2 weeks. The dose should not be increased in patients developing symptoms or with a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or a heart rate < 50 beats per min.

Further studies are required to confirm these results and to analyze the role of carvedilol in secondary prophylaxis and its effects in certain subgroups, such as patients with decompensated cirrhosis or patients not responding to propranolol.

### Editorial: beta-blockers and the prevention of decompensation in cirrhosis: worth the trouble [^114Qk2Tn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-selective beta-blockers have been a cornerstone of therapy for prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhosis patients for more than two decades. When lowering the hepatic vein portal pressure gradient (HVPG) below 12mmHg or decreasing the pressure by 20% from baseline, these drugs are of proven benefit in reducing variceal bleeding and improving survival in this patient population. The recent work by Hendández-Gea et al., suggests that initiation of the beta-blocker nadolol in cirrhosis patients with high-risk varices can delay or prevent the first occurrence of clinically evident ascites. This finding comes with some caveats, however. The beneficial effect was only seen in patients who had an improvement by 10% or more from baseline HVPG pressure (only 51% of the treated patients in this study). This class of medications has some risk and tolerance issues, and many patients do not respond, even when the heart rate is optimally decreased. Despite this, the use of beta-blockers may be beneficial in the primary prevention of the formation of ascites and further decompensation of cirrhosis.

### Non-selective β-blockers in advanced cirrhosis: a critical review of the effects on overall survival and renal function [^114PkUqM]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

At the same congress, Onali et al published a retrospective study supporting the beneficial role of these drugs, from a cohort of 316 patients assessed for liver transplant. Patients were classified according to whether they received NSBBs or not at the time of transplant. RA was present in 40% of patients. NSBBs were associated with reduced mortality (HR = 0.511, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.87, p = 0.014), even when considering only patients with RA (NSBB use: HR = 0.257, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.66, p = 0.005).

Recently, Chirapongsathorn et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of NSBBs on all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and RA. The meta-analysis included 3145 patients from three RCTs and eight observational studies of propranolol, carvedilol, nadolol and metoprolol up until January 2015, reporting 1206 deaths. In contrast to some previous studies, they concluded that the use of NSBBs was not associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and ascites or RA. This disparity may be partly explained by the heterogeneity across studies, the lack of individual participant data, the effect of the dose and duration of NSBB use or the absence of data differentiating liver-related mortality from non-liver-related deaths. This meta-analysis included studies of metoprolol, which is, however, a cardioselective β-blocker. It is important to note that patients with ascites had a poor prognosis regardless of NSBB therapy. Furthermore, since NSBBs have been clearly shown to decrease the risk of variceal bleeding, regardless of the severity of liver disease and taking into account an ∼15% risk of mortality within 6 weeks associated with variceal bleeding, NSBB withdrawal should cautiously be appraised.

### Β-blocker therapy for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy: a randomized-controlled trial [^115BVvyf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is characterized by an attenuated contractile response to stress. Long-term exposure of β-adrenergic receptors to persistently high levels of catecholamines has been implicated in its pathogenesis. We hypothesized that β-blockade with metoprolol could reverse the changes in heart function and morphology in cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.

Patients and Methods

In this prospective randomized trial, we included 78 patients aged between 18 and 60 years with abnormal cardiac output response under dobutamine stress echocardiography, without primary cardiac disease or a history of alcohol intake. Patients were assigned randomly to receive metoprolol or placebo for 6 months. The primary endpoint was the improvement in cardiac output response to stress, measured by an increase in the left ventricle stroke volume more than 30%.

Results

Three (7.3%) patients in the metoprolol group and nine (24.3%) patients in the placebo group showed improved stroke volume (P = 0.057). Diastolic dysfunction was found in two (4.8%) patients before and in five (15.6%) patients after therapy in the metoprolol group, and in 10 (27%) patients before and nine (31%) patients after therapy in the placebo group (P = 0.67). After treatment, no echocardiography parameter of morphology was significantly different between metoprolol or placebo groups. No significant differences were observed in noradrenaline, plasma renin activity, and troponin levels between groups. Cirrhosis-related clinical events, including hospitalizations and mortality, were not significantly different between the two groups. Six months of therapy with β-blocker did not ameliorate heart function and morphology in patients with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.

Summary of all recommendations

Recommendations: primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 2)
What is the best method for primary prophylaxis? We recommend non-cardioselective β blockers (NSBB) or variceal band ligation (VBL). We suggest pharmacological treatment with propranolol as first line. VBL is offered if there are contraindications to NSBB. The choice of VBL or NSBB should also take into account patient choice (level 1a, grade A). We suggest carvedilol or nadolol as alternatives to propranolol (level 1b, grade A). Dose: Propranolol: 40 mg twice daily. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once heart rate (HR) of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg (level 1a, grade A). Nadolol: 40 mg daily dose. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached a maximum dose of 240 mg (level 1a, grade A). Carvedilol: 6.25 mg once daily to increase to maintenance of 12.5 mg after a week if tolerated or once HR of < 50–55 bpm is reached (level 1a, grade A). It is suggested that NSBB are discontinued at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal impairment and hypotension (level 2b, grade B). In cases of contraindications or intolerance to NSBB, we recommend variceal band ligation (level 1a, grade A).
Who should have surveillance for variceal bleeding? We recommend all patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at the time of diagnosis (level 1a, grade A). There is no indication to repeat endoscopy in patients receiving NSBB.
How often should cirrhotic patients be endoscoped? If at the time of first endoscopy no varices are seen, we suggest that patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at 2–3-year intervals (level 2a, grade B). If grade I varices are diagnosed, we suggest that patients should be endoscoped at yearly intervals (level 2a, grade B). If there is clear evidence of disease progression we suggest that the intervals can be modified by the clinician. Endoscopy should also be offered at time of decompensation (level 2a, grade B).
Which patients with cirrhosis should have primary prophylaxis? If grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices are diagnosed, we recommend that patients have primary prophylaxis irrespective of the severity of the liver disease (level 1a, grade A).
Treatments not recommended: Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B). Isosorbide mononitrate monotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1b, grade A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend isosorbide mononitrate in combination with NSBB (level 1b, grade A). Shunt surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A). Sclerotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of NSBB in patients without varices, with focus on carvedilol. Role of NSBB in patients with small varices, with focus on carvedilol. Comparison of carvedilol versus propranolol in primary prophylaxis. Identification of, and trials assessing, new drugs for primary prophylaxis such as statins.
Quality indicator: Percentage of patients at diagnosis of cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy to screen for varices (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy either before or after diagnosis within 6 months. Denominator; patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis. Percentage of patients receiving primary prophylaxis among those newly diagnosed with grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices. Numerator; patients who have grade 1 varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices receiving primary prophylaxis. Denominator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have grade I varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered LOPRESSOR, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of LOPRESSOR. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of LOPRESSOR [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of LOPRESSOR or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of LOPRESSOR.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should in general, not receive beta-blockers, including LOPRESSOR. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, LOPRESSOR may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of LOPRESSOR. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Pheochromocytoma

If LOPRESSOR is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

5.5 Major Surgery

Avoid initiation of a high-dose regimen of beta blocker therapy in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since such use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death.

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

5.6 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

Introduction

Cirrhosis is end‐stage liver disease with many debilitating complications and a high risk for mortality. In patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension inevitably leads to ascites and esophageal varices. The most feared conditions that follow are varicose vein rupture and hematemesis. 1 Approximately half of patients with cirrhosis develop esophageal varices, and one third of these patients may develop a variceal bleed. 2 The reported mortality is up to 50% for the initial bleed and 30% for subsequent bleeds. 3 Few medications were useful in treating variceal bleeding; however introduction of a nonselective β‐blocker by Lebrec and colleagues in the 1980s was found to be effective for secondary prevention and later primary prevention. 4, 5 Nonselective β‐blockers have theoretical therapeutics on 2 ends: 1 is to halt the rising heart rate, and the other is to decrease blood flow through splanchnic vessels to relieve portal vein hypertension. 6 β 1 ‐Selective blockers were shown to be less effective than nonselective β‐blockers in portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients. 7, 8

Although myocardial infarction has been shown to have low incidence in patients with liver cirrhosis, 9 the coexistence of the 2 diseases presents clinical challenges to the physicians who are required to give appropriate and effective treatment in these patients, who have a high risk for mortality. 10 Previous cardiovascular literature has shown that β 1 ‐selective blockers have proven their role in a number of diseases, including coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and heart failure, producing fewer side effects while controlling the heart rate. 11 In the event of AMI occurring in patients with cirrhosis, the conflicting nature in the choice between the 2 β‐blockers becomes unavoidable. In this study, therefore, we aimed to determine which β‐blocker should be recommended and used in patients with both cirrhosis and AMI.

Carvedilol: a new agent in the pipeline

In addition to propranolol and nadolol, carvedilol has been investigated as a promising NSBB with the additional property of vasodilatation due to its intrinsic anti-α1 adrenergic activity and its capacity to enhance the release of nitric oxide. Thus, carvedilol reduces portal pressure not only by decreasing portal-collateral blood flow (as all other NSBB) but also by diminishing the functional component of hepatic vascular resistance which is increased in cirrhosis. Due to these effects, this drug may cause a higher risk of arterial hypotension leading to discontinuation of treatment. Indeed, a reduction in mean arterial pressure has been documented in patients on carvedilol, proportionally to the dosage. Other promising effects of carvedilol are those of scavenging and suppressing reactive oxygen species, leading to a possible cytoprotective and anti-oxidant effect. Amelioration of oxidative stress with carvedilol might even lead to antifibrotic effects.

Several clinical trials reported the efficacy of carvedilol in lowering HVPG. Carvedilol succeeded in reducing HVPG more than propranolol in some randomized clinical trials, while De and colleagues found the two to be equivalent. Lo and co-workers recently evaluated the use of carvedilol vs nadolol plus isosorbide-mononitrate in preventing variceal rebleeding. These authors concluded that carvedilol was as effective as nadolol plus isosorbidemononitrate with fewer severe adverse events and a similar rate of survival. This trial should be considered with caution due to the high rebleeding rates (60% in both groups) probably caused by the fact that these patients did not receive endoscopic treatment together with drug therapy. Moreover, β-blockage was not reflected by a decrease in heart rate and HVPG measurements were not performed.

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^116JspFr]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Starting in 2014, US guidelines have not recommended β-blockers for first-line treatment of hypertension in the absence of compelling indications due to their tolerability profile and inferior protection against stroke and mortality compared with other first-line agents. The prevalence and factors associated with this guideline-discordant practice are unknown.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with first-line β-blocker use among those without compelling indications for a β-blocker.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Serial cross-sectional study of new users of antihypertensive medications using national, patient-level data in the Veterans Health Administration between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2022. Patients were veterans initiating antihypertensive medications for newly diagnosed hypertension in the outpatient setting based on diagnosis codes and prescription dispenses, excluding veterans without a primary care visit in the prior year.

Exposure

Initiation of antihypertensive medications for newly diagnosed hypertension.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Among those without compelling indications (ie, aortic aneurysm and/or disease, angina, atrial fibrillation or arrhythmia, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization), multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate factors associated with β-blocker initiation.

Results

Of 3 138 304 included veterans (mean [SD] age 61.0 [13.0] years, 2 958 488 [94.3%] male, 149 807 [4.8%] Hispanic, 490 636 [15.6%] non-Hispanic Black, 2 028 127 [64.6%] non-Hispanic White, and 66 798 [2.1%] other races and ethnicities), 774 821 (24.7%) initiated a β-blocker. Overall, 684 045 patients (88.2%) who initiated a β-blocker did not have compelling indications, which decreased over time from 245 703 (91.8%) in 2000 through 2005 to 93 088 (81.5%) in 2018 to 2022. Metoprolol and carvedilol were the most commonly initiated β-blockers and increased over time, and atenolol initiation decreased over time. Among other factors, a greater prevalence ratio for β-blocker initiation was observed among older (PR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04–1.05), female (PR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09–1.14), non-Hispanic White (as reference group; Non-Hispanic Black PR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; Hispanic PR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.77; all others PR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86–0.92) or frail veterans (PR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25–1.31).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, most veterans using β-blockers as a first-line treatment for hypertension did not have compelling indications, and several factors were associated with likelihood of β-blocker initiation in this group. Interventions are needed to improve initial guideline-concordant treatment for veterans with incident hypertension.

### Non-selective β-blockers in advanced cirrhosis: a critical review of the effects on overall survival and renal function [^111ayfDW]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bleeding oesophageal varices in cirrhosis are associated with a 40% 1-year mortality. Non-selective β-blockers (NSBBs) reduce the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)and remain the mainstay for primary prophylaxis in combination with endoscopic band ligation for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis. Since the seminal work by Lebrec et al 35 years ago, pharmacological prophylaxis of portal hypertensive haemorrhage has experienced little variation and these drugs are still widely prescribed today in at-risk patients. Although HVPG should be measured at baseline and 4–8 weeks after starting NSBB treatment to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from continuing prophylaxis with NSBBs (HVPG reduction to < 12 mm Hg or a 20% decrease in HVPG vs the baseline value), this procedure is not widely available in clinical practice. This haemodynamic response may also help prevent the development of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Several other drugs designed to reduce portal pressure have been tested over the past 30 years, such as selective β-blockers, nitrates, angiotensin receptor antagonists, α-receptor antagonists and endothelin receptor antagonists. None of them, however, have revealed any advantages over NSBBs in terms of their safety profiles in the prophylaxis against variceal bleeding. In addition to the clinical benefits derived from their haemodynamic effects, it has been suggested that NSBBs might provide non-haemodynamic-mediated benefits such as preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although several high-quality studies have demonstrated the benefits of NSBBs in both the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, either alone or combined with endoscopic procedures, and in overall survival, only a few studies have reported patients with advanced cirrhosis, particularly decompensated patients with refractory ascites (RA).

### Update on cirrhotic cardiomyopathy: from etiopathogenesis to treatment [^113GAL3D]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with liver cirrhosis usually receive non-selective β-blockers, such as carvedilol, for primary and secondary prophylaxis in the presence of portal hypertension and evidence of varices. By reducing portal pressure, they reduce intestinal congestion and bacterial translocation from the gut. They also have a beneficial effect on the hyperdynamic circulation, reducing cardiac workload and improving the QTc interval. However, it is unclear to what extent this shortening of the QTc interval has a beneficial effect on the prognosis of CCM. Despite the benefits of β-blockers mentioned above, there is evidence that they can shorten survival time in advanced stages of cirrhosis with CCM and hyperdynamic syndrome, where a maximally activated sympathetic nervous system maintains peripheral organ perfusion. Ultimately, the patient with CCM is dependent on the increased cardiac output. The negative inotropic and chronotropic effect can impair perfusion. β-Blockers are therefore contraindicated in decompensated liver cirrhosis, as they can cause end-organ damage, for instance hepatorenal syndrome. The so-called "window theory" has been proposed to describe the time when the negative effects of β-blocker therapy become predominant. According to this theory, patients benefit most from the beneficial effects of β-blockers in the phase between mild and decompensated cirrhosis. However, the exact timing of the opening and closing of this window is unclear.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^116ZZuM7]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD portal hypertension — management of compensated cirrhosis with a contraindication to or intolerance of beta-blockers: Patients with compensated cirrhosis who have contraindication for beta-blockers or who do not tolerate beta-blockers have at present no further therapeutic options to avoid clinical decompensation other than control of the underlying disease. Although a possible benefit of statins to prevent decompensation in this setting is pathophysiologically plausible and retrospective studies suggest that statins reduce the incidence of decompensation, there are insufficient data to recommend its routine use. Patients with a standard indication for statin therapy should continue treatment, and statins should not be discouraged when indicated. In patient with cACLD with CSPH for whom beta-blockers cannot be safely administered, endoscopic surveillance should be initiated with an intent to prevent first variceal hemorrhage (primary prophylaxis) through prophylactic endoscopic band ligation of high-risk varices. Performance of an endoscopy every 2 years is recommended; however, if cause of the liver disease is under control (alcohol abstinence, weight control, viral suppression or elimination, etc.), endoscopic surveillance may be done every 3 years. In some cases, cessation of surveillance may be considered after negative serial endoscopic assessments.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In worldwide clinical trials of Metoprolol Tartrate Injection in myocardial infarction, where approximately 478 patients were over 65 years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial infarction has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals taking Metoprolol Tartrate Injection cannot be categorically ruled out. Therefore, in general, it is recommended that dosing proceed with caution in this population.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with metoprolol in patients with hepatic impairment. Because metoprolol is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication.

### Beta-blockers in patients with advanced liver disease: has the dust settled? [^111ssQ22]. Liver Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) have been the backbone for the treatment of portal hypertension in cirrhosis for the last 3 decades. A publication in 2010 of a prospective observational study suggested that NSBBs could increase mortality in patients with refractory ascites. This opened a controversy about the safety and efficacy of NSBBs in patients with advanced liver disease and led to the publication of a large corpus of observational data assessing the safety of NSBBs in patients with advanced cirrhosis. In this article, we briefly review the clinical pharmacology of NSBBs, the pathophysiological basis for the underlying benefits and harms of NSBBs in advanced cirrhosis, and the evidence in favor and against the use of NSBBs in specific scenarios. Finally, we summarize the current recommendations and propose areas of opportunity for future research. Liver Transplantation 23 1058–1069 2017 AASLD.
