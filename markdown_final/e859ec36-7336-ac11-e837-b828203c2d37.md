## Question

does modafanil help with memory

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether modafinil helps with memory. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "memory" means in these studies (working, episodic, short-term). Then, I should verify the strength of evidence by population and study design. Next, I will examine effect sizes, durability, and mechanisms. After that, I need to check safety and regulatory context. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful bottom line with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the scope of "memory". Across trials, outcomes include working memory, episodic memory, and short-term memory, often measured with digit span, paired associate learning, word-list recall, or false-memory paradigms; some studies also assess "speed of memory" or memory-related network connectivity, so I should keep these constructs distinct when interpreting results [^6b83c69a] [^65fd8a1b] [^6820cc1c] [^cc8cd197].

> Now, I will examine the highest-quality signal in healthy adults. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled fMRI study in 48 healthy men showed that a single 200 mg dose of modafinil improved performance across implicit and explicit memory tasks and reduced negative functional connectivity between frontoparietal and default mode networks, with a specific cluster linking visual and medial temporal lobe regions predicting memory gains; this provides convergent behavioral and systems-level evidence, though the sample is small and male-only, so I should be cautious about generalizability [^6820cc1c] [^d212d2d3] [^8436aeab].

> Next, I should review mood disorders, where effects might differ. In remitted major depressive disorder, a randomized, placebo-controlled study found acute improvements in episodic and working memory after a single 200 mg dose, with medium-to-large effect sizes and no mood confounding; a systematic review of modafinil in MDD also reported short-term executive and memory benefits, but emphasized the need for larger, longitudinal trials, so I should not overstate durability here [^cfa63f52] [^b4059a9c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in schizophrenia. The Cochrane review concludes there is no clear benefit of adjunctive modafinil on global cognition in schizophrenia, and a parallel-group RCT using the MATRICS battery found no significant advantage; however, a crossover study using CANTAB detected improvements in paired associate learning in early psychosis, suggesting test sensitivity and illness phase matter, so a null in some batteries does not exclude domain-specific effects in the right population [^6fb91b18] [^65fd8a1b].

> I need to check neurodegenerative and brain injury populations. In Alzheimer's disease, preclinical data suggest hippocampal neurogenesis and working memory benefits, but clinical trials are lacking; in traumatic brain injury, a Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for modafinil on chronic cognitive impairment; in stroke, modafinil may help fatigue without clear global cognitive gains, so memory-specific benefits remain unproven in these groups [^2a48c88f] [^02dc2bee] [^b0e77027].

> Let me consider sleep-related conditions. In obstructive sleep apnea with residual sleepiness, armodafinil improved episodic secondary memory and reduced fatigue, but a meta-analysis of modafinil/armodafinil adjuncts to CPAP found consistent benefits for sleepiness and attention without confirmed improvements in broader cognitive domains, including memory; in shift-work or sleep-deprived professionals, modafinil improved working memory and executive function, likely reflecting restored alertness rather than a direct memory mechanism, so I should distinguish restoration from enhancement [^0cde803c] [^c76680de] [^ec6d265b] [^bd714b0f].

> I should double-check cancer-related cognitive impairment. A randomized trial in breast cancer survivors reported improved speed of memory and quality of episodic secondary memory with modafinil, but a systematic review of psychostimulants in adult cancer survivors found only limited, heterogeneous evidence with no consistent memory benefit; a pediatric brain tumor trial was completed, but peer-reviewed outcomes are not provided here, so I should treat the positive signal as preliminary [^cc8cd197] [^9874a37b] [^c6967efd].

> Next, I should review effect sizes and durability. In healthy adults and remitted MDD, acute modafinil produces medium-to-large memory effects, but most data are single-dose or very short-term; longer-term randomized trials are sparse, and a bipolar disorder review notes that while acute modafinil improved episodic and working memory, durability and safety with repeated dosing remain uncertain, so I need to emphasize that we lack maintenance data [^6820cc1c] [^cfa63f52] [^badd78f0].

> Let me think about mechanisms. Modafinil increases extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine via transporter inhibition, engages histamine, orexin/hypocretin, and glutamate systems, and modulates large-scale networks; reduced negative connectivity between frontoparietal and default mode networks and between visual and medial temporal regions correlates with memory enhancement, plausibly facilitating encoding and retrieval, though causality and interindividual variability need further work [^577bb889] [^6820cc1c] [^4e5bf915].

> I should confirm safety and regulatory context. Common adverse effects include headache, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and palpitations; serious rashes, psychiatric symptoms, and cardiovascular effects can occur, and modafinil is not approved for cognitive enhancement or pediatric use; in patients with psychosis, mania, or cardiovascular disease, risk-benefit must be weighed carefully, and clinicians should monitor for emergent psychiatric symptoms [^1f76e252] [^7928764d] [^d542e817] [^f45b8c23].

> But wait, what if baseline performance changes the response. In alcohol dependence, modafinil improved verbal short-term memory and, in those with poor baseline working memory, also improved working memory, whereas no benefit was seen in high performers; this baseline-dependent effect mirrors broader cognitive-enhancement literature and suggests that deficits may be more responsive than intact function, which I should keep in mind when counseling patients [^6b83c69a].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Yes, modafinil can acutely improve aspects of memory in some contexts, with the most consistent evidence in healthy adults and in remitted depression, typically as single-dose effects on working and episodic memory; benefits are smaller, inconsistent, or unproven in schizophrenia, neurodegenerative disease, TBI, and cancer, and durability beyond acute dosing remains uncertain; given safety considerations and off-label status for cognition, modafinil should not be used as a routine memory enhancer outside of research or carefully selected clinical scenarios [^6820cc1c] [^cfa63f52] [^6fb91b18] [^02dc2bee] [^9874a37b].

> Clinical implications and caveats: If considered, use should be time-limited, goal-directed, and accompanied by objective cognitive testing; avoid in patients with psychosis, mania, or significant cardiovascular disease; and prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies for memory complaints, reserving modafinil as an adjunct in select cases with documented deficits and informed consent about uncertain long-term benefits and potential risks [^7928764d] [^4e305f86].

---

Modafinil shows **modest, context-dependent memory benefits** in healthy adults and some clinical populations, but effects are inconsistent across studies and populations [^4e305f86]. In healthy adults, single-dose modafinil can improve working memory and episodic memory, especially under sleep deprivation or high cognitive load [^6820cc1c] [^ec6d265b]. In depression, acute dosing improved episodic and working memory in remitted patients [^cfa63f52] [^b4059a9c]. However, in schizophrenia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and traumatic brain injury, benefits are limited or absent [^6fb91b18] [^07cf30a9] [^02dc2bee]. Modafinil is not FDA-approved for memory enhancement, and long-term safety for this use is unknown; use should be cautious and individualized [^d542e817].

## Memory domains affected by modafinil

Modafinil's memory effects vary by **domain and context**:

| **Memory domain** | **Evidence of improvement** | **Population/study context** |
|-|-|-|
| Working memory | Moderate improvement | - Healthy adults <br/> - Sleep-deprived individuals <br/> - Depression [^6820cc1c] [^ec6d265b] [^cfa63f52] |
| Episodic memory | Moderate improvement | - Healthy adults <br/> - Depression [^6820cc1c] [^cfa63f52] |
| Short-term memory | Limited/inconsistent | - Alcohol dependence <br/> - Healthy adults [^6b83c69a] [^6820cc1c] |
| Long-term memory | Limited evidence | - Healthy adults <br/> - Sleep-deprived individuals [^6820cc1c] [^ec6d265b] |

---

## Populations benefiting from modafinil's memory effects

Certain populations show more consistent memory benefits:

- **Healthy adults**: Single-dose modafinil (100–200 mg) improves working and episodic memory, especially under sleep deprivation or high cognitive load [^6820cc1c] [^ec6d265b].
- **Depression**: Acute dosing improved episodic and working memory in remitted patients [^cfa63f52] [^b4059a9c].
- **Sleep-deprived individuals**: Enhanced working memory and executive function after overnight deprivation [^ec6d265b] [^bd714b0f].

---

## Populations with limited or no memory benefit

Several populations show minimal or no memory benefit:

- **Schizophrenia**: No consistent cognitive improvement; risk of psychosis exacerbation in some studies [^6fb91b18] [^fde05d0b].
- **Chronic fatigue syndrome**: Mixed or negative cognitive effects; no clear memory benefit [^07cf30a9].
- **Traumatic brain injury**: Insufficient evidence for memory improvement [^02dc2bee].

---

## Mechanisms underlying modafinil's memory effects

Modafinil's memory effects likely reflect **multimodal neurochemical modulation**:

- **Dopamine**: Weak DAT inhibition increases extracellular dopamine, enhancing motivation and executive control [^577bb889] [^e1f98a46].
- **Norepinephrine**: Increased noradrenergic tone supports attention and working memory [^577bb889].
- **Glutamate and histamine**: Modulation may promote wakefulness and cognitive processing [^577bb889] [^183caab3].
- **Network connectivity**: Reduced negative coupling between frontoparietal and default mode networks correlates with memory enhancement [^6820cc1c] [^7693d7ba].

---

## Duration and sustainability of memory improvements

Most memory benefits are **acute**, observed within 1–2 hours and fading within 24 hours; chronic benefits are not well established. Long-term safety for cognitive enhancement is unknown, and repeated use may lead to tolerance or adverse effects [^d542e817].

---

## Safety considerations and side effects

Modafinil is generally well tolerated, but **important risks exist**:

- **Common side effects**: Headache, insomnia, anxiety, nausea, palpitations [^1f76e252].
- **Serious risks**: Rare serious rash (SJS/TEN), psychiatric symptoms (mania, psychosis), cardiovascular effects [^b1524289] [^7928764d].
- **Abuse potential**: Low but not negligible; schedule IV status reflects this risk [^499958d8].

---

## Comparison with other cognitive enhancers

Compared with other enhancers, modafinil's memory effects are **moderate and more selective** than methylphenidate or amphetamine, with fewer side effects and lower abuse potential, but also less consistent benefit across populations [^4e305f86].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Modafinil is **not FDA-approved** for memory enhancement. Use should be cautious, individualized, and reserved for select cases after weighing risks and benefits. It may be considered off-label for specific deficits (e.g. sleep-related cognitive impairment) when first-line strategies fail.

---

Modafinil can **modestly improve working and episodic memory** in healthy adults and some clinical populations, especially with sleep deprivation or high demand, but effects are inconsistent and not guaranteed. It is not approved for memory enhancement, and long-term safety is uncertain; clinicians should use it selectively and monitor for adverse effects.

### The potential procognitive effects of modafinil in major depressive disorder: a systematic review [^b4059a9c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting drug, in major depressive disorder (MDD), with a specific focus on the putative procognitive effects of modafinil.

Data Sources

A database search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase was conducted. No date limits were applied (the end date of the search was October 26, 2018), and only articles in English were included. The following search terms were used: modafinil, depression, depress*, major depressive disorder, cognition, cognitive dysfunction, and cogniti*.

Study Selection

Studies included were placebo-controlled or open-label trials of modafinil in MDD populations. Participants had to be diagnosed with MDD via DSM-IV or DSM-5 criteria, and no other interventions other than standard antidepressant treatment could be used in the trial. Overall, 540 articles were screened, 22 full-text research articles for inclusion criteria were assessed, and 12 studies were included in this review.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of publications.

Results

Modafinil was associated with improvements in executive functioning after 4 weeks of open-label adjunctive treatment in currently depressed participants. Furthermore, in a placebo-controlled study of remitted MDD participants, modafinil led to rapid improvements in episodic and working memory after a single dose. There were contradictory findings on the subjective effects of modafinil on concentration.

Conclusions

Modafinil shows preliminary evidence of alleviating specific cognitive symptoms in MDD patients, especially in the short term. However, more research using placebo-controlled longitudinal designs is needed to assess the benefits of modafinil, as there are very few studies addressing modafinil and cognition in MDD.

STIMULANTS

Modafinil

Modafinil is a stimulant, pharmacologically distinct from other well-known ones, used to treat symptoms of excessive sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy. It is thought to enhance cognitive performance — the most prevalent loss resulting from a neurodegenerative disease such as AD. Additionally, modafinil improved hippocampal neurogenesis, global mental status, and attention.

Preclinical studies in both mice and rats show that not only does short-term treatment with modafinil promote DG hippocampal neurogenesis and decrease cell death, but also normalizes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, which is known to be deficient in individuals with AD. Other rat studies further demonstrated the behavioral benefits of modafinil on working memory as administration of it increased performance in the Morris Water Maze. These studies did not test the effects of modafinil on AD animal models, which may explain why clinical studies have not been pursued more vigorously.

Clinical evidence for one study concluded that the administration of modafinil did not change apathy in individuals with AD. However, no other AD-related symptomology was directly tested.

No registrations of clinical trials testing the effect of modafinil on AD currently exist.

### Modafinil as an adjunctive treatment of sedation, negative symptoms, and cognition in schizophrenia: a critical review [^fde05d0b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability.

Data Sources

PubMed was searched for trials published in English up to January 2008 evaluating modafinil's effects on fatigue, negative symptoms, and cognition in schizophrenia with combinations of the following terms: schizophrenia, modafinil, cognition, negative symptoms, and fatigue.

Study Selection

Six trials were identified: 2 randomized, prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled trials; 3 randomized, prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials; and 1 open-label pilot study. Case series and case reports were excluded in the data analysis, except to identify potential adverse reactions to modafinil.

Data Extraction

Studies were examined for number of subjects, trial duration, design, dosing, and outcomes with respect to sedation, negative symptoms, cognitive function, and tolerability.

Results

One of 4 reviewed studies found a significant effect of modafinil as an alerting agent for antipsychotic-induced fatigue and sedation. Neither of 2 reviewed studies found modafinil to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Three of 6 reviewed studies showed that modafinil may improve short-term memory, attention, and the ability to shift mental sets. Two neuroimaging studies identified functional correlates in areas associated with working memory functions. The main adverse effect was found to be a small risk of psychosis exacerbation, which was seen in 5 of 83 patients (6.0%) in the active treatment groups as compared to 2 of 70 patients (2.9%) in the placebo groups.

Conclusions

While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia. Well-powered, prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trials using the MATRICS battery concomitantly with functional outcome measures are necessary to elucidate modafinil's efficacy and effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment for sedation, negative symptoms, and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Hence, before prescribing modafinil to a schizophrenia patient, the possible risks and benefits of each particular case should be evaluated.

### Modafinil alters decision making based on feedback history-a randomized placebo-controlled double blind study in humans [^362e0dc7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Modafinil is becoming increasingly popular as a cognitive enhancer. Research on the effects of modafinil on cognitive function have yielded mixed results, with negative findings for simple memory and attention tasks and enhancing effects for more complex tasks. In the present study we examined whether modafinil, due to its known effect on the dopamine level in the striatum, alters feedback-related choice behaviour. We applied a task that separately tests the choice of previously rewarded behaviours (approach) and avoidance of previously punished behaviours. 18 participants received a single dose of 200 mg modafinil. Their performance was compared to a group of 22 participants who received placebo in a double-blind design. Modafinil but not placebo induced a significant bias towards approach behaviour as compared to the frequency of avoidance behaviour. General attention, overall feedback-based acquisition of choice behaviour and reaction times in high vs low conflict choices were not significantly affected by modafinil. This finding suggests that modafinil has a specific effect on dopamine-mediated choice behaviour based on the history of feedback, while a contribution of noradrenaline is also conceivable. The described change in decision making cannot be considered as cognitive enhancement, but might rather have detrimental effects on decisions in everyday life.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^5f014dce]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future research directions

This was an experimental study examining the potential of a single dose of modafinil to mimic or enhance a specific component of behavioural training in healthy volunteers. It is possible that the relatively small effect we observed with modafinil on state mindfulness and the absence of enhancement of strategy effects, reflected our recruitment of participants with intact attentional abilities. Future studies may seek to examine these effects in vulnerable participant groups with impaired capacity to engage in mindfulness training (e.g. those with high levels of rumination, worry, substance use, or poor performance on working memory or attentional tasks). Moreover, future studies might consider simulating clinical treatment more closely by, for example, using multiple sessions of training, and combining these with multiple doses of modafinil. If the apparent modafinil-induced increase in strategy-use during the one-week follow-up is reliable, this might be expected to drive a cumulative effect of modafinil on mindfulness-related outcomes (across several sessions), especially if combined with a more distinctive (relative to the control strategy) mindfulness training than used here.

We used a 2 × 2 design here and it could be argued that in the absence of 'no-strategy' control conditions (for both drug groups, i.e. a 3 × 2 between subjects design), effects attributed to strategy (between T2 and T3) might in fact reflect increasing intensity of modafinil effects over time. This possibility could have been tested by repeating the DEQ at T3 to determine whether effects on the 'feel' item (which is unrelated to mindfulness) remained stable between T2 and T3. Future studies should therefore include suitable no-strategy conditions, or more parsimoniously, at least include more regular assessments of drug effects.

The analysis for one of the main reported findings – the effects of modafinil on strategy-use during the follow-up period – was not pre-specified. Moreover, this outcome was based on retrospective estimation of number and duration of practice occasions, and may therefore be susceptible to memory biases. There are a limited number of plausible bio-psychological mechanisms for such an effect, and as such, this result should be considered provisional, pending replication. We intend to perform such a replication in the future and have pre-specified a test of the effects of modafinil on self-practice during follow-up (see). This study will involve daily monitoring of practice and therefore should be less susceptible to memory biases.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^94668eb0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

The wakefulness-promoting drug, modafinil, which has cognitive- (especially attention-) enhancing properties, may be an example of such an adjunctive treatment. Although the molecular-pharmacological basis of its wakefulness promoting and pro-cognitive effects remain unclear, a range of experimental approaches indicate that modafinil occupies dopamine and noradrenaline transporters (e.g.), suggesting one potential molecular mechanism of action for its clinical effects. Behaviourally, the effects of modafinil (improvements in executive functioning, attention, learning and memory;) seem to resemble improvements in cognition that have been described in some studies of brief mindfulness training (see). Given this resemblance, modafinil might also acutely mimic subjective aspects of the attentional state(s) attained through brief mindfulness training and/or acutely augment the effects of such training.

As a first step to determining whether pharmacological augmentation of mindfulness training might be a clinically viable strategy, the current laboratory-based study used a randomised double-blind, placebo controlled design to examine the acute effects of a brief mindfulness induction combined with a single dose of modafinil. We employed a parsimonious mixed within-between subjects design in which assessment of pharmacological effects were separated from those of a behavioural manipulation, while also allowing their combined effects to be tested (e.g.). Our pre-registered hypotheses were that, compared to an active relaxation control, brief mindfulness training would increase state mindfulness, improve sustained attention and decrease mind wandering. We also predicted that compared to placebo, modafinil would have similar directional effects to brief mindfulness training on these outcomes. Finally, we examined the possibility of additive or synergistic effects between mindfulness and modafinil by testing strategy × drug interactions.

### Effect of modafinil on cognitive functions in alcohol dependent patients: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^6b83c69a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Cognitive deficits are highly prevalent in alcohol-dependent (AD) patients and may have a detrimental impact on treatment response and treatment outcome. Enhancing cognitive functions may improve treatment success. Modafinil is a promising compound in this respect. Therefore, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted with modafinil (300 mg/d) or placebo in 83 AD patients for 10 weeks. Various cognitive functions (digit span task, Tower of London task, Stroop task) were measured at baseline, during and after treatment. Compared to placebo, modafinil improved verbal short-term memory (number of forward digit spans) (p = 0.030), but modafinil exerted a negative effect on the working memory score of the digit span task (p = 0.003). However, subgroup analyses revealed that modafinil did improve both working memory and verbal short-term memory in AD patients with a poor working memory ability at baseline (25% worst performers), whereas no significant treatment effect of modafinil was found on these two dependent variables in patients with good working memory skills at baseline (25% best performers). No effect of modafinil was found on measures of planning (Tower of London task) and selective attention (Stroop task). Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between cognitive remediation and treatment outcome in order to design targeted treatments.

### Management of methamphetamine abuse and dependence [^39f487e9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Preliminary implications for evidence-based treatments and future practice may be drawn from new research findings that inspire a fresh view of methamphetamine dependence and associated medical consequences. Current user populations include increasingly impacted subgroups (ie, youths, women, men who have sex with men, and rural residents); complex consequences of methamphetamine abuse among these subgroups require additional efforts involving contextual understanding of characteristics and needs to develop effective treatments. The neurobiological data on cellular activity of methamphetamine taken with findings from neuroimaging studies indicate potential targets for pharmacologic interventions. In early trials, several candidate medications — bupropion, modafinil, and, to a lesser extent, baclofen — have shown promise in treating aspects of methamphetamine dependence, including aiding memory function necessary to more effectively participate in and benefit from behavioral therapies. Clinicians and researchers must interact to efficiently address the problems of methamphetamine dependence, a major drug problem in the United States and the world.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of modafinil for fatigue and cognition in schizophrenia patients treated with psychotropic medications [^f6a90d67]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of modafinil on fatigue, symptoms, attention, working memory, and executive functioning in schizophrenia patients treated with psychotropic medications.

Method

Twenty-four patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (10 men and 14 women) were randomly assigned to modafinil up to 200 mg a day (N = 13) or placebo (N = 11) as an adjunct therapy in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Data were collected from May 18, 2001 to September 11, 2003.

Results

Four subjects terminated the study early, including one because of worsening of psychosis during the first week taking modafinil. In the modafinil (N = 10) and placebo (N = 10) groups, fatigue improved significantly over time (p < .01), but there were no differences between groups on changes in fatigue, positive and negative symptoms, or cognition.

Conclusion

Fatigue improved in both groups, and there were no differences between groups on changes in fatigue, symptoms, attention, working memory, or executive functioning. Lack of differences between groups may be due to small sample size or possible regression to the mean in the placebo group.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^d212d2d3]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Stimulants like methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine have repeatedly shown to enhance cognitive processes such as attention and memory. However, brain-functional mechanisms underlying such cognitive enhancing effects of stimulants are still poorly characterized. Here, we utilized behavioral and resting-state fMRI data from a double-blind randomized placebocontrolled study of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine in 48 healthy male adults. The results show that performance in different memory tasks is enhanced, and functional connectivity (FC) specifically between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN) is modulated by the stimulants in comparison to placebo. Decreased negative connectivity between right prefrontal and medial parietal but also between medial temporal lobe and visual brain regions predicted stimulant-induced latent memory enhancement. We discuss dopamine's role in attention and memory as well as its ability to modulate FC between large-scale neural networks (e.g. FPN and DMN) as a potential cognitive enhancement mechanism.

### The cognitive effects of modafinil in breast cancer survivors: a randomized clinical trial… [^cc8cd197]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 9004 Background: Patients receiving treatment for cancer can experience a diminution of their cognitive abilities which can persist for many years after. The present study examined the potential of modafinil as a cognitive enhancer on memory and attention in a randomized clinical trial in breast cancer patients following completion of treatment. Tests of memory and attention selected from the Cognitive Drug Research computerized cognitive assessment were performed at baseline and after completing Phase 1 and 2. The difference between scores at baseline and scores at Phase 1 and Phase 2, were subjected to a Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Results: Of the 82 women enrolled, 68 completed all 3 CDR assessments in the study. At the end of Phase 1, modafinil had a significant effect on the Speed of Memory Index and the Digit Vigilance Test but showed no significant effect on Quality of Working Memory nor on Power of Attention. At the end of phase 2, the group that continued modafinil demonstrated improved Mean Continuity of Attention compared with the placebo group and also demonstrated significantly greater improvements in Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory relative to placebo. This improvement was observed at week 4, and was maintained throughout the study. Finally, continued modafinil demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Speed of Memory relative to placebo. Conclusions: Modafinil provides significant improvements in attention and speed of memory for breast cancer patients following their treatment of cancer. Although further study is needed, these findings suggest that modafinil may enhance quality of life in this patient population.

### Randomised controlled cognition trials in remitted patients with mood disorders published between 2015 and 2021: a systematic review by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders targeting cognition task force [^27cc938f]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Methodological advancements and suggestions

Most studies (81%) were evaluated as having either moderate or high risk of bias. In addition to relatively small sample sizes, the common sources of risk of bias were the absence of information on procedures in place to ensure that the allocation sequence was masked until treatment allocation and lack of pre‐selection of one primary cognition outcome. In the previous systematic reviews of cognition trials in mood disorders published before 2015, the risk of bias was high for 44% of the RCTs. In contrast, the risk of bias was high for only one study (6%) in the present review. This indicates an overall shift in the field towards stronger methodology. Nevertheless, some challenges remain, the most notable relating to small sample sizes. Indeed, only six (37.5%) studies had sample sizes of ≥ 60 patients, of which three were of CR, and three were of pharmacological treatments with modafinil, pramipexole and vortioxetine, respectively. The large reported effect sizes in the CR studies for the cognitive improvements on either primaryor secondary, outcomes can thus be considered relatively robust. Further, the medium to large effect size for modafinil‐induced improvement in episodic and working memorytherefore also seems robust – as do the negative findings in the pramipexole and vortioxetine studies. In contrast, the remaining 62.5% of trials may have had suboptimal statistical power and their predominantly negative findings should therefore be considered with caution.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^77bdc2e1]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Stimulants like methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine have repeatedly shown to enhance cognitive processes such as attention and memory. However, brain‐functional mechanisms underlying such cognitive enhancing effects of stimulants are still poorly characterized. Here, we utilized behavioral and resting‐state fMRI data from a double‐blind randomized placebocontrolled study of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine in 48 healthy male adults. The results show that performance in different memory tasks is enhanced, and functional connectivity (FC) specifically between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN) is modulated by the stimulants in comparison to placebo. Decreased negative connectivity between right prefrontal and medial parietal but also between medial temporal lobe and visual brain regions predicted stimulant‐induced latent memory enhancement. We discuss dopamine's role in attention and memory as well as its ability to modulate FC between large‐scale neural networks (e.g. FPN and DMN) as a potential cognitive enhancement mechanism.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^577bb889]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Similar to CAF, MOD is a wakefulness‐promoting agent, meaning it is most often used to stave off the effects of sleep deprivation or excessive daytime sleepiness (Bastoji & Jouvet; Boivin et al; Pigeau et al; Repantis et al.). Its precise mechanism is not entirely known up to date. Similar to MPH, MOD also elevates extracellular levels of catecholamines through inhibition of dopamine and noradrenaline transporters (Franke et al.). However, MOD is believed to additionally affect other neurotransmitter systems such as promoting glutamate, serotonin, histamine pathways (Minzenberg & Carter; Repantis et al.). In general, MOD affects frontal lobe areas (Scoriels et al.for a review) and has been associated with improved attention, vigilance as well as memory and learning (Battleday & Brem; Linssen et al; Müller et al; Randall et al; Repantis et al.).

Although the cognitive enhancement effect of all three stimulants is heavily dose‐dependent (Wood et al.), there seems to be converging evidence that single‐dose intake can improve memory function in a healthy population (for different meta‐analyses, see Ilieva et al; Linssen et al; Repantis et al.). Despite the different primary modes of action of the stimulants, this poses the question whether there is a shared cognitive enhancement effect related to memory. One possible common neurobiological denominator could be that the stimulants directly or indirectly increase the extracellular levels of catecholamines in the brain. Although CAF does not exert its primary actions on the dopamine and noradrenaline systems, unlike MPH and MOD, it is assumed to indirectly modulate them via its antagonistic adenosine A 1 receptors (Manalo & Medina; Nehlig; Volkow et al.). For example, in vitro studies in animals have shown that CAF affects the local release of catecholamines, especially dopamine (Nehlig).

### Effects of modafinil and prazosin on cognitive and physiological functions in healthy volunteers [^2686a460]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Previous research has demonstrated cognitive-enhancing effects of modafinil in humans and generated evidence for its therapeutic potential in psychiatric disorders. The neurochemical basis of these effects remains unresolved although a role for α1-adrenoceptors has been hypothesised. In this within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 12 healthy male adults received modafinil (300 mg), the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (3 mg), both together and placebo on separate occasions at least 5 days apart. Cognitive effects were assessed using a well-validated testing battery focusing on executive and working memory functions. Blood pressure, heart rate and salivary α-amylase (sAA) were measured at hourly intervals. Cognitive effects of modafinil and prazosin were identified at the difficult levels of the One-Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTSOC) planning task. Prazosin antagonized the error-reducing effect of modafinil when the agents were given together. In contrast, the combined agents acted synergistically to increase time taken to complete OTSOC problems compared with placebo. The tachycardic and sAA-elevating effects of prazosin were also potentiated by concurrent modafinil administration. The current data suggest that the cognitive effects of modafinil on performance accuracy and latency are dissociable in terms of their neurochemical mechanisms. Our findings support the hypothesised involvement of α1-adrenoceptors in some of the cognitive-enhancing effects of modafinil and warrant further investigation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The umbrella term cognitive enhancement refers to interventions by which healthy individuals attempt to improve their cognitive functions, for example, attention, cognitive control, or memory (Repantis et al.). Next to cognitive training, the use of psychoactive substances has become a popular way to obtain cognitive enhancement (Franke & Lieb; Talbot). Caffeine (CAF) in the form of caffeine‐containing beverages is probably one of the most widely used prescription‐free psychoactive substance worldwide (Ferré). But also prescription‐stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH, Ritalin®) and modafinil (MOD, Vigil®) are increasingly used by healthy individuals in the attempt to enhance cognition (Battleday & Brem; Compton et al.). The mode of action as well as different cognitive enhancement effects of all three stimulants have been subject to several studies.

The natural stimulant CAF acts as a nonselective antagonist by blocking adenosine A 1 and A 2 receptors increasing energy metabolism (Koppelstaetter et al; Nehlig). Caffeine is most often used and shows strong effects as countermeasure to prolonged wakefulness (Walsh et al; for a review see Irwin et al.). However, beneficial effects of CAF have been also reported on sustained attention, processing speed, vigilance, and memory (Borota et al; Koppelstaetter et al; Nehlig; Ullrich et al; for a critical review on the cognitive effects of caffeine, see James; James & Keane).

MPH functions as a catecholamine reuptake inhibitor increasing extracellular dopamine in prefrontal, striatal, and hippocampal regions and noradrenaline specifically in frontal brain regions by blocking their respective transporters due to binding to it (Berridge et al; Kuczenski & Segal; Spencer et al; Volkow et al.). There is evidence that MPH enhances working memory and memory consolidation while evidence for processing speed, cognitive control, and attention is rather mixed (Caviola & Faber; Linssen et al; Repantis et al.for a review).

### Wake-promoting and EEG spectral effects of modafinil after acute or chronic administration in the R6 / 2 mouse model of Huntington's disease [^183caab3]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent most widely used for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in several neuropsychiatric conditions including narcolepsy and Parkinson's disease. Modafinil evokes its robust wake-promoting effect in the brain by increasing the level of dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, serotonin, histamine, and hypocretin/orexin whilst decreasing the release of GABA. It is also a putative cognitive enhancer although in this respect the literature is controversial. It improves memory, executive function, and increases alertness and response accuracy in healthy subjects. Importantly, the cognitive enhancer effect of modafinil has also been reported in a number of different neurological conditions including schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Modafinil has also been shown to be effective when given as an adjunct to standard treatment for treating mood disorders. This is particularly relevant in HD, since low mood and depression occur in a considerable number of patients. Moreover, pre-symptomatic HD gene–positive individuals with subjective sleep problems have shown significantly poorer neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to those not reporting sleep problems. Thus, targeting sleep-wake disorder with a drug that may also improve cognitive function would potentially be doubly beneficial.

Here we investigate the acute effect of modafinil on sleep and wakefulness at different stages of disease in R6/2 mice. We also administered modafinil chronically for 9 weeks to determine if there was any long-term effect of modafinil on the progression of sleep-wake abnormalities in HD mice. We found that acutely modafinil was wake-promoting in R6/2 mice and reduced the pathologically increased REMS, although the effect waned as the disease progressed. Interestingly, when given chronically, modafinil maintained its wake-promoting effect to end stage, and reduced the pathologically increased gamma oscillations, an effect that persisted after washout.

### The effect of modafinil on fatigue, cognitive functioning, and mood in primary brain tumor patients: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^5d94ef78]. Neuro-Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue, cognitive deficits, and depression are frequently reported but often undertreated symptoms that can profoundly affect daily life in patients with primary brain tumors (PBTs). To evaluate the effects of the psychostimulant modafinil on fatigue, depression, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and cognitive functioning in PBT patients, we performed a multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial.

Methods

Patients randomly received either 6 weeks of treatment with modafinil (up to 400 mg/day) or 6 weeks with placebo. After a 1-week washout period, the opposite treatment was provided. Assessments took place at baseline and immediately after the first and second condition. Patients completed self-report questionnaires on fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength [CIS]), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]), HRQOL (Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]), and self-perceived cognitive functioning (Medical Outcomes Study [MOS]). They also underwent comprehensive neurocognitive testing.

Results

In total, 37 patients participated. Relative to baseline, patients reported lower fatigue severity (CIS) and better motivation (CIS) in both the modafinil (P = 0.010 and P = 0.021, respectively) and the placebo condition (P < .001 and P = 0.027, respectively). The same held for physical health (SF-36 Physical Component Summary score; P = 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively), working memory (P = 0.040 and P = 0.043), and information processing capacity (P = 0.036 and P = 0.040). No improvement in depressive symptoms was found in either condition.

Conclusions

Modafinil did not exceed the effects of placebo with respect to symptom management. Patient accrual was slow, and relatively many patients dropped out during the trial, due mostly to side effects. Other, preferably nonpharmacologic intervention studies should be considered to improve symptom management of PBT patients.

### Cognitive performance following modafinil versus placebo in sleep-deprived emergency physicians: a double-blind randomized crossover study [^ec6d265b]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Modafinil has recently been approved for the treatment of shift work sleep disorder, making it potentially available for shift-working emergency physicians. The authors' objectives were to determine whether modafinil improved cognitive performance of emergency physicians following overnight shifts and to record symptoms and subjective evaluations of the effect of modafinil on the participants.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study that followed CONSORT guidelines. Participants were assigned to one of two study groups, with study sessions occurring at least seven weeks apart, and received either modafinil or placebo depending on their random allocation. Testing after night shifts included a coding task and an AX version of the Continuous Performance Task, both of which test cognitive function. Participants also completed visual analog scales for three subjective outcomes, and symptoms were elicited.

Results

Modafinil facilitated performance on long interstimulus-interval AX trials (F [1, 23] = 6.65, p = 0.1) and marginally reduced errors on AY trials in the Continuous Performance Task (F [1, 23] = 3.59, p = 0.07), suggesting facilitation of sustained attention, cognitive control, and working memory. Additionally, modafinil, compared with placebo, facilitated performance on the coding task at the first session. Subjective data from visual analog scales confirmed that modafinil increased perceived alertness during the simulated patient care sessions but worsened sleep onset when opportunities for sleep arose.

Conclusions

Modafinil increased certain aspects of cognitive function and subjectively improved participants' ability to attend post-night-shift didactic sessions but made it more difficult for participants to fall asleep when opportunities for sleep arose.

### Pharmacologic management of cognitive impairment induced by cancer therapy [^c8569a7b]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction is a challenging adverse effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that has limited treatment options. Clinical trials for proposed pharmacotherapeutic interventions to help manage these cognitive symptoms have had conflicting results and no standard of care has yet been established. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches for cancer therapy-induced cognitive symptoms include CNS stimulants (eg, methylphenidate and modafinil), medications used in patients with memory impairment (eg, donepezil, memantine, and ginkgo biloba), and bone marrow supporting agents (eg, erythropoietin). Whilst the beneficial effects of CNS stimulants have been mainly reported in children, efficacy in adults has been varied. Antidementia drugs have emerged as promising compounds in the management of cognitive dysfunction, but clinical experience of their use remains limited. Therefore, large clinical trials for these putative memory-enhancing drugs are needed to establish their clinical value in an oncology setting. Several clinical trials testing novel pharmacotherapeutic interventions for the management of cognitive dysfunction are ongoing, as well as numerous preclinical studies. With an increasing understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in patients with cancer, novel treatment strategies are emerging.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^841d0d0d]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive dysfunction in major depressive disorder (MDD) encompasses several domains, including but not limited to executive function, verbal memory, and attention. Furthermore, cognitive dysfunction is a frequent residual manifestation in depression and may persist during the remitted phase. Cognitive deficits may also impede functional recovery, including workforce performance, in patients with MDD. The overarching aims of this opinion article are to critically evaluate the effects of available antidepressants as well as novel therapeutic targets on neurocognitive dysfunction in MDD.

Discussion

Conventional antidepressant drugs mitigate cognitive dysfunction in some people with MDD. However, a significant proportion of MDD patients continue to experience significant cognitive impairment. Two multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant, has significant precognitive effects in MDD unrelated to mood improvement. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was shown to alleviate executive dysfunction in an RCT of adults after full or partial remission of MDD. Preliminary evidence also indicates that erythropoietin may alleviate cognitive dysfunction in MDD. Several other novel agents may be repurposed as cognitive enhancers for MDD treatment, including minocycline, insulin, antidiabetic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, S-adenosyl methionine, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, modafinil, galantamine, scopolamine, N-acetylcysteine, curcumin, statins, and coenzyme Q10.

Summary

The management of cognitive dysfunction remains an unmet need in the treatment of MDD. However, it is hoped that the development of novel therapeutic targets will contribute to 'cognitive remission', which may aid functional recovery in MDD.

### Delaying memory decline: different options and emerging solutions [^83780bef]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Novel drugs for memory enhancement

Indeed, "classical" neuroenhancement drugs, such as methylphenidate and modafinil actually improve memory, and negative side effects such as abuse are comparatively low.

Similarly, a systematic review tackling newer active drugs for cognitive enhancement found a memory ameliorating effect of melatonin and acetyl salicylic acid, but also admits that most of the studied drugs showed negative results.

We, therefore, would like to report on some novel drugs that are generally not categorized as memory-enhancing. We first focus on EPO as a powerful treatment option in different mental and neurodegenerative diseases that are accompanied by memory deficits.

Better known as a doping drug in sports, increasing physical performance by boosting the number of red blood cells, the hormone EPO has been shown to additionally offer cognition-enhancing and brain-mass-protecting effects independently of its hematopoietic role. In the last few years, a positive impact on cognition and hippocampal long-term potentiation in healthy human volunteers and rodents was found. In a study on EPO as a treatment option for memory impairment in neuropsychiatric diseases, recombinant human EPO could consistently improve memory and cognition in patients with multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder. While most of the studies on depression even demonstrated a beneficial impact on mood and behavioral symptoms, this did not correlate with improvement in memory function, and other investigations did not confirm an antidepressant-like effect. However, EPO produced a mood-independent enhancement of verbal memory even 6 weeks after treatment completion when red blood cell levels were again normal.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we investigated stimulant‐induced effects of MPH, MOD, and CAF on memory and related FC. Despite their different modes of action, all three stimulants are considered cognitive neuroenhancers due to their positive effects on attention, cognitive control and specifically memory (Franke & Lieb; for a critical review on this matter, see Repantis et al.). However, mnemonic and brain‐functional effects of cognitive neuroenhancers (e.g. MPH, MOD, and CAF) are usually studied separately. While this expands our knowledge of stimulant‐specific effects on behavior and brain function, the question remains, whether there are shared cognitive enhancement effects over and above the individual stimulant. We speculated that one cognitive enhancement mechanism could be the stimulants' direct or indirect impact on extracellular levels of catecholamines in the brain. Specifically, dopamine has been shown to shape large‐scale neural networks including prefrontal regions underlying cognitive functions. For this reason, we utilized behavioral and resting state fMRI data from a double‐blind randomized placebocontrolled study (see Repantis et al.) and investigated the combined effects of MPH, MOD and CAF on memory and FC at rest (Repantis et al.). We hypothesized that memory performance should increase and large‐scale neural networks including prefrontal regions should be modulated as a function of all three stimulants. Additionally, we assumed that stimulant‐induced FC changes specific to memory should involve medial temporal lobe structures due to their consistent association with memory formation (for a meta‐analysis, see Grady).

4.5 Biological interventions: Preliminary targets

The identified neuromodulation studies provided mixed and preliminary evidence. The rationale for investigating potential pro‐cognitive effects of tDCS and rTMS is their assumed induction of neuroplastic changes through adjustment of the strength of synaptic transmissionand evidence for working memory enhancing effects in schizophrenia. Specifically, tDCS is presumed to enhance excitatory synaptic transmission by stimulating cortical glutamate and suppressing gamma‐aminobutyric acid transmission and modulating monoamine and acetylcholine expression. However, their neurobiological mechanisms are still unclear and the evidence from the identified trials must be considered with caution.

Two, of the seven pharmacological studies showed some cognitive benefits. Acute administration of modafinil improved episodic memory and working memory, while 6 weeks of lurasidone improved global cognition. The effects of modafinil were observed with an acute administration in a highly controlled setting, which renders it unclear whether longer ‐ term modafinil treatment is safe or would induce lasting cognitive improvements. The cognitive benefits are likely to result from increased wakefulness due to stimulation of the histamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and orexin systems. While some evidence suggests that modafinil may also have neuroprotective effects, such effects would only occur on a longer timescale. The cognitive improvement after lurasidone treatmentshould also be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (N = 30) and lack of a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled design. Lurasidone is a full antagonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5‐HT2A and 5‐HT7 receptors and a partial agonist at the 5‐HT1A receptor, which are purported mechanisms of cognitive benefits for some neuroleptic drugs. While preliminary, the lurasidone‐associated cognitive improvement thus provides hypothesis‐generating evidence for cognitive benefits of prolonged modulation of serotonin and dopamine signalling.

### Adjunct armodafinil improves wakefulness and memory in obstructive sleep apnea / hypopnea syndrome [^0cde803c]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Armodafinil is the R-enantiomer of racemic modafinil and has a significantly longer half-life than the S-enantiomer. This study evaluated armodafinil 150 mg/day as an adjunct treatment for residual excessive sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSA/HS) who were otherwise well controlled with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). We assessed the ability of armodafinil to improve wakefulness and cognition and reduce fatigue in this population.

Methods

In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind study, patients (n = 259) received armodafinil (150 mg) or placebo once daily. Efficacy assessments at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 included the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Cognitive Drug Research battery, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Brief Fatigue Inventory.

Results

At final visit, mean (SD) MWT sleep latency increased from baseline by 2.3 (7.8) min with armodafinil and decreased by 1.3 (7.1) min in the placebo group (P = 0.0003). Armodafinil improved clinical condition (CGI-C, 71% vs. 53% for armodafinil and placebo, respectively; P = 0.0069). Armodafinil significantly improved episodic secondary memory (P = 0.0102) and patient-estimated wakefulness (P < 0.01) and reduced fatigue (P < 0.05) compared with placebo. Armodafinil did not adversely affect nCPAP use. The most common adverse event associated with armodafinil was headache. Sleep macroarchitecture was not altered by armodafinil.

Conclusion

Adjunct treatment with armodafinil significantly improved alertness, overall clinical condition, and long-term memory. Armodafinil also reduced fatigue and the impact of sleepiness on daily activities in patients with OSA/HS who have residual excessive sleepiness notwithstanding regular use of nCPAP. Armodafinil was well tolerated.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^e086805a]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

However, up to date there are no studies investigating the cognitive enhancement effect of different stimulants in neither memory nor FC. To fill this gap, we used resting state fMRI and memory related behavioral data from a double blind randomized placebocontrolled study (Repantis et al.). In this study, 48 male participants were randomized into three groups receiving a stimulant (CAF, MOD, and MPH) or a placebo first in two separate sessions. Next to fMRI data acquisition, the participants performed a series of cognitive tasks including different memory tasks (see Section 2 and Repantis et al.).

Given prior evidence, we assumed enhanced performance in memory tests as a function of all three stimulants. Due to the reported widespread effects of MPH, MOD, and CAF on FC, we chose an agnostic, data‐driven approach employing whole brain FC analyses on resting state fMRI data. However, since all three stimulants have repeatedly shown to affect prefrontal areas, we assumed that stimulant‐induced changes in large‐scale neural networks should involve prefrontal cortices. Additionally, stimulant‐induced FC changes specific to memory should involve medial temporal lobe structures including the hippocampus, due to its consistent association with successful memory formation (Ranganath et al; for a meta‐analysis, see Grady; Wais).

4.3 Limitations

It is worth mentioning three study limitations that may reduce the generalizability and interpretability of the results. First, only male participants were recruited to avoid differential menstrual cycle effects on the two study sessions 7 days apart. This selectivity also reduces study‐irrelevant within‐subject variability regarding the rs‐fMRI data (Lisofsky et al.). However, research including women is necessary to test whether the stimulant‐induced behavioral and FC results generalize to the whole population. Similarly, we only included participants with no to low/irregular caffeine consumption into the study to avoid cognitive and physiological side effects due to caffeine withdrawal during the time period of the experiment (see James; James & Rogers). However, about 90% of the general U.S. population report to regularly consume caffeine (Meredith et al.).

Second, the sample size per stimulant group (n = 16) was rather low, thus complicating any interpretation of differential effects of any of the three stimulant. We did not find evidence for systematic differences between the groups in the sense that one stimulant group was driving the obtained overall results on memory and FC. However, given that the combined cognitive enhancement effect of all three stimulant groups only explained about 4%–10% of the variance in memory, it cannot be excluded that there are systematic differences between the stimulant groups if the group size was increased (e.g. n = 100).

Third, we only used self‐reports to screen the participants for confounding variables such as caffeine, prescription stimulant or illicit substance consumption or sleep quality. More objective measures such as sleep diaries or actigraphy to evaluate participants' sleeping patterns as well as a urine drug screen prior to testing would have been a better control for those confounding variables.

### Pharmacological targeting of cognitive impairment in depression: recent developments and challenges in human clinical research [^e1f98a46]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Dopaminergic modulators

A large body of evidence supports the regulatory role of dopaminergic signalling in cognitive functioning. Consistent with this, pharmacological manipulation of dopaminergic signalling function with piribedil (D 2 and D 3 receptor agonist) and methylphenidate (inhibitor of dopamine transporters [DAT]) results in well-replicated improvements in cognitive performance in healthy individuals. It is therefore interesting to consider whether dopaminergic antidepressant agents, such as bupropion, might have the potential as treatments for cognitive impairment in MDD.

Bupropion (which inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and noradrenaline) has been shown to improve cognitive function in MDD when taken as an adjunct to other antidepressants or as monotherapy. For example, improved visual and verbal memory and executive functioning was observed in patients with MDD after 8-week administration (N = 36), although this effect was not apparent in a separate study of healthy volunteers.

Modafinil (which has a complex mechanism of action, including weak inhibition of dopamine reuptake) has also been shown to have pro-cognitive effects in patients with depression. In currently depressed patients 4-weeks administration of modafinil improved executive function (N = 31). In patients who have recovered from depression, modafinil was shown to improve episodic memory but not executive functioning after one week in remitted depression (N = 60). This evidence is consistent with multiple studies in healthy adults demonstrating broad improvements in verbal and visuospatial working memory, learning, attention and executive functioning following modafinil administration.

Although modafinil and bupropion overlap mechanistically as inhibitors of DAT, bupropion acts on ≤ 22% of DAT binding sites, while modafinil produces weak atypical inhibition of DAT. Bupropion also blocks the reuptake of noradrenaline, with downstream modulation of tumour necrosis factor alpha and upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in MDD, which may be an alternative intra- and extracellular mechanism by which it exerts its antidepressant and cognitive effects. Similarly, the cognitive effects of modafinil may be explained by intracellular actions, including decreased neuronal free radicals, adenosine 5′-triphosphate production, and promotion of cellular metabolism. Further, given the role of the mesolimbic-dopamine circuitry in reward processing and motivation, it is important to consider the extent to which the cognitive effects of bupropion and modafinil are related to non-specific changes in motivation and affect.

### Innovative mechanisms of action for pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement: a systematic review [^c3bba286]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacological cognitive enhancement refers to improvement in cognitive functions after drug use in healthy individuals. This popular topic attracts attention both from the general public and the scientific community. The objective was to explore innovative mechanisms of psychostimulant's action, whose potential effectiveness was assessed in randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic review was carried out, using the words "attention", "memory", "learning", "executive functions", and "vigilance/wakefulness" combined to "cognitive enhancer" or "smart drug". Methylphenidate, amphetamines, modafinil, nicotine, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and antidepressants were extensively studied in previous meta-analyses and were not included in the present work. Drugs were classified according to their primary mode of action, namely catecholaminergic drugs (tolcapone, pramipexole, guanfacine), cholinergic drugs (anticholinergics), glutamatergic drugs (ampakines), histaminergic drugs, and non-specified (glucocorticoids). Overall, 50 RCTs were included in the present review. In conclusion, a number of new active drugs were found to improve some cognitive functions, in particular verbal episodic memory. However the number of RCTs was limited, and most of the studies found negative results. Future studies should assess both effectiveness and tolerance of repeated doses administration, and individual variability in dose response (including baseline characteristics and potential genetic polymorphisms). One explanation for the limited number of recent RCTs with new psychostimulants seems to be the ethical debate surrounding pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement in healthy subjects.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^7693d7ba]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

We investigated cognitive enhancement effects of stimulants (CAF, MPH, and MOD) on memory and related large‐scale neural networks. Our preliminary results indicate that reduced negative FC between the FPN and DMN as well as between visual and MTL regions reflect a cognitive enhancement effect on the neural system‐level specific to stimulant‐induced memory enhancement. Further research is required to test, whether those enhanced memory‐related changes in FC are generalizable to other pharmacological neuroenhancers. Finally, further research is required to investigate the shared stimulant‐induced effects on different neurotransmitter systems such as catecholamines (dopamine) that give rise to such large‐scale neural‐network changes.

### Interventions for preventing and ameliorating cognitive deficits in adults treated with cranial irradiation [^7b0fc5d6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive deficits are common in people who have received cranial irradiation and have a serious impact on daily functioning and quality of life. The benefit of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of cognitive deficits in this population is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing or ameliorating cognitive deficits in adult patients treated with cranial irradiation.

Search Methods

In August 2014. we searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO and checked the reference lists of included studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov, the Physicians Data Query and the Meta Register of Controlled Trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions in cranial irradiated adults, with objective cognitive functioning as a primary or secondary outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JD, KZ) independently extracted data from selected studies and carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment. Cognitive function, fatigue and mood outcomes were reported. No data were pooled.

Main Results

Sixteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review, six of which were included. Three studies investigated prevention and three studies investigated amelioration. Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta-analysis was not possible. Two studies investigated a pharmacological intervention for the prevention of cognitive deficits; memantine compared with placebo, and d-threo-methylphenidate HCL compared with placebo. In the first study the primary cognitive outcome of memory at six months did not reach significance, but there was significant improvement in overall cognitive function compared to placebo, with similar adverse events across groups. The second study found no statistically significant difference between arms, with few adverse events. The third study investigated a rehabilitation program for the prevention of cognitive deficits but did not carry out a statistical comparison of cognitive performance between groups. Three studies investigated the use of a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of cognitive deficits; methylphenidate compared with modafinil, two different doses of modafinil, and donepezil compared with placebo. The first study found improvements in cognitive function in both the methylphenidate and modafinil arms; few adverse events were reported. The second study combined treatment arms and found improvements across all cognitive tests, however, a number of adverse events were reported. Both studies were limited by a small sample size. The third study did not find an improvement in the primary cognitive outcome of overall performance, but did find improvement in an individual test of memory, compared to placebo; adverse events were not reported. No non-pharmacological studies for the amelioration of cognitive deficits were eligible. There were a number of limitations across studies but few without high risks of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There is supportive evidence that memantine may help prevent cognitive deficits for adults with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation. There is supportive evidence that donepezil may have a role in treating cognitive deficits in adults with primary or metastatic brain tumours who have been treated with cranial irradiation. Patient withdrawal affected the statistical power of both studies. Further research that tries to minimise the withdrawal of consent, and subsequently reduce the requirement for imputation procedures, may offer a higher quality of evidence. There is no strong evidence to support any non-pharmacological interventions (medical or cognitive/behavioural) in the prevention or amelioration of cognitive deficits. Non-randomised studies appear promising but are as yet to be conclusive via translation into high quality evidence. Further research is required.

### Effect of pharmacological enhancement on the cognitive and clinical psychomotor performance of sleep-deprived doctors: a randomized controlled trial [^bd714b0f]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of modafinil 200 mg on the performance of a cohort of healthy male doctors after 1 night of supervised sleep deprivation.

Summary Background Data

Sleep-deprived and fatigued doctors pose a safety risk to themselves and their patients. Yet, because of the around-the-clock nature of medical practice, doctors frequently care for patients after periods of extended wakefulness or during circadian troughs. Studies suggest that a group of substances may be capable of safely and effectively reversing the effects of fatigue. However, little work has been done to investigate their role within our profession.

Methods

We conducted a parallel, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study to investigate the effect of pharmacological enhancement on performance doctors. Thirty-nine healthy male resident doctors received either lactose placebo (n = 19) or modafinil 200 mg (n = 20) after 1 night of sleep deprivation. A selection of CANTAB neuropsychological tests was used to assess higher cognitive function. Clinical psychomotor performance was assessed using the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer Virtual Reality. Assessments were carried out between 6.00 AM and approximately 8.00 AM.

Results

Modafinil improved performance on tests of higher cognitive function; participants in the modafinil group worked more efficiently when solving working memory (F1,38 = 5.24, P = 0.028) and planning (F1,38 = 4.34, P = 0.04) problems, were less-impulsive decision makers (F1,37 = 6.76, P = 0.01), and were more able to flexibly redirect their attention (F1,38 = 4.64, P = 0.038). In contrast, no improvement was seen in tests of clinical psychomotor performance.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that fatigued doctors might benefit from pharmacological enhancement in situations that require efficient information processing, flexible thinking, and decision making under time pressure. However, no improvement is likely to be seen in the performance of basic procedural tasks.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^ca801d9a]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Memory task of visual material

In a declarative memory task, participants were exposed to 72 common nouns. The encoding difficulty was matched between lists and pretested. Based on previous research, word lists counting about 70 words prevent ceiling effects (Riedel & Blokland). The words were presented in 12 blocks (six words each) inside the scanner. Each word was presented for 2000 ms with a jittered inter stimulus interval of 2–5 s. Blocks were interspersed with fixation periods. An early recall was performed outside the scanner ~20 min after learning phase.

The FPN comprises regions such as the anterior insular cortex, anterior prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal and dorsomedial superior frontal cortex/anterior cingulate and the anterior inferior parietal lobule (Dang et al.). It has been primarily associated with attention and cognitive control (Badre & D'Esposito; Cabeza et al; Dodds, Morein‐Zamir, & Robbins; Scolari, Seidl‐Rathkopf, & Kastner). However, Iidaka et al. have shown evidence that this network is also associated with successful retrieval in episodic memory (Iidaka et al.). FC within the FPN has been shown to be modulated by different stimulants such as MOD (Esposito et al; Visser et al.); CAF (Haller et al; Koppelstaetter et al.) and MPH (Mehta et al; Mueller et al.). In fact, Schmidt and colleagues report a broad recruitment of frontoparietal regions when MOD and MPH are consumed compared with placebo (Schmidt et al.).

At rest, the DMN typically exhibits anticorrelated activity with the FPN as we have observed in cluster 1 in the placebo condition (Chai et al; Fox et al; Uddin et al.). Importantly however, the FPN has been found to flexibly couple with the DMN, depending on the task domain supporting goal‐directed cognitive processes (Spreng et al.). Dopaminergic signal transmission may function as one underlying mechanism in this regard. Evidence suggests that dopamine enhances coupling between the FPN and DMN at rest (Dang et al.). This finding is in line with our assumption that one neurobiological denominator of the cognitive enhancement effect could lie in the stimulants' ability to increase extracellular levels of catecholamines (e.g. dopamine, noradrenaline) in the brain. Catecholaminergic innervations range across the brain with high overlapping concentrations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (for review see Ranjbar‐Slamloo & Fazlali). Hence, it may be the ability of specifically FPN's right prefrontal hubs to flexibly couple and decouple from the DMN depending on the task demands that relate to the cognitive enhancement effects associated with all three stimulants (CAF, MOD, and MPH).

3.4 Candidate pharmacological interventions

Seven studies examined the potential cognitive benefits of add‐on pharmacological interventions in partially remitted MDD or BD patients with samples ranging N = 31–151 (Table 2)., Three included assessments of psychosocial function, and four of subjective cognition., One crossover study in BD patients investigated the effects of methylene blue, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase with putative effects on neuroplasticity, which has also been found to improve hypotension. Methylene blue was administered in three doses per day for 12 weeks (n = 17) versus placebo (n = 20), with cognition measures as secondary outcomes (the primary outcome was residual mood symptoms). In total, 73% of the participants completed the study, with dropouts being primarily due to symptom fluctuations and mood episodes during the 6‐month long trial period. The study revealed no significant‐related cognitive improvements after methylene blue versus placebo treatment, despite beneficial effects on residual depression and anxiety symptoms (psychosocial function not assessed).

The second study investigated the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation, which is an omega‐3 fatty acid, with five capsules (1250 mg) DHA per day for 12 weeks (n = 13) versus placebo (n = 18) in BD (and in healthy controls). No cognition measure was defined as the primary outcome, and the attrition rate was also not specified. The study revealed no significant cognitive or functional improvements in DHA versus placebo‐treated patients and no associations between cognition and subsyndromal mood symptoms.

The third study investigated the acute effects of a single dose of modafinil (200 mg) (n = 30) versus placebo (n = 30) in MDD. Eight cognition measures from four computerised cognitive tests were defined as primary outcomes, while nine measures were defined as secondary outcomes. All participants completed the study. Modafinil‐treated patients showed enhanced episodic memory and working memory with medium to large effect sizes relative to those given placebo but not in other aspects of cognition. These effects occurred in the absence of group differences in subsyndromal mood symptoms or subjective cognitive change and prevailed after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^53fb8f0f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We show that it is possible to acutely increase state mindfulness using a pharmacological, rather than behavioural strategy. The absence of differential strategy effects reported here suggests that future studies should employ more distinctive strategy instructions. Although we found no evidence for specific augmentation of mindfulness by modafinil, methodological improvements in future studies may allow such additive/synergistic effects to be detected. Translational studies that test these combined effects in 'sub-clinical' participants (e.g. those with impaired attentional performance or low trait mindfulness) are likely to be particularly informative in determining whether MBIs can be supported pharmacologically with modafinil or similar drugs in clinical groups.

### Pharmacotherapy for residual excessive sleepiness and cognition in CPAP-treated patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c76680de]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy has been used as an adjunct to CPAP for treatment of residual excessive sleepiness in patients with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). However, no studies with a high level of evidence have been conducted to support this practice and confirm its effectiveness. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize and quantify the effects of pharmacological treatment in adults with OSAS who experience residual excessive sleepiness despite adequate CPAP use. We reviewed clinical trials that compared medications to placebo and evaluated the outcomes residual excessive sleepiness, cognition, and quality of life, as well as treatment effectiveness and safety. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL, and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched using highly sensitive search strategies. Trials were only included if measures were taken to ensure effective CPAP treatment. Eight randomized clinical trials were included. Pharmacotherapy with modafinil and armodafinil led to improvement of excessive daytime sleepiness, attention/alertness, and clinical condition as measured with the CGI-C. No improvements in quality of life or other cognitive domains (including memory, executive function, and language) could be confirmed. Pharmacotherapy did not cause any severe adverse effects, but was associated with significant dropout rates as compared with placebo. In conclusion, although our results demonstrate the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment as an adjunct to CPAP, further investigation is necessary to improve confidence in its effects. Many findings on the impact of pharmacotherapy on cognition and quality of life were evaluated through analysis of single studies, with heterogeneity in tests and absence of standardization, which reduced certainty as to whether actual improvement occurred in these outcomes.

### Advances in multiple sclerosis research in 2009 [^ea9601ad]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Teriflunomide is one of a number of oral MS therapeutics being tested in phase III clinical trials at the moment. Merrill et al. tested the efficacy of this anti-inflammatory drug, which targets a mitochondrial enzyme important for the de novo pyrimidine synthesis, in a chronic relapsing animal model for MS. Teriflunomide administered to DA rats at disease onset or at the onset of remission prompted a more rapid recovery or reduced the severity of a clinical relapse, respectively. Clinical improvements were accompanied by fewer inflammatory infiltrates and less demyelination and axonal damage in histopathology.

Neuropsychological deficits in MS include impairments in both processing speed and memory and affect 40–60% of patients. In a placebo-controlled double-blind trial by Morrow et al. patients with cognitive dysfunctions were randomized to-amphetamine sulfate or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. No significant differences were observed in the subjective rating of cognition or in measured processing speed, which were the primary functions tested in the study. However, cognitively impaired MS patients on-amphetamine significantly improved on auditory/verbal and visual/spatial memory tests.

Fatigue is one of the most frequent symptoms in patients with MS and a considerable number of MS patients consider fatigue to be their most serious symptom. Treatment options include various medications such as modafinil, as well as non-pharmacological interventions. The effect of modafinil treatment on fatigue was studied by Lange et al. in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Modafinil treatment reduced fatigue, improved focused attention and also enhanced fine motoric performances and cognitive tasks in their study.

### Pharmacotherapy for chronic cognitive impairment in traumatic brain injury [^02dc2bee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of chronic disability. Worldwide, it is the leading cause of disability in the under 40s, resulting in severe disability in some 150 to 200 million people per annum. In addition to mood and behavioural problems, cognition-particularly memory, attention and executive function-are commonly impaired by TBI. Cognitive problems following TBI are one of the most important factors in determining people's subjective well-being and their quality of life. Drugs are widely used in an attempt to improve cognitive functions. Whilst cholinergic agents in TBI have been reviewed, there has not yet been a systematic review or meta-analysis of the effect on chronic cognitive problems of all centrally acting pharmacological agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of centrally acting pharmacological agents for treatment of chronic cognitive impairment subsequent to traumatic brain injury in adults.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS-the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register-on 16 November 2013, 23 February 2013, 20 January 2014, and 30 December 2014 using the terms: traumatic OR TBI OR "brain injury" OR "brain injuries" OR TBIs OR "axonal injury" OR "axonal injuries". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Supplementary searches were also performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, LILACs, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal (ICTRP) and Web of Science with conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of any one centrally acting pharmacological agent that affects one or more of the main neurotransmitter systems in people with chronic traumatic brain injury; and there had to be a minimum of 12 months between the injury and entry into the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations obtained from the search. Relevant articles were retrieved for further assessment. A bibliographic search of relevant papers was conducted. We extracted data using a standardised tool, which included data on the incidence of adverse effects. Where necessary we requested additional unpublished data from study authors. Risk of bias was assessed by a single author.

Main Results

Only four studies met the criteria for inclusion, with a total of 274 participants. Four pharmacological agents were investigated: modafinil (51 participants); (-)-OSU6162, a monoamine stabiliser (12 participants of which six had a TBI); atomoxetine (60 participants); and rivastigmine (157 participants). A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the small number and heterogeneity of the studies. All studies examined cognitive performance, with the majority of the psychometric sub-tests showing no difference between treatment and placebo (n = 274, very low quality evidence). For (-)-OSU6162 modest superiority over placebo was demonstrated on three measures, but markedly inferior performance on another. Rivastigmine was better than placebo on one primary measure, and a single cognitive outcome in a secondary analysis of a subgroup with more severe memory impairment at baseline. The study of modafinil assessed clinical global improvement (n = 51, low quality evidence), and did not find any difference between treatment and placebo. Safety, as measured by adverse events, was reported by all studies (n = 274, very low quality evidence), with significantly more nausea reported by participants who received rivastigmine compared to placebo. There were no other differences in safety between treatment and placebo. No studies reported any deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether pharmacological treatment is effective in chronic cognitive impairment in TBI. Whilst there is a positive finding for rivastigmine on one primary measure, all other primary measures were not better than placebo. The positive findings for (-)-OSU6162 are interpreted cautiously as the study was small (n = 6). For modafinil and atomoxetine no positive effects were found. All four drugs appear to be relatively well tolerated, although evidence is sparse.

### Modafinil in sports: ethical considerations [^c9deebea]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Performance enhancing agents are prohibited in athletic competition so that only athletic skills can determine outcomes. Modafinil is a novel non-addicting psychostimulant approved for treatment of narcolepsy. Does its use, especially for medical indications, violate the Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code? This is discussed with reference to a current high profile case.

2.4.1 Analysis of single memory tasks

To analyze the stimulant‐induced changes on memory, we first analyzed the outcome measures for each memory task separately in a General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) (for a discussion of the advantages using the GLMM approach, see Barr et al; Baayen et al.). The memory measures which served as dependent variables for the single GLMMs were (1) d ′ from the implicit memory task; (2–3) the amount of correctly remembered items in the memory task of visual material during early (early_visRecall) and late recall (late_visRecall); (4–5) the amount of correctly remembered items in the memory task of audio material during early (early_audRecall) and late recall (late_audRecall) and (6–7) the amount of falsely remembered critical lures (false memories) in the memory task of audio material during early (early_false_audRecall) and late recall (late_false_audRecall). The d ′ was modeled assuming a Gaussian error distribution. Except for d ′, all other outcome measures (2–7) were count variables which is why we modeled those variables assuming a Poisson error distribution of the model residuals with the default log link function (Gardner et al.).

The main independent variable of interest was the condition (binary: stimulant vs. placebo). Other covariates of no interest included into the model were (1) the group (a categorical variable indicating the specific stimulant group MOD, MPH or CAF) and (2) the medication order (a categorical variable indicating in which order the participants received either the placebo or the stimulant first). Subjects were modeled as random intercepts.

To assess the influence of the condition (stimulant vs. placebo) on all seven memory outcome measures, we performed likelihood ratio tests of the full model with the condition variable against the baseline model without the condition variable. The baseline model included the group variable, order (stimulant or placebo in first session) and the random subject effect. The full model was identical to the baseline model with the exception of the additional condition variable. The p ‐values for the individual models were obtained from likelihood ratio tests. Additionally, all obtained p ‐values from the likelihood ratio tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (Benjamini & Hochberg).

### Modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders [^6fb91b18]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with schizophrenia have a range of different symptoms, including positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal and lack of affect), and cognitive impairment. The standard medication for people with schizophrenia is antipsychotics. However, these medications may not be effective for all symptoms of schizophrenia, as cognitive and negative symptoms are usually hard to treat. Additional therapies or medications are available for the management of these symptoms. Modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent most frequently used in narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder, is one intervention that is theorised to have an effect of these symptoms.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.

Search Methods

On 27 April 2015, 24 May 2017, and 31 October 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials, which is based on regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for the inclusion of records in the register.

Selection Criteria

We selected all randomised controlled trials comparing modafinil with placebo or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently extracted data from the included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis. We used GRADE to complete a 'Summary of findings' table and assessed risk of bias for the included studies.

Main Results

Eleven studies including a total of 422 participants contributed to data analyses. Most studies had a small population size (average 38 people per study) and were of short duration. We also detected a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting in just under 50% of the trials. We therefore rated the overall methodological quality of the included studies as low. We considered seven main outcomes of interest: clinically important change in overall mental state, clinically important change in cognitive functioning, incidence of a clinically important adverse effect/event, clinically important change in global state, leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in quality of life, and hospital admission. All studies assessed the effects of adding modafinil to participants' usual antipsychotic treatment compared to adding placebo to usual antipsychotic treatment. Six studies found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on overall mental state of people with schizophrenia, specifically the risk of worsening psychosis (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.98; participants = 209; studies = 6, low-quality evidence). Regarding the effect of modafinil on cognitive function, the trials did not report clinically important change data, but one study reported endpoint scores on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB): in this study we found no clear difference in scores between modafinil and placebo treatment groups (MD -3.10, 95% CI -10.9 to 4.7; participants = 48; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Only one study (N = 35) reported adverse effect/event data. In this study one serious adverse event occurred in each group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). One study measured change in global state using the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale. This study found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on global state (RR 6.36, 95% CI 0.94 to 43.07, participants = 21; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Nine studies found that modafinil has no effect on numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.52 participants = 357; studies = 9, moderate-quality evidence). None of the trials reported clinically important change in quality of life, but one study did report quality of life using endpoint scores on the Quality of Life Inventory, finding no clear difference between treatment groups (MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.78; participants = 20; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Finally, one study reported data for number of participants needing hospitalisation: one participant in each group was hospitalised (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Due to methodological issues, low sample size, and short duration of the clinical trials as well as high risk of bias for outcome reporting, most of the evidence available for this review is of very low or low quality. For results where quality is low or very low, we are uncertain or very uncertain if the effect estimates are true effects, limiting our conclusions. Specifically, we found that modafinil is no better or worse than placebo at preventing worsening of psychosis; however, we are uncertain about this result. We have more confidence that participants receiving modafinil are no more likely to leave a trial early than participants receiving placebo. However, we are very uncertain about the remaining equivocal results between modafinil and placebo for outcomes such as improvement in global state or cognitive function, incidence of adverse events, and changes in quality of life. More high-quality data are needed before firm conclusions regarding the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders can be made.

2.2 Study design and procedure

We used a placebocontrolled, randomized, double‐blind within‐subject study design with three arms in which a stimulant was tested against placebo. Each participant received only one stimulant (and placebo) in the form of a white capsule for oral ingestion and was tested at two different occasions at the same time of the day in the early afternoon. The sessions were separated by about 1 week. The stimulants that were used were immediate‐release MPH (20 mg), MOD (200 mg), and CAF (200 mg). The doses where chosen based on known equipotency in clinical practice and prior trials as well as (for MPH and MPD) similar occupancy of the dopamine transporter (Franke et al; Repantis et al; Theunissen et al; Volkow et al.).

The white capsules containing one of the stimulants or the placebo (= microcrystalline cellulose) had been prepared by a pharmacy of the Charité (Berlin) in such a manner that they looked identical and weighed the same. Participants encoded the memory task with visual material in the MRI scanner and completed the rest of the tasks (including retrieval of this memory task) afterwards outside of the scanner (see Section 2.3). The start of the fMRI procedure was 90 min after oral substance ingestion. This timeframe was chosen so that all three stimulants had reached approximately their peak concentration in blood during testing. Two resting state scans were acquired directly before and after the encoding of the memory task with visual material in the MRI scanner, hence, 90 and 120 min after oral substance ingestion. The reason why we acquired two instead of one resting state scan was to account for general within‐subject resting state variability (Bijsterbosch et al.) and potential within‐subject variation in elimination half‐live of the stimulants (Wagner).

2.3 Behavioral measures of memory

In the original study two different memory tasks were administered — memory of visual and audio material (see Repantis et al.). For better comparability, we used the same memory outcome measures as reported in Repantis et al.

We additionally investigated whether there were whole‐brain stimulant‐induced changes in FC that relate to stimulant‐induced changes in general memory. For this, we first extracted the subject‐specific factor loadings of the latent memory change factor (see Section 2.4.2). Before entering the second level in CONN, the values were normalized, mean centered and orthogonalized to all three stimulant groups. Subsequently, the values were correlated with every group/cluster of related ROIs in the brain while controlling for differences between the groups (between subject contrast: 1 × Memory + 0 × MOD + 0 × MPH + 0 × CAF). Finally, those correlations were contrasted between the stimulant condition (2 scans) and the placebo condition (2 scans).

For exploratory purposes, the resulting (two) clusters from the group analysis in CONN were further examined to investigate to what extent they also relate to change in latent memory performance. To this end, we extracted the within‐FC of each cluster (mean average of all ROI‐pairs that belong to the respective cluster). For each cluster, we subtracted the resulting within‐FC values of the stimulant condition from the placebo condition. Subsequently, the difference values of those clusters were entered into a separate linear model together with three covariates of no interest to predict change in latent memory performance (i.e. the individual factor loadings from latent memory change factor). Due to high collinearity [r = .53, 95% CI (0.392–0.649)], the difference values of both clusters could not be entered as predictors into the same linear model. Therefore, we performed two separate linear models each predicting change in latent memory performance. The additional covariates per model were a binary variable indicating the respective scan and the order in which the subjects received either the stimulant or the placebo (binary variable: stimulant first vs. placebo first). The p ‐values for the individual models were obtained from likelihood ratio tests. That is to say, a baseline model including only the two covariates of no interest [scan and order (stimulant or placebo in first session)] was compared with the full model 1 including the two covariates and the difference value of the first cluster. The baseline model was also compared with the full model 2 including the two covariates and the difference value of the second cluster. To control for multiple comparison, all obtained p ‐values from the likelihood ratio tests were corrected using the false discovery rate (Benjamini & Hochberg).

4.2 Memory‐related stimulant‐inducedchanges between visual and medial temporal lobe regions

Episodic memory is critically dependent on the MTL and its functional connections to the cortex. For example, anatomical studies find many direct connections between the PHC and the DMN (Burwell; Witter et al.). The MTL is also strongly functionally connected to early and late visual areas (Córdova, Tompary, & Turk‐Browne; Wang et al.).

Cordova et al. (2016) show that memory retrieval can be facilitated by attention‐related increased coupling between visual areas and MTL regions during encoding of visual stimuli. In line with those results, we find stimulant‐induced modulations in FC between MTL and visual areas to be directly related to memory enhancement. Those stimulant‐induced modulations may also be associated with attention, however, we did not observe increased positive but decreased negative connectivity between visual and MTL regions. While positive connectivity between brain regions at rest is assumed to reflect synchronized activity between those regions, the physiological mechanisms underlying negative connectivity are still debated (Goelman et al.). Next to non‐neuronal hemodynamic processes, one physiological source for negative connectivity could be neuronal inhibition (Bianciardi et al; Devor et al; Shmuel et al.). Hence, the decreased negative connectivity between visual and MTL regions in the stimulant condition could reflect reduced inhibition between those brain regions facilitating encoding of the stimulus material in both memory tasks. In both tasks, participants had to memorize visually or aurally presented words. In fact, the Lingual Gyrus — one visual region identified within the hierarchical cluster — plays an important role in the recognition of words (Mechelli et al.) and has also been found to support encoding of words via visual imagery (Leshikar et al.). However, further research is necessary to investigate negative connectivity between MTL and visual regions in the context of memory.

### GSK3 β: a plausible mechanism of cognitive and hippocampal changes induced by erythropoietin treatment in mood disorders? [^a8b1328d]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatments for mood disorders have limited effects on cognitive dysfunction, and are, in some cases, associated with adverse effects on cognition due to anticholinergic, sedative, extrapyramidal and/or blunting effects, which may exacerbate patients' persistent cognitive impairments during periods of remission (i.e. when patients are relatively symptom-free). Existing cognitive enhancing drugs (i.e. medications aiming to improve cognitive functions) have shown limited pro-cognitive effects in depressed patients. Among the most promising cognition treatments are vortioxetine, which has shown replicated effects on psychomotor speed in symptomatic MDD, modafinil that improved some aspects of cognition in a study of remitted MDD, transcranial direct current stimulation that improved working memory in symptomatic MDD, lurasidone that improved a global measure of cognition in remitted BDand erythropoietin (EPO) that improved several cognitive domains in symptomatic MDD and remitted BD. However, despite these promising findings, there are no clinically available effective treatments for cognitive impairment in mood disorders to date. Indeed, many studies have examined the efficacy of existing and novel interventions to reduce cognitive dysfunction in patients with mood disorder;, however, cognition trials in this area have faced some important methodological challenges that may negate the interpretations and significance of findings. Although preliminary evidence showed promising effects of psychological interventions for cognitive dysfunction, such as cognitive remediation in patients with MDD, we recently demonstrated a lack of beneficial effects of this intervention for BD patients in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Notably, this trial was limited by a small sample size (n = 44), short follow-up times (12 weeks) and lack of enrichment for the primary outcome (objectively-assessed verbal memory dysfunction). Indeed, emerging evidence indicates that cognitive remediation programs may be useful in BD and there are several ongoing cognitive remediation trials in BD.

The study included 48 healthy, right‐handed male participants (M = 26.27, SD = 3.47, range: 21–36). The participants were recruited via internet recruitment and screened for presence of psychiatric or medical disorders as determined by a physician and using the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al.). Only male participants were included due to prior evidence showing an interaction of the female hormone cycle with resting state FC as well as performance in memory tasks (Lisofsky et al.). Further exclusion criteria were: regular or excessive consumption of caffeinated drinks (regularly drinking > 4 cups per day) within the last 6 months, 1 current usage of any medications, lifetime consumption of prescription stimulants (modafinil, methylphenidate) or illicit hard substances (e.g. cocaine, crack, and heroine), consumption of other illicit substances (e.g. speed, amphetamine, THC, ecstasy, and MDMA) within the past year, regular or irregular heavy smoking within the last 5 years (two subjects reported to smoke irregularly and little) as well as current irregular day–night rhythm (e.g. shift‐work).

To further control for irregular sleeping patterns, bad sleep quality as well as strong differences in circadian rhythm between the participants, we administered the German translated versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep quality index (PSQI, Buysse et al.) and the Morning‐Eveningness Questionnaires (D‐MEQ, Griefahn et al; Horne & Östberg). According to the PSQI, none of the participants self‐reported an unhealthy sleeping pattern (M = 2.46, SD = 1.65; max = 5; note, subjects with values between 0 and 5 are considered healthy sleepers). Furthermore, according to the D‐MEQ, the participants exhibited as similar circadian rhythm (M = 2.52, SD = 0.46; max = 3.47, min = 1.63; note, the D‐MEQ ranges from 0 = clearly " evening person " to 6 = clearly " morning person ").

Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and they were financially compensated for their time of participation. The study was approved by the Berlin State Ethics Committee (LAGeSo Berlin, Germany; 13/0138‐EK12) and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).

### Placebo and nocebo phenomena in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a narrative review on current knowledge and potential future directions [^6cf42d74]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Placebo responses in RCTs for adjunctive medication for SSDs

Treatments for symptoms that are grounded in beliefs and expectations may be more subject to placebo effects than treatments for negative (Fraguas et al.) and cognitive symptoms (Keefe et al.). In fact, Czobor et al. have suggested that negative symptom placebo effect estimates are smaller than previously reported, due to the stability and lack of variability of negative symptoms over time. This may also be highlighted in Keefe et al.'s findings of no strong placebo effects for cognition in those with schizophrenia. The adaptive attribution of salience is also critical to the refinement of goal-directed behavior, as motivational deficits are thought to arise from a blunted ability to properly assign incentive value to stimuli and events (Kapur; Waltz & Gold).

The influence of placebo responses in SSDs has also been examined in the context of clinical trials for medications designed to enhance motivation and cognition, though not all have used placebo groups. Findings from these studies generally indicate that placebo responses in such trials are considerably smaller than they are in trials of antipsychotic medications. In a meta-analysis of 12 randomized placebo-controlled RCT studies, involving 813 patients with schizophrenia, Keefe et al. found that, in clinical trials for candidate compounds for cognition enhancement, placebo responses were very small, suggesting that placebo effects for cognition in schizophrenia are virtually nonexistent. Clinical trials of the add-on use of arginine vasopressin for learning and memory in SSDs revealed treatment responses that exceed placebo responses (Geng et al.). The use of modafinil for cognition appears to have neither a strong placebo nor treatment effect in people with SSDs (Kumar,), although Strzelecki et al. observed improvements in cognition in patients with SSD administered modafinil, but not in the placebo group. Regarding social functioning in patients with schizophrenia, both placebo and treatment responses were observed in an RCT for paliperidone ER (Patrick et al.). Finally, placebo effects associated with the use of various other adjunctive or repurposed medications remain to be clearly elucidated (Cao et al; Correll et al.).

### Modafinil and cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia and healthy volunteers: the effects of test battery in a randomised controlled trial [^65fd8a1b]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have major functional impacts. Modafinil is a cognitive enhancer whose effect in healthy volunteers is well-described, but whose effects on the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia appear to be inconsistent. Two possible reasons for this are that cognitive test batteries vary in their sensitivity, or that the phase of illness may be important, with patients early in their illness responding better.

Methods

A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled single-dose crossover study of modafinil 200 mg examined this with two cognitive batteries [MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)] in 46 participants with under 3 years' duration of DSM-IV schizophrenia, on stable antipsychotic medication. In parallel, the same design was used in 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy volunteers. Uncorrected p values were calculated using mixed effects models.

Results

In patients, modafinil significantly improved CANTAB Paired Associate Learning, non-significantly improved efficiency and significantly slowed performance of the CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge spatial planning task. There was no significant effect on any MCCB domain. In healthy volunteers, modafinil significantly increased CANTAB Rapid Visual Processing, Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shifting and verbal recall accuracy, and MCCB social cognition performance. The only significant differences between groups were in MCCB visual learning.

Conclusions

As in earlier chronic schizophrenia studies, modafinil failed to produce changes in cognition in early psychosis as measured by MCCB. CANTAB proved more sensitive to the effects of modafinil in participants with early schizophrenia and in healthy volunteers. This confirms the importance of selecting the appropriate test battery in treatment studies of cognition in schizophrenia.

### Pharmacological cognitive enhancement: treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and lifestyle use by healthy people [^4e305f86]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychiatric disorders typically manifest as problems with attentional biases, aberrant learning, dysfunctional reward systems, and an absence of top-down cognitive control by the prefrontal cortex. In view of the cost of common mental health disorders, in terms of distress to the individual and family in addition to the financial cost to society and governments, new developments for treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should be a priority so that all members of society can flourish. Cognitive enhancing drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and methylphenidate, are used as treatments for the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, these drugs and others, including modafinil, are being increasingly used by healthy people for enhancement purposes. Importantly for ethical and safety reasons, the drivers for this increasing lifestyle use of so-called smart drugs by healthy people should be considered and discussions must occur about how to ensure present and future pharmacological cognitive enhancers are used for the benefit of society.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^6820cc1c]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

As predicted, we found enhanced mnemonic performance in different memory tasks in the stimulant compared with the placebo condition. That is to say, implicit memory measured as d ′ was enhanced. Correct recall for visual and audio material was also enhanced in the stimulant condition immediately after encoding as well as 24 h later. Furthermore, false memory for lures was reduced in the stimulant‐condition, but only after immediate not during late recall. Further congruent with our hypotheses, we found a stimulant‐induced effect of increased FC. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two main clusters of connections between predominantly prefrontal and parietal ROIs indicating FC change between the FPN and DMN at rest (see Figure 2 and Table S5). In one cluster, FC between predominantly lateral parietal and right prefrontal ROIs was increased in the stimulant compared with the placebo condition. In the other cluster, negative FC between predominantly medial parietal (Precuneus, Posterior Cingulum [PCC]) DMN and right prefrontal FPN ROIs was decreased in the stimulant compared with the placebo condition. A post hoc analysis revealed that the amount of negative connectivity reduction from the stimulant to the placebo condition predicted the amount of performance change in latent memory. On a whole brain level, however, one specific cluster including connections between medial temporal lobe areas (e.g. hippocampus and PHC) also belonging to the DMN and visual areas was significantly related to stimulant‐induced latent memory change. That is to say, in this cluster negative FC was significantly reduced in the stimulant compared with the placebo condition.

4.1 Stimulant‐induced changes in coupling betweenand

The DMN is a set of cortical regions comprising hubs mostly located in the ventromedial prefrontal, inferior parietal lobule and PCC/Precuneus (Greicius et al.). Those nodes exhibit coherent fluctuations during resting state and have been associated with a range of cognitive processes including self‐oriented mental activity and autobiographical as well as episodic memory retrieval (Buckner et al; Sestieri et al.). Prior studies report that this network can be modulated by different stimulants such as MPH (Liddle et al; Silberstein et al.) as well as MOD (Minzenberg et al. 2011; Schmaal et al.) and CAF (Wong et al; Wu et al.).

### Use of modafinil for the treatment of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^01528295]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for the use of modafinil in the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1990-May 2006) was conducted using MeSH terms ADHD and modafinil. The search was limited to English-language articles on clinical trials in humans. The Cochrane Database was also searched.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The literature search yielded 4 randomized clinical trials.

Data Synthesis

The use of modafinil in the treatment of ADHD is associated with significant improvements in primary outcome measures used to assess the status of patients diagnosed with ADHD. Several aspects of cognitive function in ADHD patients also appear to improve following modafinil treatment. Modafinil shows a favorable adverse effect profile. Insomnia and headache were the most common adverse effects, seen in approximately 20% of treated individuals. However, it has not been demonstrated that the beneficial effects of modafinil are maintained with chronic administration.

Conclusions

Modafinil may be a viable option for some patients in the treatment of ADHD, perhaps those for whom standard ADHD therapies have not been successful or tolerated. There remains a need for additional large, long-term studies using flexible titration methods to optimize the dose of modafinil to establish safety and efficacy, as well as head-to-head comparisons between modafinil and both long- and short-acting stimulants to determine the role of modafinil in the treatment of ADHD.

### The national cancer institute clinical trials planning meeting to address gaps in observational and intervention trials for cancer-related cognitive impairment [^109e6a12]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Many patients with cancer experience cognitive problems that negatively affect quality of life (QOL). These cognitive problems have been broadly defined in the literature as cancer-related cognitive impairment, inclusive of subtle problems to more severe impairment. Cancer-related cognitive impairment can occur before, during, and after treatment, and a subgroup of patients experience persistent cancer-related cognitive impairment. Longitudinal studies of adult patients with non–central nervous system (CNS) cancers demonstrate that cancer-related cognitive impairment can include changes in memory, executive function, attention, and processing speed. Although most studies have been conducted in patients with more common cancers (eg, breast, colon, prostate) receiving chemotherapy, little is known about cognitive consequences in patients with less common cancers and patients receiving other localized and systemic therapies. Clinically relevant risk factors for cancer-related cognitive impairment in adults include lower cognitive reserve, older age, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Biomarkers for risk of cancer-related cognitive impairment include inflammatory markers and apolipoprotein ε4 allele genotype, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor may be a protective factor, but confirmatory studies are needed.

Potential interventions for alleviating cognitive problems include cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive training, physical activity, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and medications (eg, methylphenidate, memantine, donepezil, modafinil), among others. Many intervention studies are phase I/II and may not include cognitive function as a primary outcome. Therefore, properly designed phase II/III trials with cognitive function as a primary outcome are needed.

### Cognitive boosting interventions for impulsivity in addiction: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive training, remediation and pharmacological enhancement [^c45ee493]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate and compare the effects of three cognitive boosting intervention approaches (computerised cognitive training, cognitive remediation and pharmacological cognitive enhancers) on measures of impulsive action and impulsive choice.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of publications that reported original controlled trials of cognitive boosting interventions.

Setting

Studies conducted anywhere in the world. No language restrictions were applied.

Participants

Treatment-seeking adults with substance use disorder or gambling disorder.

Measurements

Our primary outcome was a reduction in impulsive action or choice on a validated cognitive measure post-intervention. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and determined pooled estimates from published reports. We performed random-effects analyses for impulsive action and impulsive choice outcomes and planned moderator analyses.

Findings

Of 2204 unique studies identified, 60 were included in the full-text review. Twenty-three articles were considered eligible for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis and 16 articles were included in our meta-analysis. Articles eligible for pooled analyses included five working memory training (computerised cognitive training) studies with 236 participants, three goal management training (cognitive remediation) studies with 99 participants, four modafinil (cognitive enhancer) studies with 160 participants and four galantamine (cognitive enhancer) studies with 131 participants. Study duration ranged from 5 days to 13 weeks, with immediate follow-up assessments. There were no studies identified that specifically targeted gambling disorder. We only found evidence for a benefit on impulsive choice of goal management training, although only in two studies involving 66 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.49–1.23; P = 0.02; I² = 0%, P = 0.95).

Conclusion

Cognitive remediation, and specifically goal management training, may be an effective treatment for addressing impulsive choice in addiction. Preliminary evidence does not support the use of computerised cognitive training or pharmacological enhancers to boost impulse control in addiction.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^43dd3b36]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

For exploratory purposes, we investigated whether stimulant‐induced change in FC in both clusters predicts the amount of latent memory change. The first cluster [Chi 2 (1) = 7.33, p‐FDR = .016] negatively predicts latent memory change. The negative relationship is reasonable given that the ROI pairs in this cluster in the placebo condition are more negatively connected than in the stimulant condition (see Figure 2, lower left panel). In contrast, FC change in the second cluster [Chi 2 (1) = 0.07, p‐FDR = 0.799] does not predict latent memory change (see Figure 2, lower right panel). Details on the model estimates from the linear model are presented in Table S4. For the sake of completeness, the relationship between latent memory change and the respective cluster plotted separately for each group is presented in Figure S5.

3.3 Link between stimulant‐induced changes in whole brainand memory

When investigating which brain areas correlate more strongly with stimulant‐induced changes in latent memory performance in the stimulant compared with the placebo condition, one cluster survived multiple comparisons on a whole brain level [F (2,43) = 11.75, p‐FDR = .037]. This cluster consisted of 16 connections between ROIs in visual (lingual, calcarine and middle occipital cortex) and medial temporal lobe visual areas [hippocampus, parahippocampus (PHC), and superior temporal pole] (see Figure 3). A post hoc analysis revealed that ROIs from both areas were negatively correlated in the placebo condition, while this negative correlation was significantly reduced in the stimulant condition (see Figure 3). Table S5 lists all ROIs belonging to each cluster including their individual t ‐statistics.

### A review of the effects of modafinil on cognition in schizophrenia [^6118122b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Modafinil, a wake-promoting agent believed to operate via the hypocretin/orexin system, has a similar clinical profile to that of conventional, dopaminergic stimulants but different biochemical and pharmacological properties. There is increasing interest in the use of modafinil to improve cognition in schizophrenia as well as in other disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Recent research has focused on enhancing cognition in patients with schizophrenia because of the association between cognitive performance and functional outcome. Initial findings indicate that modafinil may lead to better executive functioning and attentional performance in patients with schizophrenia. The results further suggest that patient characteristics such as overall current cognitive functioning levels, genetic polymorphisms, and medication status may be important mediators for the effectiveness of modafinil, allowing for future treatment to be targeted to those most likely to benefit. Currently, further research is required to address the potential benefits and risks of chronic administration of modafinil to patients with schizophrenia.

### Preservation of neurocognitive function in the treatment of brain metastases [^dbdce020]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacotherapy

Medications used to treat cognitive symptoms have been trialed in brain tumor patients. In addition to the neuroprotectant role of memantine detailed above, pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of memory impairment and attention deficits in other neurologic populations have been studied. Most of this research has been in patients with primary brain tumors, but a few studies have also included patients with brain metastases.

An early study of the memory enhancer donepezil in a mixed group of patients with brain tumors had only one brain metastasis patient at baseline, who failed to complete the follow-up assessments, illustrating the difficulties of studying treatment outcomes in this patient population with such dismal survival. The largest study of donepezil in patients with brain tumors (n = 198) was a randomized placebo-controlled trial that included 53 patients (25%) with brain metastasesand measured cognitive effects at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. In the 74% of patients who completed follow-up visits (% of brain metastases not reported), there were subtle indications of a treatment effect on one measure of recognition memory.

Attention-enhancing medications, such as methylphenidate and modafinil, have been evaluated in mixed groups of brain tumor patients, though these studies too have largely excluded patients with brain metastases. Although early studies of this approach suggested some benefits, randomized placebo-controlled trials failed to replicate the findings, including the only study to include patient with brain metastases, suggesting that expectancy effects may play a significant role in the experience of patients prescribed these medications. It should be noted that this study evaluated fatigue, rather than cognitive function, as the primary endpoint.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^6b4a5b94]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Memory task of auditory material

Implicit and explicit verbal memory was measured with a false memory test outside of the scanner (Roediger & McDermott). Participants heard five sets of 15 words each (75 words in total). Every set contained semantically similar words that could be associated with one critical lure which was not presented itself. As an example, the presented words "drive," "street," "key," "garage," and so on are all associated to the lure "car." After the presentation an early recall was performed outside the scanner. Afterwards, participants underwent a recognition test in which a list of 40 words was presented. These included 20 words from the auditory material word list and 20 new words with the lures included among them. A sensitivity index d ′ was calculated using the formula d ′ = Z (hit rate) – Z (false alarm rate) in order to examine how well participants discriminated between old and new words. Hit rate was defined as (hits/(hits + misses) (hits were the correctly identified old words; misses were the old words that were not recognized; Macmillan & Creelman). False alarm rate was defined as (false alarms/(false alarms + correct negative) (false alarms were new words that were falsely identified as old words; correct negative were new words that were correctly identified as new words). For the Z transformation the formula NORM.S. INV(hit) – NORM.S. INV(false alarm) was used. Perfect scores were adjusted using the formula 1–1/(2 n) for perfect hits and 1/(2 n) for zero false alarms, with n being the number of total hits or false alarms (20 and 20, respectively) (Haatveit et al; Macmillan & Creelman). A higher d ′ score indicates that the signal was recognized better.

Retention of information was assessed for both memory tasks with visual and auditory material using a delayed free recall test for the two sets of learned words. This was conducted by telephone 24 h after the session. Participants were informed about the upcoming late recall task but were asked not to actively try to retain the words.

### Cognitive enhancement: effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine on latent memory and resting state functional connectivity in healthy adults [^89c5fddb]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.7.1 First‐level analysis in CONN

We adopted a whole brain data‐driven approach because we did not have a specific hypothesis where in the brain FC should increase as a function of all three stimulants. To investigate those stimulant‐induced changes in FC on a network level, that is, the whole brain, we parcellated the brain into 268 Regions of Interest (ROIs) using the Shen atlas (Shen et al.). The Shen atlas is parcellated based on resting state FC and therefore ideal for network analysis using FC (Finn et al; Rosenberg et al; Shen et al.). For this reason, the Shen atlas was preferred to CONN's default FSL Harvard‐Oxford atlas that contains only 132 ROIs derived from structural data (106 cortical and subcortical areas and 26 cerebellar areas from the AAL Atlas) (Finn et al; Rosenberg et al; Shen et al.).

The time series for each ROI were acquired by mean averaging the BOLD time series of each voxel that belongs to the respective ROI. ROI‐to‐ROI connectivity matrices (268 × 268) were computed for each participant (48), for each condition (drug vs. placebo), each scan (2) and each session (2) separately. Each element in each connectivity matrix represents the strength of FC between a pair of ROIs and was defined as the Fisher‐transformed bivariate correlation coefficient between the preprocessed and denoised BOLD time series of two ROIs.

2.7.2 Second‐level analysis in CONN

Rather than focusing on single connections between all possible pairs of ROIs, we adopted a hierarchical cluster analysis as implemented in CONN which categorizes ROIs into clusters based on ROI‐to‐ROI functional similarity and anatomical proximity metrics (Sørensen). This method is based on a complete‐linkage metric meaning that the distance between two clusters is defined as the maximum distance between all pairs of ROIs within the two clusters. CONN's default distance measure that we used is defined as D = 0.95 × D func + 0.05 × D anat, where D func is the squared Euclidean distance between the connectivity patterns for every pair of ROIs (averaged across all subjects), and D anat represents the squared Euclidean distance between the anatomical centroid coordinates for every pair of ROI.

### The treatment of sleep dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders [^672a8479]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Modafinil

Some studies have considered the converse approach to addressing sleep dysfunction in neurodegeneration, by administering the alerting agent modafinil during waking hours. However, evidence to date has not supported its use: modafinil has failed to show consistent benefit for fatigue or daytime somnolence in Parkinson's disease or for apathy in Alzheimer's disease. A small randomized controlled acute single-dose trial in Huntington's disease identified some improvement in alertness, but with no improvement to mood, and deleterious cognitive effects.

Melatonin

Melatonin, the hormone that helps orchestrate circadian sleep–wake function, has received considerable research interest as a further alternative pharmacological agent for the treatment of sleep dysfunction in neurodegeneration. Exogenous melatonin administration can influence both circadian rhythm and sleep quality, and the reduction in release of endogenous melatonin across the spectrum of neurodegeneration would suggest that administration may have a beneficial normalizing effect. Moreover, preclinical studies have suggested that melatonin could have an independent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective role, and one of promoting glymphatic clearance of neurotoxic waste.

However, while a number of studies have suggested a benefit of melatonin therapy in Alzheimer's disease, the great majority of these are open-label studies and based on subjective outcomes. Of the five robust randomized controlled trials in Alzheimer's disease employing objective outcomes based on actigraphic sleep variables, the evidence is inconclusive. Three have failed to show benefit to any sleep variable, while two have demonstrated mixed benefit: Asayama et al. reported a significant increase in total sleep time (mean, 103 min) with decreased nocturnal activity, while Dowling at al. reported improved rest–activity rhythm, but only through improvements in wake activity rather than sleep, and only when administered in conjunction with light therapy. This lack of consensus may relate to the wide range of melatonin doses employed in these studies. The cognitive benefit of melatonin therapy in Alzheimer's disease has been reported in two studies but the extent of this is of questionable clinical significance: a change of 1.5 out of a total of 30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 3.5 to 4.3 out of a scale of 70 points on the Alzheimer's Disease Cognitive Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog).

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^108a0023]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study received ethical approval from the University College London research ethics committee. Hypotheses, methods and analysis plan were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF;).

Study design

We employed a randomised, double blind 2 (drug) × 2 (strategy), factorial, between-subjects design with additional within-subjects factors of time (for acute effects) or day (for effects at one week follow-up; see below). Both a matched placebo drug control and a well-matched active control for mindfulness (i.e. relaxation) were used. This resulted in four experimental conditions: placebo–relaxation, modafinil–relaxation, placebo–mindfulness and modafinil–mindfulness. In all groups, subjective effects were tested before drug, after drug and after the mindfulness or relaxation strategy, while the drug was still expected to be active (i.e. the combined effects of strategy and drug). Behavioural outcomes were only tested after the strategy.

Participants

Written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to any experimental procedure. Eighty healthy, meditation naïve participants (i.e. with < 20 h lifetime mediation experience) were recruited from the university and local community through online and paper-based adverts and were randomly and evenly (n = 20/group) assigned to placebo–relaxation, modafinil–relaxation, placebo–mindfulness, modafinil–mindfulness, with equal numbers of men (n = 10) and women (n = 10) per cell. Of the original sample, two participants' data could not be included (see). One of these participants was replaced, leaving a final cohort of 79. All were compensated for their time (£25). Seefor further details on screening, inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomisation and sample size determination.

Participants were blind to drug condition and were not aware that there were two strategy conditions; nor were the terms 'relaxation' or 'mindfulness' used in any study material. Experimenters were blind to both drug and strategy condition.

### A systematic review of modafinil: potential clinical uses and mechanisms of action [^7ca86f70]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Modafinil is a novel wake-promoting agent that has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder and as adjunctive treatment of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. Modafinil has a novel mechanism and is theorized to work in a localized manner, utilizing hypocretin, histamine, epinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate. It is a well-tolerated medication with low propensity for abuse and is frequently used for off-label indications. The objective of this study was to systematically review the available evidence supporting the clinical use of modafinil.

Data Sources

The search term modafinil OR Provigil was searched on PubMed. Selected articles were mined for further potential sources of data. Abstracts from major scientific conferences were reviewed. Lastly, the manufacturer of modafinil in the United States was asked to provide all publications, abstracts, and unpublished data regarding studies of modafinil.

Data Synthesis

There have been 33 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil. Additionally, numerous smaller studies have been performed, and case reports of modafinil's use abound in the literature.

Conclusions

Modafinil is a promising drug with a large potential for many uses in psychiatry and general medicine. Treating daytime sleepiness is complex, and determining the precise nature of the sleep disorder is vital. Modafinil may be an effective agent in many sleep conditions. To date, the strongest evidence among off-label uses exists for the use of modafinil in attention-deficit disorder, postanesthetic sedation, and cocaine dependence and withdrawal and as an adjunct to antidepressants for depression.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^cf216d31]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, which influences the maintenance of circadian rhythms and affects energy metabolism. The mechanisms through which melatonin can exert neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects include anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as well as enhanced neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. In a 6-week double-blind RCT, the combination of melatonin and buspirone provided beneficial effects in treating depressive severity in individuals with MDD. Another RCT investigating 80 individuals with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease documented that the administration of adjunctive melatonin for 6 months was effective in improving cognitive functions and sleep maintenance. Melatonin, as well as agomelatine, a melatonergic analogue drug acting as an MT 1 /MT 2 agonist and 5-HT 2C antagonist, may hinder circadian misalignment and sleep disruption, which has been posited to contribute to increases in depressive symptoms through their effect on cognitive control.

Modafinil

Modafinil is a stimulant-like agent currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy. This drug has a pleiotropic mechanism of action targeting several neurotransmitters, including but not limited to serotonin, GABA, glutamate, orexin, and histaminergic systems. Modafinil has only been tested as a procognitive agent for MDD in a 4-week open-label trial, enrolling 35 patients with MDD with a partial response to an antidepressant at a stable dose. After modafinil augmentation, the authors concluded that no adverse effect on cognition was reported. However, neurocognitive function was not a primary outcome of this small, uncontrolled trial. A recent systematic review indicates that modafinil has procognitive effects in healthy, non-sleep-deprived individuals. Thus, the potential beneficial effects of modafinil in remediating cognitive dysfunction in MDD deserve investigation.

Galantamine

Galantamine is a cholinergic agent, a weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and a potent nicotinic receptor modulator. Because of its modulatory effects on nicotinic receptors, it has been proposed that this drug may modulate other neurotransmitter systems, including monoamines, glutamate, and GABA. Two double-blind, RCTs evaluated the effects of galantamine augmentation on neurocognitive function in MDD, and both failed to demonstrate beneficial effects on cognition. However, they both enrolled small samples, with that by Holtzheimer et al. enrolling only elderly participants.

If you have a severe rash with modafinil tablets, stopping the medicine may not keep the rash from becoming life-threatening or causing you to be permanently disabled or disfigured.

Modafinil tablets are not approved for use in children for any medical condition.

It is not known if modafinil tablets are safe or effective in children under 17 years of age.

What are modafinil tablets?

Modafinil tablets are a prescription medicine used to improve wakefulness in adults who are very sleepy due to one of the following diagnosed sleep disorders:

narcolepsy
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Modafinil tablets are used to treat excessive sleepiness, but not the obstruction or medical condition that is causing OSA. You should talk with your doctor about treatments for OSA before you start taking modafinil tablets and during treatment with modafinil tablets. Modafinil tablets do not take the place of treatments that your doctor has prescribed for OSA. It is important that you continue to use these treatments as prescribed by your doctor.
shift work disorder (SWD)

Modafinil tablets will not cure these sleep disorders. Modafinil tablets may help the sleepiness caused by these conditions, but it may not stop all your sleepiness. Modafinil tablets do not take the place of getting enough sleep. Follow your doctor's advice about good sleep habits and using other treatments.

### Methodological recommendations for cognition trials in bipolar disorder by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders targeting cognition task force [^48c598d8]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

3.8 When should pre‐ and post‐assessments be conducted?

The treatment periods in RCTs targeting cognition range from 1 to 21 weeks but are most commonly between 6 and 12 weeks. 1, 16 Short study durations have the benefit of limiting the confounding effects of mood cycling, whereas longer trial durations may be more likely to produce robust and enduring efficacy on cognition and reduce potential practice effects. The optimal duration of a particular trial would depend on the presumed onset of efficacy for the particular intervention based on its putative mechanisms. Specifically, relatively pronounced effects may be seen rapidly, depending on the agent. For example, a single dose of modafinil was recently found to have acute effects on some aspects of cognition in remitted major depressive disorder. 52 However, a general recommendation would be to administer pharmacological and other biological interventions for 6‐12 weeks and psychological interventions for 10‐21 weeks, depending on the specific treatment program with pre‐ and post‐treatment assessments of cognition at baseline and immediately after treatment completion (primary time for assessment of efficacy). When possible, a follow‐up assessment after 3‐6 months would be desirable. This recommendation is based on (i) the most common practice in RCTs of biological and psychological candidate treatments in mood disorders targeting mood symptoms or cognitive impairment and (ii) the assumption that the functional implications of treatment‐related increase in neuroplasticity would begin to emerge after 4‐6 weeks and presumably increase further with continued treatment. 53 The follow‐up assessment 3‐6 months after treatment completion would serve to determine not only whether potential treatment‐related cognitive benefits persist long‐term, but also whether they translate into functional improvements, which are likely to occur with a time lag. An analog is the typical delay between the physical healing of a sprained ankle and a person's resumption of habitual levels of daily activity and physical exercise. It is thus likely that it takes time for objective cognitive improvement to translate into better functioning in daily life. Preliminary evidence from recent EPO trials supports this notion. Here the observed correlation between EPO‐treated patients' objective cognitive improvement and subjective cognitive change in daily life was mediated by change in depressive symptoms in the acute treatment phase but was direct 6 weeks after trial completion. 15

Finally, two studies investigated the effects of vortioxetine. One study investigated the effects of 2 weeks of vortioxetine (10–20 mg/day) (n = 24) versus placebo (n = 24) in MDD (and healthy controls) with cognition being a secondary outcome (the primary outcome was a neuroimaging‐based measure of neuronal activity during working memory performance). All participants completed the study. Vortioxetine improved one measure of attention in MDD patients (effect size not reported) but no other aspects of cognition, and this effect would have not survived correction for multiple comparisons. While no effects of vortioxetine were observed on clinician‐rated depression, vortioxetine‐treated patients displayed improvement in self‐rated depression relative to placebo‐treated patients. No effects of vortioxetine were seen on patients' subjective cognition (psychosocial function not assessed). The other study investigated the effects of 8 weeks of vortioxetine (10–20 mg/day) as add‐on to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) (n = 52) or as monotherapy (n = 50) versus continued SSRI monotherapy (n = 49) in MDD. Psychomotor speed (DSST) was the primary outcome, with additional measures of cognition, psychosocial function, functional capacity and subjective cognition being secondary outcomes. In total, 99% of the participants completed the study. The findings revealed no greater cognitive improvement with vortioxetine as add‐on to SSRI or as monotherapy compared with the SSRI monotherapy on the primary or secondary cognition outcomes – and no differential effects on subsyndromal depression symptoms, psychosocial function, functional capacity or subjective cognition.

Taken together, the pharmacological interventions for cognitive impairments showed limited evidence. Two studies of lurasidone or modafinil administration indicated cognitive benefits in BD and MDD, respectively, while the remaining five studies were negative.

### Efficacy of stimulants for cognitive enhancement in non-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder youth: a systematic review [^726273fb]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Increasing prescription stimulant abuse among youth without diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is of concern. The most frequently cited motive for abuse is improved academic achievement via neurocognitive enhancement. Our aim in reviewing the literature was to identify neurocognitive effects of prescription stimulants in non-ADHD youth.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted for youth aged 12–25 years using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Fourteen papers were included.

Results

Modafinil appears to improve reaction time (P ≤ 0.04), logical reasoning (P ≤ 0.05) and problem-solving. Methylphenidate appears to improve performance in novel tasks and attention-based tasks (P ≤ 0.05), and reduces planning latency in more complex tasks (P ≤ 0.05). Amphetamine has been shown to improve consolidation of information (0.02 ≥ P ≤ 0.05), leading to improved recall. Across all three types of prescription stimulants, research shows improved attention with lack of consensus on whether these improvements are limited to simple versus complex tasks in varying youth populations.

Conclusions

The heterogeneity of the non-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder youth population, the variation in cognitive task characteristics and lack of replication of studies makes assessing the potential global neurocognitive benefits of stimulants among non-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder youth difficult; however, some youth may derive benefit in specific cognitive domains.

### Medical management of patients with brain tumors [^e3eb332e]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The most common medical problems in brain tumor patients include the management of seizures, peritumoral edema, medication side effects, venous thromboembolism (VTE), fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Despite their importance, there are relatively few studies specifically addressing these issues. There is increasing evidence that brain tumor patients who have not had a seizure do not benefit from prophylactic antiepileptic medications. Patients on corticosteroids are at greater risk of Pneumocystis jerovecii pneumonia and may benefit from prophylactic therapy. There is also growing evidence suggesting that anticoagulation may be more effective than inferior vena cava IVC) filtration devices for treating VTE in brain tumor patients and the risk of hemorrhage with anticoagulation is relatively small. Low-molecular weight heparin may be more effective than coumadin. Medications such as modafinil and methylphenidate have assumed an increasing role in the treatment of fatigue, while donepezil and memantine may be helpful with memory loss.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^2dc3217d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

Mindfulness-meditation has a variety of benefits on well-being. However, individuals with primary attentional impairments (e.g. attention deficit disorder) or attentional symptoms secondary to anxiety, depression or addiction, may be less likely to benefit, and require additional mindfulness-augmenting strategies.

Aims:

To determine whether a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, acutely increases subjective and behavioural indices of mindfulness, and augments brief mindfulness training.

Methods:

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 (drug: placebo, modafinil) × 2 (strategy: mindfulness, relaxation control) experiment was conducted. Seventy-nine meditation-naïve participants were assigned to: placebo–relaxation, placebo–mindfulness, modafinil–relaxation or modafinil–mindfulness. Pre-drug, post-drug and post-strategy state mindfulness, affect and autonomic activity, along with post-strategy sustained attention and mind-wandering were assessed within a single lab session. After the session, participants were instructed to practice their assigned behavioural strategy daily for one week, with no further drug administration, after which, follow-up measures were taken.

Results:

As predicted, modafinil acutely increased state mindfulness and improved sustained attention. Differential acute strategy effects were found following mindfulness on autonomic activity but not state mindfulness. There were no strategy or drug effects on mind-wandering. However, exploratory analyses indicated that participants receiving modafinil engaged in more strategy practice across strategy conditions during follow-up.

Conclusions:

Modafinil acutely mimicked the effects of brief mindfulness training on state mindfulness but did not enhance the effects of this training. Limitations of the current study, and recommendations for future research examining modafinil as an adjunct to mindfulness- (or relaxation-) based treatments are discussed.

### Neurostimulant use for rehabilitation and recovery after stroke: a narrative literature review [^b0e77027]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke often results in significant impairments across various domains, including movement, language, cognition, and mood. Neurostimulants have been proposed as potential therapeutic interventions to enhance recovery in these areas.

Methods

This narrative literature review examines clinical trials investigating the efficacy of neurostimulants in poststroke recovery. It evaluates outcomes related to aphasia, motor deficits, cognition, fatigue, and depression.

Results

The qualitative analysis included 34 trials testing the following neurostimulants: methylphenidate (n = 6), amphetamines (n = 8), memantine (n = 2), modafinil (n = 2), levodopa (n = 14), amantadine (n = 1), bromocriptine (n = 3), and ropinirole (n = 1). Of the 34 studies, 31 were randomized, placebo-controlled (double-blind, n = 27; single-blind, n = 2; unblinded n = 2), 2 were randomized and not placebo-controlled, and 1 was not randomized. Study design was either multiarm (n = 23), crossover (n = 10), or used subjects as their own control (n = 1). Mean sample size was 49.4 (5–593).

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that memantine may be effective for aphasia, although few phase III trials exist, whereas bromocriptine and amphetamines lack sufficient evidence for long-term recovery of aphasia. Levodopa may improve motor aphasias but has not shown long-term benefits for motor recovery. Similarly, ropinirole has not been shown to improve poststroke motor outcomes. Methylphenidate has limited efficacy for cognitive improvement but may enhance poststroke functionality and mood. Modafinil may help with poststroke fatigue. In conclusion, there are promising results of positive effects of neurostimulants with few side effects, though studies are limited by heterogeneous designs and small sample sizes. Neurostimulant efficacy must be assessed in conjunction with specific rehabilitation modalities as part of larger, well-designed studies to best understand their effects on impairment.

The MFI is a 20-item self-administered fatigue questionnaire designed to measure 5 fatigue domains: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue. Each item is scored from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating greater fatigue. The scores within each domain are summed to a total of 20, with a whole MFI score of 100. The MFI has been developedand validatedto demonstrate limited item redundancy, good reliability, strong construct viability, validity in disease, and healthy populations, with limited floor/ceiling effect. The Montreal cognitive assessment is a 1 page, 30-point cognitive test designed to assess short-term memory recall, visuospatial abilities, executive function, attention, concentration, working memory, and language. The FSS is a 9-item self-administered questionnaire; each item is scored from 1 to 7 with higher scores reflecting more fatigue. The FSS has also been tested to demonstrate its validity, internal consistency, and discriminatory power to differentiate diseased and healthy populations, and is reported as a median. The DASS42 is a 42-item self-reported score consisting of statements, which participants must rate each item 0 to 3 and is designed to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. Finally, the SSQoL is a disease-specific quality of life measure consisting of 49 items assessing 12 domains, which include social roles, mobility, energy, language, self-care, mood, personality, thinking, upper extremity function, family roles, vision, and work/productivity. Each item of the SSQoL is ranked on a 5-point scale.

Adverse events were followed closely by the Hunter Medical Research Institute clinical trials support unit by a research coordinator not otherwise involved in the study. All adverse events were registered by interview through monthly phone calls and review of patient files at each visit.

### Chronic treatment with modafinil may not be beneficial in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome [^07cf30a9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Fourteen patients (7 male, 7 female, 22–63 years), classified as having chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), but without concurrent major depression, significant sleepiness or use of psychoactive medication, completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the effects of the selective wakefulness-promoting agent, modafinil (200 and 400mg/day). The treatment periods were each 20 days, with washout periods of 2 weeks. The primary aim was to determine effects on cognition and the secondary aim was to determine effects on self-ratings of fatigue, quality of life and mood. Modafinil had mixed effects in two cognitive tasks. In a test of sustained attention, treatment with 200mg reduced the latency to correctly detect sequences, but 400mg increased the number of missed targets. In a test of spatial planning, the 200mg dose resulted in a slower initial thinking time for the easiest part of the task, whereas 400mg reduced the initial thinking time for the hardest part of the test. Lastly, in a test of mental flexibility and one of motor speed, patients performed worse whilst on modafinil (400mg), compared with the placebo period. No effects were observed on the performance of other psychometric tests or on self-ratings of fatigue, quality of life or mood, but this may have been due to insufficient statistical power. It is discussed whether the limited and mixed cognitive effects that we observed could have occurred by chance, or whether a subgroup of CFS patients with daytime sleepiness would have shown greater benefits.

### Altered brainstem responses to modafinil in schizophrenia: implications for adjunctive treatment of cognition [^d42771cd]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

This study is limited by a rather modest sample size, and that the antipsychotic medication treatment was naturalistic and not randomized nor blinded, unlike the single dose of modafinil. Nevertheless, the correlations of BOLD signal change in response to modafinil exhibited specificity in their relationships with monoamine receptor-mediated effects of antipsychotics, which were predicted based on the known neurochemical effects of both modafinil and antipsychotics, and were generally not attributable to overall illness severity as measured by psychotic symptoms nor proxied by other neurochemical effects of the antipsychotics. In addition, many of these subjects were concurrently prescribed other psychotropic agents (and in a few cases, non-psychiatric medications, for other medical conditions). It remains unclear if these other medications may have contributed to the altered neural responses to modafinil observed here. Nonetheless, the pattern of observed effects fit very well the predicted pattern based on the actions of antipsychotic drugs on these systems, and how they would be expected to interact with modafinil. In addition, the supplemental medications are reasonably-representative of the adjunctive treatments that are routinely used with schizophrenia outpatients, suggesting that the observed altered brain responses are likely representative of those that may be found among schizophrenia patients more generally.

In addition, the patient sample was quite characteristic of outpatient, community-dwelling populations with schizophrenia, in terms of demographics, symptomatology and functional status. These observations suggest that the present findings may have general relevance for the future clinical management of outpatients with schizophrenia, and the potential challenge of resolving treatment for psychotic symptoms that are the clinical hallmark of the disorder, with the cognitive impairment, which is not a defining feature of schizophrenia yet remains a major determinant of functional outcome.

It is very important to emphasize that in no way do these considerations suggest that modern antipsychotic medications be abandoned or that their use be curtailed. These medications are the mainstay of treatment of all psychotic disorders, and remain the most important advance in the history of schizophrenia treatment. It is nonetheless interesting to consider how an antipsychotic agent with relatively less catecholamine antagonist activity may mitigate these problems and serve as a better alternative, in combination with novel pro-cognitive agents, to facilitate the development of new treatments for cognition in this illness.

### Randomised controlled cognition trials in remitted patients with mood disorders published between 2015 and 2021: a systematic review by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders targeting cognition task force [^eb3d56e8]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

4.8 Conclusions and recommendations

In conclusion, this updated systematic review of RCTs published between 2015 and 2021 identified 16 RCTs in partially or fully remitted patients with BD or UD. Six studies involved CR, three tDCS or rTMS and seven pharmacological interventions, including methylene blue, DHA, modafinil lurasidone, pramipexole and vortioxetine. Most consistent cognitive improvements were observed with CR, with two trials being formally positive and four showing preliminary effects. In contrast, the tDCS and rTMS studies showed no cognitive benefits. Among pharmacological interventions, modafinil and lurasidone showed some cognitive benefits. Most studies had moderate risk of bias due to several common methodological challenges. As a supplement to our previous consensus‐based recommendations, we suggest that future cognition trials include: (i) increased sample sizes in trials through national and international collaborations when possible, (ii) pre‐selection of one cognition outcome as primary, (iii) pre‐screening for cognitive impairments within the targeted domain(s), (iv) strategies to aid transfer of cognitive gains to patients' daily lives, (v) adequate reporting of procedures for masking the allocation sequence, (vi) multimodal interventions and (vii) neuroimaging or other biomarkers to assess neurocircuitry target engagement. See the complete updated Task Force recommendations including our previous and newly added recommendations in Table 3. These include also recommendations regarding how to handle concomitant medication and specific classes of agents, criteria to select trial participants, how to define a 'clinically relevant' cognitive improvement, when to conduct pre‐ and post‐assessments and how to handle statistical issues around missing data. Following these recommendations will likely improve the chances of identifying effective pro‐cognitive treatments in RCTs and, thereby, accelerate the rate at which they can be integrated in the clinical management of mood disorders.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^51f0766f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mindfulness meditation is increasingly used as a component of psychological treatments for a variety of mental and physical health problems. Clinical trials of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated the strongest evidence for preventing depressive relapse, although MBIs also show promise for other indications. However, in addition to clinical trials that have examined this typical, extended format of mindfulness training, single-session experimental studies of very brief training (single session 'mindfulness induction': typically ≤ 20 min) have been conducted in healthy volunteers. Although some such studies demonstrated immediate benefits of brief mindfulness training exercises (e.g. on negative affect:), such studies are typically mechanistic, rather than aiming to establish clinical efficacy. For example, studies of mindfulness inductions have examined the neurophysiological basis of mindful mental states and the association between such states (or their accompanying neurophysiological changes), and adaptive changes in affect, cognition and behaviour; others have sought to identify active components of more comprehensive treatments by examining isolated mindfulness techniques. Given the brevity of these experimental mindfulness trainings/inductions, it is perhaps unsurprising that the observed effects are typically small (d ≈ 0.2) and short-lived. Despite this, such experimental studies are potentially highly informative in terms of identifying characteristics of participants who might show early treatment gains during a comprehensive/extended MBI, or in terms of developing novel, brief MBIs.

The nature of typical MBIs, both in terms of their short-term demands (prolonged within-session practice), and their relatively extended duration (typically spanning c. eight weeks), may not be optimal for some patient groups, and abbreviated treatments might be more accessible to a wider range of patients. However, other obstacles can prevent initial engagement with MBIs. Indeed, the specific focus of MBIs on self-regulation of attention represents a potential barrier in patients for whom attentional and motivational difficulties are an inherent symptom of their disorder. One approach to overcoming such obstacles may be to employ biological strategies (e.g. non-invasive brain stimulation or cognitive enhancing drugs) to support the basic attentional capacities required during MBIs. Laboratory-based studies of brief mindfulness trainings are ideally placed to preliminarily test such MBI-adjunctive treatments.

### Efficacy and safety of modafinil in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue [^edbecf03]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of modafinil in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue (CRF). DATA SOUCES: Literature was accessed via MEDLINE (1950-week 3, November 2008), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Google Scholar using the terms modafinil, cancer, and fatigue. Reference citations from articles identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language publications identified were analyzed for significance. Studies relevant to the objective were used, including 2 prospective open-label studies, one randomized double-blind, dose-controlled trial with an open-label extension, and one Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

Data Synthesis

Fatigue is a nearly universal adverse effect of cancer and its treatment that is unrelated to physical exertion, is not relieved by sleep or rest, and negatively affects quality of life. Modafinil is a central nervous system stimulant with minimal toxicity and a low propensity for abuse. Clinical data demonstrate that modafinil significantly reduces fatigue in patients who have received cancer treatment or are currently undergoing chemotherapy. Additional benefits include improvement in cognitive function, mood, general activity, walking ability, normal work ability, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. Limitations of the available data include open-label design in 3 of the 4 studies; the absence of numerical results of fatigue assessments in the abstract of 1 trial, preventing the determination of clinical significance; and the full inclusion/exclusion criteria, which were not included in the published abstracts. These limitations leave readers without a clear picture of the study populations. Finally, different patient populations at different points in treatment with varying durations of therapy were used, which makes extrapolation of data to the general population challenging.

Conclusions

Further randomized placebo-controlled trials are necessary to amass evidence for the effective and safe use of modafinil for CRF; however, if traditional therapies have failed or are intolerable, modafinil can be considered a treatment option.

### Psychostimulants for cancer-related cognitive impairment in adult cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9874a37b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive impairment is recognized as a common symptom experienced by cancer survivors which impacts on quality of life (QoL) and day-to-day activities. One of the treatment options is the use of psychostimulants but the evidence supporting its use remains unclear.

Objectives

To identify the level of evidence of psychostimulants' effect on the management of cognitive impairment in adult cancer survivors.

Methods

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL) and reference lists of relevant reviews were searched from inception to December 2017, with no language restrictions applied. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), evaluating the effect of psychostimulants on cognitive impairment among cancer patients with no primary or secondary brain tumor or brain radiation, were included. The primary outcome was cognitive function changes, whereas secondary outcomes were adverse events (AEs) and QoL.

Results

Six RCTs were included: three studies investigating methylphenidate and three modafinil, with a total of 244 and 146 patients, respectively. Due to important differences in methodologies between studies, a meta-analysis was assumed inappropriate for the primary outcome. A narrative synthesis was performed. One study using methylphenidate and two using modafinil demonstrated improvements in some cognitive functions as measured by objective cognitive assessment tests. Psychostimulants did not improve QoL and were not associated with more AEs.

Conclusion

To date, limited evidence is available to estimate the usefulness (or lack) of psychostimulants on cognitive function in this population.

5.5 Psychiatric Symptoms

Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with modafinil.

In the adult PROVIGIL controlled trials, psychiatric symptoms resulting in treatment discontinuation (at a frequency ≥ 0.3%) and reported more often in patients treated with PROVIGIL compared to those treated with placebo were anxiety (1%), nervousness (1%), insomnia (< 1%), confusion (< 1%), agitation (< 1%), and depression (< 1%).

Postmarketing adverse reactions associated with the use of modafinil have included mania, delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and aggression, some resulting in hospitalization. Many, but not all, patients had a prior psychiatric history. One healthy male volunteer developed ideas of reference, paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of PROVIGIL (three times the recommended dose) and sleep deprivation. There was no evidence of psychosis 36 hours after drug discontinuation.

Caution should be exercised when PROVIGIL is given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania. Consideration should be given to the possible emergence or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms in patients treated with PROVIGIL. If psychiatric symptoms develop in association with PROVIGIL administration, consider discontinuing PROVIGIL.

5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machinery

Although PROVIGIL has not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the CNS may alter judgment, thinking or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or other hazardous machinery until it is reasonably certain that PROVIGIL therapy will not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^440bbddc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

The absence of differences between the relaxation and mindfulness training strategies on the main outcomes of interest (particularly state mindfulness) highlights a general challenge in experimental studies of behavioural interventions that seek to selectively and potently activate a specific therapeutic process of interest (e.g. mindful attention). The challenge particularly arises in the design of suitable control conditions, namely conditions that resemble the active intervention and are equivalently credible, but are relatively inert (e.g. do not activate the neurophysiological/neurocognitive processes underlying mindful attentional states). In the current study, we designed the mindfulness and relaxation strategy instructions to be closely-matched in terms of duration, complexity, credibility and expectancy. Although we were successful in these respects, similar increases in state mindfulness in the two strategy conditions suggest that the relaxation instructions may have been insufficiently distinct from the mindfulness instructions, resulting in both strategies equivalently activating mindfulness-like subjective states. For example, both sets of strategy instructions indicated that participants should return to employing the strategy if their attention drifted. Thus, the relaxation instructions may have unintentionally activated a form of meta-cognitive awareness that is more typical of mindfulness exercises than relaxation. In addition, expert raters evaluated the strategy instructions to be 'moderately' (rather than highly) distinct in terms of the subjective and physiological states they were likely to engage (see). These considerations suggest that future research in this area should aim to employ more distinctive control strategies, which are nonetheless designed to be equivalent to active mindfulness conditions on credibility, expectancy, etc. (e.g. affective/cognitive suppression or reappraisal;).
