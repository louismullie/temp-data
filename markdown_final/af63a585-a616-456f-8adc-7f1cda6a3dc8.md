## Question

Abilify side conflicts

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Abilify (aripiprazole) "side conflicts", meaning adverse effects, interactions, and contraindications or precautions that could conflict with safe use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the conflict domains clearly and anchoring them to labeling and high-quality evidence. Then, I should stratify the most serious risks, especially boxed warnings and life-threatening conditions. Next, I will examine systemic adverse effects, followed by pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions, special populations, and functional risks. After that, I should review comparative trial data and dose–response considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical framework for decision-making, monitoring, and counseling, while noting key uncertainties and correcting any misstatements along the way if I catch them upon re-review of the sources [^116L4EWN] [^1153UoqX].

> Let me first confirm the scope of "side conflicts". I need to ensure we cover three pillars: adverse drug reactions and serious warnings, pharmacokinetic interactions affecting exposure, and disease-related contraindications or warnings that materially alter risk–benefit, with FDA labeling and systematic reviews as primary anchors for clinical reliability [^1122PgJb] [^116XLYBV] [^112vh5Yf].

> Now, I will stratify by severity starting with boxed warnings and life-threatening risks. Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis is a boxed warning with a 1.6–1.7-fold mortality increase over about 10 weeks, and the label states Abilify Asimtufii is not approved for treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis; I initially thought this constituted a formal contraindication, but wait, let me verify the precise label language because that matters legally and clinically: the labeling emphasizes "not approved" rather than an absolute contraindication, despite the strong boxed warning signal and increased cerebrovascular events in this group, so I should correct my earlier statement and retain the stronger caution consistent with labeling rather than an absolute prohibition [^112Bkb6X] [^114hCYkD].

> Next, I should review neuroleptic malignant syndrome. NMS is rare but potentially fatal, with hallmarks of hyperpyrexia, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability; management requires immediate discontinuation and supportive care, so I need to ensure we convey this as an emergent conflict that overrides routine dosing decisions [^111WuGfo] [^1122PgJb].

> I will now examine tardive dyskinesia. TD can be irreversible and risk increases with duration and cumulative exposure, with highest prevalence among the elderly, especially women; importantly, antipsychotics can transiently suppress TD manifestations, potentially masking progression, so I should emphasize dose minimization and periodic AIMS monitoring where feasible [^113UFVF3] [^111WuGfo].

> Moving to systemic metabolic adverse effects, let me consider hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, have class warnings for metabolic changes, with reports of severe hyperglycemia including ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar states; even though aripiprazole is often considered relatively metabolically sparing, monitoring fasting glucose and lipids at baseline and during treatment is still warranted, and rates of weight gain and glycemic changes can be clinically meaningful in susceptible patients, particularly in pediatrics where weight gain is more prominent [^116H8JcM] [^1159C5WX].

> For cardiovascular effects, I need to check orthostatic hypotension and cerebrovascular risks. The adult incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events was modestly higher than placebo, and falls are a meaningful downstream risk; hold on, I should verify the magnitude of orthostatic changes: significant orthostatic blood pressure change was not meaningfully different from placebo in adults, though caution is still advised in patients with cardiovascular disease or volume depletion, so my counseling should be calibrated rather than alarmist; for elderly with dementia-related psychosis, cerebrovascular adverse events are increased, reinforcing the earlier boxed warning risk tier [^1153UoqX] [^112Bkb6X] [^112NJjjZ].

> I should confirm hematologic risks. Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported; patients with prior low WBC or drug-induced leukopenia need more frequent early CBC monitoring and drug discontinuation if severe neutropenia develops, so this becomes a monitoring "conflict" in susceptible patients where other options may be preferable or vigilance heightened [^112NJjjZ] [^1122PgJb].

> Let me think about neurologic adverse effects beyond NMS and TD. Extrapyramidal symptoms in adults with schizophrenia are close to placebo overall, but akathisia is clearly increased; in pediatrics, EPS rates are higher than placebo, and akathisia is both dose-related and clinically disruptive, sometimes leading to discontinuation in adjunctive bipolar therapy, so slow titration and dose minimization are critical mitigation strategies; seizure threshold may be lowered, warranting caution in seizure disorders or concurrent pro-convulsant medications [^111fQTr2] [^113xQtWS] [^115tSb5Q] [^112NJjjZ].

> Turning to drug–drug interactions, I need to check CYP-mediated effects that alter exposure. Strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors can produce large exposure increases, with simulations indicating about a 4.5-fold increase in extensive metabolizers when both pathways are inhibited, and strong CYP3A4 inducers like carbamazepine can markedly reduce levels; these are high-stakes conflicts requiring dose reductions with inhibitors and dose increases with inducers to maintain therapeutic and safety windows, especially given aripiprazole's long half-life and active metabolite [^111LrQ2P] [^114eUvMj].

> Hold on, I should also verify common co-therapies that do not need adjustment. Based on PK data, coadministration with valproate, lithium, lorazepam, famotidine, lamotrigine, and sertraline generally does not require aripiprazole dose adjustment, and aripiprazole does not substantially change exposure of CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4 substrates, which simplifies many combination regimens in practice [^116XLYBV] [^111LrQ2P].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pediatrics. Wait, let me verify dose-response patterns in youth: EPS, somnolence, tremor, and akathisia exhibit dose-related increases in pediatric schizophrenia or bipolar trials, with higher discontinuation rates due to adverse events in pediatric bipolar mania versus placebo; weight gain and appetite increase are common, even though the metabolic liability may be less than agents like risperidone, so I must emphasize the balance between behavioral benefits and EPS or metabolic burdens and advocate for pediatric-specific dosing and monitoring cadence [^116SmzEr] [^112d2gTF] [^1158B1uF].

> I should double-check pregnancy and lactation guidance. Evidence from animal studies indicates developmental toxicity and increased stillbirths, supporting a risk-based use framework in pregnancy; third-trimester exposure has been associated with neonatal EPS or withdrawal, necessitating peripartum planning; during lactation, aripiprazole is present in breast milk and can reduce milk supply via prolactin effects, so infant hydration and weight gain should be monitored and maternal goals discussed; I initially thought the pregnancy categorization might be D, but wait, I need to correct that because the provided regulatory summaries align with a Category C risk framework and clinical risk–benefit assessment rather than an absolute contraindication [^1128ABp7] [^115ejdVC] [^111g9tmp] [^116Zi7ay].

> Let me consider pharmacogenomics and intrinsic factors. Known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have substantially higher aripiprazole exposure and generally require about a 50% dose reduction; I need to ensure any concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is factored additively, since poor metabolizer status plus inhibition can compound exposure increases [^115dX5hb].

> I should review functional impairment risks next. Aripiprazole can impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills, so patients should avoid hazardous activities, including driving, until individual response is known; somnolence shows a dose-response relationship at higher adult doses, so practical mitigation includes daytime dosing, dose reduction, or avoiding sedative co-therapies when possible [^116Zi7ay] [^116SmzEr].

> Body temperature regulation is another functional conflict. Antipsychotics can impair heat dissipation, increasing dehydration and heat stroke risk; thus, counseling to avoid overheating and to maintain hydration is important, particularly in warm climates or with exertion [^116Zi7ay] [^1122PgJb].

> Next, I will examine comparative tolerability and effectiveness signals. In first-episode schizophrenia, aripiprazole and risperidone had similar positive symptom response, with aripiprazole showing better metabolic outcomes but more akathisia, which can be a deciding factor if a patient is akathisia-prone; I should confirm the design strength, and hold on, the BETA trial was open-label and subject to bias, so any preference or tolerability advantages there should be interpreted cautiously compared with double-masked RCTs and Cochrane syntheses [^115sLnnz] [^113oWoXo] [^114qeYd8].

> Dose–response considerations are crucial for preventing avoidable side effects. Multiple trials indicate no efficacy advantage above 10–15 mg for schizophrenia, with receptor occupancy plateauing near 10 mg; I initially assumed that 20–30 mg might be superior, but wait, the evidence suggests diminishing returns with increasing adverse effects such as somnolence and EPS, so I should correct that assumption and recommend using the minimal effective dose aligned to clinical response and tolerability [^113h1BWX] [^11153Y43] [^116SmzEr].

> Synthesis and clinical decision framework now needs to be explicit. I need to ensure high-priority cautions include the boxed warning population with dementia-related psychosis where treatment is not approved and carries increased mortality and cerebrovascular risks, severe hematologic reactions with mandated monitoring and discontinuation thresholds, and significant pharmacokinetic interactions requiring dose adjustment or alternative therapies; for baseline and follow-up, I should confirm weight, BMI, fasting glucose, and lipid panels at baseline with periodic reassessment, CBC in those with WBC risk, fall risk assessment, and cardiovascular caution, adjusting cadence to patient risk and formulation half-life; for dosing, start low, typically 10–15 mg orally in adults, titrate slowly, avoid unnecessary doses above 20 mg given limited incremental efficacy and higher adverse effect burden, and adjust for CYP2D6 genotype and CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers; counseling must include compulsive behaviors, orthostatic dizziness, heat intolerance, driving caution, and recognition of red flags such as rigidity, fever, or new involuntary movements [^1122PgJb] [^116H8JcM] [^112NJjjZ] [^1153UoqX] [^113h1BWX] [^111LrQ2P].

> Next, I should review the key uncertainties and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. Suicidality data are insufficient to draw conclusions specific to aripiprazole in adults, warranting careful monitoring during initiation and dose changes; long-term metabolic risk remains challenging to disentangle from disease and population confounders; relative TD risk compared with other antipsychotics is not definitively known and should be framed as a class risk mitigated by dose and duration minimization and periodic AIMS assessments where indicated [^116BkM2d] [^116H8JcM] [^113UFVF3].

> Final clinical interpretation: Abilify often confers a relative metabolic advantage versus several comparators but carries a higher risk of akathisia and dose-related EPS, especially in youth and at higher doses; the most critical conflicts involve the elderly with dementia-related psychosis due to increased mortality and cerebrovascular events, substantial CYP-mediated interaction liabilities that can inflate exposure several fold, and hematologic or metabolic monitoring requirements that must be operationalized; individualized decisions should weight baseline metabolic status, EPS susceptibility, CYP2D6 genotype, seizure or cardiovascular risk, and fall potential, with a strong bias toward the lowest effective dose, proactive monitoring, and early mitigation of akathisia to preserve adherence and outcomes [^115sLnnz] [^112Bkb6X] [^111LrQ2P] [^1122PgJb].

---

Abilify (aripiprazole) has a **favorable side-effect profile** compared to other antipsychotics, with lower risks of weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and prolactin elevation [^114qeYd8], but a higher risk of akathisia and restlessness [^115sLnnz]. It is associated with **lower metabolic risk** than olanzapine or risperidone [^111YA3s6], yet can cause serious adverse effects, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^111WuGfo], tardive dyskinesia [^113UFVF3], and orthostatic hypotension [^1153UoqX]. Abilify is **not approved for dementia-related psychosis** due to increased mortality and stroke risk [^112Bkb6X], and monitoring is required for metabolic changes, EPS, and compulsive behaviors [^116H8JcM] [^1122PgJb].

---

## Common side effects of abilify

Abilify is generally well-tolerated, but **common side effects** include:

- **Akathisia**: Restlessness and inability to stay still [^113xQtWS].
- **Insomnia**: Difficulty sleeping [^1158B1uF].
- **Anxiety**: Increased nervousness or worry [^1159C5WX].
- **Nausea**: Feeling sick or queasy [^1158B1uF].
- **Headache**: Commonly reported [^1158B1uF].
- **Dizziness**: Feeling lightheaded or faint [^1158B1uF].
- **Somnolence**: Drowsiness or sleepiness [^116SmzEr].
- **Weight gain**: Less common than with other antipsychotics, but still possible.

---

## Serious side effects and warnings

Abilify carries several **serious side effects and warnings**, including:

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**: A potentially fatal condition characterized by hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability [^111WuGfo].
- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Potentially irreversible involuntary movements, particularly with long-term use [^113UFVF3].
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, leading to dizziness or fainting [^1153UoqX].
- **Seizures**: Increased risk, particularly in patients with a history of seizures or conditions lowering seizure threshold [^112vh5Yf].
- **Metabolic changes**: Hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain [^116H8JcM].
- **Compulsive behaviors**: Pathological gambling and other compulsive behaviors [^1122PgJb].
- **Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis**: Not approved for this population due to increased risk of death and cerebrovascular events [^112Bkb6X].

---

## Comparison with other antipsychotic medications

Abilify's **side effect profile differs** significantly from other antipsychotic medications:

| **Side effect** | **Abilify (aripiprazole)** | **Olanzapine** | **Risperidone** | **Quetiapine** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Weight gain | Moderate | High | Moderate | Moderate |
| Metabolic syndrome | Moderate | High | Moderate | Moderate |
| Prolactin elevation | Low | Moderate | High | Moderate |
| Sedation | Moderate | High | Moderate | High |
| Akathisia | High | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) | Moderate | Moderate | High | Moderate |

---

Abilify is associated with **lower risks** of weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and prolactin elevation than olanzapine and risperidone [^114qeYd8], yet has a **higher risk of akathisia** and restlessness [^115sLnnz].

---

## Patient populations at higher risk

Certain patient populations are at **higher risk** for specific side effects. Elderly patients with **dementia-related psychosis** have an increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular events [^112Bkb6X]. Those with a history of seizures have an increased risk of seizures [^112vh5Yf]. Patients with **cardiovascular disease** are at increased risk of orthostatic hypotension and cardiovascular events [^1153UoqX], and those with **metabolic risk factors** are at increased risk of hyperglycemia, diabetes, and dyslipidemia [^116H8JcM].

---

## Long-term side effects and complications

Long-term use of Abilify may lead to **tardive dyskinesia**, characterized by potentially irreversible involuntary movements [^113UFVF3], and **metabolic syndrome**, with an increased risk of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia [^116H8JcM]. Weight gain remains a moderate risk compared to other antipsychotics [^114qeYd8], and **compulsive behaviors** such as pathological gambling may occur [^1122PgJb].

---

## Drug interactions and contraindications

Abilify **interacts with several medications** and substances:

- **CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Increase aripiprazole levels, requiring dose adjustments [^111LrQ2P] [^116XLYBV].
- **CYP3A4 inducers**: Decrease aripiprazole levels, potentially reducing efficacy [^111LrQ2P] [^114eUvMj].
- **Alcohol and CNS depressants**: Increase risk of sedation and motor impairment.
- **Other antipsychotics**: Increased risk of EPS and metabolic side effects.

---

## Management strategies for side effects

Healthcare providers can **manage and mitigate side effects** through dose adjustments, switching to another antipsychotic with a different side effect profile, or using adjunctive medications such as beta-blockers for akathisia. Ongoing monitoring of metabolic parameters, weight, and prolactin levels, along with patient education about potential side effects and their management, are recommended [^1122PgJb].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes and quality of life

Patient-reported outcomes indicate that Abilify generally **improves quality of life** due to its favorable side effect profile compared to other antipsychotics [^113oWoXo]. However, akathisia and restlessness can negatively impact patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment [^115sLnnz].

---

## Regulatory warnings and black box warnings

Abilify carries several regulatory and black box warnings, including **increased mortality** in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis; it is not approved for this population [^112Bkb6X]. There is an increased risk of **suicidal ideation and behavior**, particularly in pediatric and young adult patients [^116BkM2d]. Additional warnings include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a potentially fatal condition, and tardive dyskinesia, which can be irreversible.

---

Abilify (aripiprazole) is an atypical antipsychotic with a **favorable side-effect profile** compared with other antipsychotics [^114qeYd8], but it **still carries serious risks** such as NMS, tardive dyskinesia [^111WuGfo], and metabolic changes [^116H8JcM]. Healthcare providers should carefully monitor patients and manage adverse effects through dose adjustments, switching medications, and patient education.

### Aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia [^111YA3s6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

In many countries of the industrialized world, second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics have become first-line drug treatments for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various second-generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review, we examine how the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole differ from that of other second-generation antipsychotics.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized trials comparing oral aripiprazole with oral forms of amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis using a random-effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (MD) again based on a random-effects model.

### Aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia [^114qeYd8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

In most Western industrialized countries, second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics are recommended as first-line drug treatments for people with schizophrenia. In this review, we specifically examine how the efficacy and tolerability of one such agent, aripiprazole, differs from that of other comparable second-generation antipsychotics.

- **Objectives**: To review the effects of aripiprazole compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2012), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies, and authors of trials for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing aripiprazole (oral) with oral and parenteral forms of amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, or zotepine for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model. Where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks for primary outcomes. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of evidence.

### Abilify [^1153UoqX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a potential side effect of Abilify, possibly due to its antagonistic effects on alpha-adrenergic receptors. In short-term, placebo-controlled trials involving adult patients on oral Abilify (n = 2,467), the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events included: orthostatic hypotension (1% for Abilify, 0.3% for placebo), postural dizziness (0.5% for Abilify, 0.3% for placebo), and syncope (0.5% for Abilify, 0.4% for placebo). In pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years (n = 732) on oral Abilify, the incidences were: orthostatic hypotension (0.5% for Abilify, 0% for placebo), postural dizziness (0.4% for Abilify, 0% for placebo), and syncope (0.2% for Abilify, 0%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The incidence of a significant orthostatic blood pressure change, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 20 mmHg with an increase in heart rate of ≥ 25 bpm from standing to supine, was not meaningfully different from placebo. In adult patients on oral Abilify, the incidence was 4% compared to 2% for placebo, while in pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years, it was 0.4% compared to 1% for placebo.

Caution is advised when using Abilify in patients with cardiovascular disease (such as a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions predisposing to hypotension, such as dehydration, hypovolemia, and concurrent use of antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Falls

Antipsychotics, including Abilify, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which can lead to falls, consequently increasing the risk of injury.

5.5 Metabolic changes

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.

- **Hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus**: Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with aripiprazole [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including Abilify Asimtufii, should be monitored regularly for the worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose tests.

### Abilify Asimtufii [^111WuGfo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported with antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment in the global clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue Abilify Asimtufii and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose increase. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued.

### Abilify asimtufii [^112Bkb6X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely involving patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5% compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. However, the extent to which findings of increased mortality in observational studies can be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to characteristics of the patients is unclear.

ABILIFY ASIMTUFII is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Cerebrovascular adverse reactions, including stroke in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis**: In placebo-controlled clinical studies (two flexible-dose and one fixed-dose study) of dementia-related psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke).

### Abilify [^113UFVF3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, Abilify should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective treatments are not available.

### Abilify [^113xQtWS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following findings are based on a pool of five placebo-controlled trials (four 4-week and one 6-week) in which oral Abilify was administered in doses ranging from 2 to 30 mg/day.

- **Commonly observed adverse reactions**: The only commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of Abilify in patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and Abilify incidence at least twice that for placebo) was akathisia (Abilify 8%; placebo 4%).

Adult Patients with Bipolar Mania

This section discusses findings based on a pool of 3-week, placebo-controlled, bipolar mania trials in which oral Abilify was administered at doses of 15 or 30 mg/day.

- **Commonly observed adverse reactions**: These are associated with the use of Abilify in patients with bipolar mania (incidence of 5% or greater and Abilify incidence at least twice that for placebo), though specific findings are detailed in Table 14.

- **Less common adverse reactions in adults**: Table 15 enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in schizophrenia and up to 3 weeks in bipolar mania). This includes only those reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with Abilify (doses ≥ 2 mg/day) and for which the incidence in patients treated with Abilify was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo in the combined dataset.

An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential adverse reaction incidence based on age or gender.

### SPL drug information for aripiprazole [^1159C5WX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Very common adverse reactions (over 10%) associated with the use of aripiprazole PO (also known as Abilify, Abilify MyCite) include agitation, anxiety, elevated blood glucose, headache, insomnia, nausea, skin irritation, somnolence, vomiting, and weight gain.

### Abilify [^116SmzEr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dose response relationships for the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were evaluated from four trials in adult patients with schizophrenia. These trials compared various fixed doses (2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg/day) of oral ABILIFY to placebo. This analysis, stratified by study, indicated that the only adverse reaction with a possible dose response relationship, most prominent at 30 mg, was somnolence (including sedation).

### Abilify [^1158B1uF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Adult patients**: The most common adverse reactions in adult patients in clinical trials (≥ 10%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, akathisia, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness.

- **Pediatric patients**: The most common adverse reactions in the pediatric clinical trials (≥ 10%) were somnolence, headache, vomiting, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and increased weight.

Abilify has been evaluated for safety in 13,543 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, dementia of the Alzheimer's type, Parkinson's disease, and alcoholism, with approximately 7,619 patient-years of exposure to oral Abilify and 749 patients with exposure to aripiprazole injection. A total of 3,390 patients were treated with oral Abilify for at least 180 days, and 1,933 patients treated with oral Abilify had at least one year of exposure.

In pediatric patients, Abilify has been evaluated for safety in 1,686 individuals (ages 6 to 18) who participated in multiple-dose clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder, or Tourette's disorder, and who had approximately 1,342 patient-years of exposure to oral Abilify. A total of 959 pediatric patients were treated with oral Abilify for at least six months.

### A randomized comparison of aripiprazole and risperidone for the acute treatment of first-episode schizophrenia and related disorders: 3-month outcomes [^115sLnnz]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). High credibility.

Research findings are particularly important for medication choice for first-episode patients as individual prior medication response to guide treatment decisions is unavailable. We describe the first large-scale double-masked randomized comparison with first-episode patients of aripiprazole and risperidone, two commonly used first-episode treatment agents. One hundred ninety-eight participants aged 15–40 years with schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, and who had been treated in their lifetime with antipsychotics for two weeks or less, were randomly assigned to double-masked aripiprazole (5–30 mg/d) or risperidone (1–6 mg/d) and followed for 12 weeks.

Positive symptom response rates did not differ (62.8% vs. 56.8%) nor did time to response. Aripiprazole-treated participants had better negative symptom outcomes but experienced more akathisia. Body mass index change did not differ between treatments but advantages were found for aripiprazole treatment for total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and prolactin levels. Post hoc analyses suggested advantages for aripiprazole on depressed mood.

Overall, if the potential for akathisia is a concern, low-dose risperidone as used in this trial maybe a preferred choice over aripiprazole. Otherwise, aripiprazole would be the preferred choice over risperidone in most situations based upon metabolic outcome advantages and some symptom advantages within the context of similar positive symptom response between medications.

### A prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study of aripiprazole in the management of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in general psychiatric practice: Broad Effectiveness Trial with Aripiprazole (BETA) [^113oWoXo]. Schizophrenia Research (2006). Low credibility.

BETA was designed to evaluate the overall effectiveness of aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated in a general psychiatry outpatient practice setting.

- **Methods**: In this 8-week, multicenter, open-label study, 1,599 outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive either aripiprazole (n = 1,295) or another antipsychotic medication (safety control [SC] group; n = 304). Aripiprazole was initiated at 15 mg/d with the option to adjust between 10–30 mg/d. The SC medication was specifically selected for each patient by the clinician and dosed according to prescribing guidelines for that medication. The primary effectiveness measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of the aripiprazole group at study endpoint. Secondary measures included response rates and preference of medicine (POM) ratings by patients and caregivers.

- **Results**: Sixty-five percent of aripiprazole patients completed the study. The mean aripiprazole dose at endpoint was 19.9 mg/d, with approximately 39% of patients starting and remaining at 15 mg/d. At endpoint, the mean CGI-I score of 2.77 demonstrated that aripiprazole was minimally to moderately effective; the mean CGI-I score for the SC group was 3.59, indicating minimally effective to no change. Fifty-three percent of aripiprazole patients responded to treatment (CGI-I score of 1 or 2; last-observation-carried-forward [LOCF]), and approximately 71% of patients and caregivers rated aripiprazole as better than the pre-study medication on the POM.

The drug interaction studies examined the effect of other drugs on the exposures of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole. The results are summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. Simulation indicated that a 4.5-fold increase in mean Cmax and AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. In poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, a 3-fold increase in mean Cmax and AUC values at steady-state is expected when administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

- **Figure 2**: The effect of other drugs on dehydro-aripiprazole pharmacokinetics.

The effect of Abilify on the exposures of other drugs is summarized in Figure 3. A population PK analysis in patients with major depressive disorder showed no substantial change in plasma concentrations of fluoxetine (20 or 40 mg/day), paroxetine CR (37.5 or 50 mg/day), or sertraline (100 or 150 mg/day) dosed to steady-state. The steady-state plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine increased by about 18% and 36%, respectively, while concentrations of paroxetine decreased by about 27%. The steady-state plasma concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were not substantially changed when these antidepressant therapies were coadministered with aripiprazole.

### Abilify [^116BkM2d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about the drug's effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e. beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, whether increases or decreases.

- **Symptoms to monitor**: Anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or who are experiencing emergent suicidal behavior.

### Aripiprazole for schizophrenia [^111DQyi2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). High credibility.

Treatment of people with schizophrenia using older typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol can be problematic. Many fail to respond, and more experience disabling adverse effects. Aripiprazole is said to be one of a new generation of atypical antipsychotics with good antipsychotic properties and minimal adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: The reviewers searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (May 2003), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. The authors contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, the FDA, and authors of trials for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: All clinical randomized trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

- **Main results**: Despite the fact that 4,125 people participated in ten randomized aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behavior, engagement with services, or satisfaction with treatment.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Abilify Asimtufii, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment, and conduct them recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

- **Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis**: In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include a pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of Abilify Asimtufii at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

	- Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue Abilify Asimtufii in patients with severe neutropenia (ANC < 1000/mm3) and follow their WBC counts until recovery.

- **Lactation**:

	**Risk summary**: Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. Based on published case reports and pharmacovigilance reports, aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period may lead to clinically relevant decreases in milk supply, which may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug. There are also reports of aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and no maternal milk supply in the postpartum period. Effects on milk supply may be mediated through decreases in prolactin levels, which have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor the breastfed infant for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Abilify Asimtufii and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Abilify Asimtufii or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Abilify [^1153hJUq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in schizophrenia or bipolar mania is unclear. However, the efficacy of aripiprazole in the listed indications could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively). It has moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, alpha1-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively). Additionally, it shows moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki = 98 nM) and has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50 > 1000 nM).

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Abilify activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole. Dehydro-aripiprazole has been shown to have affinities for D2 receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination half-lives are approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole and 94 hours for dehydro-aripiprazole. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics, and at steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole is dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isoenzymes.

### Abilify asimtufii [^1133FiRL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Following single dose administration of Abilify Asimtufii, the mean apparent terminal elimination half-life of aripiprazole was 21 days.

- **Metabolism**: Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. Following administration of multiple doses of Abilify Asimtufii, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents approximately 29% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.

- **Excretion**: Following a single oral dose of 14C-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine, and approximately 18% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces.

- **Studies in specific populations**: No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with Abilify Asimtufii in specific populations. All the information is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole or is based on the pharmacokinetic modeling of oral aripiprazole and/or Abilify Asimtufii.

Aripiprazole is a relatively new antipsychotic drug, considered the prototype of a new third generation of antipsychotics, known as dopamine-serotonin system stabilizers. This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole compared to typical antipsychotics.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with other typical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2007), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized trials comparing aripiprazole with typical antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, using a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) based on a random effects model. We contacted representatives of Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals (UK) for additional and missing data.

- **Main results**: We included nine randomized trials involving 3122 people comparing aripiprazole with typical antipsychotic drugs. None of the studies reported on relapse, our primary outcome of interest. Attrition from studies was high, and data reporting was poor.

To evaluate relationships between aripiprazole dose, plasma level, pharmacologic activity, and clinical outcome, we aimed to assess the potential for therapeutic drug monitoring.

In August 2008, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases using the keywords aripiprazole, plasma levels, plasma concentration, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Twenty-one reports were retrieved. Eight studies investigating the relationship between blood concentrations of aripiprazole and dose, dopamine D(2)/D(3) occupancy, and/or outcome and adverse effects were then selected.

All data concerning plasma or serum concentrations of aripiprazole were included if concentrations were reported in relation to a dose, dopamine occupancy, or clinical outcome. Reports solely investigating drug interactions were not included.

A strong correlation exists between aripiprazole dose and plasma concentration. Positron emission tomography analyses suggest that there are significant relationships between dopamine receptor occupancy and both aripiprazole dose and blood concentration. Dopamine receptor occupancy appears to reach a plateau at doses above 10 mg, supporting the observation found in dose-response studies that 10 mg/d is the optimal dose for aripiprazole.

In conclusion, the dose range for aripiprazole is well defined, and it reliably predicts plasma level, dopamine receptor occupancy, and clinical response. Plasma level variation appears to have minimal impact on clinical response, but it may predict some adverse effects.

### Abilify [^115tSb5Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following findings are based on a placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with bipolar disorder in which Abilify was administered at doses of 15 or 30 mg/day as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.

- **Adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment**: In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 12% for patients treated with adjunctive Abilify compared to 6% for patients treated with adjunctive placebo. The most common adverse drug reactions associated with discontinuation in the adjunctive Abilify-treated compared to placebo-treated patients were akathisia (5% and 1%, respectively) and tremor (2% and 1%, respectively).

- **Commonly observed adverse reactions**: The commonly observed adverse reactions associated with adjunctive Abilify and lithium or valproate in patients with bipolar mania (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence at least twice that for adjunctive placebo) were: akathisia, insomnia, and extrapyramidal disorder.

- **Less common adverse reactions in adult patients with adjunctive therapy in bipolar mania**: Adverse reactions were reported during acute treatment (up to 6 weeks) that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with adjunctive Abilify (doses of 15 or 30 mg/day) and lithium or valproate, with incidences greater than those treated with the combination alone.

### Aripiprazole alone or in combination for acute mania [^115f8ByP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by episodes of elevated or irritable mood (manic or hypomanic episodes) and episodes of low mood and loss of energy (depressive episodes). Drug treatment is the first-line treatment for acute mania, with the initial aim of rapid control of agitation, aggression, and dangerous behavior. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, is used in the treatment of mania both as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. The British Association of Psychopharmacology guidelines report that, in monotherapy placebo-controlled trials, the atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, have been shown to be effective for acute manic or mixed episodes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole alone or in combination with other antimanic drug treatments, compared with placebo and other drug treatments, in alleviating acute symptoms of manic or mixed episodes. Other objectives include reviewing the acceptability of treatment with aripiprazole, investigating the adverse effects of aripiprazole treatment, and determining overall mortality rates among those receiving aripiprazole treatment.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) was searched, covering all years up to July 31, 2013. This register contains relevant randomized controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (since 1950), EMBASE (since 1974), and PsycINFO (since 1967). We also searched the Bristol-Myers Squibb clinical trials register.

### Abilify [^117J8ftB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Abilify in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was demonstrated in two short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled trials involving adult patients. These patients met DSM-IV criteria for MDD and had shown an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) during the current episode. Additionally, they exhibited an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant therapy, which included medications such as paroxetine controlled-release, venlafaxine extended-release, fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline. An inadequate response to prospective treatment was defined as less than a 50% improvement on the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17), a minimal HAMD17 score of 14, and a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement rating of no better than minimal improvement. An inadequate response to prior treatment was characterized by less than a 50% improvement as perceived by the patient after at least 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose.

- **Primary and secondary instruments**: The primary instrument for assessing depressive symptoms was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to evaluate the degree of depressive symptomatology. The key secondary instrument was the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a 3-item self-rated tool used to assess the impact of depression on three domains of functioning, with each item scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme).

In the two trials (n = 381, n = 362), Abilify was superior to placebo in reducing mean MADRS total scores.

### Abilify asimtufii [^115dX5hb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of Abilify Asimtufii did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience and pharmacokinetic data have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This approach accounts for the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.

	- In single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies with oral aripiprazole, there was no detectable age effect in the population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenia patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dosage adjustments are recommended based on age alone. Abilify Asimtufii is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **CYP2D6 poor metabolizers**: Dosage adjustment is recommended in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers due to high aripiprazole concentrations. Approximately 8% of Caucasians and 3% to 8% of Black/African Americans cannot metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers (PM) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Abilify [^116YD6tG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the context of major depressive disorder, short-term, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that the incidence of EPS-related events, excluding those related to akathisia, was 8% in patients treated with adjunctive Abilify compared to 5% in those receiving adjunctive placebo. Moreover, the incidence of akathisia-related events was significantly higher for adjunctive Abilify-treated patients at 25%, compared to 4% for adjunctive placebo-treated patients. The trials further elucidated that the SAS and the BARS scores indicated a pronounced difference between adjunctive Abilify and adjunctive placebo, with scores of Abilify at 0.31 and 0.22 compared to placebo scores of 0.03 and 0.02, respectively. Notably, changes in the AIMS were similarly observed in both the adjunctive Abilify and adjunctive placebo groups.

For autistic disorder, particularly in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years, short-term, placebo-controlled trials reported that the incidence of EPS-related events, excluding akathisia, was 18% for those treated with Abilify versus 2% for placebo. Interestingly, the incidence of akathisia-related events in Abilify-treated patients was 3%, in contrast to 9% for placebo. In these pediatric trials, the SAS scores displayed a significant distinction between Abilify and placebo, with scores of 0.1 for Abilify and –0.4 for placebo, while the changes in the BARS and the AIMS scores were comparable between the two groups.

In trials concerning Tourette's Disorder, specifically in pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years, the short-term, placebo-controlled studies noted the incidence of EPS-related events, excluding those concerning akathisia, was 7% for Abilify-treated patients, compared to 6% for those receiving placebo.

### Aripiprazole for schizophrenia [^111Gq2oc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment of individuals with schizophrenia using older typical antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, can be problematic. Many patients fail to respond to these older antipsychotics, and more people experience disabling adverse effects. Aripiprazole is considered part of a new generation of atypical antipsychotics, offering good antipsychotic properties with minimal adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole on individuals with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (September 2005), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, the FDA, and authors of trials for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: All clinical randomized trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo, typical, or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

- **Main results**: Despite the fact that 7,110 people participated in fifteen randomized aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behavior, or engagement with services.

### Abilify [^116L4EWN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Efficacy of Abilify was established in the following adequate and well-controlled trials:

- **Clinical studies (14.1)**: Four short-term trials and one maintenance trial in adult patients and one short-term trial in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia.
- **Clinical studies (14.2)**: Four short-term monotherapy trials and one 6-week adjunctive trial in adult patients, and one short-term monotherapy trial in pediatric patients (ages 10 to 17 years) with manic or mixed episodes. One maintenance monotherapy trial and one maintenance adjunctive trial in adult patients with bipolar I disorder.
- **Clinical studies (14.3)**: Two short-term trials in adult patients with MDD who had an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy during the episode.
- **Clinical studies (14.4)**: Two short-term trials in pediatric patients (ages 6 to 17 years) for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder.
- **Clinical studies (14.5)**: Two short-term trials in pediatric patients (ages 6 to 18 years) with Tourette's Disorder.

- **Adults**: The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in five short-term (4-week and 6-week) placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish Abilify from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials).

In a study involving pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with Tourette's Disorder, no common adverse reactions exhibited a dose-response relationship.

- **Schizophrenia in adults**: In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding those related to akathisia, was 13% for ABILIFY-treated patients compared to 12% for placebo. The incidence of akathisia-related events for ABILIFY-treated patients was 8% compared to 4% for placebo.

- **Schizophrenia in pediatric patients**: In short-term, placebo-controlled trials involving patients aged 13 to 17 years, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding those related to akathisia, was 25% for ABILIFY-treated patients compared to 7% for placebo. Akathisia-related events were 9% for ABILIFY-treated patients compared to 6% for placebo.

Objectively collected data from these trials were assessed for EPS using the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), for akathisia using the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and for dyskinesias using the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (AIMS). In the adult schizophrenia trials, objective data did not show a difference between ABILIFY and placebo, except for the BARS (ABILIFY, 0.08; placebo, –0.05). In pediatric trials, objective data showed no difference between ABILIFY and placebo, except for the SAS (ABILIFY, 0.24; placebo, –0.29).

### Abilify [^117Mz9Dp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with bipolar mania were established in a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 197 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years. Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients.

The efficacy of adjunctive Abilify with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated. However, such efficacy and the lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between aripiprazole and lithium or valproate can be extrapolated from adult data, along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients demonstrating irritability associated with autistic disorder were established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 212 pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years. A maintenance trial was conducted in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with irritability associated with autistic disorder. The first phase of this trial was an open-label, flexibly dosed (aripiprazole 2 to 15 mg/day) phase in which patients were monitored closely.

We also acknowledge that aripiprazole takes 14 days to reach a steady state, whereas amisulpride reaches a steady state in 3 days. Although this is another important potential consideration, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study of aripiprazole in healthy volunteers found that exposure (area under the curve over 24 hours) following 8 days of aripiprazole at 10 mg daily was within 10% of exposure at 14 days. In our study, antipsychotic levels were collected as close as possible to outcome data, with a maximum interval of a few hours, making it unlikely that plasma level fluctuations influenced the results, considering the 94-hour half-life of aripiprazole and its active metabolite. Additionally, the mean plasma aripiprazole concentration in our study corresponds to that associated with approximately 80% striatal D2/D3 occupancy. For these reasons, we believe it is unlikely that an inadequate dose or duration of aripiprazole treatment explains the drug differences, although future studies could test this further. Finally, all previous double-blind investigations of the effects of antipsychotics on reward function in healthy volunteers have used only single doses, whereas our study more closely mimics the clinical use of antipsychotics by investigating repeated administration.

Our finding that amisulpride induced negative symptoms may seem surprising, as there is some evidence that low-dose (50–300 mg) amisulpride is effective as a treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia. This has been hypothesized to relate to lower doses binding to presynaptic autoreceptors to enhance dopamine transmission.

### Abilify [^113h1BWX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg daily doses of Abilify was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group in these studies. An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness based on age, gender, or race.

A longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to Abilify 15 mg/day or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as a CGI-Improvement score of ≥ 5 (minimally worse), scores of ≥ 5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or a ≥ 20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving Abilify 15 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo (Study 5 in Figure 6).

- **Pediatric patients**: The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and had a PANSS score of ≥ 70 at baseline. In this trial (n = 302), comparing two fixed doses of Abilify (10 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, Abilify was titrated starting from 2 mg/day to the target.
