## Question

risk factors, prognosis, clinical manifestations of central diabetes insipidus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk factors, prognosis, and clinical manifestations of central diabetes insipidus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining central diabetes insipidus and its pathophysiology. Then, I should categorize risk factors by etiology and quantify them where possible. Next, I will examine clinical manifestations and diagnostic thresholds. After that, I should evaluate prognosis across settings and identify predictors of outcomes. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios and synthesize practical takeaways for clinicians, making sure I double-check key claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), now often termed arginine vasopressin deficiency, reflects impaired synthesis or release of AVP from the hypothalamic–posterior pituitary axis, leading to hypotonic polyuria and compensatory polydipsia; clinically, polyuria is typically defined as more than 50 mL/kg/day, and urine is dilute with low specific gravity and osmolality when AVP is deficient or absent [^113oMceE] [^112K2Ush] [^114NnP5Z].

> Hold on, I should verify the epidemiologic context before attributing risk. Medically treated CDI is uncommon, with a prevalence around 7–10 per 100,000, and most cases are acquired rather than familial, though genetic forms do occur and are important in pediatrics and early-onset presentations [^115Y6buZ] [^113oMceE] [^117U8GcH].

> Now, I will categorize risk factors by etiology, starting with neoplastic causes. Suprasellar and sellar tumors are leading etiologies in children and adults, including germinomas, craniopharyngiomas, and pituitary adenomas. Importantly, CDI can be the initial manifestation of a sellar germ cell tumor, and delayed diagnosis is common, which underscores the need for early MRI and tumor surveillance in unexplained CDI [^113HEgbe] [^113NGDAc] [^116nDspL].

> Wait, let me verify infiltrative and granulomatous diseases next. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) carries a substantial risk of CDI, with multisystem disease and craniofacial bone involvement increasing risk several-fold; long-term, the cumulative incidence of CDI in LCH can approach 20% at 15 years, and skull lesions are considered CNS risk lesions that portend neurodegenerative complications and DI risk [^113GfWa2] [^111etPr6]. I should also note that Erdheim–Chester disease and sarcoidosis can infiltrate the hypothalamic–pituitary region and cause CDI, sometimes preceding overt systemic disease by years [^112y3X3H] [^115S6mmq].

> I need to check traumatic and surgical etiologies carefully. Severe traumatic brain injury is a major risk, with CDI occurring in roughly 14–18% of severe TBI cohorts and strongly associated with mortality and poor outcomes; early onset within 48 hours and extreme hypernatremia worsen prognosis, and the triphasic response (DI–SIADH–DI) is a classic but treacherous pattern after pituitary or hypothalamic injury [^1175fY6a] [^11138Qen] [^113uzWWS]. Postoperative CDI after transsphenoidal surgery is common, with reported incidences ranging widely due to inconsistent definitions; risk increases with suprasellar extension, craniopharyngioma histology, younger age, and higher-grade intraoperative CSF leaks, and early copeptin can help predict postoperative CDI [^114bcF95] [^114rzpxC] [^116Hogeb].

> Let me consider autoimmune and inflammatory causes. Autoimmune infundibuloneurohypophysitis presents with CDI and pituitary stalk thickening; in children, stalk thickening often regresses, but CDI tends to be permanent, and anti–AVP-cell antibodies are found in a meaningful subset of "idiopathic" cases, especially in younger patients with autoimmune histories or stalk changes on MRI [^111ognk2] [^116phyWX]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can precipitate hypophysitis with CDI, albeit less commonly than other pituitary axes, and require high suspicion and multidisciplinary management [^111wFnHc] [^113DRyiF].

> I should confirm infectious associations. Case series and reports describe CDI after COVID-19, sometimes with MRI evidence of infundibuloneurohypophysitis; while causality remains uncertain, SARS-CoV-2 may access the hypothalamus via permeable periventricular regions, so new-onset polyuria and polydipsia after COVID-19 warrant evaluation for CDI [^114jBiUv] [^1144SpiN] [^112J4CfW].

> But wait, what about genetic and familial forms. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus results from AVP gene mutations and typically presents in childhood; early recognition enables family screening and prevents complications from delayed diagnosis, and parents familiar with the phenotype often manage hydration effectively while still benefiting from desmopressin when needed [^117U8GcH] [^111xAHS8].

> Next, I should review clinical manifestations and diagnostic thresholds to avoid misclassification. The core phenotype is hypotonic polyuria with compensatory polydipsia; in pediatrics, pathological polyuria is often defined as exceeding 2 L/m²/day, and paired hyperosmolar serum with hypo-osmolar urine supports CDI, while urine specific gravity is typically less than 1.010 and urine osmolality less than 300 mOsm/kg in complete forms [^111sNEpC] [^113hpEKV] [^111BuKLA]. Hypernatremia reflects inadequate intake or impaired thirst, and in severe TBI cohorts, maximum sodium above 160 mEq/L correlates with worse outcomes; importantly, patients may not appear polyuric if volume depleted, so I need to ensure I interpret urine output in the context of volume status and access to fluids [^114cfrtE] [^1144tuNh].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach and not overstate any single test. Classical water deprivation testing remains useful, but copeptin-based algorithms after osmotic or nonosmotic stimulation increasingly supplant older methods due to higher accuracy and practicality; basal copeptin above about 21 pmol/L suggests nephrogenic DI, whereas stimulated copeptin below about 4.9 pmol/L supports complete CDI, and very low copeptin in hypernatremia is diagnostic of CDI and an indication for desmopressin [^112aMjCc] [^112GAeW1] [^112sFBJE]. I should double-check that MRI of the pituitary and stalk is essential to identify tumors, stalk thickening, or loss of the posterior pituitary bright spot, and that a structured follow-up plan is critical in idiopathic cases because occult etiologies may declare over time [^116nDspL] [^111BuKLA].

> I will now examine prognosis and outcomes, being careful to separate acute neurocritical care from chronic endocrine settings. In severe TBI, CDI is an early complication and a marker of diffuse hypothalamic–pituitary injury; mortality is high, and early onset with extreme hypernatremia predicts poor outcomes, though aggressive neurocritical care interventions may mitigate risk in select patients [^1175fY6a] [^11138Qen]. In contrast, in nontraumatic chronic CDI, life expectancy is near-normal with appropriate desmopressin and monitoring, but morbidity is driven by treatment-related hyponatremia, adipsia-related hypernatremia, and unrecognized anterior pituitary deficits; patient surveys show frequent hospitalizations for hyponatremia and frequent mismanagement when nil-by-mouth without desmopressin coverage [^115WGzLH] [^114CK61s].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific prognostic signals. In children with idiopathic-appearing CDI, the degree of pituitary stalk thickening at presentation stratifies long-term risk of permanent anterior pituitary dysfunction. Severe stalk thickening correlates with higher probability of multi-axis deficits, and a meaningful minority later reveal LCH or germinoma, reinforcing the need for serial MRI and endocrine surveillance [^113HEgbe] [^116nDspL]. I should confirm that postoperative CDI after craniopharyngioma is very common and often permanent, and that the triphasic pattern complicates inpatient fluid management and mandates close electrolyte monitoring [^113uzWWS].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that alter risk or management. Pregnancy can unmask or transiently worsen CDI via placental vasopressinase, and desmopressin is effective and safe when needed. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy can precipitate hypophysitis with CDI and requires coordinated endocrine management. And in brain death, the absence of CDI does not preclude the diagnosis because residual neuroendocrine function can persist, with renal function modulating whether polyuria manifests [^114xcuvP] [^111wFnHc] [^113kg8kU] [^1122JhKT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the prevalence of CDI was about 1 in 25,000, but I should double-check that figure. That estimate pertains to diabetes insipidus overall; medically treated central DI is closer to 7–10 per 100,000, so I should correct that to avoid overstating incidence [^11292txb] [^115Y6buZ].

> Let me synthesize practical clinical takeaways while keeping the evidence front and center. CDI risk is highest in the settings of severe TBI, transsphenoidal pituitary surgery especially for craniopharyngioma, LCH with craniofacial involvement, autoimmune hypophysitis, and selected malignancies; early recognition hinges on measuring paired serum and urine osmolality in polyuria, using copeptin-based testing when available, and obtaining pituitary MRI to uncover occult tumors or stalk disease, with longitudinal follow-up to catch evolving etiologies [^1175fY6a] [^114rzpxC] [^113GfWa2] [^112aMjCc] [^116nDspL]. Prognosis ranges from high acute mortality in TBI-associated CDI to excellent long-term stability with desmopressin in chronic nontraumatic cases, but complications are common without education on intermittent aquaresis and inpatient safety protocols; clinicians should anticipate hyponatremia with over-replacement, hypernatremia with adipsia or access issues, and unrecognized anterior pituitary deficits, and they should align with patient-preferred nomenclature to reduce dangerous confusion with diabetes mellitus [^115WGzLH] [^114CK61s] [^112rfBhP].

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is caused by **arginine vasopressin deficiency** from hypothalamic–posterior pituitary injury, leading to polyuria, polydipsia, and hypernatremia if fluids are restricted [^113oMceE]. The most common risk factors are **pituitary surgery, trauma, tumors, and infiltrative or autoimmune diseases**; idiopathic cases are common, especially in children and young adults [^113HEgbe] [^112sFBJE]. Prognosis depends on etiology: idiopathic or autoimmune CDI often stabilizes with desmopressin, whereas tumor-related or severe trauma-associated CDI carries higher morbidity and mortality, particularly with hypernatremia or adipsia [^112Hbktf] [^1175fY6a]. Early recognition and desmopressin therapy are essential to prevent complications [^114CK61s].

## Risk factors and etiologies

CDI arises from diverse causes; **identifying the etiology is critical** for prognosis and management [^116nDspL].

| **Category** | **Etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Traumatic | - Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) [^1175fY6a] <br/> - Pituitary or hypothalamic surgery [^114bcF95] <br/> - Skull base fractures [^1175fY6a] |
| Neoplastic | - Craniopharyngioma [^113uzWWS] <br/> - Germinoma [^113NGDAc] <br/> - Pituitary adenoma [^112Hbktf] <br/> - Metastases [^112sFBJE] |
| Infiltrative/inflammatory | - Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) [^113GfWa2] <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^115S6mmq] <br/> - Autoimmune hypophysitis [^111ognk2] <br/> - Erdheim-Chester disease [^112y3X3H] |
| Genetic | - AVP gene mutations (familial neurohypophyseal DI) [^117U8GcH] <br/> - Wolfram syndrome [^notfound] |
| Infectious | - COVID-19-associated hypophysitis [^112J4CfW] <br/> - Meningitis/encephalitis [^114cfrtE] |
| Idiopathic | - Autoimmune or unknown etiology, especially in children and young adults [^113HEgbe] [^116phyWX] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

CDI presents with characteristic features; **prompt recognition is essential** to prevent complications [^116nDspL].

- **Polyuria**: Large volumes of dilute urine (> 3 L/day in adults; > 2 L/m²/day in children) [^111sNEpC] [^112K2Ush].
- **Polydipsia**: Excessive thirst, often with preference for cold water [^notfound].
- **Nocturia**: Frequent nighttime urination [^111WS3eu].
- **Hypernatremia**: If fluid intake is restricted or thirst is impaired; serum sodium > 145 mmol/L [^117T8Yan] [^115Rrr1h].
- **Dehydration**: Dry mucosa, tachycardia, hypotension, lethargy, confusion [^notfound].
- **Adipsia**: Impaired thirst perception, increasing hypernatremia risk [^117T8Yan].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by etiology, treatment response, and complications; **early diagnosis and management improve outcomes** [^116nDspL].

- **Idiopathic/autoimmune CDI**: Often stable with desmopressin; risk of hyponatremia from overtreatment [^114CK61s].
- **Tumor-related CDI**: Higher morbidity/mortality; risk of recurrence, additional pituitary deficits, and neuro-ophthalmologic complications [^113NGDAc].
- **Trauma/surgery-related CDI**: May be transient or permanent; triphasic response (DI-SIADH-DI) is common post-pituitary surgery [^113uzWWS].
- **Hypernatremia**: Associated with seizures, cerebral hemorrhage, and increased mortality, especially in TBI or critical illness [^115Rrr1h] [^113uxLF1].
- **Hyponatremia**: From desmopressin overtreatment or SIADH phase; risk of seizures and neurologic injury [^114CK61s] [^1125c297].
- **Quality of life**: Impaired due to polyuria, nocturia, and treatment side effects [^115WGzLH].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Accurate diagnosis and etiologic evaluation are essential; **copeptin testing is increasingly used** to differentiate CDI from other polyuria-polydipsia syndromes [^11292txb].

- **Initial tests**: Serum/urine osmolality, sodium, glucose; exclude diabetes mellitus [^113hpEKV].
- **Water deprivation test**: Gold standard; CDI shows inability to concentrate urine despite dehydration [^116GGMzr].
- **Copeptin measurement**: Basal > 21 pmol/L suggests nephrogenic DI; hypertonic saline-stimulated copeptin < 4.9 pmol/L supports CDI [^112aMjCc].
- **MRI**: Essential to identify tumors, infiltrative disease, or stalk abnormalities [^111BuKLA].

---

## Management and follow-up

Desmopressin (DDAVP) is the cornerstone of therapy; **individualized dosing and patient education** are critical to balance efficacy and safety [^114CK61s].

- **Desmopressin**: Intranasal, oral, or injectable forms; titrate to control polyuria while avoiding hyponatremia [^117UNBgQ].
- **Patient education**: Fluid management, recognition of hyponatremia/hypernatremia, and emergency protocols [^114CK61s].
- **Monitoring**: Regular serum sodium, urine output, and pituitary function assessments [^115wd1Ld].
- **Address underlying etiology**: Tumor treatment, immunosuppression for autoimmune disease, or management of infiltrative disorders [^notfound].

Central diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder with significant morbidity if unrecognized or undertreated. Early **identification of etiology**, desmopressin therapy, and vigilant monitoring of sodium and pituitary function are key to optimizing outcomes [^113oMceE].

Diabetes insipidus is a rare complication after carbon monoxide poisoning. We report on a woman and her daughter who were noted to have polyuria and hypernatremia after exposure to carbon monoxide. Both patients were responsive to desmopressin therapy, and the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus was made. The development and correction of hypernatremia further complicated the neurological damages caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. These cases illustrate the possibility of central diabetes insipidus and hypernatremia after carbon monoxide poisoning and the importance of immediate antidiuretic hormone treatment and careful fluid therapy.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) management — Good Practice Statements for desmopressin (DDAVP) state that we suggest individualized therapeutic schedules, and some patients with partial DI may prefer no treatment; to reduce hyponatremia risk, we recommend that clinicians educate all patients about the risk of overdosing and have patients periodically (at least weekly) experience a phase of polyuria when the medication effect has worn off. In postpituitary surgery DI, we suggest that clinicians should make at least one attempt to discontinue DDAVP during the weeks to months after surgery to determine whether posterior pituitary function has recovered. In cases of adipsic DI, we suggest careful DDAVP and fluid intake titration that includes frequent weighing and serum sodium level monitoring. We suggest that all patients with DI wear an emergency bracelet or necklace to inform clinicians of the patient's health problem if incapacitated.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^114NnP5Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome which results from loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, resulting in impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP deficiency leads to the inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in a clinical syndrome of hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. CDI is caused by diverse etiologies, although it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, providing insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome. Recent developments in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have improved accuracy and acceptability of the diagnostic approach to the hypotonic polyuria syndrome. We discuss the management of CDI with particular emphasis on management of fluid intake and pharmacological replacement of AVP. Specific clinical syndromes such as adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy as well as management of the perioperative patient with diabetes insipidus are also discussed.

### The relation between the incidence of hypernatremia and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^115Rrr1h]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The study was aimed at verifying whether the occurrence of hypernatremia during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay increases the risk of death in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We performed a retrospective study on a prospectively collected database including all patients consecutively admitted over a 3-year period with a diagnosis of TBI (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8) to a general/neurotrauma ICU of a university hospital, providing critical care services in a catchment area of about 1,200,000 inhabitants.

Methods

Demographic, clinical, and ICU laboratory data were prospectively collected; serum sodium was assessed an average of three times per day. Hypernatremia was defined as two daily values of serum sodium above 145 mmol/l. The major outcome was death in the ICU after 14 days. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used, with time-dependent variates designed to reflect exposure over time during the ICU stay: hypernatremia, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) administration as a surrogate marker for the presence of central diabetes insipidus, and urinary output. The same models were adjusted for potential confounding factors.

Results

We included in the study 130 TBI patients (mean age 52 years (standard deviation 23); males 74%; median Glasgow Coma Score 3 (range 3 to 8); mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 50 (standard deviation 15)); all were mechanically ventilated; 35 (26.9%) died within 14 days after ICU admission. Hypernatremia was detected in 51.5% of the patients and in 15.9% of the 1,103 patient-day ICU follow-up. In most instances hypernatremia was mild (mean 150 mmol/l, interquartile range 148 to 152). The occurrence of hypernatremia was highest (P = 0.003) in patients with suspected central diabetes insipidus (25/130, 19.2%), a condition that was associated with increased severity of brain injury and ICU mortality. After adjustment for the baseline risk, the incidence of hypernatremia over the course of the ICU stay was significantly related with increased mortality (hazard ratio 3.00 (95% confidence interval: 1.34 to 6.51; P = 0.003)). However, DDAVP use modified this relation (P = 0.06), hypernatremia providing no additional prognostic information in the instances of suspected central diabetes insipidus.

Conclusions

Mild hypernatremia is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with severe TBI. In a proportion of the patients the association between hypernatremia and death is accounted for by the presence of central diabetes insipidus.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^113XGHuL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Investigation and management of hypotonic polyuria is a common challenge in clinical endocrinology. The 3 main causes, recently renamed to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), and primary polydipsia (PP) require accurate diagnosis, as management differs for each. This new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and has now been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED). Advances in diagnosis over the last few years have centered around the use of copeptin measurement. Here, we use 3 patient case histories to highlight the use of this approach, and to demonstrate how it can succeed where other approaches, such as the water deprivation test, sometimes fail. We discuss the overall approach to each type of patient and the strengths and limitations of diagnostic strategies, illustrating the use of the new nomenclature.

### Central diabetes insipidus and autoimmunity: relationship between the occurrence of antibodies to arginine vasopressin-secreting cells and clinical, immunological, and radiological features in a large cohort of patients with central diabetes insipidus of known and unknown etiology [^116phyWX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare hypothalamus-pituitary disease due to the deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP) synthesis from the hypothalamus and/or secretion from the neurohypophysis. The etiology of CDI is unknown in over one third of cases, classified as idiopathic CDI. The aim of this study was 2-fold: 1) to evaluate the occurrence of circulating autoantibodies to AVP-secreting cells (AVPcAb), and 2) to correlate it to clinical (sex, age of disease onset, disease duration, and degree), immunological (clinical history of autoimmune diseases and presence of related organ-specific autoantibodies), and radiological features (neurohypophyseal bright spot, pituitary stalk thickening, and empty sella) in a large cohort of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI or CDI of known etiology. To this purpose, 150 patients with CDI were studied: 64 idiopathic, 6 familial, 12 associated to granulomatous diseases, and 68 secondary to cranial trauma, tumor, or surgery. AVPcAb were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence method. AVPcAb were found in 23.3% of CDI patients: 21 idiopathic (32.8%) and 14 nonidiopathic (16.3%; χ² = 13.1; P < 0.001). AVPcAb were independently associated with age less than 30 yr at disease onset (P = 0.001) in patients with idiopathic CDI and with history of autoimmune diseases (P = 0.006 and P = 0.02, respectively) and radiological evidence of pituitary stalk thickening (P = 0.02 and P = 0.003, respectively) in both idiopathic and nonidiopathic CDI. The likelihood of autoimmunity in one patient with apparently idiopathic CDI with age of disease onset less than 30 yr was 53%, it increased to 91% when history of autoimmune diseases was associated and to 99% when pituitary stalk thickening was further associated. In conclusion, autoimmunity is associated with one third of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI, which should therefore be classified as autoimmune CDI. Autoimmune CDI is highly likely in young patients with a clinical history of autoimmune diseases and radiological evidence of pituitary stalk thickening. Conversely, autoimmunity probably represents an epiphenomenon in patients with nonidiopathic CDI.

### Central diabetes insipidus secondary to COVID-19 infection: a case report [^1144SpiN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly affects the lungs, but can involve several other organs. The diagnosis of acute and chronic sequelae is one of the challenges of COVID-19. The current literature proposes that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may involve the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In this case report, we present a unique case of new-onset central diabetes insipidus secondary to the COVID-19 disease in a 54-year-old woman.

Case presentation

A 54-year-old woman presented with the history of excessive thirst, polyuria, and polydipsia, six weeks after being infected by COVID-19. Laboratory tests revealed low urine osmolarity and increased serum osmolarity, and the patient was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. After administration of nasal desmopressin, urinary osmolarity increased, and the patient's symptoms improved. However, to stabilize her condition, desmopressin treatment was required.

Conclusions

We reported a unique case of diabetes insipidus in a COVID-19 patient. Central diabetes insipidus may be included in clinical manifestations of the COVID-19, in case of new-onset polyuria and polydipsia following COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, a causal relationship has not been established between the symptoms of the patient and the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis in a 51-year-old man with cutaneous involvement and multiple endocrinopathies [^1171DsR9]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

The BRAF V600E mutation is implicated in LCH and is significantly associated with cutaneous involvement and treatment-refractory disease. This patient's underlying mutation was distinct from the commonly identified BRAF V600E mutations, rendering it insensitive to V600E-specific inhibitors such as vemurafenib. The mutation instead appears sensitive to MEK inhibitors (trametinib) or pan-RAF/RAF dimer inhibitors (LY3009120) based on clinical models and prior case reports.

Clinical presentation of LCH is diverse and largely dependent on site and extent of organ system involvement, most commonly including the skeletal system, integumentary system, spleen, and pituitary gland. Cutaneous manifestations may be the earliest recognizable presentation of disease, although isolated skin disease is rare and usually represents LCH dissemination. Importantly, adult patients with LCH first presenting in the skin are at increased risk of a secondary hematologic malignancy — including leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndromes — even years after remission of cutaneous lesions. These patients therefore require close monitoring for detection of later disease sequelae. In addition to cutaneous involvement, this patient also had central diabetes insipidus, secondary hypogonadism, and secondary hypothyroidism caused by pituitary gland metastasis. Although central diabetes insipidus is a recognized complication of LCH, related endocrinopathies are not well defined, particularly in adult patients with the disease.

Management of LCH requires an extensive workup for both underlying disease and organ-specific manifestations. For disseminated LCH, standard chemotherapy is a 12-month course of vinblastine and prednisolone. Cladribine appears to be an effective, albeit less commonly used, treatment for multisystem LCH. Despite initial improvement in clinical symptoms after chemotherapy, this patient ultimately died of complications from a massive saddle pulmonary embolism. Whether this complication arose from direct pulmonary involvement by LCH or the hypercoagulable state associated with his malignancy remains unclear.

This case highlights a rare, primarily pediatric diagnosis affecting an adult patient with severe, multisystem involvement. With a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, LCH requires a high suspicion for disease; dermatologists should consider LCH in an adult with refractory crusted rash in the appropriate context. Prompt recognition may allow for early intervention and improved prognosis.

### Central diabetes insipidus secondary to COVID-19 infection: a case report [^114jBiUv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In March 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a worldwide pandemic with a significant mortality rate. One of the prominent features of COVID-19 is that it has the potential to affect various organ systems. Similar to other infectious diseases, one of the challenges for COVID-19 is the presence of both common and uncommon disease manifestations. Uncommon manifestations have a greater risk of going undiagnosed for a longer time. As an atypical manifestation, the spectrum of endocrine presentations in COVID-19 is still incomplete. Here, we describe a novel case of diabetes insipidus as a possible late-onset sequel of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

### Concurrent central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting disease in a post-operative case of craniopharyngioma: a case report [^111zLXUW]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) results from a deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP), and is characterized clinically by polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration. CDI has been reported in upto 80% of children post-surgery. Pathologic polyuria (> 4 ml/kg/hr) with raised serum osmolality (> 300 mOsm/kg) and hypernatremia (> 145 mEq/L) but decreased urine osmolality (< 300 mOsm/kg) with low urine specific gravity (< 1.010) establishes a diagnosis of CDI. It is essential to rule out hyperglycemia and cortisol deficiency prior to establishing a diagnosis of CDI. Injury to the pituitary stalk during surgery or head injury can lead to a transient, triphasic or permanent CDI. Transient CDI can manifest within hours of surgery with polyuria lasting for 5–7 days. It usually settles once the AVP secreting neurons located in the posterior pituitary recover their normal function. In the triphasic response, the first phase of transient CDI is followed by second phase of SIADH resulting from an unregulated release of ADH from the dying or damaged axons in posterior pituitary. SIADH is characterized by oliguria, decreased serum osmolality (< 280 mOsm/kg), hyponatremia (< 135 mEq/L), urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm/kg) and urine sodium excretion of > 30 mEq/L. Usually, after about 2 weeks, re-emergence of polyuria marks the onset of third phase of permanent CDI resulting from the death of ADH secreting neurons.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1125c297]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, despite the high prevalence of HN, and published guidance on its diagnosis and treatment, numerous shortcomings in current HN management are evident. HN in general and SIADH in particular are often diagnosed without attention to accepted diagnostic criteria. Strikingly, many patients receive no specific treatment for HN. FR was predictably the most frequent initial therapy but was ineffective in more than half of the cases. When unsuccessful, FR was often not followed with an additional therapy. Despite the availability of active therapies to correct [Na +], HS, and vasopressin-receptor antagonists, clinicians typically discharge patients with unresolved HN. From this study, we can conclude that educational efforts should focus on how to diagnose SIADH with rigor, on the lack of efficacy of FR alone and the potential for [Na +] to fall with FR alone, on the use of active treatments to raise [Na +] urgently when needed, and on increasing the awareness of situations where overly rapid correction is likely. One such circumstance highlighted in the present study is the immediate postoperative period after pituitary surgery where SIADH may occur but be transient and diabetes insipidus requiring desmopressin may supervene. Here, concomitant treatment with active therapies may pose a special risk. Randomized controlled trials of HN therapy are needed to compare relative efficacy, risks of over rapid correction, and overall costs, particularly for the active treatments. Given the strong association of HN with adverse outcomes, but persisting uncertainty about whether HN contributes to the poor outcomes or is only a marker of severe underlying disease, research efforts should, in addition, focus on which patients are more likely to respond to specific therapies and which will directly benefit from correction of HN.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus for the internist: an update [^116DgybL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities have to be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys, gestational diabetes insipidus resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase and finally primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to detect the aetiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central DI, a close follow-up is needed since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. This review will discuss issues and newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus.

### Approach to the pediatric patient: central diabetes insipidus [^116nDspL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a complex disorder in which large volumes of dilute urine are excreted due to arginine-vasopressin deficiency, and it is caused by a variety of disorders affecting the hypothalamic-posterior pituitary network. The differential diagnosis is challenging and requires a detailed medical history, physical examination, biochemical approach, imaging studies, and, in some cases, histological confirmation. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method for evaluating congenital or acquired cerebral and pituitary stalk lesions. Pituitary stalk size at presentation could be normal, but it may change over time, depending on the underlying condition, while other brain areas or organs may become involved during follow-up. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid central nervous system damage and germ cell tumor dissemination and to minimize complications of multiple pituitary hormone defects. We provide a practical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI and highlight several pitfalls that may complicate the differential diagnosis of conditions presenting with polyuria and polydipsia. The need for a careful and close follow-up of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI is particularly emphasized because the underlying condition may be recognized over time. The clinical scenario that we outline at the beginning of this article represents the basis for the discussion about how the etiological diagnosis of CDI can be overlooked and demonstrates how a water intake and urine output improvement can be a sign of progressive damage of both hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland with associated pituitary hormonal deficiencies.

### Idiopathic granulomatous hypophysitis: a systematic review of 82 cases in the literature [^111NbzG3]. Pituitary (2014). Low credibility.

The majority of cases of IGH become apparent due to mass effects from an enlarged pituitary gland, prompting the need for surgical resection of the gland. It follows, therefore, that a large number of IGH cases may be subclinical, or manifest in ways that are not attributable to mass effects. The two most clinically significant manifestations are central diabetes insipidus and hypopituitarism. In approximately one-third of central diabetes insipidus cases the cause remains unknown, and treatment consists of vasopressin replacement when deficiency becomes clinically apparent. There is a vein of literature linking lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis to the pathogenesis of central diabetes insipidus. In addition, many authors have detailed an association between infundibular swelling on imaging and the development of central diabetes insipidus. Both central diabetes insipidus and infundibular enlargement were reported in approximately one-third of IGH cases in this review, indicating that IGH may account for a portion of central diabetes insipidus cases that are at present considered idiopathic. Similarly, IGH may account for some cases of panhypopituitarism that remain cryptogenic despite intensive investigation. Further autopsy series may help to better understand the presence of undetected pituitary disorders underlying cases of central diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism.

### Central diabetes insipidus: clinical profile that suggests organicity in Peruvian children: lima-Peru 2001–2013 [^114f3cfd]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a heterogeneous disease caused by arginine vasopressin deficiency; its management implies a profound understanding of the pathophysiology and the clinical spectrum. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical characteristics that indicate organicity in children and adolescents with central diabetes insipidus treated at the Department of Endocrinology from The Child Health's Institute during 2001 to 2013.

Methods

Cross-sectional, retrospective study. 79 cases of patients diagnosed with CDI (51 males and 28 females) from 1 month to 16 years of age were reviewed. For the descriptive analysis, measures of central tendency and dispersion were used; groups of organic and idiopathic CDI were compared using χ2-test and t-test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

The average age of patients was 8.1 ± 4.2 years. Organic causes were intracranial tumors, 44 (55.7%), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), 11 (13.9%) and cerebral malformations in 7 (8.9%) patients, while the idiopathic group was 14 (17.7%) patients. Regarding clinical characteristics suggestive of organicity, headache (p = 0.02) and visual disturbances (p = 0.01) were found statistically significant. The anterior pituitary hormonal abnormalities were documented in 34 (52.3%) organic CDI patients. Furthermore, we did not find a significant difference in the average daily dose of desmopressin between patients with permanent vs. transitory CDI (0.81 ± 0.65 vs. 0.59 ± 0.62; p = 0.363).

Conclusions

The main clinical features suggestive of organicity in pediatric patients with central diabetes insipidus were headache and visual disturbances; furthermore, anterior pituitary hormonal abnormalities suggest an underlying organic etiology.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^116Hogeb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

3.6 Prediction of postoperative diabetes insipidus

Another role of copeptin is its use as a prognostic marker for the development of diabetes insipidus after pituitary surgery. A first proof‐of‐concept study in 2007 used the classical insulin tolerance test and showed that copeptin measured during hypoglycaemia is a useful measure to identify patients with complete central diabetes insipidus at 3 months after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. 56 In this study, copeptin levels of patients with intact posterior pituitary showed a maximal increase to 11.1 ± 4.6 pmol/L, while copeptin levels in patients with central diabetes insipidus remained low upon hypoglycaemia at 3.7 ± 0.7 pmol/L. A hypoglycaemic stimulated copeptin level < 4.75 pmol/L had an optimal diagnostic accuracy to detect central diabetes insipidus of 100%.

Despite its reliable diagnostic performance, the insulin tolerance test is not appropriate in the immediate postoperative recovery phase. Moreover, this test is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease or seizure history. However, surgery — itself known as a stressful event stimulating hypothalamic stress hormone release including AVP, 57 — can be used as a "stress test" to assess functionality of AVP and copeptin secretion. In a prospective multicentre trial including 205 patients undergoing pituitary surgery, 24% of patients developed postoperative central diabetes insipidus. Those patients had significantly lower copeptin levels on the first postoperative day compared to patients without postoperative diabetes insipidus. The post hoc‐derived copeptin cut‐off level of < 2.5 pmol/L had a positive predictive value for the development of central diabetes insipidus of 81% and a specificity of 97%, while a level > 30 pmol/L excluded it with a negative predictive value of 95% and a sensitivity of 94%. Accordingly, copeptin measurement after pituitary surgery is helpful to predict the onset of central diabetes insipidus, allowing earlier targeted therapeutic measures.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^1144pGKG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Copeptin as a Predictive Marker for Central Diabetes Insipidus

In addition to diagnosing diabetes insipidus in the outpatient clinic, copeptin measurement has also been proposed in the evaluation of postoperative central diabetes insipidus. While 1 study showed a high diagnostic accuracy of 100% for insulin-induced hypoglycemia-stimulated copeptin with a cut-off value of 4.75 pmol/L to detect central diabetes insipidus 3 months after pituitary surgery, the risks of this test outweigh its potential value. Other studies used surgery itself as a stress test. In a study including 205 patients of which 49 had a postoperative diabetes insipidus, a copeptin level < 2.5 pmol/L measured on the first postoperative day had a positive predictive level of 81% and specificity of 97%. Meanwhile, a copeptin level > 30 pmol/L had a negative predictive value of 95% and sensitivity of 94%. A second study examined the use of copeptin levels 1 hour after extubation after pituitary surgery. While a cut-off value below 4.2 pmol/L indicated permanent central diabetes insipidus, a value above 12.8 pmol/L was predictive of an unremarkable postoperative course. Since only 8 of the included 66 patients had central diabetes insipidus, however, these results should be confirmed in a larger cohort.

In conclusion, copeptin-based tests are valuable diagnostic measures in the difficult distinction between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, SE 2018 guidelines recommend to administer IV or IM vasopressin 1–2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output, with close observation of the clinical and biochemical response. Consider administering further doses of desmopressin when production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^112aMjCc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, copeptin is secreted in equimolar amounts to AVP and reliably mirrors AVP concentrations in the circulation. Its measurement has several advantages over AVP since it is stable ex vivo, can easily be measured, and results are available within a few hours. The 2 assays with sufficient technical description and clinical data justifying their routine clinical use are the sandwich LIA and its automated immunofluorescent successor on the KRYPTOR platform.

The main and best-validated indication for copeptin measurement is in the differential diagnosis of polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. Here, baseline levels > 21 pmol/L identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and osmotically stimulated levels with hypertonic saline (cut-off 4.9 pmol/L) or nonosmotically stimulated levels with arginine (cut-off 3.8 pmol/L) differentiate between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic accuracy.

In hyponatremia, the diagnostic utility of copeptin is of minor relevance and may be limited to fast and reliable identification of patients with underlying primary polydipsia. No differentiation between SIAD and other etiologies of hyponatremia seems possible, nor can copeptin reliably differentiate between cancer-related SIAD and other etiologies.

In hypernatremia, copeptin measurements below 4.4 pmol/L are diagnostic for central diabetes insipidus and allow identifying patients in need of desmopressin treatment.

Of note, in clinical settings where copeptin assays are unavailable or not available on the same day, close clinical supervision and judgment of routinely measured plasma and urine parameters are still the mainstay of differential diagnosis of disturbances in water homeostasis. Copeptin has also emerged as an unspecific marker of stress, predicting outcome in patients with sepsis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or pneumonia, among others. In patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, copeptin seems to be a predictive marker for the development of diabetic kidney disease. In addition, in ADPKD, it is suggested that copeptin predicts disease progression and treatment response to vaptans. Whether measurement of copeptin in these diseases has real clinical implications remains to be shown in future studies.

Diabetes insipidus is a disease characterized by polyuria and polydipsia due to inadequate release of arginine vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland (neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus) or due to arginine vasopressin insensitivity by the renal distal tubule, leading to a deficiency in tubular water reabsorption (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). This article reviews the genetics of diabetes insipidus in the context of its diagnosis, clinical presentation, and therapy.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^1134tJ9T]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, copeptin is a reliable surrogate parameter of AVP. In contrast to AVP, it is stable and can be measured easily with a sandwich immunoassay in serum or plasma. Copeptin is a promising new parameter clearly simplifying the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. Here, high baseline levels unequivocally indicate nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and hypertonic saline‐stimulated copeptin levels differentiate between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia with a high sensitivity and specificity. Consequently, hypertonic saline infusion plus copeptin measurement could replace the indirect water deprivation test in the routine evaluation of patients with hypotonic polyuria.

In contrast, in SIAD, copeptin measurement is of only little diagnostic value. Copeptin levels widely overlap in patients with hyponatraemia and emphasize the heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, a variety of factors leads to unspecific copeptin elevations in the acute setting further complicating its interpretation. The broad use of copeptin as diagnostic marker in hyponatraemia and specifically to detect cancer‐related disease in SIAD patients can, therefore, not be recommended. Nevertheless, extreme values point to a specific underlying pathophysiology: copeptin levels above 84 pmol/L indicate hypovolaemic hyponatraemia and the need for fluid infusion while low levels < 3.9 pmol/L are associated with primary polydipsia. Hyponatraemic patients presenting with undetectable copeptin levels and low free water clearance should be investigated for nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis.

### Diabetes insipidus [^113oMceE]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Central DI results from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance to AVP in the kidneys. Central and nephrogenic DI are usually acquired, but genetic causes must be evaluated, especially if symptoms occur in early childhood. Central or nephrogenic DI must be differentiated from primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Primary polydipsia is most common in psychiatric patients and health enthusiasts but the polydipsia in a small subgroup of patients seems to be due to an abnormally low thirst threshold, a condition termed dipsogenic DI. Distinguishing between the different types of DI can be challenging and is done either by a water deprivation test or by hypertonic saline stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. Furthermore, a detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to ensure an accurate DI diagnosis. Treatment of DI or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central DI, nephrogenic DI and primary polydipsia.

Disorders of body fluids, notably central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), are relatively uncommon as a presenting symptom of sellar and suprasellar masses, but quite common following surgical resection of such lesions. It therefore behooves clinicians treating such patients to have a good understanding of the pathophysiology, the differential diagnosis and the management of these disorders. This review discusses some general issues concerning the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, clinical manifestations and therapy of hyperosmolar and hypoosmolar syndromes, including CDI and SIADH, and then more specifically addresses the evaluation and treatment of pre- and postoperative disorders of water metabolism in patients with pituitary adenomas.

### Incidence and effect of diabetes insipidus in the acute care of patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^1175fY6a]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Literature on diabetes insipidus (DI) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is scarce. Some studies have reported varying frequencies of DI and have showed its association with increased mortality, suggesting it as a marker of poor outcome. This knowledge gap in the acute care consequences of DI in severe TBI patients led us to conceive this study, aimed at identifying risk factors and quantifying the effect of DI on short-term functional outcomes and mortality.

Methods

We assembled a historic cohort of adult patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary-care university hospital over a 6-year period. Basic demographic characteristics, clinical information, imaging findings, and laboratory results were collected. We used logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for the development of DI, and the association of this condition with death and unfavorable functional outcomes [modified Rankin scale (mRS)] at hospital discharge.

Results

A total of 317 patients were included in the study. The frequency of DI was 14.82%, and it presented at a median of 2 days (IQR 1–3) after ICU admission. Severity according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of the head, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and skull base fracture was suggested as risk factors for DI. Diagnosis of DI was independently associated death (OR 4.34, CI 95% 1.92–10.11, p = 0.0005) and unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 4–6) at discharge (OR 7.38; CI 95% 2.15–37.21, p = 0.0047).

Conclusions

Diabetes insipidus is a frequent and early complication in patients with severe TBI in the ICU and is strongly associated with increased mortality and poor short-term outcomes. We provide clinically useful risk factors that will help detect DI early to improve prognosis and therapy of patients with severe TBI.

### Diabetes insipidus in craniopharyngioma: postoperative management of water and electrolyte disorders [^113uzWWS]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Pre-operative central diabetes insipidus has been reported in 8–35% of patients affected with craniopharyngioma, and in 70–90% after surgery. The management of postoperative polyuria and polydipsia can be challenging and fluid balance needs to be closely monitored. The classical triphasic pattern of endogenous vasopressin secretion — an initial phase of symptomatic diabetes insipidus occurring 24 hours after surgery; a second phase of inappropriate vasopressin secretion potentially causing hyponatraemia; and a third phase with a return to diabetes insipidus occurring up to 2 weeks later — is often complicated by cerebral salt wasting and thirst disorders. Inadequate adrenal replacement therapy and anticonvulsant agent treatment may increase the risk of life-threatening hyponatraemia in the course of desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment. Appropriate management, in order to avoid life-threatening or disabling electrolyte disturbances, requires a good grasp of the relevant pathophysiology. We review here the pathophysiology and management of the multiple fluid disorders encountered following surgery for craniopharyngiomas.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^113Ls6zu]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.

### Rare neonatal diabetes insipidus and associated late risks: case report [^114Swzh8]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

When he returned at two years of age, he had had no seizures, his ventriculoperitoneal shunt was working properly and, due to the fact that his food intake had been stable (though low), with no significant vomiting or diarrhoea, he maintained almost perfect fluid control. However, we saw a small, thin, microcephalic child (Table 1), with very small developmental progress and whose deglutition had just improved. His serum sodium (146 mmol/L), osmolality (294 mOsm/kg), glucose (4.0 mmol/L), a.m. cortisol (292.6 mmol/L), free thyroxin (19.6 pmol/L), insulin (2.2 μU/mL) and IGF-1 (78 ng/mL) were within normal range, but his vasopressin was lesser than 1.1 pmol/L. His urinary osmolality ranged from 758 mOsm/kg (3 hours after desmopressin) to 226 mOsm/kg prior to the following dose. Given his unfavourable nutritional evolution, with insufficient deglutition, a gastrostomy was advised to provide nutritional support.

At the three-year check-up, the patient was under nasal desmopressin treatment (10 μg bid). This was recommended at his local hospital some four months before, when he underwent a gastrostomy, which unfortunately soon failed because of septic complications. Subsequently, the undernourished (Table 1) and seriously delayed child (developmental age of about 9–10 months) got progressively worse: His fluid balance became quite unstable and, on at least two occasions, he suffered weight loss and clinical deterioration for several days related to a common cold. The family was informed about the risk posed by the probable dehydration episodes suffered by the child. The sc route for the desmopressin therapy and a new attempt at gastrostomy were once again recommended.

This advice was not followed, and at the age of 3 years and 5 months, the child was admitted to his local hospital after five days of a new nasal cold. His medical report registered a Glasgow Score of 8, body weight loss of 12%, and 189 mmol/L of serum sodium. After a few hours of saline infusion, he achieved a certain degree of clinical recovery. However, the next day he worsened again, and forty hours after his admittance, he entered into status epilepticus and was transferred to our hospital.

### Central diabetes insipidus in children as a diagnostic challenge [^111WS3eu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a disorder in the pediatric population resulting from antidiuretic hormone deficiency. The excessive production of dilute urine characterizes it and manifests with polyuria, nocturia, and polydipsia. The diagnostics of CDI is often challenging, especially concerning the underlying condition of the disease. This article highlights the diverse clinical presentation of children with CDI and diagnostic difficulties among patients with polyuria and polydipsia. The article also reviews the etiology, symptoms, diagnostic workup, and management of CDI. We present 4 pediatric patients (aged 3–13.5 years) diagnosed with CDI of different etiology: 1 due to septo-optic dysplasia/optic nerve hypoplasia and 3 due to acquired processes such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis and germ cell tumor in 2 patients. Central diabetes insipidus was the first manifestation of a tumor or granuloma in all presented patients with acquired pathology. The patients sometimes need long-term follow-up to establish the proper final diagnosis.

### The diagnosis of children with central diabetes insipidus [^114fHydH]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus is the end result of a number of different diseases that affect the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system. In many patients, especially children and young adults, it is caused by the destruction or degeneration of neurons that originate in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. The known causes of these lesions include germinoma or craniopharyngioma; Langerhans cell histiocytosis; local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases; trauma resulting from surgery or an accident; sarcoidosis; metastases; and midline cerebral and cranial malformations. In rare cases, genetic defects in AVP synthesis that are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive traits are the underlying cause. Accurate diagnostic differentiation is essential for both safe and effective disease management. Proper etiological diagnosis can be achieved via a series of steps that start with clinical observations and then progress, as needed, to more sophisticated methods. Indeed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the examination method of choice for evaluating hypothalamic-pituitary-related endocrine diseases due to its ability to provide strongly-contrasted high-resolution multi-planar and spatial images. Specifically, MRI allows a detailed and precise anatomical study of the pituitary gland by differentiating between the anterior and posterior pituitary lobes. MRI identification of pituitary hyperintensity in the posterior part of the sella, now considered to be a clear marker of neurohypophyseal functional integrity, together with careful analysis of pituitary stalk shape and size, have provided the most striking recent findings contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of some forms of 'idiopathic' central diabetes insipidus.

To review the approach to a patient with diabetes insipidus during pregnancy.

Methods

This review examines the normal physiology of water homeostasis, the related changes that occur during pregnancy, and the pathophysiology of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy. Associated complications, evaluation, and management are discussed.

Results

Diabetes insipidus can complicate up to 1 in 30,000 pregnancies. Diabetes insipidus during pregnancy has a variety of causes, some that predate the pregnancy and others that begin during gestation. Polyuria and polydipsia can occur or be exacerbated in women with overt or subclinical central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These women have either decreased central secretory reserve or impaired renal responsiveness to vasopressin. In addition, women can experience diabetes insipidus de novo in pregnancy through the actions of placental vasopressinase, which causes accelerated degradation of vasopressin. This form of diabetes insipidus may be associated with increased complications of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Management of central diabetes insipidus and transient diabetes insipidus of pregnancy can be achieved with 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin acetate) (DDAVP), a vasopressin analogue. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is typically resistant to both DDAVP and vasopressin and underlying causes should be addressed.

Conclusions

Increased awareness of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy may lead to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment that will reduce the risks of maternal and fetal morbidity. Overall, growing experience with DDAVP has shown that it is a safe and effective treatment for diabetes insipidus caused by a variety of factors.

### Diabetes insipidus after endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery: multicenter experience and development of the SALT score [^114rzpxC]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors for the development of postoperative diabetes insipidus (DI) in a modern cohort of endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery.

Methods

Analysis of prospectively collected data of 449 consecutive patients operated on for anterior skull base pathology. DI was defined as a polyuria (> 250 ml/h for ≥ 2 consecutive hours) polydipsia syndrome associated with hypotonic urine with or without hypernatraemia. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of postoperative DI. A simple scoring system was then created.

Results

Postoperative DI occurred in 46 (10.2%) patients. The development of DI did not affect quality of life. Predictors of DI on multivariate analysis included suprasellar extension (OR 2.2; p = 0.04), age < 50 years (OR 2.8; p = 0.003), craniopharyngioma histology (OR 6.7; p = 0.002), and Kelly grade 3 intraoperative CSF leak (OR 2.1; p = 0.04). The SALT score was created based on these characteristics, with one point awarded for each feature present, and predicted DI with fair to good predictive value in our cohort (AUROC 0.735 (95%CI 0.65–0.82)). The rates of postoperative DI were 4.0%, 6.5%, 15.0%. 36.8% and 85.7% for SALT scores of zero, one, two, three, and four, respectively.

Conclusions

The SALT score predicts postoperative DI with fair to good accuracy, and now requires prospective external validation. Improved prediction of DI could optimize resource allocation and facilitate individualised preoperative patient counselling. We also provide our algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of DI.

### Familial forms of diabetes insipidus: clinical and molecular characteristics [^117U8GcH]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Over the past two decades, the genetic and molecular basis of familial forms of diabetes insipidus has been elucidated. Diabetes insipidus is a clinical syndrome characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and increased fluid intake (polydipsia). The most common type of diabetes insipidus is caused by lack of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), which is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by the neurohypophysis. This type of diabetes insipidus is referred to here as neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. The syndrome can also result from resistance to the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin on the kidney, either at the level of the vasopressin 2 receptor or the aquaporin 2 water channel (which mediates the re-absorption of water from urine), and is referred to as renal or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between these two types of diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia can be difficult owing to the existence of partial as well as complete forms of vasopressin deficiency or resistance. Seven different familial forms of diabetes insipidus are known to exist. The clinical presentation, genetic basis and cellular mechanisms responsible for them vary considerably. This information has led to improved methods of differential diagnosis and could provide the basis of new forms of therapy.

### American association of clinical endocrinology disease state clinical review: evaluation and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated endocrinopathies: a practical case-based clinical approach [^113DRyiF]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced hypophysitis — diagnostic features, laboratory utility, and epidemiology across agents are outlined as follows: In ipilimumab (Ipi)–associated cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows diffuse enlargement of the pituitary with variable stalk enlargement, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency tends to be permanent (75%). Compared with Ipi, anti–programmed death 1 (PD-1) or anti–PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) cases have fewer headaches and a smaller proportion with MRI-detected pituitary enlargement (28% vs 98% with Ipi). In nivolumab (Nivo) monotherapy for lung cancer, asymptomatic secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) developed in approximately 11%, with 25% treated with glucocorticoids; another retrospective multicenter study of Nivo or pembrolizumab (Pembro) reported a 0.5% prevalence of hypophysitis with later onset (a median of 26 weeks of treatment), and PD-1 inhibitors are typically dosed every 2–6 weeks depending on the agent and dose. For pituitary axes testing in the acute phase, the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism can be made with low free T4 and inappropriately normal or decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the diagnosis of AI is initially reliant on cortisol because the ACTH stimulation test is not reliable during acute presentation. The utility of measuring follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, or growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 is limited; active malignancy is a contraindication for growth hormone replacement and these measurements are of low clinical relevance. Although exceedingly rare, diabetes insipidus (DI) has been reported; the possibility of DI should be considered in patients with new increased thirst and frequent urination, confirmed with serum and urine osmolality, and if DI is confirmed, pituitary infiltration by malignancy should be excluded, which may require MRI of the sella.

### Diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIADH) after pituitary surgery: incidence and risk factors [^115C5kQ4]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are relatively frequent and potentially serious complications after pituitary surgery. Both DI (diabetes insipidus) and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis) can complicate and prolong hospital and intensive care unit stay, and the latter may even be preventable. We aim to assess the incidence of both electrolyte disorders and their risk factors. From a prospective registry of patients who underwent endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for pituitary adenoma, patients with postoperative DI and SIADH were identified. Univariable and multivariable statistics were carried out to identify factors independently associated with the occurrence of either DI or SIADH. A total of 174 patients were included, of which 73 (42%) were female. Mean age was 54 years (range 20–88). During postoperative hospital stay, 13 (7.5%) patients presenting with DI and 11 (6.3%) with SIADH were identified. Patients who developed DI after surgery had significantly longer hospital stays (p = 0.022), as did those who developed SIADH (p = 0.002). Four (2.3%) patients were discharged with a diagnosis of persistent DI, and 2 (1.1%) with the diagnosis of SIADH. At the last follow-up, 5 (2.9%) patients presented with persistent DI, while none of the patients suffered from SIADH. Younger age (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94–1.01, p = 0.166) and pituitary apoplexy (OR 2.69, 95% CI 0.53–10.65, p = 0.184) were weakly associated with the occurrence of DI. We identified younger age (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–0.99, p = 0.045) and lower preoperative serum sodium (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71–0.95, p = 0.008) as independent risk factors for SIADH. Although we found a weak association among age, pituitary apoplexy, and the occurrence of DI, no independent predictor was identified for DI. For postoperative SIADH however, lower age and preoperative serum sodium were identified as significant predictors. None of these findings were sufficiently supported by preexisting literature. Both electrolyte disorders are exquisitely hard to predict preoperatively, and further research into their early detection and prevention is warranted.

### Central diabetes insipidus in children with acute brain insult [^114cfrtE]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus occurs in patients with overwhelming central nervous system injuries, and may be associated with brain death. The clinical picture of children with acquired central diabetes insipidus after acute brain insult is seldom reported. We retrospectively reviewed cases dating from January 2000-February 2008 at a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit. Fifty-four patients (28 girls, 26 boys), aged 3 months to 18 years, were enrolled. Etiologies included severe central nervous system infection (35.2%), hypoxic-ischemic events (31.5%), head injury (18.5%), and vascular lesions (14.8%). In 39 (72.2%) patients, diabetes insipidus was diagnosed during the first 2 days after acute central nervous system injury, and 40 (74.0%) developed maximum serum sodium concentrations of > 160 mEq/L. In 16, sequential cerebral salt wasting syndrome developed after their initial diabetes insipidus presentation. Overall mortality at 2 months after admission was 77.8%. Our results demonstrate that patients who develop central diabetes insipidus after acute central nervous system injury manifest high mortality. Development of central diabetes insipidus within the first 2 days and a maximum plasma sodium > 160 mEq/L were significant predictors of outcomes.

### A patient with partial central diabetes insipidus: clarifying pathophysiology and designing treatment [^111uEHw5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Studies were undertaken in a 32-year-old man who developed polyuria (4 L/d) a few days after a basal skull fracture; the condition persisted 1 year after the accident. The other major features were thirst, a plasma sodium of 143 mmol/L, 24-hour urine osmolality of 221 mOsm/kg H₂O, and levels of vasopressin in plasma that were less than 0.5 pg/mL on 20 separate occasions. The 24-hour urine volume implied that the diagnosis was partial rather than complete central diabetes insipidus; however, several random urine samples had a much higher osmolality. An infusion of hypertonic saline led to the release of vasopressin and the excretion of concentrated urine. We propose that the basis for the lesion may be the transection of some, but not all, of the fibers connecting the osmostat and vasopressin release center. This partial transection could permit vasopressin to be secreted in response to a larger rise in plasma sodium concentration. This pathophysiologic analysis provided the basis for therapy to minimize the degree of polyuria.

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^115m8kYJ]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Pituitary disease management during COVID-19 — diabetes insipidus (DI) guidance emphasizes safety: in patients with DI without concomitant illness the main risk is iatrogenic hyponatremia; if access to regular electrolyte monitoring is difficult it would be prudent to advise patients to withhold a weekly dose of desmopressin to allow for an aquaresis and favor under-dosing during daytime, with an aim to relieve symptoms of polyuria particularly overnight; in those with mild or partial DI, treatment with desmopressin may not be required as long as patients are instructed to drink to thirst and have access to fluids; in hospitalized patients, hypernatremia is more likely to occur, particularly in those with adipsic DI, and regular electrolyte monitoring is required, with requirement for parenteral desmopressin and intravenous fluids in cases of severe illness.

### Central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis: from epileptic and other manifestations to cognitive prognosis [^116RZSB4]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the presentation, outcome and aetiology of central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis (CPEPM) in a tertiary hospital center. The study method is a case series and included identification of patients from University of Montreal Health Centre archives database (1995–2007). All diagnoses were confirmed by neuroimaging or brain autopsy. Twelve individuals (25–66 years old) presented heterogeneous manifestations. Co-morbidities included diabetes insipidus (n = 2), haemodialysis (n = 1), cirrhosis (n = 3), gastroenteritis (n = 2) and potomania (n = 1). Aetiologies included rapid correction of severe hyponatremia (n = 6)/acute hypernatremia (n = 1); immediate (n = 2) or remote (n = 1 with recurrent cirrhosis) orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) with tacrolimus-induced immunosuppression (n = 3); and chronic alcoholism (n = 4, two with hyponatremia). Four individuals died acutely. Two were lost to follow-up. Six had good motor or cerebellar recovery. Neuropsychological evaluations (n = 5/6) revealed a subcortical/frontal dysfunction. Cognitive impairment represented the major remaining lasting sequel (n = 4). Three salient clinical syndromes were observed: (1) predominant cerebellar presentation in individuals with alcoholism (n = 4); (2) significant alteration of consciousness at presentation (n = 4), all resulting in death (OLT, n = 3); (3) seizures persisting after natremia correction (n = 2). Clinical presentation of CPEPM is heterogeneous and can even include seizures. Cognitive impairment should be screened as it is a significant factor limiting return to normal life.

### The relationship between manifestation of diabetes insipidus and estimated glomerular filtration rate in brain death [^1122JhKT]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Systematic reviews have revealed that up to 50% of patients with brain death have residual hypothalamic/pituitary activity based on the absence of central diabetes insipidus (DI). We hypothesized that different degrees of renal dysfunction may impact the presence of DI in patients with brain death.

Design

Single-center prospective data collection.

Setting

ICUs in a tertiary academic hospital.

Patients

All adult patients declared brain dead over 12 years.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

DI was diagnosed by polyuria, low urine specific gravity, and increasing serum sodium, measured in close proximity. Renal function was assessed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using the simplified modification of diet in renal disease equation. Analysis was completed in 192 of 234 patients with brain death after excluding those with missing data, those younger than 18 years and those on vasopressin infusions. One hundred twenty-two patients (63.5%) developed DI and 70 patients (36.5%) did not. The proportion of DI decreased significantly with decreasing eGFR: for eGFR greater than 60mL/min, DI was present in 77.2%; for eGFR 15–60mL/min, DI was present in 54.5%; for eGFR 14.9–9.8mL/min, DI was present in 32%; none of the 14 patients with eGFR less than or equal to 9.7mL/min ever experienced DI (p < 0.001). Using logistic regression, for every 10mL/min decrease in eGFR, the odds of DI decreased 0.83 times (95% CI, 0.76–0.90, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Renal dysfunction significantly impacts DI's clinical manifestation in brain death. We report that patients who experience brain death with severe renal dysfunction may not develop clinical signs of DI.

### Diabetes insipidus in children… [^111irWhA]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a symptom which may be due to a variety of causes. Its diagnosis and treatment, unsatisfactory as the latter may be, present no difficulty, but the detection of the underlying cause often requires considerable study and may at times be impossible. When this underlying cause is not ascertainable a diagnosis of idiopathic diabetes insipidus may be made. In many instances this classification will be correct, since neither the further course nor the necropsy will reveal an anatomic cause for the polydipsia and polyuria. In other cases the basic process will be recognized only after the symptoms have progressed for months or years. The observation of a few cases of polyuria and polydipsia and the attempt to formulate their prognoses induced us to study the literature of diabetes insipidus in children. This survey demonstrated that definite progress has recently been made in the understanding of some of the. WARKANY J, MITCHELL AG.

### Child with suspected diabetes insipidus [^117UNBgQ]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected diabetes insipidus — desmopressin (DDAVP) is often used for control of significant polyuria/polydipsia; it is a synthetic long acting analog of vasopressin and is available in oral tablets and melts, intranasal and subcutaneous form. There is a risk of sodium fluctuations and hyponatremia with DDAVP treatment; care should be taken during treatment as inadvertent large doses may lead to severe hyponatremia and seizures, and ensuring "breakthrough" voiding close to the next dose can be helpful to limit risk of hyponatremia. In some older children with diabetes insipidus and intact thirst mechanism, increasing fluid intake to match urine output and avoid hypernatremia can be sufficient treatment; children with intact thirst mechanism can usually self-regulate to increase their water intake to avoid dehydration, and avoiding pharmacological therapy can prevent sodium fluctuations and risk for hyponatremia.

### The relation between the incidence of hypernatremia and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^116ws4aA]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypernatremia, a water balance disorder encountered in about 6 to 9% of critically ill patients, has been associated with an increased risk of death and complications in some recent retrospective studies in general intensive care units (ICUs).

Patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a high risk of developing hypernatremia over the course of their ICU stay, due to the coexistence of predisposing conditions such as impaired sensorium, altered thirst, central diabetes insipidus (CDI) with polyuria, and increased insensible losses. Moreover, these patients often receive mannitol or hypertonic saline solutions, with the aim of reducing cerebral edema and controlling intracranial pressure. In this clinical setting, it is not known, however, whether increased serum sodium (Na) is an independent risk factor for death, or is simply a surrogate marker of illness severity.

It has been shown that almost 20% of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage develop hypernatremia, a complication bearing an increased risk of death. On the other hand, in a recent series of patients from a neuro-ICU, hypernatremia was documented in only 8% of them; moreover, only the more advanced forms of this disorder (that is, serum Na exceeding 160 mmol/l) were associated with increased mortality. These conflicting findings leave the question of the true clinical significance of moderate increases in serum Na (for example, between 145 and 160 mmol/l) unresolved.

We therefore designed the present study in order to verify whether the occurrence of hypernatremia during the ICU stay is an independent risk factor of death in patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8).

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^115wd1Ld]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Neurosurgery — brain (applies only to neurosurgery with potential to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis) — diabetes insipidus follow-up identifies diabetes insipidus as a potential late effect and specifies periodic evaluation via history with assessment of excessive thirst/polyuria yearly. Health links note hypopituitarism. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include Na, K, Cl, CO2, serum osmolality, and urine osmolality as clinically indicated if history is consistent with excessive thirst and/or polyuria; evaluation for other central endocrinopathies, including growth hormone (GH) deficiency, central hypothyroidism, central adrenal insufficiency, precocious puberty, and gonadotropin deficiency; and referral to endocrine to manage hormonal dysfunction. Diabetes insipidus is described as unlikely to occur as a late effect past two years from therapeutic exposure, and other causes should be considered if symptoms are present. The pathway is tagged as SYSTEM = Endocrine/Metabolic with SCORE = 1. Additional information advises considering patient and cancer/treatment factors, including craniopharyngioma, extension of tumor into hypothalamus, surgery in supra-sellar region, and reoperation for recurrent tumor.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^114bcF95]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary tumors require specialized care in particular for surgical management. Centralization of care for patients with a pituitary tumor in Pituitary Centers of Excellence that deal with high surgical volumes and harbor multidisciplinary teams is advocated to minimize disease- and treatment-related morbidity. Local audits within treatment facilities, but also comparison of treatment results and complications between centers, hold the promise for future quality assurance. Uniform application of the same definitions is mandatory to reliably measure and compare outcomes. However, establishing uniform definitions is challenging, especially for early postoperative complications such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and postoperative hyponatremia.

Postoperative DI is caused by vasopressin deficiency and is one of the most reported complications after pituitary tumor surgery. While in the future measurement of copeptin might be a viable alternative to vasopressin measurement and diagnose DI, to date, diagnosis of DI is based on clinical and indirect laboratory findings as serum vasopressin measurement is expensive and results are not available within the time frame necessary in this setting. The majority of studies reporting on the incidence of postoperative DI do not provide uniform definitions. There is variation in the use of clinical and biochemical parameters which limits reliable comparisons between studies (Table 1) and results in reported incidence range between 2 and 54%. Although there is evidence on the etiology, prevalence numbers, variety of DI patterns, predisposing factors, and treatment of postoperative diabetes insipidus, a formal and widely used definition or consensus statement is not yet available.

### Central diabetes insipidus secondary to COVID-19 infection: a case report [^112J4CfW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, in specific regions of the brain, specifically in periventricular areas, the blood–brain barrier is adjusted to allow the required compounds in the systemic circulation to enter the central nervous system. In such areas, the blood–brain barrier vessels exhibit fewer tight junctions, resulting in a more permeable barrier. Our patient revealed chronic small vessel infarction in the periventricular region, which may be a potential cause of SARS-CoV-2 possible access to the hypothalamus. However, due to the limitations of our case study, we could not prove the underlying mechanism. The unknown etiologies also cannot be ruled out.

A previously published case report described a 44-year-old female diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and central diabetes insipidus 24 days after COVID-19 symptom onset. The other case reported by the same author was a 28-year-old male who developed diabetes insipidus and myocarditis after COVID-19 recovery. Another case report described polydipsia and polyuria in a critically ill 68-year-old patient with hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He developed central diabetes insipidus about one month after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The brain MRI of these patients showed no abnormal findings. However, Misgar et al. reported evidence of infundibuloneurohypophysitis in the brain MRI of a 60-year-old woman. Eight weeks after the onset of COVID-19, the patient developed central diabetes insipidus. It is also notable that all patients developed diabetes insipidus as a late sequel of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the role of viral infections in this rare presentation of COVID-19 remains to be investigated.

In conclusion, we reported a unique case of diabetes insipidus in a patient following COVID-19 disease. Laboratory findings were compatible with central diabetes insipidus. The patient did not exhibit any known etiology of diabetes insipidus. Central diabetes insipidus may be included in clinical manifestations of the COVID-19, in case of new-onset polyuria and polydipsia following COVID-19 disease. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association between COVID-19 and central diabetes insipidus and unfold the possible underlying mechanisms.

### Clinical presentation and outcome of children with central diabetes insipidus associated with a self-limited or transient pituitary stalk thickening, diagnosed as infundibuloneurohypophysitis [^111ognk2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite lymphocytic or autoimmune infundibuloneurohypophysitis (INH) is an increasingly recognized aetiology in children with central diabetes insipidus (CDI); clinical data on epidemiology (clinical evolution, predisposing factors, complications), diagnosis and management of this entity are limited and mostly based on published case reports. The aim of this study was to gain a broader insight in the natural history of this disease by analysing the clinical presentation, radiological pituitary stalk changes, associated autoimmunity and hormonal deficiencies in children with CDI and a self-limiting or transient stalk thickening (ST), diagnosed as autoimmune infundibuloneurohypophysitis, during the last 15 years in four Belgian university hospitals.

Design and Patients

The medical files of nine CDI patients with a ST at initial presentation and no signs of Langerhans cell histiocytosis or germinoma at presentation and/or during follow-up of more than 1.5 years were reviewed.

Results

Age at presentation ranged from 3 to 14 years. Two patients had a positive family history of autoimmunity. Three children presented with associated growth failure, two with nausea and one with long-standing headache. Median maximal diameter of the stalk was 4.6 mm (2.7–10 mm). Four patients had extra-pituitary brain anomalies, such as cysts. One patient had central hypothyroidism, and another had a partial growth hormone deficiency at diagnosis. Within a mean follow-up of 5.4 (1.5–15) years, stalk thickening remained unchanged in two patients, regressed in one and normalized in six children. CDI remained in all, while additional pituitary hormone deficiencies developed in only one patient.

Conclusions

In this series of children INH with CDI as initial presentation, CDI was permanent and infrequently associated with anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies, despite a frequent association with nonstalk cerebral lesions.

### Central diabetes insipidus: clinical characteristics and long-term course in a large cohort of adults [^112Hbktf]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare heterogeneous condition with various underlying causes. This study sought to increase the still-limited data on the clinical characteristics and long-term course in adults diagnosed with CDI.

Methods

Data on demographics, presentation, imaging findings, affected pituitary axes, treatment, and complications were collected retrospectively from the files of 70 adult patients with CDI followed at a referral endocrine clinic.

Results

Forty women and 30 men were included. Mean age was 46.8 ± 15 years at the time of this study and 29.3 ± 20 years at CDI diagnosis. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed in childhood. Forty patients (57%) acquired CDI following surgery. Main sellar pathologies were: craniopharyngioma, 17 patients (11 diagnosed in childhood); Langerhans histiocytosis, 10 patients (5 diagnosed in childhood); 7 patients (all diagnosed as adults) had a growth hormone-secreting adenoma; 12 patients (17%; 6 diagnosed in childhood) had idiopathic CDI. At least one anterior pituitary axis was affected in 73% of the cohort: 59% had growth hormone deficiency, 56% hypogonadism, 55% central hypothyroidism, 44% adrenocorticotropic hormone-cortisol deficiency. Patients with postoperative/trauma CDI (n = 44) tended to have multiple anterior pituitary axes deficits compared to the nonsurgical group of patients. All patients were treated with vasopressin preparations, mostly nasal spray. Hyponatremia developed in 32 patients, more in women, and was severe (< 125 mEq/L) in 10 patients. Hypernatremia (> 150 mEq/L) was noticed in 5 patients. Overall, the calculated complication rate was 22 in 1,250 treatment-years.

Conclusion

Most adult patients with CDI have anterior pituitary dysfunction. Stability is usually achieved with long-term treatment. Women were more susceptible to desmopressin complications, albeit with an overall relatively low complication rate.

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^114x2nk8]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Hypopituitarism diagnosis — initial testing and thresholds include early morning fasted pituitary profiles, prioritized screening for diabetes insipidus (DI), and cortisol cutoffs for adrenal insufficiency (AI). An early morning fasted pituitary profile should be arranged, and if DI is strongly suspected, a non-fasted morning blood sample for serum sodium and osmolality should be collected first because patients with complete DI often present with hypernatremia, avoiding the need for a protracted water deprivation test. For AI, a cortisol level < 3 µg/dL indicates AI while a cortisol level > 15 µg/dL reliably excludes AI, with dynamic testing ordinarily used for intermediate results but possibly delayed during the pandemic. Central hypothyroidism is suggested by a low free T4 with low/normal TSH, and central hypogonadism is suggested by low serum testosterone with low/normal gonadotrophins in non-obese males or low estradiol with low/normal gonadotrophins in pre-menopausal women with amenorrhea or in post-menopausal females.

### Clinical characteristics and predictive factors of delayed diagnosis in patients with sellar germ cell tumors [^113NGDAc]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the clinical characteristics and predictive factors associated with delayed diagnosis in patients with sellar germ cell tumors (GCTs), aiming for early diagnosis.

Methods

A total of 345 patients with sellar GCTs were retrospectively collected. Patients were classified into a delayed diagnosis group (> 6 months from onset to diagnosis) and a non-delayed diagnosis group (≤ 6 months). We compared general characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, treatment strategies, tumor prognosis, and pituitary function between the two groups. Predictive factors for delayed diagnosis were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

225 patients (65.2%) experienced delayed diagnosis. Although there was no association between delayed diagnosis and survival rates or tumor recurrence rates, the delayed diagnosis group had a higher incidence of central diabetes insipidus, central adrenal insufficiency, central hypothyroidism, central hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. Moreover, polyuria/polydipsia (OR 5.46; 95% CI 2.33–12.81), slow growth (OR 5.86; 95% CI 2.61–13.14), amenorrhea (OR 6.82; 95% CI 2.68–17.37), and germinoma (OR 4.99; 95% CI 1.08–3.61) were associated with a higher risk of delayed diagnosis, while older age of onset (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84–0.94) and nausea/vomiting (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.15–0.63) contributed to earlier diagnosis.

Conclusion

In patients with sellar GCTs, delayed diagnosis is common and linked to increased pituitary dysfunction. The initial symptoms of slow growth, polyuria/polydipsia, and amenorrhea, as well as germinoma with negative tumor markers, predict the possibility of a delayed diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to minimize the impact of sellar GCTs on pituitary function.

Postpituitary or hypothalamic surgery diuresis — diabetes insipidus (DI) risk and contributors: DI occurs commonly in the immediate period (days 1–2) after pituitary or hypothalamic surgery; other causes of postsurgical abundant diuresis include steroid-induced hyperglycemia, abundant intraoperative fluid administration, and an abrupt reduction of serum GH levels in acromegaly. High-dose perioperative GC increase the incidence of postoperative DI, possibly mediated by increased glomerular filtration rate, reduced ADH secretion, and reduced renal sensitivity to GC.

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in the Differential Diagnosis of Diabetes Insipidus

Differential Diagnoses of Polyuria–Polydipsia Syndrome

As discussed above, AVP is the main regulatory hormone for salt-water homeostasis. Stimulated by an increase in plasma osmolality or hypovolemia, AVP induces water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidneys. Impairment of this process leads to diabetes insipidus, characterized by polyuria of more than 50 mL per kg body weight per 24 hours of hypotonic urine and polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. Diabetes insipidus is further divided into a central and a nephrogenic origin. While the first cause is due to impaired AVP production or secretion upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimulation, the second cause results from renal resistance to AVP.

Central diabetes insipidus is mainly caused by destruction of the producing or secreting cells, leading to a partial or complete form. The main causes are accordingly pituitary surgery, head trauma, and infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or metastases; inflammatory or autoimmune disorders such as hypophysitis and familial forms due to a genetic defect leading to impaired AVP synthesis are also known. A rare form, gestational diabetes insipidus, manifests during pregnancy and is caused by increased AVP metabolism due to the placental enzyme vasopressinase.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is mainly secondary to adverse drug effects (lithium), electrolyte disturbances (hypercalemia or hypokalemia) or kidney diseases, resulting in renal insensitivity to AVP and corresponding lack of aquaporin 2–mediated water reabsorption. If discovered early on, these secondary forms are often reversible in contrast to rare congenital forms due to mutations in the AVPR2 or the AQP2 genes.

An important differential diagnosis to central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is primary polydipsia. Here, polyuria–polydipsia occurs despite intact AVP secretion and renal sensitivity. As a result of this chronic excessive fluid intake, the concentration gradient in the renal medulla is continuously reduced with a downregulation of aquaporin 2 channels. Chronic central AVP suppression may also play a role. These factors lead to the excretion of hypotonic urine, making it difficult to distinguish it from diabetes insipidus. Primary polydipsia has been increasingly observed in health conscious people who aim for a high daily water intake; other possible triggers are dependency disorders or a reduced thirst threshold. Severe polydipsia has primarily been described in psychiatric patients.

Hypopituitarism during COVID-19 — clinicians should remain vigilant given increased background mortality and management trade-offs. Patients with hypopituitarism have increased mortality, particularly from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. There is a careful balance between preventing adrenal insufficiency and avoiding prolonged glucocorticoid over-replacement with consequent immunosuppression. Diabetes insipidus poses fluid-balance challenges during significant illness, and hypernatremia is linked to increased mortality in intensive care admissions.

A 2019 position statement noted that neuroendocrine function can persist in patients with permanent injury to the brain and "is not inconsistent with the whole brain standard of death". Clinicians may initiate a BD/DNC evaluation and determine a patient BD/DNC despite evidence of neuroendocrine function (Level B).

### Changing the name of diabetes insipidus: a position statement of the working group for renaming diabetes insipidus [^1159ugb7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Historical Context

Before explaining the rational for the name change, it is instructive to review the historical context for the name of diabetes insipidus. The polyuria and polydipsia of diabetes was first described by Demetrius of Apameia (first-second century BC), who used the term diabetes, meaning "passing water like a siphon" to describe the polyuria characteristic of this condition. Araetus of Cappadocia (81–138 AD) further defined the clinical characteristics of this disease. Although observations that the urine was sweet were alluded to in both Greek and Indian history, the first documented report of the sweet character of diabetic urine was published by the English physician Sir Thomas Willis in 1674 (The Diabetes or Pissing Evil). However, the differentiation between the saccharine urine of glucosuria and the non-saccharine urine of other forms of polyuria is attributed to the Scottish physician William Cullen, who appended the Latin word mellitus (sweet) to the Greek term diabetes to distinguish between these two types of polyuria. In 1794, Johann Peter Frank first introduced the term diabetes insipidus to differentiate these patients from those with diabetes mellitus. These terms persisted as valid clinical descriptions without known pathophysiology until the vasopressor and antidiuretic actions of posterior pituitary extracts were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th century, including use of posterior pituitary extracts to treat diabetes insipidus. In the mid-20th century, arginine vasopressin was synthesized and identified as the antidiuretic hormone, and the distinct central and nephrogenic etiologies of diabetes insipidus were recognized and characterized. Despite new knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of the different etiologies of diabetes insipidus by the late 20th century, no attempts were made to rename diabetes insipidus according to the known causes of the disorder, namely deficiency of arginine vasopressin or resistance to the receptor-mediated actions of arginine vasopressin.

### Current perspective on the pathogenesis of central diabetes insipidus [^115S6mmq]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a heterogeneous condition characterised by polyuria and polydipsia caused by a lack of secretion of vasopressin, its physiological suppression following excessive water intake, or kidney resistance to its action. The clinical and laboratory diagnosis is confirmed by standard tests, but recent advances in molecular biology and imaging techniques have shed new light on the pathophysiology of this disease. In many patients, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a germinoma or craniopharyngioma; Langerhans' cell histiocytosis and sarcoidosis of the central nervous system; local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases; trauma from surgery or accident; and, rarely, genetic defects in vasopressin biosynthesis inherited as autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive traits. Thirty to fifty percent of cases are considered idiopathic. Tumour-associated central diabetes insipidus is uncommon in children younger than 5 years old. Biopsy of enlarged pituitary stalk should be reserved for patients with hypothalamic-pituitary mass and progressive thickening of the pituitary stalk since spontaneous recovery may occur. Molecular biology in selected patients may identify those with apparently idiopathic diabetes insipidus carrying the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene mutation.

### Neuroimaging of central diabetes insipidus-when, how and findings [^111BuKLA]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus (CDI) is due to deficient synthesis or secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin peptide (AVP). It is clinically characterised by polydipsia and polyuria (urine output > 30 mL/kg/day) of dilute urine (< 250 mOsm/L). It is the result of a defect in one of more sites involving the hypothalamic osmoreceptors, supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, median eminence of the hypothalamus, infundibulum or the posterior pituitary gland. A focused MRI pituitary gland or sella protocol is essential. There are several neuroimaging correlates and causes of CDI, illustrated in this review. The most common causes are benign or malignant neoplasms of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (25%), surgery (20%), head trauma (16%) or familial causes (10%). No cause is identified in up to 30% of cases. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal axis is crucial when evaluating a patient with CDI. Establishing the aetiology of CDI with MRI in combination with clinical and biochemical assessment facilitates appropriate targeted treatment. The aim of the pictorial review is to illustrate the wide variety of causes of CDI on neuroimaging, highlight the optimal MRI protocol and to revise the detailed neuroanatomy and neurophysiology required to interpret these studies.

### Family experience with individuals of different ages and clinical presentations diagnosed with DI: do familial DI cases tolerate polyuria better? [^111xAHS8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare genetic disorder caused by vasopressin deficiency due to AVP gene mutations. This case report describes the genetic findings and clinical profiles of three generations within a family affected by hereditary central DI and managed with desmopressin.

Case Presentation

An 8-month-old male infant was admitted due to persistent polyuria and polydipsia that had been present since birth. History revealed a daily fluid intake of 7,200 mL and required 13 full diapers. The water deprivation test revealed a serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg with a concurrently low urine osmolality (< 300 mOsm/kg), confirming the diagnosis of DI. Desmopressin therapy was initiated for the patient. Using next-generation sequencing, a heterozygous variant c.329G > A (p. Cys110Tyr) was detected in the AVP gene. Following our patient's diagnosis, we evaluated first cousin once removed (on the maternal side) for similar symptoms. Upon identification of the heterozygous AVP variant via next-generation sequencing, desmopressin treatment was started. The same variant was detected in our patient's grandfather, mother, aunt, great-uncle, and first cousin once removed. Polyuria and polydipsia were present in all patients included in our case series. The grandfather and great-uncle, who were initially diagnosed, experienced delayed diagnosis and later developed renal complications. In contrast, the following generations of the family were diagnosed early.

Conclusions

In familial cases, parents are often familiar with the clinical features of DI, allowing them to ensure adequate hydration, manage polyuria, and minimize the risk of dehydration. However, early diagnosis reduces the risk of long-term complications and enables effective family screening, allowing identification of previously unrecognized mild cases.

### Diabetes insipidus: an update [^112mR2vj]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus involves the distinction between central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Differentiation is important because treatment strategies vary; the wrong treatment can be dangerous. Reliable differentiation is difficult especially in patients with primary polydipsia or partial forms of diabetes insipidus. New diagnostic algorithms are based on the measurement of copeptin after osmotic stimulation by hypertonic saline infusion or after nonosmotic stimulation by arginine and have a higher diagnostic accuracy than the water deprivation test. Treatment involves correcting preexisting water deficits, but is different for central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia.

### Clinical considerations and key issues in the management of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease: a seven case series [^112y3X3H]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the past three years, the constantly growing clinical awareness of medical professionals has globally promoted several substantial achievements in the evolution of ECD. First, the rate at which patients are being diagnosed has risen dramatically. Patients are being diagnosed much earlier in the course of their disease. We now witness subclinical, nearly asymptomatic ECD patients. Thus, new dilemmas are discussed regarding the potential benefits and risks of early medical interventions. Second, annual ECD conferences are being held, promoting novel research initiatives as well as the emergence of the first edition of consensus guidelines.

Nevertheless, the proper diagnosis and management of an ECD patient remains a challenge. From our clinical experience with seven patients, several key issues should be addressed in the management of such patients. In terms of diagnosis, as previously reported, diabetes insipidus of an unexplained etiology may precede the onset of investigation eliciting symptoms by as many as twelve years. Most peculiarly, the various anatomical disruptions of the hypothalamic - pituitary regions that could explain such a phenomenon appear on MRI, if at all, months to years following diagnosis. This gap of time suggests that the initial manifestations of ECD could indolently progress from microscopic involvement which generates a functional disturbance of the posterior pituitary. Ultimately, this process may become evident on MRI as absence of the high signal intensity of the posterior pituitary on T1 weighted images or as thickening of the pituitary stalk.

### Desmopressin acetate [^112NJWNb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Central Diabetes Insipidus

Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis

Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^116GGMzr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impairment of AVP secretion from the posterior pituitary. In clinical practice, it needs to be distinguished from renal resistance to the antidiuretic effects of AVP (nephrogenic DI), and abnormalities of thirst appreciation (primary polydipsia). As nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is rare in adults, unless they are treated with lithium salts, the practical challenge is how to differentiate between CDI and clinical disorders of excess thirst. The differential diagnosis is usually straight forward, but the recommended gold standard test, the water deprivation test, is not without interpretative pitfalls. The addition of the measurement of plasma AVP concentrations improves diagnostic accuracy, but the radioimmunoassay for AVP is technically difficult, and is only available in a few specialized centres. More recently, the measurement of plasma copeptin concentrations has been claimed to provide a reliable alternative to measurement of plasma AVP, without the sampling handling challenges. In addition, the measurement of thirst ratings can help the differentiation between CDI and primary polydipsia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is biochemically certain, investigations to determine the cause of AVP deficiency are needed. In this review, we will outline the diagnostic approach to polyuria, revisit the caveats of the water deprivation test and review recent data on value of adding AVP/copeptin measurement. We will also discuss treatment strategies for CDI, with analysis of potential complications of treatment.

### Central diabetes insipidus in children and young adults: etiological diagnosis and long-term outcome of idiopathic cases [^113HEgbe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is considered idiopathic in 20% to 50% of affected subjects.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a systematic diagnostic workup could achieve better etiologic diagnosis in children and adolescents presenting with polyuria and polydipsia.

Design and Setting

This is a prospective study conducted at a tertiary referral center. Patients underwent clinical and endocrine evaluations every 6 months and neuroimaging every 6 months for 2 years and yearly for 3 years. Endocrine function and neuroimaging were also reassessed after adult height achievement.

Participants

A total of 85 consecutive patients with CDI were enrolled at a median age of 7.5 years; those with idiopathic CDI were stratified based on pituitary stalk thickness.

Main Outcome Measures

To establish the etiology of CDI, we determined the time lag between its onset and the specific diagnosis, the long-term impact on pituitary function, and the overall long-term outcomes.

Results

Of the subjects, 24 (28.2%) received an etiologic diagnosis at presentation and 11 (13%) within 2.5 years (n = 7 germinomas and n = 4 Langerhans cell histiocytosis), 7 (8.2%) were lost to follow-up, and 43 (50.6%) were considered to have idiopathic disease and were followed until the median age of 17.3 years. Neuroimaging identified 40 of 43 patients with self-limited inflammatory/autoimmune pituitary stalk thickness within the first 6 months, the severity of which was significantly correlated to pituitary dysfunction. The probability of > 10-year-survival without an anterior pituitary defect was related to the severity of pituitary stalk thickness, and 53% showed permanent anterior pituitary defects. Three patients developed Langerhans cell histiocytosis and 1 developed Hodgkin lymphoma after a median of 9 and 13 years, respectively.

Conclusions

A diagnostic etiology was achieved in 96% of patients with CDI. Risk stratification based on the degree of pituitary stalk thickness is of prognostic value for long-term outcomes including permanent pituitary dysfunction. New guidance is provided for the management of these patients.

### Central diabetes insipidus: a previously unreported side effect of temozolomide [^11499HxK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent primarily used to treat tumors of the central nervous system. We describe 2 patients with apparent TMZ-induced central diabetes insipidus. Using our institution's Research Patient Database Registry, we identified 3 additional potential cases of TMZ-induced diabetes insipidus among a group of 1545 patients treated with TMZ.

Case Presentations

A 53-year-old male with an oligoastrocytoma and a 38-year-old male with an oligodendroglioma each developed symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria approximately 2 months after the initiation of TMZ. Laboratory analyses demonstrated hypernatremia and urinary concentrating defects, consistent with the presence of diabetes insipidus, and the patients were successfully treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate was withdrawn after the discontinuation of TMZ, and diabetes insipidus did not recur. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary and hypothalamus was unremarkable apart from the absence of a posterior pituitary bright spot in both of the cases. Anterior pituitary function tests were normal in both cases. Using the Research Patient Database Registry database, we identified the 2 index cases and 3 additional potential cases of diabetes insipidus for an estimated prevalence of 0.3% (5 cases of diabetes insipidus per 1545 patients prescribed TMZ).

Conclusions

Central diabetes insipidus is a rare but reversible side effect of treatment with TMZ.

### Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 with diabetes insipidus: a case report [^117JYe8j]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Reported by previous studies, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is the most common and usually the first component of APS-1, and it usually occurs before the age of 5. Hypoparathyroidism is the most common endocrine component and usually appears after chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Adrenal insufficiency is less common than hypoparathyroidism and has an incidence peak at the age of 12 years. The most three frequent minor manifestations are autoimmune thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune hepatitis. Our patient developed chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis at the age of 9 years and then developed adrenal insufficiency and autoimmune thyroiditis at the age 15 years. He also presented alopecia, which is also a common minor components of APS-1 reported in a Russian cohort with 112 APS-1 patients.

Interestingly, our patient was referred to us for his polyuria and polydipsia. Water deprivation test and vasopressin administration revealed that our patient suffered from central diabetes insipidus. Further pituitary MRI found no significant lesions. The causes of central diabetes insipidus are usually pituitary lesions, including trauma, tumor, or infection. Lymphocytic filtration is now recognized also a common cause of central diabetes insipidus. And it may recover to normal while diabetes insipidus is left permanent. There are only few cases of diabetes insipidus caused by APS. In a study including 79 children and young adults with central diabetes insipidus, only in one patient diabetes insipidus was caused by APS. And the patient developed polyuria and polydipsia until age 24.8 while he had been diagnosed with APS at the age of 2 years. The long period of time elapsed since APS was diagnosed to the presentation of diabetes insipidus is also seen in our patient. Another cohort from Turkey including 34 children with central diabetes insipidus revealed that only in one case diabetes insipidus was caused by APS. The development of central diabetes insipidus in APS patients may be due to autoimmune process. In a large cohort of 2385 APS patients, 22 of them with central diabetes insipidus, and most of them developed diabetes insipidus after the age of 20 years, was selected out for screening for antibodies to AVP-secreting cells (AVPcAb). AVPcAb was positive in 15 of the 22 patients and consisted positive during the 5-year follow-up. While in the control group of 13 idiopathic central diabetes insipidus, only 5 of them were AVPcAb positive. The presence of AVPcAb suggested that due to the autoimmune pathogenesis, diabetes insipidus is also a component in APS. The damage of AVP cells may be chronic, which may be associated with the late development of central diabetes insipidus in APS patients.

### New developments and concepts in the diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus (AVP-deficiency and resistance) [^11292txb]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterised by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine, with a prevalence of 1 per 25,000 population. Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI resulting from deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI) or AVP-resistance develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys. The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited/familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as in aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described. Although the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis. Diagnosing partial forms of DI, and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia, can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs and, in some cases, administration of diuretics. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of DI has led to novel evolving therapeutic agents that are under clinical trial.

### Central diabetes insipidus from a patient's perspective: management, psychological co-morbidities, and renaming of the condition: results from an international web-based survey [^115WGzLH]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Central diabetes insipidus is a rare neuroendocrine condition. Data on treatment-associated side-effects, psychological comorbidities, and incorrect management are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate patients' perspectives on their disease.

Methods

This study used a cross-sectional, web-based, anonymous survey, developed by endocrinologists and patient representatives, to collect the opinions of patients with central diabetes insipidus on management and complications of their disease, psychological comorbidities, degree of knowledge and awareness of the condition among health-care professionals, and renaming the disease to avoid confusion with diabetes mellitus (diabetes).

Findings

Between Aug 23, 2021, and Feb 7, 2022, 1034 patients with central diabetes insipidus participated in the survey. 91 (9%) participants were children and adolescents (37 [41%] girls and 54 [59%] boys; median age 10 years [IQR 6–15]) and 943 (91%) were adults (757 [80%] women and 186 [20%] men]; median age 44 years [34–54]). 488 (47%) participants had isolated posterior pituitary dysfunction and 546 (53%) had combined anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction. Main aetiologies were idiopathic (315 [30%] of 1034 participants) and tumours and cysts (pre-surgical 217 [21%]; post-surgical 254 [25%]). 260 (26%; 95% CI [0·23–0·29]) of 994 patients on desmopressin therapy had hyponatraemia leading to hospitalisation. Patients who routinely omitted or delayed desmopressin to allow intermittent aquaresis had a significantly lower prevalence of hyponatraemia compared with those not aware of this approach (odds ratio 0·55 [95% CI 0·39–0·77]; p = 0·0006). Of patients who had to be hospitalised for any medical reason, 71 (13%; 95% CI 0·10–0·16) of 535 patients did not receive desmopressin while in a fasting state (nil by mouth) without intravenous fluid replacement and reported symptoms of dehydration. 660 (64%; 0·61–0·67) participants reported lower quality of life, and 369 (36%; 0·33–0·39) had psychological changes subjectively associated with their central diabetes insipidus. 823 (80%; 0·77–0·82) participants encountered a situation where central diabetes insipidus was confused with diabetes mellitus (diabetes) by health-care professionals. 884 (85%; 0·83–0·88) participants supported renaming the disease; the most favoured alternative names were vasopressin deficiency and arginine vasopressin deficiency.

Interpretation

This is the largest survey of patients with central diabetes insipidus, reporting a high prevalence of treatment-associated side-effects, mismanagement during hospitalisation, psychological comorbidities, and a clear support for renaming the disease. Our data are the first to indicate the value of routinely omitting or delaying desmopressin.

### Multiphase management of sodium imbalance following traumatic brain injury: a case-based review [^116w76gQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This case report is important because it exemplifies a rare but clinically significant sequence of sodium disturbances — osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD), and subsequent syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) — following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These phases often overlap, mimic one another, or transition rapidly, making diagnosis and management highly challenging. The case emphasizes:

The Triphasic Pattern – Often overlooked in clinical practice, the unmasking of AVD following mannitol-induced diuresis and eventual transition to SIAD is under-recognized but crucial for guiding treatment decisions.
Dynamic Pathophysiology –The triphasic response mechanism is believed to involve an initial phase of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) caused by transient dysfunction or "stunning" of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-secreting neurons, followed by a second phase of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) due to uncontrolled ADH release, and finally a third phase of permanent CDI resulting from depletion of ADH stores and irreversible loss of ADH production in the posterior pituitary.
Clinical Relevance – Mismanagement (e.g. giving fluids in SIAD or restricting them in AVD) can lead to devastating complications like cerebral edema, seizures, or demyelination.
Teachable Value – The case serves as a high-yield clinical learning opportunity for ICU physicians, pediatricians, and neurologists, especially with its clear timeline, management strategies, and a schematic protocol for differentiation.
Gap in Literature – There are limited pediatric case reports systematically describing all three phases and offering practical ICU management tools in such a structured format.

In sum, the case bridges a gap between theory and bedside care, offering both a cautionary tale and a practical guide for optimizing outcomes in critically ill TBI patients.

Pathophysiology of Sodium Imbalance in Traumatic Brain Injury:

Sodium imbalance in TBI results from disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, intracranial pressure, and renal handling of water and electrolytes. (Tables 1 and 2) Initial osmotic diuresis is a common consequence of mannitol use and may exacerbate sodium derangement, particularly in unconscious or altered-consciousness patients, where fluid intake may be inadequate. Vasopressin deficiency (formerly central DI) arises due to hypothalamic or pituitary injury, impairing vasopressin secretion or release and causing polyuria and hypernatremia if patients cannot compensate with adequate fluid intake. SIAD results from non-osmotic vasopressin release, leading to water retention, concentrated urine, and dilutional hyponatremia. (Table 2. Diagnostic Clues in Sodium Imbalance, Table 3: Differentiation table).

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^112GAeW1]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, copeptin is a valuable and reliable diagnostic marker in the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. In a patient with unclear polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome, determination of basal copeptin levels is recommended to exclude nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In patients with high suspicion of complete central diabetes insipidus, an overnight water deprivation test might confirm diagnosis provided urine osmolality remains below 300 mosm/kg and plasma sodium levels increase above 147 mmol/L. In all other patients, copeptin measurement after osmotic stimulation with 3% saline solution aiming at a plasma sodium level above 147 mmol/L is recommended (see diagnostic work flow in Figure 4).

The determination of copeptin on the first postoperative day after pituitary surgery is useful to predict the development of central diabetes insipidus.

### Central diabetes insipidus in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury [^11138Qen]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the occurrence rate of central diabetes insipidus in pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury and to describe the clinical, injury, biochemical, imaging, and intervention variables associated with mortality.

Design

Retrospective chart and imaging review.

Setting

Children's Hospital, level 1 trauma center.

Patients

Severely injured (Injury Severity Score ≥ 12) pediatric trauma patients (> 1 month and < 18 yr) with severe traumatic brain injury (presedation Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and head Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 4) that developed acute central diabetes insipidus between January 2000 and December 2011.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 818 severely injured trauma patients, 180 had severe traumatic brain injury with an overall mortality rate of 27.2%. Thirty-two of the severe traumatic brain injury patients developed acute central diabetes insipidus that responded to desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin and/or vasopressin infusion, providing an occurrence rate of 18%. At the time of central diabetes insipidus diagnosis, median urine output and serum sodium were 6.8 ml/kg/hr (interquartile range = 5–11) and 154 mmol/L (interquartile range = 149–159), respectively. The mortality rate of central diabetes insipidus patients was 87.5%, with 71.4% declared brain dead after central diabetes insipidus diagnosis. Early central diabetes insipidus onset, within the first 2 days of severe traumatic brain injury, was strongly associated with mortality (p < 0.001), as were a lower presedation Glasgow Coma Scale (p = 0.03), a lower motor Glasgow Coma Scale (p = 0.01), an occurrence of fixed pupils (p = 0.04), and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (p = 0.04). Cerebral edema on the initial computed tomography, obtained in the first 24 hrs after injury, was the only imaging finding associated with death (p = 0.002). Survivors of central diabetes insipidus were more likely to have intracranial pressure monitoring (p = 0.03), have thiopental administered to induce coma (p = 0.04) and have received a decompressive craniectomy for elevated intracranial pressure (p = 0.04).

Conclusions

The incidence of central diabetes insipidus in pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury is 18%. Mortality was associated with early central diabetes insipidus onset and cerebral edema on head computed tomography. Central diabetes insipidus nonsurvivors were less likely to have received intracranial pressure monitoring, thiopental coma and decompressive craniectomy.

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^111bpqz2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit sodium and glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to glycosuria and natriuresis, both of which can affect urine osmolality and contribute to osmotic diuresis. Vasopressin acts on V2 receptor (V2R) in the collecting duct, facilitating water reabsorption via aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels. Dysregulation of the vasopressin-V2R-AQP2 axis is central to both CDI and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Studies in diabetic rats have shown that empagliflozin downregulates AQP2 expression in the kidney. In CDI, the lack of vasopressin release impairs urine concentration, and SGLT2 inhibitors may exacerbate this defect by further downregulation of AQP2. In this patient, the marked increase in polydipsia following dapagliflozin administration supports this hypothesis.

A limitation should be considered in the interpretation of our case. The inability to routinely measure AVP and copeptin levels at our institution, due to both technical limitations and existing clinical protocols, represents a key constraint. This lack of quantitative neuroendocrine data restricts our capacity to establish precise correlation between observed clinical manifestations and their underlying biochemical mechanisms.

In conclusion, CDI should be considered in T2DM patients with persistent hypernatremia following resolution of HHS. SGLT2 inhibitors may complicate the diagnosis and management of CDI by masking hypotonic polyuria and altering urine osmolality. Discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended when evaluating patients with suspected of CDI to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

3 THE ROLE OF COPEPTIN IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES INSIPIDUS

3.1 Polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome

Polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome is a common problem in clinical practice with the main entities being central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. 38

While central diabetes insipidus is characterized by a complete (complete central diabetes insipidus) or partial (partial central diabetes insipidus) insufficient vasopressin (AVP) secretion from the pituitary, 39, 40 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from an AVP resistance of the kidneys 41 both leading to hypotonic polyuria with compensatory polydipsia. Central diabetes insipidus can result from various conditions affecting the hypothalamic‐neurohypophyseal system such as trauma resulting from surgery or accident, local tumours or metastases, inflammatory/autoimmune or granulomatous diseases. 1, 42 Several reports also described genetic defects in the AVP synthesis leading to inherited forms of central diabetes insipidus. 20, 43 The most challenging form of central diabetes insipidus involves an impairment of the thirst perception and consecutive hypodipsia, which can result in severe hypernatremia. 38, 44

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from a lack of aquaporin 2 (AQP2)‐mediated water reabsorption in the collecting duct. This is either a consequence of gene mutations in the key proteins vasopressin V2 receptor or AQP2, is secondarily triggered by electrolyte disorders or is induced by certain drugs especially lithium. 41

The pathomechanism of primary polydipsia, which is characterized by excessive fluid intake, is less clear. An analysis of 23 patients with profound hyponatraemia due to primary polydipsia revealed an increased prevalence for psychiatric diagnoses such as dependency disorders (43%) and depression (35%). 45 Another prospective study with 156 patients with polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome however showed a similar rate (around 30%) of psychiatric disorders in patients with primary polydipsia and patients with central diabetes insipidus. 46 As chronic excessive fluid intake in patients with primary polydipsia leads to a down‐regulation of the AQP2 channels in the kidneys, the renal medullary concentration gradient is reduced, making any diagnostic evaluation of the urine osmolality and urinary output difficult. 47

Differentiation between the three mentioned entities is important since treatment strategies vary and application of the wrong treatment can be dangerous. 48 However, reliable differentiation is often difficult to achieve, 49 especially in patients with primary polydipsia or partial forms of diabetes insipidus. 2, 50

Defining Organ Involvement, Risk Organs, and CNS (Central Nervous System) Risk Lesions

The findings of the pretreatment clinical evaluation allow definition of organ involvement based on the clinical, biological, and radiological criteria shown in Table IV. Disease involvement of certain organs is considered as a marker of higher risk of (a) dying from disease (risk organs) or (b) developing neuro-degenerative complications more commonly named as CNS risk lesions.

TABLE IV
Definition of Organ Involvement in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis

Risk organs include the hematologic system, the spleen and the liver (evidence: B, agreement: 2). The lung had been considered for many decades as a risk organ, but its individual prognostic impact has recently been questioned. In fact, in the absence of involvement of other risk organs, lung disease is only in exceptional cases the ultimate cause of death, and this usually occurs through "mechanical complications" such as an uncontrolled pneumothorax, or as a late event due to chronic emphysematous changes. In the upcoming clinical trial for LCH in children (LCH-IV), the lung will be no longer considered a risk organ.

Involvement of some skull bones might predispose to diabetes insipidus (DI) and CNS manifestations. The term CNS risk lesions, representing a more recent concept, suggests that these patients are more likely to develop neuro-degenerative CNS disease, which may be an irreversible complication of LCH and may have a debilitating course. Therefore, skull bone lesions, with the exception of the vault, are considered as CNS risk lesions, assuming that risk factors for DI can also be considered as risk factors of neuro-degenerative changes (evidence C; agreement: 1).

Clinical Classification

The current classification differentiates between single system disease (SS-LCH) and multisystem disease (MS-LCH), a distinction based on the extent of involvement at diagnosis. In SS-LCH, only one organ or system is involved such as bone (either as a single bone or more than one bone), skin, lymph node (not the draining lymph node of another LCH lesion), lungs, hypothalamic-pituitary/central nervous system, or others such as thyroid or thymus. In MS-LCH, two or more organs, or systems are involved either with or without involvement of risk organs.

### Risk factors for diabetes insipidus in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^113GfWa2]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is the most frequent central nervous system (CNS)-related permanent consequence in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), which mostly requires life-long hormone replacement therapy. In an attempt to define the population at risk for DI, 1,741 patients with LCH registered on the trials DALHX 83 and DALHX 90, LCH I and LCH II were studied.

Results

Overall 212 of 1,741 patients (12%) was reported to have DI. In 102 of 1,741 patients (6%) DI was present at diagnosis of LCH. One thousand one hundred eighty three of 1,539 patients without DI at diagnosis had follow up information. One hundred ten of these (9%) later developed DI. The risk of developing DI was 20% at 15 years after diagnosis. Multisystem disease patients at diagnosis carried a 4.6-fold risk for DI compared to single system patients. Craniofacial lesions, in particular in the "ear", "eye", and oral region were associated with a significantly increased risk for DI (relative hazard rate, RHR 1.7), independent of the extent of disease. No influence of the duration of therapy could be determined, but the duration of initial disease activity (RHR 1.5) and the occurrence of reactivations (RHR 3.5) significantly increased the risk for DI.

Conclusions

Patients with multisystem disease and craniofacial involvement at diagnosis, in particular of the "ear", "eye", and the oral region carry a significantly increased risk to develop DI during their course. This risk is augmented when the disease remains active for a longer period or reactivates.

### Changing the name of diabetes insipidus: a position statement of the working group for renaming diabetes insipidus [^112rfBhP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Changing the Name of Diabetes Insipidus

There are multiple reasons to change the name of diabetes insipidus at this time. First and foremost, although the terms mellitus and insipidus do differentiate between the clinical characteristics of these two very different causes of polyuria, and clearly are not eponyms, the use of the common term "diabetes" in both has unfortunately led to confusion for both patients and their caretakers. This confusion with diabetes mellitus has been to the detriment of patients with diabetes insipidus when they are under the care of non-endocrine specialists. Some physicians and nurses do not appreciate the difference between these two very different disorders. In several patients with central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin treatment was withheld with serious adverse outcomes, including death. This has led to high profile litigation cases and coroners' inquests involving the police, with wide media coverage. Subsequent to these unfortunate but avoidable cases, national safety alerts, surveys among endocrinologists, and a global task-force consisting of a wide range of senior clinicians involved with the care of patients with diabetes insipidus has led to a strong impetus to change the name of the condition. Second, patients with diabetes insipidus strongly support changing the name to eliminate "diabetes". In a survey of > 1000 patients with central diabetes insipidus recently published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, 85% preferred the name to be changed, mainly because of experiences with insufficient understanding of the disease by health professionals who confused this disorder with diabetes mellitus. Indeed, 87% percent of patients felt that this lack of knowledge and the resulting clinical confusion affected the management of their condition, eg, repeated blood sugar measurements or prescription of medication for diabetes mellitus during hospitalization. Finally, we believe the names of medical disorders optimally should reflect the underlying pathophysiology, which in the case of diabetes insipidus is now well known to be deficient secretion and/or end-organ effects of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Hence, for all the above reasons, the working group proposes that the name diabetes insipidus should be changed to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) for central etiologies, and arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R) for nephrogenic etiologies, and this proposal has been endorsed by the following societies represented by the working group members: Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, Pituitary Society, Society for Endocrinology, European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, Endocrine Society of Australia, Brazilian Endocrine Society, and Japanese Endocrine Society, and is under review at several other societies.

### Utility of copeptin in predicting non-pathological postoperative polyuria in patients affected by acromegaly undergoing pituitary neurosurgery [^116Ef8dM]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acromegaly is a rare condition and results from an overproduction of growth hormone (GH) and elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), characterized by progressive somatic disfigurement and systemic manifestations, generally due to a functioning pituitary adenoma. Acromegaly is an insidious disease, and despite advancements in diagnostic techniques over time, there remains a considerable diagnostic latency; for such a reason, in most cases the underlying etiology is a pituitary macroadenoma.

The excess of GH/IGF-I in patients with acromegaly leads to several negative consequences. Such individuals are at increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, musculoskeletal issues, as well as psychiatric complications, resulting in a decline in quality of life and an elevated risk of mortality.

The primary treatment for most patients is surgical, as surgery alone offers the possibility of a definitive cure in the short-term, leading to immediate lowering of GH levels and providing tumor tissue for pathological characterization. However, the neurosurgical management does not come without potential complications, such as postoperative hypopituitarism (anterior and/or posterior), or cerebrospinal fluid leak, depending on the size of the lesion, extent of resection and neurosurgeon's experience.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), is a possible consequence of pituitary manipulation and is caused by a transient or permanent deficiency in the secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by the neurohypophysis and in most cases, resolves within 10 days.

CDI is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia, with possible consequent hypernatremia and hypertonicity unless fluids are promptly replaced, leading to increased morbidity and lengthened hospital stays.

For these reasons, various strategies for early diagnosis have been proposed in recent years. In particular, research focus has shifted to copeptin, the C-terminal portion of pre-pro-vasopressin (CT-proAVP), which is released simultaneously and in an equimolar ratio with AVP. Copeptin, known for its longer half-life and greater ex vivo stability compared to its biologically active counterpart, has been extensively demonstrated to accurately predict the onset of CDI when promptly assessed after surgery.

4 THE ROLE OF COPEPTIN IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF SIAD

4.1 Differential diagnosis of hyponatraemia

Hyponatraemia is defined as a plasma sodium level of < 135 mmol/L and characterized by a relative excess of body water compared to total body sodium. 3 Although often neglected in clinical practice, hyponatraemia is an important condition as it is present in up to 30% of hospitalized patients 4, 58 and linked to increased morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. 59, 60, 61 Hyponatraemia is associated with a variety of underlying disorders and may be categorized according to extracellular fluid volume into hypervolemic (eg, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), hypovolaemic and euvolemic hyponatraemia with SIAD as the most common cause. 62, 63 Main diagnostic criteria for SIAD include plasma osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg and urine sodium concentration > 30 mmol/L, euvolemia and absence of adrenal, thyroid or renal insufficiency. 62 Hyponatraemia may further be triggered by diuretic use, primary polydipsia or endocrine conditions (adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism). Discrimination between these pathophysiological categories is crucial as management differs considerably (eg, fluid restriction in SIAD vs intravenous fluid in hypovolaemia), and delayed treatment may lead to devastating consequences such as brain oedema, seizures and coma/death. 64 Unfortunately, the diagnostic approach to hyponatraemia is complex and time‐consuming; clinical signs and symptoms are variable and unspecific and fluid status is difficult to assess. 65, 66 According to current hyponatraemia Clinical Practice Guidelines, 62 laboratory measurements such as urine osmolality and urine sodium as well as the calculation of fractional uric acid excretion are proposed; however, in many cases accurate classification into pathophysiological categories remains cumbersome.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology review on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-mediated endocrinopathies provides a practical approach for clinicians based on a literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus and evidence from prospective, randomized clinical studies; cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; case-based studies; and an expert consensus. Immunotherapy with ICIs has transformed cancer care but frequently results in immune-mediated endocrinopathies that can cause acute and persistent morbidity and, rarely, death. Patterns differ between inhibitors of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed cell death protein 1 or programmed cell death ligand 1 pathways and most often involve the thyroid and pituitary glands, while less common presentations include insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, primary adrenal insufficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism, central diabetes insipidus, primary hypogonadism, and pancreatitis, with or without progression to diabetes mellitus or exocrine insufficiency. The review emphasizes the need for a high index of clinical suspicion across specialties, provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ICI-induced endocrinopathies, and proposes that patients on ICI therapy be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team in collaboration with endocrinologists.
