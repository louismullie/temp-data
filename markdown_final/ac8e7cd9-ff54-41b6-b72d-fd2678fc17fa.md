## Question

Explanation of at least two strategies for including academic activities and accomplishments into your professional development goals. Then, explain how those goals may align with the University's emphasis on social change. Be specific and provide examples.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of at least two strategies to integrate academic activities and accomplishments into professional development goals, and to explain how those goals align with a university's emphasis on social change, with specific examples. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core components of academic professional development and the institution's social change mission. Then, I should identify and validate two concrete, evidence-based strategies. Next, I will examine how each strategy can be explicitly mapped to social change objectives. After that, I will synthesize an alignment framework and offer measurable milestones. Finally, I will consider pitfalls and a final, actionable summary, verifying claims against the cited literature at each step.

> Let me first confirm the foundational pieces I'm building on: professional development in academic medicine spans clinical excellence, education, research, and service/advocacy, and career advancement is shaped by how institutions recognize contributions across these domains; social change in many universities is expressed through commitments to health equity, community engagement, policy translation, and global or local public good, which should be reflected in promotion frameworks and mentorship practices [^114yaBQG] [^113YeWsp] [^117QqcVj].

> Now, Strategy 1: the advocacy portfolio as a formalized, scholarly approach to nontraditional academic contributions. Wait, let me verify the construct validity and uptake — multiple pediatric institutions have operationalized advocacy portfolios that parallel educator portfolios, explicitly codifying advocacy scholarship within promotion domains such as research, education, and service, with accepted products like policy statements, legislative testimony, and community-partnered initiatives, and this is increasingly recognized as legitimate scholarship by appointments and promotion committees [^113YeWsp] [^1152kvH5]. Hold on, I should verify alignment with university social change goals — advocacy portfolios inherently foreground systemic drivers of inequity, policy solutions, and community partnerships, mirroring institutional values that elevate health equity, DEIB, and community impact alongside traditional academic outputs [^1152kvH5] [^113YeWsp].

> Let me consider a concrete example to make this actionable: a faculty member with expertise in social determinants of health could develop a multi-year advocacy portfolio that includes a peer-reviewed policy analysis on housing instability and pediatric asthma, coauthored legislative testimony supporting local tenant protections, a partnered community needs assessment with a neighborhood coalition, and integration of advocacy training into residency curricula, all tied to measurable outcomes such as policy adoption, media citations, and trainee advocacy competency gains, which are explicitly valued within these frameworks [^1152kvH5] [^113YeWsp].

> Next, Strategy 2: aligning research and teaching with the Sustainable Development Goals to operationalize social change at a systems level. I need to check the evidence that SDG-aligned strategies shift academic priorities toward long-term, equity-focused work and transdisciplinary collaboration; the BMJ Global Health series argues that SDG integration incentivizes strategic, mission-driven planning beyond funding cycles and provides a shared metrics framework for partnership effectiveness and institutional capacity strengthening, which maps directly to social change imperatives [^117QqcVj] [^111QfkwU]. Hmm, wait a minute — initially I almost equated SDG alignment with grant-getting alone, but that would be misleading; the stronger claim is that SDG framing reorients institutional strategy and faculty work toward upstream, equity-centered questions and sustained partnerships, with pragmatic approaches to risk mitigation and metrics development for academic contributions to SDG targets [^116anRjh] [^111PcEmh].

> I will now examine how this translates into professional goals: a faculty member could commit to SDG3 (good health and well-being) and SDG10 (reduced inequalities) by pursuing implementation research on telehealth access for rural communities, teaching a systems-based practice course on health equity measurement, and leading a cross-sector partnership with public health departments and community organizations; this integrates scholarship, education, and service while producing outputs aligned with SDG indicators and institutional social change priorities [^117QqcVj] [^111QfkwU].

> Let me synthesize alignment with university social change emphasis so I don't jump to conclusions. Both strategies directly embed equity, community voice, and policy translation into academic work: advocacy portfolios institutionalize nontraditional scholarship that tackles structural determinants, while SDG-aligned work embeds global-local equity targets and partnership metrics into research and teaching; together they satisfy the demand for evidence-based, systems-oriented contributions to social change that many universities now recognize in promotion policies and faculty development programs [^113YeWsp] [^114yaBQG] [^1152kvH5].

> Hold on, I should verify the measurement piece to ensure these are not just aspirational goals. Promotion frameworks increasingly accept diverse scholarly products, including policy engagement, community-partnered work, and implementation science, provided they demonstrate excellence and impact; therefore, professional development plans should specify quantifiable deliverables such as policy briefs adopted, community outcomes improved, peer-reviewed publications on equity or implementation, and teaching evaluations that reflect systems-thinking competency gains, which collectively signal advancement-ready contributions to social change [^113YeWsp] [^1152kvH5].

> But wait, what if the institution lacks explicit promotion pathways for advocacy or SDG-linked work? I need to ensure we address implementation barriers: many academic centers are evolving but still underrecognize nontraditional scholarship; early engagement with department chairs, mentorship committees, and promotion liaisons to co-create an evaluative framework, secure protected time, and identify suitable mentors is essential, and aligning activities with institutional mission statements and community benefit reports can mitigate resistance and normalize these contributions as bona fide academic work [^113YeWsp] [^1152kvH5] [^1143aN1G].

> In summary, two evidence-based strategies — formalizing an advocacy portfolio and aligning research and teaching with SDG targets — provide concrete, measurable ways to integrate academic activities into professional development goals while directly advancing university priorities for social change; they expand the definition of scholarship, leverage cross-sector partnerships, and yield outputs that institutions increasingly value for promotion and for meaningful impact on health equity and systems transformation [^113YeWsp] [^117QqcVj] [^114yaBQG].

---

Two concrete ways to weave academic work into professional development are: (1) **SDG-aligned research and teaching** [^111QfkwU] that links scholarship to global health equity and sustainability, and (2) **community-engaged scholarship** [^115s13Zo] that translates academic outputs into local impact through partnerships and advocacy. These strategies align with a university's social change mission by directly addressing inequities [^116anRjh], strengthening community capacity [^115s13Zo], and generating evidence for policy change, with examples such as SDG-targeted studies on social determinants, community-based participatory research, and advocacy portfolios embedded in promotion criteria [^1152kvH5].

---

## Strategy 1: aligning academic activities with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

### Implementation

- **Goal setting**: Define research and teaching goals around SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and related SDGs, targeting social determinants, equity, and sustainability [^117QqcVj].

- **Curriculum integration**: Embed SDG content into courses, workshops, and training to build student capacity for equity-focused, systems-level thinking [^114zwGSd].

- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with NGOs, government, and community groups to co-create SDG-aligned projects and share metrics for shared accountability [^116anRjh].

---

### Alignment with social change

This approach advances health equity and justice by focusing on **SDG targets that reduce disparities** [^notfound]. It also **builds institutional capacity** for long-term, equitable development and strengthens cross-sector partnerships that drive policy and practice change [^111QfkwU].

---

### Example

A **project** could examine how housing instability affects chronic disease outcomes and test community-based interventions to improve equity, while a **teaching** component would train students to evaluate and implement SDG-aligned health policies.

---

## Strategy 2: community-engaged scholarship and advocacy

### Implementation

- **Community partnerships**: Conduct participatory research with underserved communities to address local priorities and co-produce knowledge [^115s13Zo].

- **Advocacy portfolio**: Document policy engagement, public education, and community outreach as scholarly contributions for promotion and tenure [^113YeWsp].

- **Training and support**: Provide mentorship and resources to build faculty capacity for advocacy and community-engaged work [^1152kvH5].

---

### Alignment with social change

This approach **addresses systemic inequities** by tackling root causes through community-driven solutions [^115MNWHi]. It empowers communities by building local capacity and leadership and generates evidence to inform policy and support legislative or regulatory change [^111XsMah].

---

### Example

A **partnership** with a local organization to reduce food insecurity that includes a community garden, nutrition education, and policy briefs for local government demonstrates both **scholarship and impact**.

---

## Conclusion

By aligning academic work with the SDGs and investing in community-engaged scholarship, faculty can advance **equity-focused research and education** [^114zwGSd] while directly supporting the university's social change mission. These strategies produce measurable impact on health disparities, strengthen community capacity, and embed social responsibility into academic careers [^11744Qug].

Seven good reasons to pursue the SDGs

First, the SDGs' target date of 2030 can incentivise academic institutions to think long term and strategically, avoid pursuing funding and planning operations on a year-by-year basis, and answer critical and difficult questions: "Where do we want to be in 2030?"; "Are the 13 targets within SDG3 the best we can achieve or can we do better?"; "Will we still need to work on a particular global health priority or in a particular country after 2030?"; "How will our work in 2030 differ from what it is now?". Academic institutions can also play an important role in addressing challenges associated with the SDGs themselves, which have been criticised for being a product of the same imperfect and unequal world, countries and societies that they are trying to change. For example, the presence of governance and accountability gaps between and within nation states, the excessive vulnerability of health policies and practices to broader political determinants of health, and an insufficient emphasis on a rights-based approach to health are among the major criticisms specifically raised against SDG3. Through research and scholarship, academic institutions can raise awareness and develop solutions to some of these challenges.

Second, by shifting from short-term plans to strategies that are aligned to the SDGs and are on a timeline longer than the funding cycle for most grants, academic institutions will be incentivised to be guided by strategy in the pursuit of funding rather than the other way around. The priorities of the host country — rather than the likelihood that donors will fund a particular set of activities — should in fact be the primary determinant of the types of goals that academic institutions opt to pursue. Unfortunately, funding for global health has plateaued over the past 3 years despite the fact that there is currently an estimated gap of US$20–50 billion per year needed to achieve SDG3 in 67 low-income and middle-income countries. A series of additional trends are contributing to an evolving funding environment, which academic institutions must now confront. These trends include (1) transition from core or longer-term funding towards more discretionary funding, (2) transition from country-led decision-making towards multistakeholder governance and (c) transition from broader systemic goals towards problem-focused vertical initiatives.

Conclusions

Even though it has been almost 3 years since the United Nations announced the SDGs and 2030 Agenda, to our knowledge, academic institutions working in global health have yet to incorporate the pursuit of SDG3 and the other SDGs into their strategies, plans or operations. We believe that there are multiple reasons (moral, strategic and even pragmatic) for these institutions to fully embrace the SDGs and hold themselves accountable to the same metrics and benchmarks endorsed by other development partners.

There might be some risks for academic institutions that opt to measure their success on their ability to achieve the SDGs since they often have limited control over health service delivery or the contribution of other stakeholders to the same goals. However, there are pragmatic approaches that academic institutions can take to lessen these risks. One approach includes establishing partnerships with health service delivery platforms (such as non-governmental organisations or the public sector), which prioritise patient care and public health interventions and strengthen the feedback loop between academic activities (research and training) and health service delivery. The other approach includes identifying intermediate health metrics or measurable milestones over which academic institutions have direct control and that can help provide clarity on individual roles, responsibilities and attributable achievements.

In the end, shifting from short-term plans to longer-term strategies that are aligned to the SDGs and share both goals and supporting metrics with other key global health players will greatly benefit academic institutions as well as the globe. By embracing the SDGs, these institutions will help improve the health of poor and underserved populations across the globe, and, as importantly, they will also help demonstrate a path towards sustainability in global health that is comprehensive, evidence based and agreed on. Such evidence will go a long way in preventing governments and donors from prematurely labelling some partnerships and multilateral initiatives as unsustainable. But, it will also ensure that the idea of sustainability itself remains a specific and tangible endeavour, regardless of how distant and challenging that may seem.

The Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda

It has been almost 3 years since the United Nations announced the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 2030 Agenda. The third of the 17 goals (SDG3) is specifically focused on health and is composed of 13 targets addressing a comprehensive set of global health priorities. Successful pursuit of SDG3 will require strong leadership from national governments and the United Nations system but also from other partners including multilateral organisations, civil society, business and the private sector. Among the partners, academic institutions working in global health have a pivotal role to play. We argue that, although the SDGs are imperfect, there remain strategic reasons, value-generating opportunities and a moral responsibility for academic institutions both in high-income and low-income to middle-income countries to fully incorporate the pursuit of SDG3 and other SDGs into their strategies, plans or operations to help advance the SDGs globally (box 1).

Box 1
Reasons for academic institutions to incorporate the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within their strategies and operations.

A target date of 2030 will incentivise academic institutions to (a) think long term and strategically, and (b) answer the hard question: "Where do we want to be in 2030?"
Academic institutions will also be incentivised to develop strategies that are driven by the SDGs rather than by the perceived availability of funding.
SDGs will contribute to eliminating the false dichotomy between the Global North and the Global South and foster transnational learning in health service delivery.
SDGs are very interdependent, which favours collaborations across disciplines and sectors.
Participation in inclusive partnerships centred around the pursuit of SDG3 will potentially serve as a catalyst for individual institutional capacity strengthening and transformation.
The emphasis of the SDGs on partnerships will facilitate the development of evidence-based metrics to determine whether a partnership has been successful.
The emphasis of the SDGs on institutional capacity strengthening and sustainability will facilitate the development of evidence-based metrics to define and measure them. Knowing whether sustainability is being achieved will prevent global health partnerships and multilateral initiatives from (a) being labelled as unsustainable prematurely, (b) ending too soon or (c) lasting indefinitely without evolving or leading to institutional capacity strengthening.

### Academic careers in advocacy: aligning institutional values through use of an advocacy portfolio [^113YeWsp]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Academic children's hospitals must embrace advocacy as a central component of their missions to discover new knowledge and improve the health of the communities and patients they serve. To do so, they must ensure faculty have both the tools and the opportunities to develop and articulate the work of advocacy as an academic endeavor. This can be accomplished by integrating the work of advocacy at the community and policy-change levels into the traditional value systems of academic medicine, especially the promotions process, to establish its legitimacy. Academic pediatric institutions can support this transformation through robust training and professional development programs and establishing opportunities, resources, and leadership positions in advocacy. The adoption of an advocacy portfolio can be used to align these activities and accomplishments to institutional values and promotion. This alignment is crucial to supporting the advocacy work of pediatricians at a time in which community engagement and systems and policy change must be added to professional activities to ensure optimal outcomes for all children.

### Developmental approaches to faculty development [^116LMqcX]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

An academic career goes through developmental stages and faculty have different needs as they progress through these stages. Faculty development initiatives can target these developmental needs. Early career faculty develop their clinical and academic identities and benefit from orientation programs and mentorship. Mid-career faculty engage in role transitions, consolidating their careers, and focusing on productivity and generativity. They benefit from programs that provide new skills, including leadership skills. Advanced career faculty focus on professional-personal integration, contributing to a community, and changes in roles and power. They can benefit from mentorship, from peers locally and at a distance.

Seventh, the SDGs can help academic institutions define metrics to determine whether critical, yet hard to measure, 'soft' goals are being achieved. For example, despite the growing consensus among development experts on the importance of partnerships in global health, the evidence on the effectiveness of these partnerships remains thin. Embracing SDG17 would further incentivise academic institutions to define evidence-based metrics on what makes a partnership successful and how partnerships compare with other models of engagement in global health. At the same time, embracing SDG16 would incentivise academic institutions to define evidence-based metrics to determine whether and to what extent each partner improved its practices and strengthened its capacity over time and whether such capacity leads to long-term sustainability.

Sustainability metrics should address 'technical domains' such as clinical care, training and research. For example, many academic institutions in low-income and middle-income countries are still burdened by a severe shortage of faculty. Faculty from high-income countries deployed overseas can help teach local students until these institutions are able to retain some of the new graduates as faculty and can help mentor and supervise local faculty in the early and most critical stages of their career. However, sustainability metrics should also address 'enabling domains' such as administration, infrastructure, equipment, information technology and finance. There are in fact myriads of administrative, legal, technological, financial and even ethical challenges that one encounters when working internationally. For example, the lack of well-defined academic career paths in global health, limited grants-management expertise within academic institutions in low-income and middle-income countries, or the persistence of legal and immigration hurdles which prevent academic institutions from hosting foreign faculty and students or from deploying their own overseas can all hinder the success of global health partnerships and the achievement of sustainability.

### Pediatric advocacy: advancement in academic institutions [^1143aN1G]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Steps to Promote Advocacy in Your Institution.

Institutional leaders at all levels may face barriers to achieving this vision and need to rely on various theories and styles of change management. One particularly relevant approach, adaptive leadership, is designed to address complex and longstanding challenges and is centered on building capacity across all organizational levels. This approach leverages past successes while at the same time prioritizing innovation and diversity of thought, staff, and expertise; it recognizes that any successful "adaptation" preserves what is essential, reorganizes what no longer best meets an organization's needs, and creates new opportunities to allow an organization or individual to thrive.

Using this framework, several examples follow of activities that may be particularly impactful in advancing a sustainable commitment to advocacy within academic institutions, though there are many other potentially effective activities and strategies.
Preserving what is essential: First and foremost, it is important to identify and articulate the overarching sense of purpose and how day-to-day activities are influenced by these guiding principles. Ensuring that their team is reminded of and centered on this sense of purpose will prepare advocates for the potentially hard work ahead and ensure they stay true to your mission. It is critical for advocates to understand and convey that successful advocacy results in systemic change to benefit children and families, their community, and potentially their institution or practice, including new or expanded funding.
Better meeting an organization's needs with existing resources: By focusing on three key areas — increased relationship building with elected officials and partner advocates, enhancing communication (including with media), and aligning existing resources – leaders can strengthen existing infrastructure and provide more focus on desired activities and outcomes. To achieve success in these areas, it is useful to think about who potential champions are and/or who is likely to be influential in achieving their goals work to better understand their priorities and how they may align with the advocate's vision for change. Sometimes relatively minor adjustments within an organization can have a large impact.
Creating new opportunities: The cultivation of supplemental funding sources can provide opportunities for innovation and be an important lever for achieving buy-in and leveraging additional institutional support. Some funding opportunities may be solely focused on health advocacy and/or community engagement, but it is also useful to look for opportunities to partner with others and enhance their work.

### The influence of academic projects on the professional socialization of family medicine faculty [^111V1JBf]. Family Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Successful academic physicians acquire and maintain productive colleague relationships, understand unwritten rules of academe, and effectively manage their careers. Developing these professional socialization skills are goals of some faculty development programs (FDPs), but there is scant evidence about whether such programs are effective.

Methods

A nationwide retrospective, cross-sectional written survey was conducted in two phases: (1) FDP directors who received US Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration support between 1994 and 1997 described program activities and provided enrollee rosters and (2) enrollees reported socialization and colleague outcomes. Instruments were developed, pilot tested, and administered for this study. Analysis utilized descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and ANOVA.

Results

Of 52 eligible directors, 37 (71%) provided FDP activity details and rosters. Of 543 eligible enrollees, 351 (65%) returned surveys. A key result of factor analysis was a seven-item scale related to academic project activities. FDPs with greater emphasis on these activities were associated with enrollees reporting higher levels of colleague relationships and professional socialization skills.

Conclusion

This study's factor analysis indicates that certain FDP project activities are positively associated with enrollees' professional socialization outcomes.

### Evaluating academic mentorship programs in low-and middle-income country institutions: proposed framework and metrics [^116BoryT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Career guidance.

Mentors play an important role in their mentees' career trajectory, including guidance and support for professional development and career planning. Evaluating success for such activities can be challenging, but we envision two possible approaches. A mentor's level of engagement can be an important metric for this domain. This may be measured subjectively via mentee satisfaction surveys (see above) or objectively via specific process indicators (i.e. mentoring outputs required by the institution or program). Instruments such as individualized development plans (IDPs) can play an important role. Most IDPs require that the mentee articulate concrete goals and expected accomplishments over a 3- to 5-year time horizon. The development and joint monitoring of an IDP facilitates discussions about career planning between mentor and mentee; it also serves as an important foundation for self-reflection. External audits of the IDP process, including the tracking of key career milestones according to planned timelines, can further enrich the evaluation of mentoring programs.

Career guidance may also be measured by the mentee's downstream career advancement. This may include academic appointments and promotions, awards and recognition, and/or other career milestones. At an individual level, a good mentor helps the mentee identify his/her talents, supports skill development in that area, and focuses professional growth in a way that best leverages this skill set. From an institutional perspective, however, such measures of success may be interpreted more narrowly. For example, a school or department may seek to develop talented faculty along its stated priorities; the institution may further emphasize the promotion and retention of its own internal trainees and faculty. Such considerations must be clearly articulated in mentorship evaluation plans, so that expectations between mentors, mentees, and institutions are properly aligned.

### A randomized controlled trial to improve the success of women assistant professors [^115sqpSZ]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

(1) Professional development of women assistant professor faculty

Prior research on the causal factors in gender disparities has identified academic productivity and work-life integration as two of the key barriers to women's career success. As a result, we designed the professional development level of the intervention to target these two factors affecting career progression. To enhance academic productivity, intervention faculty participated as a cohort in a semester-long, intensive Manuscript Writing Program of eight workshop sessions. Two senior women medical faculty taught evidence-based skills for overcoming common barriers to scholarly productivity combined with peer and senior mentoring. To develop skills related to managing work and life demands, the cohort of intervention faculty also participated in the nationally recognized Total Leadership Program. The Total Leadership Program consisted of four seminars with intensive activities between sessions, including experiments to improve performance in all spheres of life — work, home, community, and self — by finding mutual value among them through engagement with key stakeholders, reflection, and coaching. In the second and third years of the trial, supplemental professional development sessions were held to maintain peer support, offer additional mentoring, and promote ongoing skill development. Attendance at all faculty development sessions was tracked.

(2) Department/division faculty task force initiatives

Within each of the 13 intervention departments/divisions, the respective chair or chief each appointed a faculty member to chair their task force and also selected a group of associate and full professor men and women faculty members to serve on the task force. Each task force was charged with creating and implementing a specific department/division initiative to improve their local environment for women's career success. Through 6 months of intensive strategic planning meetings with a recruited outside facilitator with expertise in leadership and innovation in healthcare, each task force designed an initiative and developed metrics of success. In the subsequent 2 years, the initiatives were implemented and evaluated. Progress and challenges were discussed in annual summits to which members of the 13 intervention task forces, respective chairs and chiefs, the School of Medicine Dean, and senior leadership were invited to attend. In the final summit of February 2013, all faculty in the intervention arm were encouraged to attend as each task force presented their accomplishments and discussed future goals. Examples of task force initiatives include the implementation of home reading work stations in the Department of Radiology, an overhaul of on-call scheduling for junior faculty in a pediatric division, and a grant development initiative in a basic science department that included a mock study section for grant review.

### Succeeding as a clinician educator: useful tips and resources [^111WYbkv]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinician Educators (CEs) play an essential role in the education and patient care missions of academic medical centers. Despite their crucial role, academic advancement is slower for CEs than for other faculty. Increased clinical productivity demands and financial stressors at academic medical centers add to the existing challenges faced by CEs. This perspective seeks to provide a framework for junior CEs to consider with the goal of maximizing their chance of academic success. We discuss six action areas that we consider central to flourishing at academic medical centers: 1. Clarify what success means and define goals; 2. Seek mentorship and be a responsible mentee; 3. Develop a niche and engage in relevant professional development; 4. Network; 5. Transform educational activities into scholarship; and 6. Seek funding and other resources.

### Successes, lessons and opportunities: 15-year follow-up of an integrated evidence-based medicine curriculum [^113LvmZX]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Moving forward

Recently experts in evidence appraisal published the 21st chapter of the GRADE guidelines — tools intended to assist with the assessment of results and certainty of evidence. S31 The need for multiple publications suggests that evidence appraisal has become increasingly complex, and in many ways a moving target. Based on 15 years experience with EBM education, we would advocate for familiarity with, not mastery of evidence appraisal skills in an EBP curriculum for primary care. Even if one were familiar with basic evidence appraisal skills, there are numerous other factors to consider that require further time and investigation (eg, How does this paper fit with others on the topic? How many other trials were registered but not published?) In our personal experience, comprehensive and timely appraisal of health information requires years of regular practice. Thus, we continue to encourage our learners to learn basics of EBM and health literacy, but strongly advocate the use of prefiltered evidence summaries (ideally written by experienced authors without financial conflicts of interest) to answer daily clinical questions.

Over the past 15 years, we have seen a gradual evolution from 'point of care' tools to 'shared informed decision-making'. S32 Improving learner familiarity with shared decision-making tools is essential in moving medicine to a more inclusive decision-making setting. Our team, along with numerous other groups, has developed tools to assist with shared decision-making in clinical practice. S33–37 Increasing learner familiarity with these resources may be an opportunity to improve translation of evidence into practice and we are working to incorporate these as examples of practical evidence application into our curriculum. For example, we are incorporating these more and more into the 1-hour journal club to allow for discussion around their practical implementation into practice.

In order to engage faculty, we continue to grow our annual medical education conference on evidence-based practice for both community and academic clinicians. This medical education event is organised outside of the university setting and is designed to promote EBP and build enthusiasm for teaching and incorporation of EBP into daily practice.

In summary, the current curriculum (table 1) is a result of modifications in response to ongoing feedback and best evidence. The originally stated goals of the EBP curriculum remain relevant, encouraging familiarity of with basic EBM concepts yet emphasising the use of preappraised evidence summaries. Fifteen years later, we would add a third goal — to train residents to optimise patient-oriented outcomes in the context of shared decision-making and individual patient preferences and values.

### Using social media for patient care, research, and professional development: a north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper [^113ekDFd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

The advent of social media has changed numerous aspects of modern life, with users developing and maintaining personal and professional relationships, following and sharing breaking news and importantly, searching for and disseminating health information and medical research. In the present paper, we reviewed available literature to outline the potential uses, pitfalls and impacts of social media for providers, scientists and institutions involved in digestive health in the domains of patient care, research and professional development. We recommend that these groups become more active participants on social media platforms to combat misinformation, advocate for patients, and curate and disseminate valuable research and educational materials. We also recommend that societies such as NASPGHAN assist its members in accessing training on effective social media use and the creation and maintenance of public-facing profiles and that academic institutions incorporate substantive social media contributions into academic promotion processes.

### Engagement strategies that foster community self-determination in participatory research: insider ownership through outsider championship [^115s13Zo]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In order to maximize the benefits of community-based participatory research, effective ownership over the research process must be at least equally in the hands of the community. A previous social network analysis documented that the participatory research process shifted ownership from academic to community partners, but did not show what actions and strategies fostered this shift.

Objectives

This study follows the trajectory of a community-academic partnership and asks, from the perspective of the project stakeholders, which actions and strategies over the lifespan of the research led to the observed shift in ownership and decision-making from the original external academics to the community stakeholders?

Methods

Qualitative description using inductive thematic analysis. One academic and five community stakeholders identified as central in a previous social network analysis, participated in retrospective, semi-structured interviews.

Results

Actions deemed to have fostered the observed shift in ownership included: existence of a strong champion; stimulating 'outside' ideas; emergence of core people; alignment of project goals with stakeholders' professional roles; involving the right people; personal qualities of the champion; trust-building; and active use of participatory engagement strategies.

Conclusion

Although communities must take ownership over the research process to assure sustained action and change, a strong, trusted and accepted outside champion who actively enacts participatory engagement strategies can facilitate the participatory process and provide community stakeholders the time and support they need to achieve meaningful and sustained leadership roles. These findings have implications for how partnership research is designed and implemented, both in community and in clinical organisational settings.

### Pediatric advocacy: advancement in academic institutions [^1152kvH5]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Department role to increase value of advocacy

Pediatric departments can advance advocacy activities through alignment, training, and creating innovative funding opportunities and leadership positions. First, strategic planning should focus on aligning faculty advocacy endeavors with hospital and department missions. The use of shared language in the hospital community benefit report as well as annual Chair reports, allows for alignment between faculty efforts within larger missions, making a clearer case for investment in the work. Second, formal assistance is necessary as many faculty lack curricular training, mentorship, or protected time to engage in advocacy work. AMCs should provide faculty training and resources through professional development curricula, mentorship programs, and internal grant-funded opportunities. Investing in structural support for faculty advocacy activities will lead to sustainable advocacy. Third, once the framework and opportunities are established, advocacy efforts must also be aligned with not only traditional academic values but also traditional academic structures. This includes the development of leadership positions such as Vice Chairs and department advocacy leaders, which when complemented with a scholarly approach to the work, is inclusive of a pathway forward to promotion. Finally, departments can support the translation of advocacy work into faculty academic promotion using an advocacy portfolio (AP). Modeled after the success of the educator's portfolio, the AP can provide a clear roadmap by incorporating advocacy work into the promotion domains of scholarship/research, education, and service/clinical.

One example involves Duke University School of Medicine Appointments, Promotion and Tenure that, in 2020, debuted a new framework for promotion at the faculty, department, and institutional level that values the traditional areas of primary focus (research, clinical, education) while also valuing the many "expressions of scholarship" of faculty that uphold institutional values. They define advocacy scholarship as "scholarly activity that promotes the social, economic, educational, and political changes that ameliorate threats to human health and advance the well-being of people". As with traditional scholarship, work cited is required to highlight proof of excellence and evidence of a scholarly approach. Faculty identify advocacy-specific scholarly areas cited in the AP: advocacy engagement, community outreach, knowledge dissemination, advocacy teaching/mentoring, and advocacy leadership/administration. Additional forms of high-impact advocacy work beyond peer-reviewed manuscripts include co-authorship of policy statements/legislative briefs/consensus statements, legislative testimony, development of public health initiatives that become standard of care, participation in local and regional task forces, and establishment of community partnerships.

### Charter to establish clinical exercise physiology as a recognised allied health profession in the UK: a call to action [^111imQwm]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

As part of its regulatory role, university course accreditation is a core function of ESSA, which it delegates to the ESSA Accreditation Council. The Accreditation Council oversees accreditation policies and the appointment of course accreditation reviewers. Accreditation reviewers include experienced academics and accomplished practitioners, and they work in small teams of three to four members when carrying out a university programme review. Programmes may be accredited in exercise science (BSc), clinical exercise physiology (MSc) or both. In applying for accreditation, university programmes are required to map their curricula against the exercise science and clinical exercise physiology standards, and in doing so must demonstrate evidence of student attainment of each standard through learning and assessment activities. University programmes are also assessed on their level of resourcing, including the number and level of academic staff and their alignment with the fundamental domains of exercise science, support staff, facilities including laboratories and access to equipment. As the practicum programme forms an essential part of training and accreditation, university programmes are also assessed on their capacity to deliver supervised training opportunities that are aligned with the scope of practice across a broad range of professional placements. University programmes must demonstrate that the practicum programme is integrated into the programme curriculum, and that processes are in place to support placement supervisors and maintain the quality of the training and assessment activities undertaken. The university programme accreditation process is outlined in the accreditation guide.

ESSA was founded in 1991 by a group of academics from prominent Australian Universities who recognised the potential of exercise to promote health. The academic community developed a roadmap that worked towards the common goal of securing recognition. Key elements were establishing (1) the scientific evidence base; (2) an accreditation pathway; (3) professional development and (4) continued education. The relevance and growth of exercise for health rapidly accelerated after recognition in 2005 by the Minister of Health in the Australian Federal Parliament that exercise specialists should play an important role in the public healthcare system of Australia (Medicare). This 'Medicare Moment' allowed trained and AEPs to join the allied health workforce and to bill Medicare for various services related to exercise testing and prescription in specific patient groups. Consequently, AEPs in Australia have become a vital professional 'cog' in the delivery of effective interventions to promote healthy ageing and as part of the prevention and management of chronic and complex diseases.

### Transitioning from training to breast imaging practice: building an academic career [^112cfzwo]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Launching an academic career in breast imaging presents both challenges and opportunities for the newly graduated trainee. A strategic plan aligned with one's personal strengths and interests facilitates career success and professional satisfaction. Academic departments offer multiple tracks to accommodate diverse faculty goals. The specific requirements of various tracks vary across institutions. The clinician-educator track typically encourages a focus on medical education and educational scholarship. The clinician-investigator or clinician-scholar track supports original research and grant-funded clinical trials. Finally, the clinical and clinician-administrator tracks allow for emphasis on clinical program development and leadership. As definitions of scholarship broaden, many opportunities are accessible to demonstrate excellence in the traditional areas of clinical practice, education, and research, as well as the broader fields of leadership and administration. Departmental and national society resources that advance knowledge in one's chosen area of interest are available and should be explored. Mentorship and sponsorship can provide valuable insight into identifying such resources and devising a plan for sustainable career success and work-life integration.

### Academic anaesthesiology: a global perspective on training, support, and future development of early career researchers [^1151nfnR]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- The challenges facing early career academic anaesthesiologists are similar in most well-resourced countries.
- These include long training pathways, variable salary support to provide protected time for academic work, and poor long-term research funding opportunities.
- A focus on mentoring, sponsorship, and diversity is critical to sustaining academic anaesthesiology in the face of overwhelming clinical demands, and to ensure the necessary human capital for innovation and discovery in advancing the specialty to improve patient care.

Anaesthesiology and its related specialities (perioperative, critical care, and pain medicine) have a long history of bold investigations, breakthrough discoveries, and interdisciplinary leadership. Over the last century, academic anaesthesiologists have laid the educational and organisational foundations to establish anaesthesiology as an independent speciality attracting talented individuals. Although recruitment and development of prospective investigators, educators, and administrators are integral to the speciality's future growth and sustainability, numerous challenges and barriers remain. As a global community, we are responsible for providing a fertile ground for future leaders in anaesthesiology. All authors of this paper are early-career anaesthesiologist researchers, primarily British Journal of Anaesthesia Editorial Fellows, and thus well situated to reflect on the current state of academic anaesthesiology and provide perspectives on optimal investigator training and support worldwide.

Careers in academic anaesthesiology are heterogeneous. Although research, teaching, and administration constitute the core of academic anaesthesiology, the proportion of time dedicated to these activities varies across countries, regions, and institutions. Broadly speaking, academic anaesthesiologists are clinicians whose expertise and efforts contribute to the development and expansion of the speciality beyond the provision of routine medical care. Depending on the setting and individual career goals, the focus of an academic anaesthesiologist may be a combination of investigator- or industry-initiated scientific research, supervision of clinical and research training, development of quality improvement programmes, institutional leadership, and policymaking. Achieving eventual success in academia requires the willingness to persevere through setbacks and rejection, which is best fostered through lifelong mentorship and sponsorship. Despite recent initiatives from professional societies and various stakeholders to recognise and develop structured support for academic career development, the road to academic success can appear to be a journey into the unknown, with large differences prevailing between geographic regions (see Table 1). Here, we compare typical academic career paths across selected geographic regions and discuss barriers and opportunities faced by early-career academic anaesthesiologists.

### Policy options to address the effectiveness of health service management graduates in solving Iranian health system challenges: a mixed scoping review and policy Delphi approach [^1127YEvL]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Healthcare management graduates' education can be improved through academic methods like training and capacity-building. Workplace expertise and resilience are crucial for healthcare sector change agents. In China, inadequate formal and informal management training for hospital managers is highlighted. Comprehensive, tailored approaches are needed to address competency requirements. Aligning educational programs with organizational values and advocating for specialized post-graduate programs for healthcare leaders are also suggested. Education should align with an organization's objectives and plans, emphasizing the identification and communication of company values and goals to both managers and employees. This alignment process should begin early and persist throughout an employee's career. Trainees can derive greater value from integrating organizational strategy into training, as they observe its immediate relevance to the organization. Graber's research on healthcare management and education explores top educational programs for future healthcare leaders, including specialized Master of Science (MS) in Organizational Leadership and MS in Health Care Management with entrepreneurship emphasis. The study presents a unique framework for healthcare management training that integrates cultural principles and value systems from educational institutions and national health infrastructure. It emphasizes the importance of ongoing training and capacity building within graduate programs to adapt to evolving industry needs.

In line with the second policy option, the development of a framework for EPAs in healthcare management education is crucial, as it can provide a clear structure for the assessment and progression of students' professional activities. Datta emphasizes the importance of EPAs in medical education, specifically highlighting the need for a portfolio framework to document them. Cateand Laufurther support this, providing examples of EPA-based curricula in medical and nursing education, respectively. These studies collectively emphasize the importance of a framework for EPAs in healthcare management education, but they do not delve into its practical implications for skill development or patient outcomes. In their respective works, Yang, Fortin, Khodayari-Zarnaq, Robbins, and Calhounhave significantly contributed to understanding the specific competencies required by graduates pursuing careers in healthcare management. Their research has illuminated key domains such as leadership, communication proficiency, business acumen, and technology application, underscoring how these competencies contribute to clinical practice effectiveness through real-world examples. The intricacies highlighted offer insights into the challenges involved that go beyond what current literature addresses. These studies collectively emphasize the importance of the EPA framework in influencing the expertise and understanding of graduates majoring in healthcare management.

### Essential components of cancer education [^113MGmeQ]. Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

Modern cancer therapy/care involves the integration of basic, clinical, and population-based research professionals using state-of-the-art science to achieve the best possible patient outcomes. A well-integrated team of basic, clinical, and population science professionals and educators working with a fully engaged group of creative junior investigators and trainees provides a structure to achieve these common goals. To this end, the structure provided by cancer-focused educational programs can create the integrated culture of academic medicine needed to reduce the burden of cancer on society. This summary outlines fundamental principles and potential best practice strategies for the development of integrated educational programs directed at achieving a work force of professionals that broadly appreciate the principals of academic medicine spanning the breadth of knowledge necessary to advance the goal of improving the current practice of cancer care medicine.

### Minimizing low-value, uncompensated work in academic infectious diseases: a 6-step program [^113pKsMu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Uncompensated work in academic infectious diseases (ID) may be high value (eg, important for academic promotion or necessary for advancement to leadership roles) or low value (eg, not aligning with or contributing to professional goals and aspirations). "Curbside" consultations, participation in hospital committees outside of professional interests, and other "citizenship" tasks are common examples of threats to our valuable time as ID providers. Herein, we define the scope of the problem of low-value uncompensated work in academic ID and outline a 6-step program to minimize these threats. Collaboration with professional sponsors, such as division chiefs, to align individual and team goals and use of a "value-versus-compensation" matrix to prioritize activities may help us establish our own agendas and reclaim our professional autonomy.

### The NIH stage model for behavioral interventions in aging: development, maturation, impact, and opportunities for advancement [^115KrqCu]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) Stage Model provides a systematic framework for advancing behavioral intervention science. It uniquely bridges basic research with the development and dissemination of interventions that are scientifically rigorous and scalable. This manuscript examines the evolution and key features of the NIH Stage Model, its incorporation of iterative and mechanism-focused methodologies, and its impact on behavioral science, particularly in aging research. We provide examples of how the model's flexibility, iterative design, focus on mechanisms of behavior change, and emphasis on scalability are significantly influencing intervention development in aging. We describe how the National Institute of Aging (NIA) Edward R. Roybal Centers for Translational Research in the Behavioral and Social Sciences of Aging have become engines of intervention development and testing according to the NIH Stage Model by funding behavioral trials across the NIH Stage Model while simultaneously supporting the development of training opportunities and scientific networks immersed in this approach. We conclude with a discussion of strategies, fully aligned and compatible with the NIH Stage Model, to further achieve the model's ultimate goal: the swift translation of interventions, including aging interventions, into clinical, community, home, or other "real-world" settings to benefit those that need them.

### Professional practice guidelines for integrating the role of work and career into psychological practice [^117KM3v6]. APA (2017). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for Integrating the Role of Work and Career Into Professional Psychology Practice — psychologists may help adolescents, as well as adults, to explore life goals, personal strengths and weaknesses, family expectations, potential barriers, and goal setting related to work. Tasks for adolescents could include community service, job shadowing, co-ops, extern- and internships, and summer jobs as well as formal assessments related to interests, values, and personality. Psychologists who are helping adult clients with work-related issues are encouraged to consider the client holistically rather than focusing exclusively on vocational development, and recognize the interplay of work and non-work roles. As noted in Guideline 6, economic factors have significantly changed individuals' career and work security and clients will often have to make a series of career decisions across the lifespan, some of which are significantly influenced by external factors. Guideline # 4: Psychologists strive to understand how cultural, individual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender, gender identity, geographic location, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and language, may influence the pursuit and experience of work. Psychologists may also use biographies, exemplars in novels, jobs in the community, extracurricular activities, and school service projects as means of enhancing adolescents' vocational knowledge.

### Developing a professional identity as a change agent early in medical school: the students' voice [^1146wEbL]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

As health systems are adapting to increased accountability for quality outcomes, population health, and collaborative care, medical schools are adapting curricula to better prepare physicians to function in health systems. Two components of this educational transformation are (1) increasing physician competence in Health Systems Science, including quality, population health, social determinants of health, and interprofessional collaboration, and (2) providing roles for students to act as change agents while adding value to the health system. The authors, three medical students who served as patient navigators during their first year of medical school, provide perspectives regarding their clinical systems learning roles, which spanned the levels of individual patients, clinic operations, and the health system. Specifically, authors describe working with a struggling patient, developing an intake assessment tool to aid clinical operations, and creating a directory of community-based resources. Authors discuss educational benefits, including understanding social determinants of health, barriers to care, and inefficiencies within the healthcare system. Several challenges are explored, including the importance of student initiative and concerns about traditional curricular outcomes. Through early experiences, students describe developing a professional identity as a change agent, while also learning key competencies required for clinical practice.

### Identifying and prioritising the key components of a quality improvement network for allied health professionals and psychological therapists: a group concept mapping project [^114bH51G]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Rising demands for efficiency and effectiveness coupled with increasingly limited resources are placing UK healthcare systems under significant and sustained pressure. Quality improvement (QI) is 'the combined and unceasing efforts of everyone — healthcare professionals, patients and their families, researchers, payers, planners and educators — to make the changes that will lead to better patient outcomes (health), better system performance (care) and better professional development (learning)'. For this to happen systematically, a substantial proportion of the healthcare workforce must be committed to learning and changing as well as capable of implementing, and sometimes leading, improvement work in a clinical setting. Enthusiasm for QI continues to gather momentum, with improvement approaches, methods and tools forming a core component of many undergraduate and postgraduate training programmes. However, the complexities of modern healthcare continue to create gaps in our ability to consistently deliver the most effective and efficient care for our patientsand QI activities often fail to achieve widespread uptake, despite robust evidence of their benefits.

Recently, there has been increasing awareness that healthcare systems need to adopt the science and practice of QI more systematically. Drawing on knowledge from a wide range of disciplines and sectors, improvement science is an applied field of study focusing on theories, methods and approaches that facilitate or hinder efforts to improve quality, and the scientific study of these complex social interventions in the specific contexts where they occur. Improvement science provides clinicians with theoretical frameworks and technical skills to study systems, understand variation, build learning, and determine the best evidence-based interventions and implementation strategies to deliver safe and effective patient care. However, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of QI approachesand healthcare organisations continue to struggle with the adaptive side of change, which relates to unleashing the power of people and their motivations to advance and sustain improvement work at scale.

### Guidelines for prevention in psychology [^115MNWHi]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline 8 — Psychologists are encouraged to engage in systemic and institutional change interventions that strengthen the health of individuals, families, and communities and prevent psychological and physical distress and disability. The rationale notes that systemic preventive interventions include those that affect families, schools, communities, and work environments, and that individuals may not be able to achieve maximum health or full social participation if systemic barriers, such as classism, racism, sexism, and poverty, prevail. It adds that prevention programs that focus only on changing individuals are likely to be less effective than those that also address the contexts that support or inhibit development and optimal health, with evidence that programs developing community norms promoting healthy lifestyles are effective in reducing risk behavior problems. Application guidance states that psychologists are encouraged to engage in activities that produce systemic, institutional, and organizational change, contributing to systemic change that strengthens protective and resiliency factors across families, schools, workplaces, faith communities, community centers, and health care centers; examples include organizational psychologists helping develop corporate policies to reduce work stress and stress-related illnesses and to increase worker satisfaction and productivity, and school-based programs that have yielded positive results and enhanced students' emotional, social, and academic development.

### Defining the acute care surgeon: American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) panel discussion on full-time employment, compensation and career trajectory [^116y8ied]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-clinical work

Once reasonable work hours and clinical responsibility have been outlined, non-clinical work must be factored in. While clinical work of a physician can be objectively captured (although imperfectly) with the wRVU, a similar approach can be taken for non-clinical work to capture the effort, expertise and time required. Non-clinical work typically falls into one of several categories and is not limited to academic/university-affiliated hospitals: administrative, education, research, global health, community outreach, innovation and advocacy, table 1. Like clinical productivity, non-clinical goals of the division and individuals must be defined, measurable and transparent. However, these non-clinical goals, outside of specific items such as grant funding, are not inherently tied to compensation and may distract surgeons from generating wRVUs. That said, non-clinical work is critical to accreditation, Division/Departmental academic success, personal and professional growth and overall career satisfaction.

Table 1
Examples of non-clinical work performed by acute care surgeons

With proper stakeholder alignment, an academic RVU may help incentivize and reward important non-clinical work in an objective manner. Prior studies within and outside of surgery have established potential frameworks to shape non-clinical or academic RVUs. An important step in creating this system is engaging leadership to develop non-clinical RVUs that support the mission of the enterprise's mission, which may range include traditional academic pursuits (ie, research, innovation and education) to more recently emphasized areas of injury/illness prevention, community partnerships, global health and advocacy, table 1.

The final step involves funding and outlining financial compensation. Again, this should be a decision for local leadership, ideally using an annual iterative process and that refines institution and faculty goals and measures outcomes achieved through non-clinical RVU implementation. Metrics may include number of publications, grant applications/awards, patents received, education achievements, administrative quality improvement efforts and legislation passed. This approach can promote diversity in surgeon phenotypes and thereby diversity of faculty by not only rewarding traditional phenotypes (eg, the researcher). Finally, studies on implementation of non-clinical RVUs have demonstrated great satisfaction without significant financial investments as faculty 'feel seen' and appreciate 'even a small recognition' for the immense non-clinical work they routinely perform.

### Mentorship in academic surgery: revisiting the essence of faculty development [^111R4M8o]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Mentorship is one essential element of faculty development that is traditionally described as a relationship between a senior individual who serves as the mentor for a mentee who is a less experienced individual. Permitting the mentee to select the mentor as a form of informal pairing; providing structured training for mentors and mentees; conducting frequent, in-person sessions; and financially and academically recognizing the mentoring activities will be of mutual benefit to mentors and mentees alike, and beneficial to the organization that the mentors and mentees serve. Mentorship represents a discipline distinct from coaching and sponsorship. Mentoring is an intense, holistic, and long-term professional relationship that transforms the mentor and mentee, as well as the organization in which the interaction occurs. Coaching is a focused, short- or long-term professional interaction that is directed at specific goals and objectives that are established by the coachee. Sponsoring represents active support by the sponsor with significant influence and access to resources and who is advocating for the career advancement of the sponsee. All three exercises are of known value to permit academic development and academic advancement in faculty development constructs.

### Milestones as a guide for academic career development [^114jyGDz]. Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Faced with a limited supply of applicants for faculty positions, increasing demands for residency faculty, and a growing number of programs, our program has increasingly filled ranks with recent residency graduates with broad scope but limited experience and training in academics. These early-career clinicians often require further mentorship as they seek advancement in clinical skills and development of teaching and scholarly activity skill sets.

Methods

To educate our recent residency graduates in teaching/scholarly activity skills, and to provide a career trajectory, we created a process to guide their maturation with milestones using the six core competencies from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. The milestones consist of four levels of clinician/academician maturation. Each competence has goals and activities for each level of development. We validated the milestones using our physician faculty assessing time spent in academic medicine and academic rank.

Results

Faculty of higher academic rank scored higher in all competencies than faculty of lower academic rank. Correlation between systems-based practice and years in academics demonstrated statistical significance, and all other categories showed nonsignificant associations.

Conclusions

The milestones are consistent with faculty academic development and career progression, and may serve as a guide for career advancement and as a guideline for professional progression for residency clinicians. Further testing for validation in other family medicine programs is necessary, but preliminary findings indicate this milestone project may be of service to our profession.

### Academic hospitalists' views on promotion through the lens of professional identity [^115ka8Ru]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Academic promotions are based on assessments of faculty members' contributions to academic medical centers' missions. Promotions ideally motivate excellence, provide a path for advancement, and signal an institution's priorities. Academic internal medicine hospitalists lag behind other fields in promotions.

Objectives

This study sought to characterize academic hospitalists' experiences of academic promotions, their motivations for pursuing promotion, and the currency for promotion that aligns with their professional identities-how hospitalists see themselves, including their knowledge, skills, values, and activities.

Methods

As part of a broader qualitative study of professional identity development, 31 academic hospitalists with < 1 to > 20 years' experience at three academic centers participated in focus groups. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results

Five themes were identified: (1) variable clarity of the academic promotions process, (2) anticipated opportunities and validation as motivations for pursuing promotion, (3) variable alignment between hospitalists' professional identity and institutional values (e.g., limited attention to quality of educators' teaching), (4) impact on well-being, and (5) proposed currency for promotion aligned with hospitalists' multifaceted identities both within and outside the context of patient care.

Conclusions

While many academic internal medicine hospitalists recognize the potential value of academic promotions, the perceived alignment between institutional values, as reflected in the currency for promotion, and their own professional identities shapes their motivation to pursue promotion. Opportunities to narrow the gap in promotions include implementing early career mentorship to navigate the process and developing or highlighting existing currency for promotions that align with their professional identities.

### Use of social media in health care-opportunities, challenges, and ethical considerations: a position statement of the American Academy of Neurology [^114pqKCX]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Social media — information exchange, distribution, and networking in the medical profession emphasizes that social media enables professional connection and networking and that joining Twitter accelerates professional development and uncovers opportunities that otherwise would have been difficult to access. It notes participation in social media is helpful for amplifying the impact of one's work and providing new opportunities for academic scholarship and that social media provides access to unparalleled professional development opportunities. The page cautions that all of these opportunities require careful forethought and crafting and that simply signing up and using a given platform will not lead to success. It advises that an essential first step for an individual or an organization is to establish clear goals for use of social media — setting the direction for a social media plan, defining priorities, and ensuring conveyance of intended messages, and specifies that for clinicians and health care organizations, improving the health of patients and the broader community should be the foremost goals in any social media plan, taking precedence over personal and economic goals, as required by the ethical principles of beneficence and justice.

### Which factors influence the transition towards a healthy and sustainable food environment in Dutch hospitals? A qualitative view from stakeholders [^1166pdjj]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Momentum for change

Some participants mentioned that there was increased attention and awareness for prevention and a healthy lifestyle in society in general. This created momentum for change to healthier and more sustainable food environments in their hospital and enhanced the awareness among the entire population. Additionally, a few participants mentioned that recent experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced this momentum for a healthier environment. However, these participants indicated at the same time that the COVID-19 pandemic had delayed the realization of a healthy and sustainable food environment in hospitals, for example, because of staff shortages and a deteriorated financial situation of caterers and suppliers, causing less emphasis on development and innovation of healthy and sustainable food products. Yet, a shift towards a healthier environment is still needed, emphasized by a healthcare professional: " Before a hospital truly embraces nutrition, prevention, health promotion, that requires a significant shift, especially if you always focused solely on illness. " P21, healthcare professional/project coordinator.

Government-established policies and guidelines

As a helpful guidance in achieving a healthy and sustainable food environment, participants often mentioned that the clear goals and targets set by the National Prevention Agreement provided them the urgency to change: " And we just have to achieve that goal, because we signed the [NPA] agreement. " P2, facility professional. In addition, many participants indicated that the tools and guidelines of the National Nutrition Centre with respect to healthy and sustainable diets and food environments are supportive in achieving this goal. However, a participant also illustrated: "… hospital patients often require more protein and energy, more frequent eating moments, and sometimes more compact foods with higher energy density. As a result, it may not always fully align with the [Dutch] Dietary Guidelines. " P8, healthcare professional.

Collaboration and networks outside the hospital

All three participating hospitals were located near a university that facilitated collaborations with academics and provided them with knowledge and skills that supported the transition towards a healthy and sustainable food environment. Furthermore, all three hospitals acknowledged that the national learning network of hospitals set up by the TEH program of the Nutrition and Healthcare Alliance supported them in various ways, such as sharing best practices, learning from each other, and benchmarking their performance against other hospitals, as illustrated by: " What we have particularly benefited from is the motivation it [the TEH network] gave and the contacts with other hospitals that emerged there. So doing it together with [hospitals] in the entire country. " P19, healthcare professional.

### Recognizing innovation in academic advancement [^11744Qug]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Intrapreneurship

Intrapreneurship refers to innovation, product development, and process improvement within an organization. Intrapreneurs leverage their deep understanding of institutional structure to advance their organizations, and their impact can be measured by effects seen on health care quality and outcomes, cost savings, patient access, reduction of inequities, patient satisfaction and overall growth. Such contributions should be recognized in the academic advancement process, and metrics of intrapreneurship success can be assessed in the following 5 categories:

- **Product and Process Development**: Clinician innovators leverage their unique patient care perspective and working institutional knowledge to create novel products and processes that enhance all aspects of the care paradigm. Such improvements include information technology and application development, enhancements to the electronic medical record, internal think tanks and steering groups to improve workflow, and a wide variety of quality improvement initiatives. AMCs can decide whether such interventions should be recognized while still in process or only upon completion, with additional consideration for those interventions that have resulted in tangible improvements.
- **Delivery of Care**: Intrapreneurs can develop novel pathways and process frameworks to optimize the use and deployment of clinical resources. Examples may include virtual group patient visits or counseling, establishment of multidisciplinary clinics structured around a specific disease, or optimization of specialty referrals to reduce delays in care. Faculty that pioneer and implement such changes should be given formal recognition for their involvement in such initiatives.
- **Leadership and Mentoring**: Leaders and mentors who foster an organizational growth mentality and empower innovation through their work and in their mentees are crucial for the sustained success of any organization. An intrapreneur's impact here can be measured through the number of their mentees and the productivity and success of those mentees. Institutions should also reward leaders who demonstrate managerial innovation by tracking new programs and initiatives that enhance employee motivation, well-being, problem-solving, and communication.
- **Health Care Economics**: Innovation in revenue generation and provider payments, including value-based care models or quality-based incentives, can lead to higher value of care by limiting the utilization of high-cost, low-value tests and interventions. Individuals who champion such changes should be recognized for their contribution to the institution and the health care landscape.
- **Individual Capacity Development**: Formal training programs are often costly and incur a significant time commitment. However, these programs are a powerful way for clinicians to expand their capacity and develop new perspectives, all of which ultimately benefit their institutions in the long term. Training and certificate programs, such as in artificial intelligence, clinical informatics, and biodesign, and formal education such as Masters degrees, represent an individual's commitment to scholastic and personal growth that should be formally recognized in the academic advancement process.

### Critical care organizations: building and integrating academic programs [^114D2rAC]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Academic medical centers in North America are expanding their missions from the traditional triad of patient care, research, and education to include the broader issue of healthcare delivery improvement. In recent years, integrated Critical Care Organizations have developed within academic centers to better meet the challenges of this broadening mission. The goal of this article was to provide interested administrators and intensivists with the proper resources, lines of communication, and organizational approach to accomplish integration and Critical Care Organization formation effectively.

Design

The Academic Critical Care Organization Building section workgroup of the taskforce established regular monthly conference calls to reach consensus on the development of a toolkit utilizing methods proven to advance the development of their own academic Critical Care Organizations. Relevant medical literature was reviewed by literature search. Materials from federal agencies and other national organizations were accessed through the Internet.

Setting

The Society of Critical Care Medicine convened a taskforce entitled "Academic Leaders in Critical Care Medicine" on February 22, 2016 at the 45th Critical Care Congress using the expertise of successful leaders of advanced governance Critical Care Organizations in North America to develop a toolkit for advancing Critical Care Organizations.

Measurements and Main Results

Key elements of an academic Critical Care Organization are outlined. The vital missions of multidisciplinary patient care, safety, and quality are linked to the research, education, and professional development missions that enhance the value of such organizations. Core features, benefits, barriers, and recommendations for integration of academic programs within Critical Care Organizations are described. Selected readings and resources to successfully implement the recommendations are provided. Communication with medical school and hospital leadership is discussed.

Conclusions

We present the rationale for critical care programs to transition to integrated Critical Care Organizations within academic medical centers and provide recommendations and resources to facilitate this transition and foster Critical Care Organization effectiveness and future success.

### Mentorship in endocrinology training: a cross-sectional study of the United States and Europe [^117HSLC5]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversely, European mentorship emphasises fostering independence, strategic goal-setting, and acknowledging professional contributions — practices congruent with hierarchical academic systems valuing autonomy and collaborative achievement. Here, structured guidance (e.g. goal-setting strategies linked to reduced burnout) and inspirational mentorship dominated outcomes, suggesting mentees prioritise role models who elevate aspirations while providing pragmatic support to navigate rigid career pathways. The stark contrast in mentorship satisfaction drivers — holistic support in the U.S. vs. charismatic leadership in Europe — highlights how regional norms shape expectations. These divergences suggest that effective mentorship must adapt to local academic ecosystems: U.S. models integrate personal and professional development, while European success hinges on balancing inspirational leadership with methodical guidance.

Cultivating mentor competencies — such as active listening, trust-building, and work-life balance advocacy — should underpin training programmes, as these attributes were strongly linked to reduced burnout and career satisfaction in both cohorts. For Europe, integrating U.S.-inspired cultural competency initiatives could address gaps in accommodating gender and cultural differences, while U.S. programmes could formalise training to scale these strengths system-wide. Leveraging regional strengths is equally critical: U.S. institutions should expand mentor databases to preserve trainee autonomy in self-selecting relationships, while Europe could mitigate faculty shortages through cross-institutional networks, such as partnerships with local, national, regional, and international scientific societies, to pool mentorship resources and align with its collaborative training ethos. Hybrid frameworks combining Europe's frequent interaction schedules with the U.S.'s holistic support — supported by virtual platforms — could bridge engagement gaps. Future longitudinal studies should evaluate these strategies while clarifying causal pathways, ensuring mentorship evolves to meet the dynamic demands of endocrinology.

### Competency-based curricular design to encourage significant learning [^112wLXTg]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2014). Low credibility.

Most significant learning (SL) experiences produce long-lasting learning experiences that meaningfully change the learner's thinking, feeling, and/or behavior. Most significant teaching experiences involve strong connections with the learner and recognition that the learner felt changed by the teaching effort. L. Dee Fink in Creating Significant Learning Experiences: An Integrated Approach to Designing College Course defines six kinds of learning goals: Foundational Knowledge, Application, Integration, Human Dimension, Caring, and Learning to Learn. SL occurs when learning experiences promote interaction between the different kinds of goals, for example, acquiring knowledge alone is not enough, but when paired with a learning experience, such as an effective patient experience as in Caring, then significant (and lasting) learning occurs. To promote SL, backward design principles that start with clearly defined learning goals and the context of the situation of the learner are particularly effective. Emphasis on defining assessment methods prior to developing teaching/learning activities is the key: this ensures that assessment (where the learner should be at the end of the educational activity/process) drives instruction and that assessment and learning/instruction are tightly linked so that assessment measures a defined outcome (competency) of the learner. Employing backward design and the AAMC's MedBiquitous standard vocabulary for medical education can help to ensure that curricular design and redesign efforts effectively enhance educational program quality and efficacy, leading to improved patient care. Such methods can promote successful careers in health care for learners through development of self-directed learning skills and active learning, in ways that help learners become fully committed to lifelong learning and continuous professional development.

### Academic internal medicine hospitalist professional identity development [^112nK9GB]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Academic hospitalists have major roles in medical education, clinical care, and other academic medical center missions. Their professional identity development has implications for vitality, burnout, retention, and patient safety.

Objective

To characterize academic internal medicine hospitalist professional identity and its development.

Methods

Ten focus group interviews were conducted with 31 hospitalists in early-, mid-, and late-career stages at three academic medical centers. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results

Academic hospitalist identity development was characterized by (1) constant core clinician identity, (2) navigating interfaces between different spheres of knowledge, influence, and activity (patients, systems, learners, and multiple medical and psychosocial issues), (3) expanding identities in the "extension zone" outside of patient care, (4) variable and ambiguous academic identity, (5) ongoing negotiation between extrinsic factors (resources, relationships, and validation), intrinsic factors (personal identities and professional values), and identity development, (6) diverse career trajectories, and (7) professional identity driving career decision-making.

Conclusions

In contrast to a "deficit" view of generalists lacking focus on a specific disease or organ system, academic internal medicine hospitalist professional identity encompasses distinct roles and skills. While hospitalists individualize their activities outside the context of patient care, the core clinician identity remains a beacon guiding these activities. Hospitalists' varied and ambiguous concepts of what it means to be academic may contribute to lagging academic progress. Organizations should support hospitalists' unique professional identities, seek clarity around what it means to be academic, and foster ongoing professional identity development.

### Mentorship in academic radiology: why it matters [^116bhAKP]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mentorship plays a critical role in the success of academic radiologists. A mentor helps a mentee reach both personal and career goals by functioning as an adviser and role model while providing support and sharing knowledge. Multiple studies have shown that faculty members with mentors have better career opportunities, publish more papers, are more likely to receive research grants, and have greater overall career satisfaction. The benefits of mentorship go both ways: while mentees benefit from professional support, advice, and career-specific skills, mentors receive intellectual and professional stimulation, personal enrichment, and a sense of giving back to their institutions and specialty. Moreover, reverse mentoring, where mentees provide skills and guidance to their mentors, can be beneficial to the mentor, for example in the use of social media, often more familiar to younger mentees. At an institutional level, mentorship offers the opportunity to develop future leaders in clinical care, research, education, and administration, and institutions with successful mentoring programs have better clinical and academic productivity, better retention and academic promotion rates.

While most radiology residency programs have incorporated formal mentoring programs for residents, fewer departments have instituted mentoring programs for junior faculty. Junior or newly hired faculty in academic radiology face specific obstacles including new clinical, educational, and research responsibilities, often paired with personal changes and growing family demands. In addition, the increasing focus on clinical productivity, pressure on turn-around times, and demands on non-interpretive tasks, such as consultations, administration, meetings, and teaching, have led to a high prevalence of "burnout" among radiologists, making mentoring of junior faculty members even more important.

This article reviews the benefits and challenges of mentorship in academic radiology, discusses how to institute a faculty mentoring program, examines different types of mentoring, and reviews challenges related to diversity and inclusion.

### Using social media for patient care, research, and professional development: a north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper [^111W1BcR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) position statement — The abstract states that "we reviewed available literature to outline the potential uses, pitfalls and impacts of social media for providers, scientists and institutions involved in digestive health in the domains of patient care, research and professional development", and makes recommendations: "We recommend that these groups become more active on social media, with content that aims to combat misinformation, advocate for patients, and curate and disseminate valuable research and educational materials" and "We also recommend that societies such as NASPGHAN assist its members in accessing training on effective social media use and the creation and maintenance of public-facing profiles and that academic institutions incorporate substantive social media contributions into academic promotion processes". The disclaimer clarifies that "The NASPGHAN clinical practice guidelines and position papers are evidence-based decision-making tools for managing health conditions", that "This document is not a disease management requirement or rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care", and that such documents "should also not be used in support of medical complaints, legal proceedings, and/or litigation, as they were not designed for this purpose".

### An incentive compensation system that rewards individual and corporate productivity [^116dzvhz]. Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

An economically mature health care market has led to increased cost competition. Subsequently, a perceived need for productivity-based physician compensation has developed. While some institutions have rewarded individual productivity based on specific facets of academic responsibility, such as teaching, research, and patient care, we chose to develop an incentive compensation system that rewards both individual and group productivity.

Program Development

We developed a physician incentive compensation system that rewards individual and group productivity by capturing multiple aspects of work activity. Faculty members are given compensation value points for clinical productivity, scholarship activities, teaching activities, service activities, and achievement of the department's goals. The system was implemented in a graduated fashion in the Department of Family Medicine at Indiana University beginning July 1, 2000.

Program Evaluation

In April 2003, all faculty physicians (n = 18) participated in a survey about the compensation system. The majority of faculty view the system as a necessity for the department (72.2%); 35.2% were satisfied with the system overall; 35.3% were neutral; and 27.4% were dissatisfied or not sure of their overall satisfaction.

Conclusions

A comprehensive physician incentive compensation system incorporating department goals can be designed and implemented in an academic setting.

### Curriculum development: a how to primer [^113BKd9f]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Step 1. Needs assessment/statement

The needs assessment helps us answer 'Why'? In the case of curriculum development, the answer may be quite broad and should point to the distinction between the current teaching strategy surrounding a learning need and what should be changed about it. At the start, it is wise to consider whose needs are the priority. This may start with a learner's needs (either attitudinal and knowledge-based needs, readiness to learn or timing), but likely extends to the patients and communities for whom the learner will be caring. When justifying time or funding, an articulation of how this curriculum might meet regulatory or board requirements can be useful.

The mechanics of a needs assessment includes readily available information and the collection of new information. The acquisition of new information can be structured (survey or medical knowledge assessment), semi-structured (series of discussions or a call to action based on sentinel event), research/data driven (data on learners' performance or clinical quality data) or based on regulatory requirements.

A very basic example (see table 1), experienced by one of the authors was the identification of a gap in knowledge leading to the development of a newly structured educational activity.

Once the needs assessment is finalised, and the needs have been articulated, a rationale statement should be agreed on. This rationale statement is 1–3 lines that articulates the fundamental findings from the needs assessment to guide the development of the curriculum. The rationale statement can then be used to keep the curriculum on task. It is intended to be modified only if there is a serious oversight in the development. In this way, the needs assessment and rationale statement can truly render a solid foundation for the curriculum in development.

Step 2. Determining and prioritising content

This is the first step in beginning to articulate what is going to be included, a general description of the content, along with a prioritisation of that content. In the example of the communication skills curriculum referenced above, the content was determined both by working backwards from the milestone goals and also from reviewing what experts in the field have identified. In some cases, there will not be expert knowledge or milestones to work from, and in these cases, original research might be needed, such as surveys of experts in the field, or analysis of conversation around a difficult topic needing to be addressed. An example of this last strategy can be seen in a recent publication on addressing the topic of racism in medical education (see table 1).

### Going for growth: improvement in the infrastructural and management support for clinical academic research [^117Rdgzw]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Lessons and limitations

The introduction of quality improvement as an approach to capacity building is new and was 'untested' at the start of the process. The use of organisational metrics was introduced part way through the process but aligned well with the key performance indicators that had been established within the directorate. Clinical staff engagement beyond the initial champions was slow to develop as was the academic collaboration with senior professorial leads who were time-limited and initially unconvinced that the ambition could be achieved in a short time scale. Their view of early career researchers, mirrored by the novice clinical academic workforce themselves, was that the ambition had been well conceived but was not manageable within a 12 to 14 month period. This skepticism has been somewhat challenged by the achievement of academic status and the level of achievement in clinical academic activity across professions in the directorate.

Some critical problems remain; that the relatively early career clinical academics require support and guidance in the complex and ever-changing range of opportunities and barriers to developing clinical academic activity. Continuing investment in the PPI and research officer roles has been necessary to achieve the operational plan. In addition, the clinical pressure on staff and managers remains and increases, continuing the tension between investments in research as a quality improvement initiative in medium term with the highly present short term challenge of delivering care and services. Proposed interventions (such as the learning and development events) have not recruited well and it has been difficult to offer specific training in groups.

Professional management have achieved a far greater knowledge and understanding of the opportunities for research to compliment the clinical workforce and workforce flexibility, capacity, and contribution of partners in academic practices has been a tangible benefit and fully costed. Compliance with the research strategy and operational improvements were based on a principle of inclusivity and engagement and this has been thoroughly carried through with an individual response to all clinical researchers and a focus on the voice of the patient in research and a compliance with the INVOLVE principles. A significant limitation of the project as a whole and the metrics adopted by the organisation to measure research outputs is the lack of translational measures that might demonstrate innovation and impact in patient care.

### Organizational savvy: critical to career development in academic medicine [^114FHDSR]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Organizational savvy is critical to career development, but is rarely discussed as a learnable skill. Drawing on > 45 years of working closely with Academic Health Center professionals, the author offers an introduction to navigating organizational dynamics that will be especially valuable to women, as they tend to be less effectively mentored than men; mentors may also find this guide of use in coaching these skills. Common misconceptions that interfere with acquiring organizational savvy include assuming that academic medicine is a meritocracy, that hard work will assure success, and that disagreements are personal. People who learn to navigate competitive hierarchies are continuously expanding their understanding of significant events, of how their unit fits within the larger system, and of which constraints they can influence. Strategies suggested for developing a political compass focus on building relationships, learning from surprises and disappointments, facilitating dialogue with open-ended questions, and handling sensitive topics as they arise. The author opens with a case illustrating common new faculty dilemmas and closes with examples applying the mentioned recommendations. Becoming more organizationally savvy helps professionals advance not only their own careers but also improvements in their institutions.

### Developing a comprehensive approach to youth violence prevention in a small city [^1151tiaN]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A Center for Academic Excellence in Youth Violence Prevention was established in 1999 at Virginia Commonwealth University, in the small city of Richmond, Virginia. The social context of Richmond provides many challenges and assets for preventing youth violence, including high levels of youth exposure to violence and exemplary role models for resiliency. In this paper, the conceptual framework used to guide Center activities is explained first, followed by an accounting of the initial activities for developing a community mobilization process. Next, examples are presented of how the core theme of "Strengthening the Voices of Stakeholders" was implemented at the levels of grassroots/taxpayer, organizations, and systems/policy. A university policy strategy for involving more sectors of the University in community partnerships to prevent youth violence and promote positive early childhood development is then described. The paper closes with an assessment of the mobilization efforts to date and a sketch of new plans for the future.

### Assessing the perceived impact of ESOR training programs on radiologists' professional development [^113B63bk]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Another essential aspect is the interdisciplinary nature of training. In each department, the rich learning environment is fostered by multidisciplinary exchanges. Each tutor is dedicated to a single tutee, ensuring focused guidance while the department's diverse specialties broaden the participant's knowledge and skills. This aligns with the recent findings by the European Society of Radiology, which emphasize the importance of structured, high-quality training programs for radiology residents in Europe, including the development and implementation of entrustable professional activities.

The career trajectories of former participants underscore the long-term benefits of ESOR training programs. A significant proportion of alumni have pursued academic careers, reflecting one of ESOR's primary objectives to enhance academic excellence in radiology. These collaborations offer targeted training opportunities in specific areas of radiology, combining the expertise and resources of multiple organizations to provide comprehensive educational experiences. The program's emphasis on long-term collaboration rather than a one-time experience is evident, as many participants continue to engage in professional relationships and collaborative projects initiated during their fellowships. This aligns with the success of mentoring programs like the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), which emphasizes sustained mentorship and professional growth, particularly for underrepresented groups.

The financial support provided to participants is another key factor in the success of ESOR programs. This funding alleviates the financial burden associated with advanced training and international mobility, making it possible for a wider range of participants to benefit from these opportunities. The financial backing is crucial as it ensures that talented radiologists, regardless of their economic background, can access high-quality training and further their careers. Robust financial support systems are essential for fostering diversity and inclusion in training programs, as seen in various initiatives aimed at addressing workforce diversity.

Robust mentorship, as highlighted by the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), has been linked to enhanced mentee productivity, self-efficacy, and career satisfaction, which are critical to the success of researchers in training. Effective mentorship programs must create a supportive environment with mentors and peers committed to advancing the careers of investigators from traditionally underrepresented groups, addressing the disparities highlighted by studies on NIH funding barriers.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, society for nutrition education and behavior, and school nutrition association: comprehensive nutrition programs and services in schools [^1156VmNk]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

School nutrition education and promotion — effective elements, coverage rates, and integration guidance are as follows: Research evidence indicates that nutrition education is more likely to bring about positive behavior change when it includes the following elements: targets specific behaviors or practices; uses appropriate behavior change strategies to provide relevant knowledge and teach behavior change skills, including self-assessment and goal-setting; delivers coherent and clearly focused curricular linkages to content tied to national and local educational standards; uses active methods, including innovative multimedia technology tools; and devotes adequate time and intensity to result in behavior change. Approximately 75% of wellness policies nationwide addressed teaching behavior-focused skills in 2014, up from 50% in 2006, while only 10% recommended that teachers receive professional development for new nutrition education skills. Consequently, schools and/or districts should adopt evidence-based strategies and techniques in establishing nutrition education goals, develop coherent behavior-focused curricula for all grades using existing resources, and provide adequate funding for professional development and resources. Classroom nutrition education can be included as part of health education, integrated into all core and elective subjects, or provided as standalone curricula for all grade levels, and direct and indirect nutrition education needs to be integrated with high-quality food provided to children through school meals, healthful food choices available throughout the school campus, well-implemented wellness policies, other food- and nutrition-related activities in the school, and reinforcement in the home and community to have lasting impact. Nutrition promotion focuses in particular on evidence-based techniques to market nutritious foods and beverages to students through a comprehensive and multichannel approach and should be encouraged, and it can enhance participation in school meal programs and decrease food waste; adequate funding and technical assistance can help schools use innovative strategies to create a health-promoting school.

### Advancing academic capacity in physical and rehabilitation medicine to strengthen rehabilitation in health systems worldwide: a joint effort by the European academy of rehabilitation medicine, the association of academic physiatrists, and the international society of physical and rehabilitation medicine [^115Hcpwd]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

The Importance of Promoting PRM as a Medical Specialty to Strengthen Rehabilitation in Health Systems Worldwide

Although all health strategies have functioning as the eventual objective, the primary and defining aim of rehabilitation is to optimize functioning. – The complex nature of PRM as a discrete medical specialty, and the challenge that it creates academically, can be addressed more effectively given our understanding of the scope and aim of rehabilitation. This can inform the task of developing and sustaining academic capacity for PRM research and clinical practice and ultimately for academic leadership and career development. As mentioned previously, more than 2.4 billion individuals can potentially benefit from rehabilitation, and these individuals experience a vast range of physical and mental health conditions (permanent or temporary) — as well as the natural reduction of functioning associated with the aging process. From a life-course perspective, in short, everyone is a beneficiary of PRM.

This wide range of beneficiaries and underlying health conditions, however, requires an equally wide range of competencies and skillsets for the PRM physician (also known as physiatrists). Moreover, although discrete, and in that sense specialized, PRM is also an inherently collaborative area of medicine. Physical and rehabilitation medicine physicians work with other medical specialists and adopt techniques usually associated with the promotive, preventive, and even curative health strategies to best serve their patients. Physical and rehabilitation medicine physicians can also contribute to public health by implementing rehabilitation strategies, such as the promotion of exercise, at the level of the population. From the point of view of academics, this feature of PRM presents the challenge: as the essential core competencies of PRM are developed to a professional standard, the invaluable collaborative linkage with other areas of medicine must be forged to create a synergetic unity both in teaching, clinical practice, and research. Furthermore, a strong collaborative association with other rehabilitation professionals creates an important synergy that benefits students, trainees, and patients.

Given the daunting range of health conditions during the course of which rehabilitation services can be beneficial to the well-being of patients, PRM clinical education and training must draw upon a substantial medical knowledge base derived from scholarly activity and scientific research. For its part, PRM research is inherently, not merely multidisciplinary, but interdisciplinary. To secure the collaborative outcome, it draws in results across scientific disciplines — not only biomedical but also biomechanical, and social — and integrates these to create an evidence base that is relevant to the practice of PRM.

### Leveraging neighborhood-scale change for policy and program reform in Buffalo, New York [^111XsMah]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The Healthy Communities Initiative (HCI) affects 8500 employees working in the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and 8925 residents of adjacent neighborhoods, where 37% of people live below the poverty line, and a majority (68.7%) identify themselves as African-American.

Intervention

The HCI partnership, which includes multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary organizations and neighborhood residents, implemented the Active Living by Design community action model with greatest emphasis on achieving policy and planning changes to support active living behaviors.

Results

The master plan of the campus now incorporates active living as a guiding principle. Physical improvements to support walking and bicycling in the target area have been planned and implemented through a $14 million federal transportation grant. The partnership facilitated the creation of a citywide Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Board and the passage and implementation of an ordinance to enhance bicycling infrastructure within the city.

Lessons Learned

Buffalo's experience suggests that to achieve lasting environmental change in the context of a medical campus and its surrounding neighborhoods, it is critical to: (1) engage neighborhood residents from the outset to build social capital; (2) cultivate a diverse partnership; (3) use a comprehensive approach; (4) balance long-term goals with short-term accomplishments; (5) integrate active living concerns within existing policy and planning mandates; and (6) make sustainability a priority.

Conclusions

Environmental changes in the public domain that support active living require collaboration among public, nonprofit, and private sectors; citizen engagement; and the presence of a legal and structural framework provided by government policies and plans to direct future development.

### A consensus statement on the meaning, value and utility of training programme outcomes, with specific reference to anaesthesiology: a consensus statement on training programme outcomes [^111FAVgS]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Certain incontrovertible principles are agreed to as fundamental to a sound decision. These could include the requirement for construct validity and reliability in assessment tools, acknowledgement of the risks or over- and under-assessment, and the risk of generating a "hidden curriculum" causing trainees to work towards a particular form of assessment rather than towards a competency. Then, the available scientific evidence (perhaps linking performance at some form of assessment with subsequent clinical behaviour) and local constraints (perhaps availability of simulation facilities, or a faculty development programme which includes workplace-based assessments) are taken into account. A decision is then made at the appropriate level (in this example: perhaps Programme Director or Clinical Competency Committee) and rationale shared with stakeholders. This might entail explanation of the need to achieve a balance between over and under-assessment of trainees, quality of feedback (and feedback-related learning), investment of time (human capital) and value for money.

Stakeholders and evaluation – collaboration on continuous quality improvement

In general, evaluation is a challenging but essential component to process development and its validation. In the context of training doctors, we examine two branches of evaluation (i) evaluation of the process of collaboration amongst stakeholders and (ii) evaluation of the selection, renewal and achievement of TP outcomes (the latter covered in Section 2).

Conducting ongoing evaluation of inter-organisational collaboration has been reported to offer, at least, the perception of progress and increased faith within stakeholders. Embedding ongoing assessment into the initial organisation and its planning is prudent. In the systems-based approach that we advocate, regulatory bodies play a crucial role in influencing and standardising the quality of TPs, in continuously improving the quality (cQI) of curricula to align with population needs, and in improving learning environments.

A logic model will operate successfully if programme specific data (ideally using continuous data streams) are used together with emerging published evidence. Ultimately, it will seek to align specific TP outcomes (at patient-, trainee- and programme-focused levels) with measures of healthcare quality or patient outcome. The stakeholder collaborative network must retain sight of its ideal goals with awareness of any trade-offs incurred in progressing towards them.

Priority areas in which new knowledge is required to optimise the value of training programme outcomes

Certain elements of a truly system-based approach will require generation of new knowledge through research. In this section, we point to those areas of greatest importance while recognising that valuable work is currently underway in each of them.

### Professional practice guidelines for integrating the role of work and career into psychological practice [^11188AUR]. APA (2017). Medium credibility.

Professional practice guidelines for integrating the role of work and career into psychological practice — research basis and scope are outlined, noting that there are several meta-analyses and reviews that have documented the effectiveness of career counseling and that interventions that involved professional assistance were significantly more effective than counselor-free interventions; the guidelines are based on extant effectiveness studies and provide recommendations for psychological practice, although they are not based on a thorough, systematic review of all relevant literature. The specific goals are to provide psychologists with the rationale and needs for addressing vocational behavior and the meaning of work in professional practice, an introduction to the major issues in understanding vocational behavior and development and the world of work, and specific recommendations for working effectively with work and career issues; they are written specifically for psychologists working with clients or patients and provide guidance for clinical interventions related to work and career, and they are not intended to provide directions for interventions with organizations and industries but rather focus on the clinical aspects of working with individuals.

### Looking back, moving forward-reflecting on a career in psychiatric research [^111dmbpu]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The arc of my career has focused on the integration of clinical care, mentoring, and research, leading to meaningful research questions and intervention trials advancing the field. In this Special Communication, I first offer a brief synopsis of my work as an academic psychiatrist, highlighting mission, themes and publications, sponsors, and collaborators. I then discuss activities as a mentor, focusing on 2 National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded research career development programs. As the past recipient of K01, K02, and K05 awards from the NIMH (1980–2000), I have taken to heart the obligation to pay it forward: to support, advise, instruct, and guide younger colleagues, challenging them academically and professionally. For 20 years, my P30 infrastructure center grant provided a platform for institutional training grants (T32s) and psychiatric research education grants (R25s) to serve as a foundation for training the next generation of clinical scientists in late life mood disorders, as well as a nidus for interdisciplinary collaboration. I have benefitted greatly from having had mentors and wise friends, particularly David Kupfer, MD; Ellen Frank, PhD; and Thomas Detre, MD, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine; colleagues in the Aging Branch of NIMH throughout my 40-year career as a physician scientist; Dilip Jeste, MD, University of California at San Diego; Daniel Blazer, MD, PhD, Duke University School of Medicine; George Alexopoulos, MD, Weill Cornell School of Medicine; John Rush, MD, University of Texas Southwestern School of Medicine; Alan Schatzberg, MD, Stanford University School of Medicine; M. Katherine Shear, MD, Columbia University Schools of Social Work and of Medicine; Helena Kraemer, PhD, Stanford University School of Medicine; and Edmund Ricci, PhD, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. These colleagues are good listeners, flexible, diverse in perspectives, knowledgeable, nonjudgmental, and able to give constructive feedback, network, and help find resources. I have sought to do likewise with many younger colleagues, both men and women, physicians and PhDs, and persons of different professional, racial, and ethnic backgrounds-totaling about 25 K awardees. I conclude with recommendations for future clinical practice and research in late-life depression, describing a broad spectrum of approaches aiming both to reduce its public health burden and to enhance wisdom, resilience, and well-being in later life.

### Going for growth: improvement in the infrastructural and management support for clinical academic research [^113DcEfz]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Baseline measurement

The objective was to combine the tools and techniques of quality improvement with effective organisational and leadership development to achieve research capacity building. The quality improvement methodology draws on a breadth of knowledge and research including technical engineering theories of systems, theories about human relationships and social interactions, and complexity theory. Making organisational change demanded an understanding of complex adaptive systems and an appreciation of the complexity of the ways that structures, processes, and patterns work together as part of a system to generate different outcomes. Commitments to four equally important elements of improvement are a fundamental requirement; to identify drivers for change and also harness known mechanisms to achieve the improvement. Figure 1 identifies how the elements are highly intertwined and interconnected, and improvement to research activity and outcomes is regarded as a challenge to the system and not to individual practitioners and clinicians

(See figure 1).

A project initiation document (PID) was written to identify the method and measures for a second cycle of improvement. This focused on identifying baseline data for research, gaining an inclusive understanding of the research strategy and re-designing research processes. Underpinning the research strategy was a commitment to changing patterns of thinking and behaviours associated with research. We wanted to promote clinical academic conversations, relationships, communication and learning, and decision-making along with recognition of the need to extend the engagement with patients as partners in the research process. This element of genuinely seeking patterns of change is important because the clinical academic role is unfamiliar to many and despite changes to structures and processes to support research, might become a barrier to change.

The project initiation document identified the objective for the second cycle of change and these were agreed by managers and staff and to other key stakeholders.

### A review of COVID-19's impact on radiology residents' academics and wellness in north America [^114WHKx7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions in radiology departments throughout North America. Radiology residency programs were forced to make dramatic changes to their training programs, which had major impacts on resident academics and wellness. The goal of this review is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on radiology residents' academics and wellness in North America, while also identifying effective measures taken by programs to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.

Methods

The search strategy involved database search via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science with specific key words related to COVID-19, radiology residents, education, wellness, and virtual learning. Studies discussing the education and wellness of radiology residents in North America published after 2020 were included. The data were analyzed using a narrative synthesis approach.

Results

The three main domains affected by the pandemic include the residency curriculum, research, and resident wellness. The decline in case volume and diversity of cases had negative overall impact on education of radiology residents, but simulated cases and virtual learning proved its value during the pandemic and may have lasting implications for the postpandemic world. Research initiatives transitioned to a remote format with greater emphasis on quality improvement and COVID-19-related studies. Reduced face-to-face interaction opportunities made it difficult to establish strong and meaningful interpersonal connections and had a negative impact on resident wellness, mentorship, and professional development. Implementing mentorship programs and virtual "town hall meetings" were effective measures to maintain connections during times of social distancing. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic introduced unprecedented stressors and challenges for radiology residents that negatively impacted their mental health and wellness. Incorporating wellness initiatives such as wellness hours and team-building activities and using social media were helpful in promoting wellness and mental health for radiology residents.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the academics and wellness of radiology residents across North America but has taught us many lessons that can help us navigate the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, the postpandemic world, and future pandemics.

### Developing critical mass and growing our own academics [^111p37FC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

Academic paediatrics is an exciting and rewarding career path but is not immune to the problems of recruitment and retention currently affecting most branches of medicine. The Modernising Medical Careers initiative, with its explicit academic training path, offers an unparalleled opportunity to develop novel schemes that promote recruitment and retention. Coordinated action is required to define, publicise and support the new academic training programmes and to attract the best trainees into them.

Formal and informal feedback is important to improve the performance, skill sets, commitment, accountability, and morale of the person being evaluated. Feedback can help people achieve their goals. Feedback is a basis for changes in compensation and other rewards. Formal reviews can also be the foundation for job changes. The latter includes promotions, lateral moves that are a better fit or will help the individual have new experiences or achieve new areas of proficiency, or finding opportunities to work outside the organization.

### Advancing beyond the average: the importance of mentoring in professional achievement [^111t12Y1]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The profession of respiratory care is founded on rigorous scientific research, which in turn depends on rigorous training in research methods. Only a small part of that training is from written and audiovisual materials; the most important aspects of becoming a respiratory researcher are learned from. Becoming a thoroughly-involved respiratory care professional, then a researcher, and then a mentor is challenging but rich with the rewards of contributing to the advancement of science and, thereby, to the care and comfort of our patients. Becoming a respiratory researcher begins with. Only those with a burning desire to excel, to discover truth, and to contribute to the advancement of the profession will persevere through the setbacks and bring a research project to final fruition. The second requirement for long-term success is learning to maintain between enthusiasm and realism. It is crucial to avoid taking on more than you can realistically do, and it is necessary to devote adequate time to your family and/or non-work-related pursuits and recreation. The third aspect of becoming a contributor to respiratory care research is rigorous and ongoing education in the of respiratory care, the methods of medical research, and the basic sciences and mathematics that underlie the profession, including some calculus, engineering physics, and statistics. You must understand research design, critical analysis of research, and numerous aspects of presentation, including clear writing and concise speaking. The fourth aspect is: you must have a strong commitment to obtaining accurate, reproducible, and meaningful data. You must sustain strong attention to detail; mentors are essential because they teach the needed discipline, the required measurement skills, and how to select the appropriate equipment with which to conduct the research. is the fifth aspect. In addition to planning and using your time wisely, you must learn what are realistic expectations about how long a project will take, when to ask for help, and when to stop because you have reached your physical or mental limit and you need to rest and devote some time to your nutrition and recreation. The sixth aspect is: having achieved the basic skills and gained a fair amount of experience, your efficiency improves and you begin to achieve more in a day; you begin to start mentoring others; you can confidently and quickly handle multiple projects; if you don't know the answers you know where to find them; you are seen as an authority and people ask you for consultations and presentations and to participate in committees. The final aspect is, meaning that your practice of respiratory care reaches a level at which you meet challenges for which you feel you have no response in memory and yet you succeed.

### More than a 100 years after flexner: are we achieving expertise through medical education? [^113kXU52]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Broadly, attaining expert performance has a least 5 key components:

Professional development should occur in a culture that pursues a "learning orientation" (also known as "mastery orientation"). Simultaneously, the prevailing culture must reduce its "performance orientation" since this only encourages the goal of looking good in the eyes of others. Performance-oriented individuals usually will not risk looking bad. Put another way, a learning orientation prioritizes improving, even at the cost of occasional failure (which in due time pays off), whereas a performance orientation prioritizes looking good. Individuals can become more learning-oriented over both the short-and long-term. Incremental self-improvement focuses on the elements of a challenging task, looking for ways to improve even when things are going well, using effort and strategy as normal components of improving and appreciating that errors and failure, although not the goal, are very potent learning tools.
Strategies leading to higher performance should be used. The strategy of deliberate practice leads the way. Additional strategies include: (a) reflective reasoning(involving structured reanalysis of case findings such as listing symptoms of a diagnosis that are expected but are not present or listing symptoms that are present but not accounted for by the diagnosis); (b) mastery learning(ensuring correct task performance where any aspect that is missing, or done sub optimally, is practiced repeatedly until success is achieved); (c) spacing for better retention and performance(inserting time between related learning sessions where the total learning time is kept constant - for example, a single 60-minute learning session could be changed to 3 20-minute sessions each separated by a day or more); (d) retrieval(the active recall of information at some time after it was initially learned - the longer the interval between successful retrievals the more durable is the learning); (e) feedback to enhance learning(feedback is only effective at improving performance when it directs the learner to alter an aspect of what they are doing such that it becomes more effective - praise, although pleasant to give and receive, does not typically result in improved performance); (f) comparing and contrasting to enhance transfer(finding all the commonalities and differences between topics; for example, listing the similarities and differences between septic and hemorrhagic shock would help identify the fundamental similarities and differences between them which would lead to a more effective diagnosis with a new and somewhat different manifestation of either); (g) teaching to enhance metacognition (metacognition is the process of realizing when you do, or do not, know or understand something).
Obstacles that interfere with high performance should be avoided. Working memory capacity (WMC) is used by the brain when we actively think, pay attention, process information, and learn. This processing capacity is extremely limited in humans (the typical person can only hold 7 numbers in their mind at a time) and is sufficiently vulnerable that simply walking along a prescribed path while learning words will result in less learning compared to learning while sitting. This limitation can be optimized by training a task to a level of automaticity which then reduces the involvement of WMC to complete the task. In turn, this leaves more WMC available to attend to other cognitive processes. Additional performance limitations include (a) cognitive biases and heuristics(biases are cognitive errors made when processing information; heuristics are cognitive shortcuts used to make quick and easy decisions); (b) dysfunctional thinking dispositions (a variety of thinking dispositions can reduce optimal decision making and performance. For example, the "need for cognition" is the tendency to engage in, and enjoy, effortful cognitive activity. Those with a high need for cognition perform better on intellectual tasks". Actively Open-Minded Thinking" is another disposition that is favorably, or unfavorably, linked to normatively rational thinking when is high or low, respectively).
Coaching or a structured curriculum is needed to ensure that components 1 to 3 above are followed and to provide the right environment. Mentors in the medical profession seldom dedicate themselves to coaching a junior colleague the way a coach of an elite athlete would dedicate themselves to improving the performance of an athlete. Prior studies have shown that physician self-assessment is poor and sometimes it is even inversely related to performance. In essence, physicians need to receive frequent, timely and actionable feedback from knowledgeable others that they will listen to.
The learner must be persistently motivated to achieve increasing levels of performance. Significant motivation and self-discipline are needed to stay on the path of incessant improvement. Motivation is fostered through autonomy, relatedness to important others, and success in attaining goals. Implementation intentions have been shown to help individuals reach goals that require self-discipline.

### The process of developing a joint theory of change across three global entities: can this help to make their efforts to strengthen capacity for implementation research more effective? [^112LFjvF]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Materials and methods

Developing the joint theory of change

Usually, a theory of change is developed in the context of a single new programme. For example, the National Institute of Health Research UK have developed a theory of change that illustrates how its Global Health Research programme aims to bring about its intended outcomes and impacts. A theory of change starts with identifying the goal of a programme and then working backwards to identify the anticipated outcomes and activities needed to achieve impact. However, in our case, the theory of change (including its vision and goal) had to be aligned to the existing strategies of the three programmes: each strategy was underpinned by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The first step was, therefore, to determine the programmes' joint vision and goal for their research capacity strengthening (RCS) efforts. After that, activities related to strengthening capacity for IR within each programme were identified and then the activities were reviewed and used to formulate joint outcomes and ultimate goals. Since all three programmes already had their own well-established activities and workplans, we adapted the traditional process for developing a theory of change for a new programme, so we focused especially on identifying the pathways that would lead to achieving their common goal of strengthening IR capacity. The programmes each provided documents that provided more details about each of their activities (online supplemental table S1). A joint theory of change was developed by two to three representatives from each of the three programmes (seven participants in total). They were selected to participate in the study because they were senior leaders and managers in their programmes with good overall knowledge and understanding of, and influence over, their programmes. They participated in a 2-day workshop facilitated by two external consultants with experience in developing theories of change. No patients or members of the public were involved in the design, conduct or reporting of this study.

### National Society of Genetic Counselors' board of directors response to myers et al' A report of the AGCPD task force to evaluate associations between select admissions requirements, demographics, and performance on ABGC certification examination' [^1161mpJg]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). Medium credibility.

3.1 Definitions and language alignment

Aligning on shared language and definitions related to J.E.D. I. work was a key need articulated in several of the discussions NSGC leadership held with leaders of other genetic counseling organizations. Given that we aim to increase diversity and inclusion at many intersecting points in the genetic counseling profession, it is critical to have a common lexicon by which to articulate and document goals and measure outcomes. Indeed, one of the prioritized recommendations from Exeter's report was for NSGC to 'develop organization‐wide definitions of diversity, equity and inclusion' (Exeter Group's DEI Report). We propose that these definitions should be aligned upon broadly throughout the profession.

3.2 Data collection and sharing

We propose that genetic counseling organizations commit to the collection and sharing of data related to recruitment and retention of genetic counselors representing diverse identities into the field. This is a necessary first step to identifying and assessing barriers and disparities in admissions guidelines, training, certification, ongoing education, and professional development. NSGC has made Exeter's DEI report publicly available and will continue to collect and share data through the Professional Status Survey and other means. We recognize and applaud genetic counseling training programs' and organizations' data collection and sharing efforts, an example being Myers et al. 's findings.

3.3 Resource development and sharing

We encourage the creation and sharing of resources for fostering greater justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in the training, supervising, education, mentoring, recruitment, and retention of genetic counselors. Such resources could include, for example, implicit bias and antiracism training, best practices for demographic data collection, and high school career fair outreach materials. We recognize that each genetic counseling organization has a unique purpose with specialty expertise and that access to monetary, volunteer, and staff assets vary. NSGC recognizes the need to bridge gaps and limitations to foster inclusive and equitable access by all partner organizations. Shared and easily accessible resources would maximize breadth and depth of content and eliminate duplicative efforts and redundancies, so that all genetic counselors could benefit and contribute to J.E.D. I. initiatives.

### Supervision for genetic counselors: the role of career-long supervision to develop resilient practitioners [^114sQBRV]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Supervision is a forum for learning, accomplished through reflection on practitioner work and practice (AGNC Supervision Working Group; Human Genetics Society of Australasia (HGSA)). Regular reflective conversations with a supervisor provide opportunities for professional growth and ongoing development, including a focus on professional identity as genetic counselors. Supervisees, at all stages of their careers, reflect on themselves in their work with clients, research participants, colleagues, students, managers, and those they manage. Facilitated reflection with a supervisor creates opportunities to examine our beliefs and ideas from different perspectives, ensuring learning and growth continue (Carroll). Supervisee goals for supervision change over time and may include professional growth, specific skill development to further strengthen competence, and skills to enhance professional relationships.

In a fast‐evolving field, protecting time to pause and reflect is crucial. This is perhaps particularly important as the activity of genetic counseling is integrated into mainstream practice by healthcare professionals using genetic testing as part of treatment and management planning. Supervision provides an ideal place to reflect on and articulate how genetic counselors practice genetic counseling and the psychotherapeutic value that is central to genetic counseling provided by a genetic counselor (Biesecker).

As authors, we acknowledge and reflect on the many ways our positionality interacts with our experiences of supervision. We experience supervision as a Pakeha woman from Aotearoa New Zealand, who has worked as a clinical genetic counselor and now works as an academic genetic counselor; as a Pakeha woman who has long involvement with teaching, researching, and practicing supervision in academic, community, and private settings; and as a white man in his 80s originally trained as a research scientist, who is increasingly convinced of the necessity of expanding his understanding of alternative ways of experiencing the world. Active, career‐long participation in supervision continues to create opportunities for deep, guided reflection on many aspects of our professional identities. As the genetic counseling profession expands and diversifies there is a strong argument for career‐long supervision, and we urge both individuals and professional societies to consider embedding the practice of supervision beyond graduate training so as to establish a professional culture that values life‐long facilitated reflection and supervision.

### Using social media for patient care, research, and professional development: a north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper [^114NRH3c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

NASPGHAN position paper — summary of recommendations for professional social media use in pediatric gastroenterology states the following: We encourage providers, scientists and medical institutions to be active participants on social media and incorporate this participation in their patient education and advocacy efforts. We recommend that providers, scientists and medical institutions help encourage patient families to engage in social media using reputable online sources of medical information including social media. We recommend that providers, scientists, journals, and medical institutions play an active role in combating medical misinformation and science denialism. We recommend that individual researchers and academic journals use social media to increase the impact of their peer-reviewed work on broader audiences and recognize that social media can be an important source of feedback, engagement, and cross-disciplinary interaction. We recommend that educators incorporate social media as part of the medical education of our pediatric gastroenterology fellows and other learners. We recommend that the evaluation of academic promotion or mentorship of trainees and junior faculty recognize the impact of social media-based scholarship and education for promotion and tenure. We recommend that providers maintain an active online presence that is accurate and appropriate. Medical institutions should allocate personnel and resources to create and maintain their online presence. We recommend that NASPGHAN lead the pediatric gastroenterology community in social media by continuing to strengthen its own social media presence and by providing social media education and guidelines. A strong social media presence will amplify the resources and messaging from our society for its members, our patients, and the public.

### Time to develop more clinician-educators in allergy and immunology [^111wSAjU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician-educators in the field of allergy and immunology (A/I) in the United States teach and assess trainees (medical students, residents, and fellows), provide professional development to primary care physicians and advance practice providers, and are essential in developing a pipeline of academic A/I specialists. According to data from Doximity and the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States appears to be facing a shortage of clinician-educators and academic allergists in A/I. Without adequate numbers of A/I specialists focused on medical education, institutions will find it difficult to train fellows and introduce the field of A/I to medical students and residents. It is now imperative that the field focus on empowering more A/I specialists to become clinical teachers and clinician-educators. There are specific strategies that individuals, as active agents in their own development, can take in planning for this rewarding and fulfilling career. Individuals can pursue professional development opportunities, join medical education communities of practice, seek education mentors, and join in scholarship activities. It is also essential that systems-level support be provided for clinician-educators, given the increasing business pressures in medicine. Academic institutions, national organizations, and professional societies can provide resources, including structured programs in medical education, protected time, and grants. This article outlines strategies for individuals, institutions, and professional organizations that will promote the development of the next generation of A/I clinician-educators.

### Creating entrustable professional activities to assess internal medicine residents in training: a mixed-methods approach [^112JYffg]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Competency-based medical education has not advanced residency training as much as many observers expected. Some medical educators now advocate reorienting competency-based approaches to focus on a resident's ability to do authentic clinical work.

Objective

To develop descriptions of clinical work for which internal medicine residents must gain proficiency to deliver meaningful patient care (for example, "Admit and manage a medical inpatient with a new acute problem").

Design

A modified Delphi process involving clinical experts followed by a conference of educational experts.

Setting

The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

Participants

In phase 1 of the project, members of the Specialty Committee for Internal Medicine participated in a modified Delphi process to identify activities in internal medicine that represent the scope of the specialty. In phase 2 of the project, 5 experts who were scholars and leaders in competency-based medical education reviewed the results.

Measurements

Phase 1 identified important activities, revised descriptions to improve accuracy and avoid overlap, and assigned activities to stages of training. Phase 2 compared proposed activity descriptions with published guidelines for their development and application in medical education.

Results

The project identified 29 activities that qualify as entrustable professional activities. The project also produced a detailed description of each activity and guidelines for using them to assess residents.

Limitation

These activities reflect the practice patterns of the developers and may not fully represent internal medicine practice in Canada.

Conclusion

Identification of these activities is expected to facilitate modification of training and assessment programs for medical residents so that programs focus less on isolated skills and more on integrated tasks.

Primary Funding Source

Southeastern Ontario Academic Medical Organization Endowed Scholarship and Education Fund and Queen's University Department of Medicine Innovation Fund.

### Trends in the endocrinology fellowship recruitment: reasons for concern and possible interventions [^111erv9U]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

System-based solutions

The widening supply–demand mismatch begs the question of how, collectively as a consultative specialty, we can implement clinical care processes that are effective, sustainable, and aligned with professional and personal goals of our workforce (including in-training endocrinologists). A model of shared care increasingly embraced in academic centers leverages on the expertise of all team members and, equally important, mitigates physician isolation that is often a conduit to burnout. Organizations that incorporate autonomy and flexibility as important factors in workflow enjoy a high clinician retention rate. Likewise, trainees who have protected time to foster their professional goals will be more likely to achieve job satisfaction and serve as ambassadors of the field with rotating MSs and IM residents.

The progressive introduction of value-based models of care may positively impact wages for nonprocedural subspecialties and emphasize recognition for the role of the endocrinologist, thus enhancing both the appeal of our field among trainees and workforce job satisfaction.

### A theoretical and practical approach to quality improvement education [^114zwGSd]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality Improvement (QI) knowledge and skills are required at all levels of physician training. System improvement efforts need to include understanding of health disparities and design of interventions to reduce those disparities, thus health equity needs to be integrated into QI education. Payors, accreditation bodies and health systems' emphases on QI result in the need for QI curricula that meet the needs of diverse learners. This article presents a theoretical background and practical tools for designing, implementing, and evaluating a QI educational program across the spectrum of physician training with an emphasis on competency-based education and a goal of continuous practice improvement. Practice-based learning and improvement and systems-based practice are two core domains of competencies for readiness to practice. These competencies can be met through the health systems science framework for studying improvement in patient care and health care delivery coupled with QI science. Curricula should incorporate interactive learning of theory and principles of QI as well as mentored, experiential QI project work with multidisciplinary teams. QI projects often develop ideas and implement changes but are often inconsistent in studying intervention impacts or reaching the level of patient outcomes. Curriculum design should incorporate adult learning principles, competency based medical education, environmental and audience factors, and formats for content delivery. Key QI topics and how they fit into the clinical environment and teaching resources are provided, as well as options for faculty development. Approaches to evaluation are presented, along with tools for assessing learner's beliefs and attitudes, knowledge and application of QI principles, project evaluation, competency and curriculum evaluation. If the goal is to empower the next generation of change agents, there remains a need for development of scientific methodology and scholarly work, as well as faculty development and support by institutions.

### Goal changes and healthy aging [^1174eBwB]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

This article discusses ways in which aging individuals respond to physical, social, and environmental changes and constraints by modifying their goals. We review aging-related trends, which we derive from several theoretical approaches, including goal systems theory, the motivational theory of life-span development and its action-phase model, and the Selection, Optimization, and Compensation model. These theories explain how biological and social role changes in later adulthood prompt individuals to make changes to the content, orientation, and composition of their goals, including disengaging from and adjusting previously central goals. They also help identify individual differences in the capacity to do so effectively. We review several motivation-related interventions that address the challenges in goal adjustment and call for more research on identifying processes of goal changes conducive to healthy aging, more interventions, and modifications of societal and institutional (e.g., workplace, nursing home) operations that support adaptive goal change in older adults.

### Clinicians must participate in the development of multimodal AI [^116ErGKK]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Facilitating the clinician as an active participant in multimodal AI development is a problem without a simple solution, and will require a range of long-term approaches. These include strategies to encourage clinicians into AI research, such as academic funding bodies stipulating an expectation of clinician involvement throughout AI development. Complementarily, AI developers should be incorporated as observing members of the clinical multidisciplinary team to deepen their understanding of clinical workflows. This strategy, in particular, is a recognised but as yet unrealised goal of Health Education England. In addition, wider education of healthcare professionals about AI, via large scale targeted programs such as PathLAKE for computational pathology, can reduce mistrust and direct clinicians towards active involvement in AI development, encouraging them to help fix the issues with AI that they see.

Whilst these strategies are important, it remains a fact that the AI developer community and the clinical community are culturally distinct. At present, the two groups have different philosophies, speak different languages, and have different goals. Fostering integration of these distinct groups cannot therefore be a task-specific process, focused on the technical challenge of model development or the practical challenge of model deployment. Instead, formal structures are needed to develop an integrated community of clinicians and AI developers, with common philosophy and shared challenges. The development and fostering of these groups cannot be a passive process and will require application of stakeholder management techniques, to ensure that clinicians are fully integrated throughout multimodal AI development. The role of Research Community Managers (RCM) is growing in popularity and recognition and they are well placed to enact this. RCMs broad set of skills encompass communication, engagement, strategic planning, and technical expertise through activities such as participation guidelines for projects, stakeholder mapping, organising knowledge sharing events and workshops, and maintaining and supporting technical documentation.RCMs can therefore play a leading role in fostering collaboration, transparency, and community-based approaches in interdisciplinary projects between data scientists and clinicians, ensuring these projects and groups can function as a strongly connected ecosystem and achieve improved outcomes and innovation in a healthcare environment.

### Developing a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum for professionalism and scientific integrity training for biomedical graduate students [^1157XASK]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

A multidisciplinary faculty committee designed a curriculum to shape biomedical graduate students into researchers with a high commitment to professionalism and social responsibility and to provide students with tools to navigate complex, rapidly evolving academic and societal environments with a strong ethical commitment. The curriculum used problem-based learning (PBL), because it is active and learner-centred and focuses on skill and process development. Two courses were developed: Scientific Professionalism: Scientific Integrity addressed discipline-specific and broad professional norms and obligations for the ethical practice of science and responsible conduct of research (RCR). Scientific Professionalism: Bioethics and Social Responsibility focused on current ethical and bioethical issues within the scientific profession, and implications of research for society. Each small-group session examined case scenarios that included: (1) learning objectives for professional norms and obligations; (2) key ethical issues and philosophies within each topic area; (3) one or more of the RCR instructional areas; and (4) at least one type of moral reflection. Cases emphasised professional standards, obligations and underlying philosophies for the ethical practice of science, competing interests of stakeholders and oversight of science (internal and external). To our knowledge, this is the first use of a longitudinal, multi-semester PBL course to teach scientific integrity and professionalism. Both faculty and students endorsed the active learning approach for these topics, in contrast to a compliance-based approach that emphasises learning rules and regulations.

### Evaluation of active living research progress and lessons in building a new field [^116iLhNf]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

An evaluation was undertaken of the initial 6 years of the Active Living Research (ALR) program. Conducted in 2006 and analyzed in 2007, the evaluation was designed to assess productivity and progress on all three program goals and to inform consideration of program re-authorization.

Methods

The evaluation was a retrospective, in-depth, descriptive study utilizing multiple methods, both qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative data were derived mainly from 88 interviews with key informants. Quantitative data were derived primarily from a web-based survey of grantee investigators.

Results

Examples of key indicators of ALR's progress in addressing its goals were (1) in building a knowledge base: 40% of grantee investigators reported producing at least one scientific publication based on their ALR study, averaging two papers per principal investigator who had published; (2) in growing a transdisciplinary field: investigators funded in the first five rounds of grants reported representing more than 20 disciplines; and (3) in contributing to policy change: ten examples were reported of contribution to specific policy changes. In addition, more than one-third (37%) of principal investigators had leveraged additional funds, averaging $275,000 per ALR grant, suggesting that ALR also had made progress in growing financial resources for the field.

Conclusions

Overall, ALR made strides during 6 years in addressing its mission to develop a transdisciplinary field of research on environmental and policy factors that promote physical activity. The evaluation provided insight into useful approaches and strategies for building a nascent research field and suggested how to enhance the contribution of research to policy.

### A consensus statement on the meaning, value and utility of training programme outcomes, with specific reference to anaesthesiology: a consensus statement on training programme outcomes [^114gKgr1]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The necessary centrality of the patient to any system-based approach to training is captured in the model proposed by Wong et al. which refers to (i) the different levels and forms of decision making, (ii) the need for key stakeholders to participate in the co-production, measurement and evaluation of outcomes, and iii. that fact that decision making is context bound and iv. the invariable competition for resources.

Thomas and Ellaway have described the application of implementation science principles to health professional education. These entail ensuring that decisions are based on the relevant available evidence (evidence base) being presented to the appropriate stakeholders (data access), who are best positioned to understand its implications (context) and to respond appropriately (addressing barriers). Using this approach, we propose the following with respect to the achievement of TP outcomes:

1 Data access: The consistent achievement of pre-determined outcomes will depend on accessing data streams from the programme and the clinical sites (pre-requisite).
2 Evidence base: The aggregate of data from clinical settings and training environment must be provided to stakeholders in a timely way at the correct level. These data can critically inform and influence decision-making. Progress and challenges should be identified at programme director level.
3 Context: The manner in which specific TP outcomes is achieved needs to take account of context specific resources and local health needs.
4 Addressing barriers: The data generated locally need to be examined for unintended consequences. Barriers or perceived barriers to implementation of programme changes relating to specific programme outcomes, need to be identified across the system including investment, faculty development, structures and resource access.

Of the various components of a logic-based modelapplied to training doctors, we propose that TP outcomes are uniquely important, (i) representing the means by which society's healthcare needs are met through training, and (ii) determining the specific "deliverables" within curriculum and instructional design. In this sense, the outcomes represent the centre or fulcrum of the professional training system and should determine its operation (upstream) and serve as measures of efficacy (downstream).

We recognise that Training Programmes operate in a complex, dynamic environment. Whilst the four principles above provide accommodation for change, an operating logic model could actually leverage benefit from change (in data content, environmental factors, advances in data science).

### Essential nonclinical competencies for cardiovascular specialists imperatives for training [^117YX4gE]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

5 DISCUSSION

This is an era when physicians and team members risk becoming commodities rather than professionals. Active and effective engagement in healthcare systems at the practice, hospital, system, institutional and national level is a vehicle for helping to ensure that the quality of care for patients supersedes pure financial concerns. Such engagement also empowers clinicians and academicians, restoring a sense of professional control. While clinical skills are integral to formalized training and lifelong learning/continuing education, opportunities for nonclinical skill development lag. Several institutions have ongoing programs to help bridge this gap. Integration of nonclinical teaching into formal academic training and lifelong learning can help provide cardiovascular professionals with tools to positively influence the future of care.

Dick Conti left a legacy of devising and implementing actions toward the ultimate goal of improved care for patients. We, as cardiovascular specialists, have the opportunity and the responsibility to perpetuate his mission.

American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Scientific Research Agenda

The scientific agenda must be defined based on the knowledge gaps in rehabilitation and the needs of persons experiencing disability. Basic science research in rehabilitation must be supported and integrate approaches that are common to other medical specialties. Clinical and translational research must occupy a special place in the research agenda. In other words, we need to translate basic science findings into clinical knowledge useful and applicable in health delivery systems along the rehabilitation continuum of care for the benefit of people with disabilities and the general population who can benefit from rehabilitation. The field of PRM should take advantage of the dramatic increase in scientific knowledge in the last few decades to enhance our efforts in rehabilitation research. It is also important to conduct research that will inform health policy and decision makers in both the private and public sectors as well as to apply rehabilitation expertise in measuring and optimizing function to strengthen the scientific agenda in population health studies. Finally, we need to promote the conduct of "secondary research" including systematic reviews and meta-analysis as well as qualitative research. Such efforts may identify gaps in knowledge that could be addressed by basic and clinical research efforts.

Because of its relevance to a clinical discipline, it may be relevant to base the development of a research agenda on a model that highlights the importance of an integrative model of human functioning. The backbone of this model is the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Furthermore, the research activity based on this model can be characterized as translational because it emphasizes the quest for information that will directly benefit human health. To enhance the quality of the research, methodological issues are also being addressed.

Research Capacity

Building research capacity requires several specific actions and elements. First and foremost, it is essential to bring together a cadre of researchers with the background, talent, and motivation to generate new knowledge and address relevant questions that need to be answered to advance the field. Senior researchers must work closely with more junior investigators who need to be mentored and invite their students to join their projects. It must be noted that the retention of this research workforce is as important as its recruitment. To attract young talent, we must highlight the relevance of rehabilitation as well as the excitement that comes with finding ways to enhance human functioning.

Second, rehabilitation researchers must work in an institution that recognizes the importance of this activity for the future of mankind. This recognition should be demonstrated by an institutional culture that values research as part of its mission. Furthermore, the institution must commit significant resources to build the infrastructure that is needed to conduct innovative and creative research.

### Improving facility-based care: eliciting tacit knowledge to advance intervention design [^115MpTyc]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The five motive forces we consider aggregate many elements of existing frameworks, for example, from behavioural science, implementation scienceand health systems thinking. We acknowledge our approach is derived to serve practical ends from a large and diverse body of important work spanning goal theory, identity theory, health policy and organisational research, work on leadership in health systemsand motivation. Our aim is not to propose a substitute for these ideas but use them to help practitioners to reflect on how their intervention affects and is affected by others and therefore how local understanding may help them make adaptations that may promote success. The five motive forces linked to broad questions are:

Goal alignment and ownership: Arguably, ensuring all key stakeholders are aligned with the goal of an intervention is a fundamental step influencing everything from organisational responses to individuals' motivation. How will the approach proposed ensure the goals of the intervention are considered important by everyone involved in, or affected by, the changes being made? How does the intervention ensure that they commit individually, as teams and as organisations, to achieving these goals?
Leadership for change: Which individuals or teams are expected to lead the change on a day-to-day basis? Are they appropriately positioned in the system/facility to do this (eg, do they have any necessary formal authority or informal power)? How will these people, typically at the mid-level of facility organisations (eg, senior health workers or department heads), gain any needed skills in strategic use of communication, coaching and problem-solving skills so they can be both effective and create the trusting relationships needed to foster change?
Empowering key senior actors: The mid-level change leaders we explore in the question above will need the support of more senior managers who run whole health facilities and potentially those at even higher levels of the health system. Are these more senior personnel identified, engaged and themselves empowered and willing to support the change through new policy or by tackling bureaucratic hurdles so they in turn empower those at local level? How will these key actors be recognised for achievements when changes occur so the momentum for change is sustained over time at multiple levels of the health system?
Responsive planning and procurement: How will any infrastructural, ongoing material or community needs (identified while considering the three core resources) be met? Are mechanisms in place to leverage new resources that go beyond any short-term external project support to meet longer-term or unanticipated and emergent needs? Will resourcing a new initiative divert existing resources from elsewhere causing a new set of problems?
Learning for transformation: How will evaluation and learning take place locally to identify and celebrate successes, identify challenges (including unintended consequences) and strengthen local team-working through ongoing co-production of solutions? How might local learning lead to wider shared learning that can harness the power and enhance the capability of peers and networks?

### Healthy aging: American Geriatrics Society white paper executive summary [^11631CwX]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). High credibility.

American Geriatrics Society white paper — roles for advocacy, education, and clinical practice in promoting healthy aging are stated with explicit actions: As advocates, we should facilitate collaboration across sectors of society, disciplines, and professions by highlighting incentives and frameworks for stakeholders to work together, and we must acknowledge that healthy aging requires a community response in addition to a health care response. Policy directions specify that first, health systems should be aligned to meet the needs of older populations and this must include access to older-person–centered, integrated care; second, long-term care services and supports should be strengthened across a continuum of need; third, everyone should have the opportunity to live and grow old in an age-friendly environment, and fourth, improved measurement, monitoring, and understanding is needed to overcome major knowledge and research gaps, with the stance that we can and should position healthy aging as an untapped resource. In education, the paper states that as educators, we work both at individual and public health levels to change minds and attitudes, including combating ageism; we should promote an understanding of the aging dividend/benefit; we need to educate individuals and the public to have appropriate expectations about aging — neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic; we must train our students in ways that promote respect, compassion, and dignity across ages and cultures; and interprofessional learning also provides a powerful format for healthcare professionals. Clinically, it emphasizes that as clinicians, we promote healthy aging through clinical best practices that embrace the biopsychosocial model of function, disability, and health, emphasizing abilities and participation of older adults in their families, work, and communities.

### Entrustable professional activities and curricular milestones for fellowship training in pulmonary and critical care medicine: executive summary from the multi-society working group [^111U2zkz]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Assessment of graduate medical trainee progress via the accomplishment of competency milestones is an important element of the Next Accreditation System of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. This article summarizes the findings of a multisociety working group that was tasked with creating the entrustable professional activities and curricular milestones for fellowship training in pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine, and combined programs. Using the Delphi process, experienced medical educators from the American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Association of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Program Directors reached consensus on the detailed curricular content and expected skill set of graduates of these programs. These are now available to trainees and program directors for the purposes of curriculum design, review, and trainee assessment.

### Political strategy, business strategy, and the academic medical center: linking theory and practice [^111wnZ5v]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to link external political strategy theory to a specific health care setting-that of the academic medical center (AMC). Political strategy encompasses those activities undertaken by AMCs to acquire, develop, and use power (clout, influence, and credibility) to gain an advantage in situations of conflict. It should be differentiated from internal politics, a topic that will not be dealt with in this review. Political strategy should also be distinguished from but not divorced from competitive strategy. As political and social action can change the competitive landscape and the rules of competition, AMCs must become adept in issues management and stakeholder management. The focus on political strategy is a reflection of the enormous changes in the external environment that have impacted AMCs in recent years. These changes have often emerged out of political and social action and they impact significantly on the organization's more traditional business strategies. We suggest that a tighter alignment between political and business strategies in the future will help ensure organizational survival and success. This article reviews the literature and theory in corporate political strategy and illustrates the application of political strategy with examples of issues and problems faced by AMCs. Models of political strategy are well crafted, and this article concludes with succinct observations on the use of political strategies to enhance the business-based strategies of AMCs. Although the focus is on AMCs, the use of political strategies is applicable to any health care institution.

### Design and implementation of a distant-learning clinical research mentorship program: the accra-toronto collaboration [^112DjrFs]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengthening research capacity has been touted as a powerful and cost-effective way to improve health and development. The paucity of data on operational guidance, monitoring, and evaluation may be one of the reasons why progress is slower than desired. Well-conceptualized programs with a priori deliverables remain the minority, but are growing in number. The ESSENCE Good Practice framework for research capacity strengthening provides useful principles and practical considerations. Our program design included many of the principles and deliverables recommended.

Our experience highlights enabling strategies for building a successful relational partnership in education collaboration, which we have operationalized into 8 steps. These include the following: identify potential partners, perform a needs assessment of learners, define the knowledge gap, design and refine the curriculum, select evaluation tools, define short- and long-term deliverables, consider the budget, and repeat the process for each successful group of learners or collaborating partners. Identifying appropriate partners aligns with the ESSENCE principles. The needs assessment of learners is a discrete step well described in educational designto understand the learning needs and perspective of the target audience, intentionally refining educational offerings to align with different learning styles and expectations. The choice of evaluation tools should be focused on instruments that are validated and aligns with the Kirkpatrick modelof program evaluation. Adequate consideration of budgetary requirements to support the goals of learners and partnering institutions is also important. We expect this simple action cycle will enable experience to be gained, evidence to be built, and best practices to be followed, doing so with improved efficiency, sustainability, and growth. This is particularly important for academic institutions designing education collaborations with partners from different settings (Fig 5).

FIG 5
Education collaboration design.

There are limitations to our project. Our report represents our first experience with a single institution and a modest cohort of 5 learners. Continued sustainability is required to demonstrate real success with our approach. There is no easy way to quantify the long-term impact of our program as incorporating the skills that have been learned into clinical practice is subject to multiple environmental factors. We expect that, through continuation of our project with successive cohorts of learners, a network of alumni from our mentorship program will provide a greater experience as well as opportunities for longer-term follow up. A qualitative study of trainees who have completed the program from Ghana and Zimbabwe is underway. We are optimistic that building bridges and promoting research capacity can ultimately improve the quality of care and meaningful clinical outcomes for patients in low- and middle-income countries.

### The perceived organizational impact of the gender gap across a Canadian department of medicine and proposed strategies to combat it: a qualitative study [^113Tr5gB]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Sampling and recruitment

Our local data from the 2015 faculty survey suggested that there were gender differences according to faculty academic position description, academic rank, and hospital. Thus, we used a purposive sampling strategy to identify DOM members across various academic positions (i.e. clinician-teacher, clinician-educator, clinician-investigator, clinician-scientist, clinician-administrator, and clinician-quality and innovation specialist). These academic position descriptions vary according to the time spent in clinical service, the nature of the scholarly work (Table 1), and their promotion requirements. We also identified participants across academic ranks (i.e. lecturer, assistant professor, associate professor, and full professor) and hospitals. We aimed to recruit participants until we achieved a saturation of themes; we anticipated the need to recruit one or two individuals from each of the six fully affiliated hospitals by academic position description to reach this goal.

Table 1
Academic position descriptions within the Department of Medicine, University of Toronto

a CPA refers to creative professional activities, which are activities that demonstrate impact outside of the traditional clinical, research, or education domains

We obtained a list of full-time faculty members within the DOM and a member of the research team sent email invitations describing the study to potential participants. To maximize the response rate, an email reminder was sent. We also employed a snowball sampling strategy, wherein participating faculty members were asked to support recruitment by identifying other DOM members who might be willing to be interviewed.

Data collection

We conducted a series of one-on-one semi-structured interviews between May and September 2016. We developed questions based on our 2015 survey results and feedback from the research team. The questions included inquiries around perceptions of the gender gap, factors contributing to the gender gap, the impact of the gap on organizational effectiveness and workplace culture, and possible strategies to mitigate it. The interview guide is in given in the Appendix. The interviews were conducted by telephone, and lasted 45 to 60 min. They were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and de-identified. The units of analysis included the transcripts as well as field notes taken by the research assistant during the interviews. We collected participant demographic information including gender, hospital, academic position, academic rank, division, and stage of career (denoted by years of service). We asked participants for permission to use de-identified quote(s) prior to inclusion in the report and/or publication. We provided participants with a draft of the report for review.

### What we know about designing an effective improvement intervention (but too often fail to put into practice) [^1165dwsZ]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

What the literature suggests we should have done

There is no shortage of increasingly sophisticated theory, empirical evidence and learned commentary that could have guided our design decisions. Much of the thinking about interventions is relatively new; a state-of-the-art review of improvement published in the Lancet more than 15 years ago made no specific reference to the ways in which interventions morph when applied in practice. In contrast, more recent international guidance on designing, conducting and writing up improvement projects highlights the importance of describing how improvement interventions change. In brief, a number of themes relating to the design of effective interventions are emerging in the literature.

First, the importance of using theory ('a chain of reasoning') to optimise the design and effectiveness of interventions is highlighted. A commonsense rather than an overly academic approach to theory is being advocated as a way of reducing the risk of the 'magical thinking', which encourages improvers to use interventions that look superficially attractive but for which the mechanisms of action are unclear. Alongside the use of theory, there is a growing interest in the application of 'design thinking' as a strategy for ensuring that the problem has been clearly identified and a way of addressing complex problems in rapidly changing environments. Second, the importance of having an explicit method, such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Model for improvement using Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, is described and also understanding how to use the methods to their full potential. Third, there is a growing emphasis on the extent to which improvement interventions are social as well as technical in nature, and how their effectiveness is a consequence of a complex interaction between people, organisational structures and processes. Fourth, the literature describes how what people do (intervention), how they do it (implementation) and the wider environment (context) are interdependent and some people are suggesting that the traditional differentiation between this classic triad is no longer helpful.

### Professional practice guidelines for integrating the role of work and career into psychological practice [^117YKGjd]. APA (2017). Medium credibility.

Professional psychology practice — integrating the role of work and career — psychologists are encouraged to recognize that the lack of work impacts individuals, communities, and organizations from the local to the global level; become familiar with the world of work and resources for employment statistics, employment projections and occupational information to help clients access work opportunities, pursue career advancement, and prepare for career transitions; and advocate for organizational and policy changes that reduce the barriers to sustainable and rewarding work, including educating policy-makers about economic and political structures and addressing institutionalized discrimination and workplace climate factors such as workplace bullying.

### Regional and institutional trends in assessment for academic promotion [^114yaBQG]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Study design

To study how researchers are evaluated worldwide, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis examining the assessment criteria used in promotion policies. We systematically identified and analysed selected promotion criteria by capturing their presence or absence in promotion policies and comparing differences and similarities across disciplines, fields, tracks, types of institution and countries, considering their socioeconomic contexts. Rather than following a predefined protocol, we developed our methodology through an initial pilot study, which then evolved into a comprehensive framework (Supplementary Information section 1.1), which allowed us to compare and quantify qualitative data from institutional documents worldwide.

Researchers operate in diverse environments across countries, regions and institutions, resulting in substantial variability in career progression roles. Mapping all career paths is beyond our aims, so we focused on promotion policies for (full) 'professor' — the most senior academic role, widely recognized and comparable across countries. We distinguish the standard academic track, a research-focused track, a teaching-focused track and a clinical track. Additionally, we focus on assessment within academic institutions, and do not include roles beyond universities such as those in research institutes, clinical settings or commercial environments.

Between May 2016 and November 2023, we drew on the Global Young Academy membership and alumni network to collect documents outlining promotion policies, including criteria and procedures (Methods section "Data acquisition"). In a study pilot phase (2016–2018), we sourced 46 policies to inform our methodological framework. Subsequently, in a first data collection phase (2018–2021), we built a dataset of 196 policies from 55 countries. In 2023, we updated the data for all policies collected and broadened the scope of our effort to include policies from under-represented Global South regions, adding a further 440 policies. With this last round, we sourced policies set by 190 academic institutions ('institutional policies') and 58 government agencies ('national policies') across 121 countries. Additionally, 53 organizations' (institutions' or agencies') documents in our sample defined multiple policies that distinguish between career tracks and/or disciplines, which brought the total of collected track-specific and discipline-specific policies to 532 (Fig. 1; more in Methods sections "Translation" to "Clustering by disciplines, tracks, global region and economic status").

### Going for growth: improvement in the infrastructural and management support for clinical academic research [^111me547]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Our objective was to implement a directorate research strategy to improve and grow clinical academic capacity and capability and ensure that the organisational systems and processes enabled clinical staff and managers to increase grant capture, undertake clinically relevant research, including the adoption of NIHR portfolio sites and established a culture in which research was an accepted part of professional practice. An initial evaluation of senior and middle manager attitudes and understanding of the research infrastructure and benefits of research identified that the directorate had a deeply segmented view of research and only a partial view of how research could benefit patients and improve their services. A significant number of staff claimed to be research active but this activity was not contributing to the service knowledge or being translated into grant capture, leading to income that could be used to invest in patient facing research. Few managers had appreciated the challenge of implementing the research strategy or the potential of enabling research active staff to generate clinical academic careers. A quality improvement methodology was adopted, based on four equally important elements [1]; involving people (staff and patients) in research, developing people's research knowledge and skills, promoting an understanding of the complex systems and processes associated with research, and using an organisational research strategy with leadership to drive change. This improvement method suggests an equal and proportional range of activity to engage staff, amend and adapt processes and systems, carry out organisational change and "make it a habit". The improvement measures were selected by a number of managers who acted as "research champions" and shared these with all staff across the directorate; the focus was on delivering sustained improvements in performance targets agreed with the organisation. The interventions were introduced to assist managers in each professional group to champion research and undertake the organisational change that would be needed. The two cycles of improvement over 14 months were used to achieve "academic status" within the organisation, to include clinical staff in the delivery of the research strategy and to create a clinical academic infrastructure that incorporated a well organised public and patient involvement (PPI) panel. Additional measures included the level of participation of clinical academic staff in grant capture and the level of income from research to sustain the growth in activity.

### Preterm birth and healthy outcomes team: the science and strategy of team-based investigation [^114cWvwu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Progress

PreHOT was formed in 2008 through funding from Alberta Innovates Health Solutions, formerly the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, Interdisciplinary Team Grants Program (#200700595). In order to optimize functioning and outputs, extensive investment was made in developing the team ethos and integrity. These efforts were facilitated by engaging a professional coach who led team members through a consensus process to develop the vision, mission, working agreements, conflict resolution, financial management and recognition (authorship, intellectual property) plans. The engagement of team members in the creation of a team handbook was an innovative and effective approach to encourage team success. The dedication to the process enabled us to minimize communication errors and to establish team-specific operating principles and accountabilities that were acceptable across discipline, faculty, and institution. In addition, team members made meaningful time commitments to attend team meetings, get to know each other, understand the work of researchers in other content areas, engage in discussions to ensure their work was understood by others of different content expertise, and provide valuable feedback to team members regardless of discipline. Indeed, through these efforts we believe we have been able to learn from one another, increase the sophistication of our science, and identify emerging questions to be addressed across scientific paradigms, and collectively establish and maintain a high integrity, highly collaborative research environment. In addition, we have examined the learning and work styles each researcher brings to the team, which has enabled us to embrace the diversity of our unique talents, develop mutual respect, reduce frustration, and increase engagement and productivity.

Through this process of engagement with one another, PreHOT developed a governance and operational structure that encouraged communication and collaborative decision making. An executive met quarterly to review the budget and project progress and to strategize solutions for potential barriers to success (eg. delays in ethics approvals or release of funds). Research project leaders met routinely with their research teams at schedules appropriate to the project (e.g. weekly for some, monthly for others), and they provided quarterly reports to the executive members and the funder. Trainee events were scheduled twice per year and included both academic and social activities to encourage team building (eg. knowledge mobilization workshop, rafting). Team members and trainees committed to attending an annual meeting, which included administrative and progress reports as well as scientific presentations. At these annual meetings, team members participated in leadership development activities and further team building exercises.

### Pathway for a diverse and sustainable emergency medicine clinician-scientist workforce: recommendations from the 2024 SAEM consensus conference [^11164H7J]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Undergraduate and Medical Student Pathways

4.1 Why Is This Important?

A sustainable pathway to support a robust and diverse EM clinician–scientist workforce begins with early exposure and engagement. Attracting research‐oriented students from all backgrounds into the specialty of EM is essential to this process. These early research opportunities will cultivate students' passion for EM and stimulate the knowledge and skill acquisition needed to have successful careers as EM clinician–scientists.

4.2 Challenges and Barriers

Major challenges for recruiting students into academic EM careers include the lack of branding and visibility of EM as an academic specialty (addressed in the previous section). Research‐oriented students may be steered away from EM as a clinical specialty by advisors due to a lack of awareness (their own or from poorly informed mentors and advisors) of the depth and breadth of EM research career opportunities across the research spectrum, including basic science, clinical research, public health, community health, health services, and health disparities. Departmental barriers include limited funding for engagement of students in student‐research relative to other departmental priorities. Additionally, there is a lack of EM representation in the recruitment of students into Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTP) and predoctoral T32 programs due to a lack of faculty trainers to serve as primary mentors. Medical student access to EM clinician–scientist research mentorship may be limited based on faculty availability and alignment of research interests. Some institutions do not allow undergraduate research activities or do not have active EM research programs despite interested undergraduates and medical students. Existing institutional resources for students who wish to pursue investigative careers, such as short‐term training programs supported by institutional, foundation, or federal funding, are underused by EM or even unknown to many EM programs and investigators. Increasing EM access to these resources may require increased representation of EM on institutional federal grant review committees, NIH‐funded programs, and other venues.

4.3 Recommended Strategies

A prioritized list of recommended strategies with associated goals, timeline, and parties responsible for implementation is provided in Table 2.
