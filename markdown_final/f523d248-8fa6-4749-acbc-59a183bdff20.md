doxazosin-indictn

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about doxazosin's FDA-labeled and off-label indications, dosing by formulation, key precautions and contraindications, interaction considerations, special populations, and how pivotal trials shape practice decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA labeling and which formulations are actually approved for which indications. Then, I should verify dosing by indication and formulation. Next, I will review evidence-supported off-label uses. After that, I need to check safety warnings, contraindications, drug–drug interactions, and special populations. Finally, I will integrate pivotal trial data and provide a concise clinical summary.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications and formulations: doxazosin immediate-release (Cardura) is FDA-approved for hypertension and for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adults, whereas the extended-release formulation (Cardura XL/doxazosin mesylate ER) is approved for BPH but not for hypertension [^111PTerM] [^1168ne57] [^111Ly6eU] [^1128Q4Hk].

> Wait, I should double-check the formulation-specific limitation, because it's easy to conflate them; Cardura XL explicitly states it is not for the treatment of high blood pressure, so hypertension treatment must use the immediate-release formulation if doxazosin is chosen [^1128Q4Hk].

> Now, for hypertension dosing, I need to ensure I use the immediate-release numbers: start 1 mg orally once daily, titrate to a maintenance range of 1–16 mg daily, with a maximum of 16 mg daily; and I should remember the orthostatic hypotension and first-dose syncope risk, especially in combination with other vasodilators or PDE5 inhibitors [^1168ne57] [^117UKtqh].

> Regarding BPH, let me verify dosing by formulation so I don't mix them up: for immediate-release, start 1 mg daily and titrate to 1–8 mg daily (max 8 mg), while the extended-release/GITS formulation is commonly initiated at 4 mg daily with potential titration to 8 mg based on response, as shown in controlled trials of the GITS system [^113XGzNJ] [^111GnwjY] [^116bKCEV].

> Mechanistically, I should recall that symptomatic benefit in BPH comes from alpha-1–mediated relaxation of prostate and bladder neck smooth muscle, improving urinary flow and lower urinary tract symptoms [^1128Q4Hk].

> For off-label uses, hold on, I should verify dosing and duration; doxazosin is used as medical expulsive therapy to facilitate ureteral stone passage in adults, typically 2–4 mg daily for up to 4 weeks [^111PTerM] [^116qmocK].

> Next, I will examine perioperative alpha-blockade in pheochromocytoma; doxazosin 2–16 mg/day has demonstrated comparable blood pressure control to phenoxybenzamine with fewer persistent postoperative effects, making it a reasonable alternative in experienced hands [^1151rChb].

> But wait, resistant hypertension is a distinct scenario; PATHWAY-2 showed spironolactone was superior to doxazosin modified-release (4–8 mg) and bisoprolol as fourth-line therapy, so doxazosin can be considered when spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated, but it is not the preferred fourth-line agent [^111J3t7t] [^113c36eX] [^1134CPSd].

> I need to ensure the contraindications are explicit: known hypersensitivity to doxazosin, other quinazolines such as prazosin or terazosin, or formulation components is a contraindication [^113PqiMy] [^114Qs59U] [^114gjo4R].

> Let me review hepatic impairment guidance carefully; use with caution in Child-Pugh A or B with monitoring for hypotension, but avoid in Child-Pugh C, and the same caution applies to the extended-release product with explicit do-not-use in severe impairment [^114ydxtB] [^1137r14Z] [^111JkfyV] [^117GN7FB] [^115RQEan].

> Hold on, I should verify key interactions that amplify hypotension; potent CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase doxazosin exposure, and coadministration with PDE5 inhibitors like tadalafil or sildenafil augments blood pressure lowering and has been associated with symptomatic hypotension and syncope, warranting careful spacing, dose adjustments, or avoidance [^116Qv5pn] [^117UKtqh] [^11366Bxr] [^117K7NmE] [^11468euS].

> Next, I should review perioperative ophthalmic risk; intraoperative floppy iris syndrome has been reported with alpha-1 blockers including doxazosin, so the ophthalmic surgeon should be alerted prior to cataract surgery [^117UKtqh].

> Let me consider cardiovascular outcomes and the older adult population; doxazosin as an antihypertensive has been associated with higher rates of heart failure versus chlorthalidone and with worse cardiac outcomes in certain ischemic subgroups, reinforcing that it should not be first-line for hypertension in most patients, especially older adults [^113enLcA] [^112eWD6x] [^116U5k4S].

> I should confirm key BPH evidence to guide expectations; alpha-1 antagonists improve LUTS and flow with early onset over days, and combination therapy with finasteride offers superior long-term outcomes in men with prostates 25 mL or larger compared with monotherapy [^116bKCEV] [^112jZL65] [^111N2rEG].

> Let me check renal dosing; no dose adjustment is generally required in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapy for doxazosin IR or ER [^115Laq2s] [^117GeMTV] [^114g2AdR] [^111pik7c].

> I should review adverse reactions to set monitoring plans; common effects include dizziness, headache, somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, palpitations, peripheral edema, and gastrointestinal symptoms, with uncommon events such as syncope or stroke reported, and rare reactions spanning hepatic injury, priapism, and hematologic changes [^112PgQ7n] [^1123sXyP] [^116h8F55] [^115DbBwu] [^112YvA5f].

> In summary, doxazosin IR is labeled for hypertension and BPH, while ER is labeled for BPH only; evidence-supported off-label uses include ureteral stone expulsion and perioperative pheochromocytoma blockade; dosing must be formulation- and indication-specific; and clinicians should prioritize safer fourth-line options in resistant hypertension, avoid use in severe hepatic impairment, and vigilantly manage orthostatic risk and interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors and PDE5 inhibitors [^111PTerM] [^1128Q4Hk] [^116qmocK] [^1151rChb] [^111J3t7t] [^111JkfyV] [^117UKtqh].

### Pharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension in patients with psoriasis [^112kDWSv]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Doxazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used for treating resistant arterial hypertension (AH). It is particularly recommended as an adjunctive drug when existing treatment has failed to adequately reduce blood pressure, especially in patients who are spironolactone intolerant. Doxazosin can also be used in combination with other drugs, such as beta-blockers or centrally acting drugs, to achieve better blood pressure control. There is no evidence that doxazosin affects inflammatory processes that could lead to the worsening of psoriasis. Notably, it is sometimes used in patients with metabolic syndrome, which is a common comorbid condition in those with psoriasis.

Urapidil also blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors in the periphery.

- **Main advantage**: It can rapidly lower blood pressure, with minimal effect on heart rate. Urapidil is mainly used in the acute setting to control hypertensive crises, especially in hospital care. Based on its influence on the sympathetic nervous system, it should not significantly worsen the course of psoriasis. However, studies focusing on its mechanism of action relative to psoriasis are lacking.

The main indication for sacubitril/valsartan is for the treatment of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and it is not primarily used for AH treatment. Sacubitril/valsartan combines two mechanisms of action:

- **Inhibition of the enzyme neprilysin**: Increases natriuretic peptide levels, promotes vasodilation, and increases diuresis and sodium excretion, thereby lowering blood pressure and relieving the burden.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111J3t7t]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The PATHWAY-2 study, published in 2015 in the journal Lancet, investigated the effectiveness of spironolactone compared to doxazosin in treating drug-resistant hypertension. The trial specifically aimed to determine if spironolactone was superior to add-on doxazosin for this condition. It was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 335 patients, composed of 105 females and 230 males.

Participants in the study were aged between 18 and 79 years and had a seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP of ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months. Key exclusion criteria included secondary or accelerated hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.

- **Interventions**:
	- Spironolactone was administered to 285 participants at 25 mg/day through week 6, with forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12.
	- Doxazosin was given to 282 participants at 4 mg/day through week 6, with forced uptitration to 8 mg/day through week 12.

- **Primary outcome**: The study found a significant increase in the reduction of home SBP from week 6 to week 12, with a reduction of 12.8 mmHg for spironolactone versus 8.7 mmHg for doxazosin (adjusted difference [AD] 4.03 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.02 to 5.04).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant increases in the reduction of home SBP were observed at week 12 (further details removed due to text truncation).

### Adcirca [^11366Bxr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Alpha-blockers and PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are systemic vasodilators. In subjects receiving a concomitant single dose of tadalafil (20 mg) and daily doxazosin (8 mg), an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, there was an augmentation of the blood pressure–lowering effect of doxazosin. This effect was still present at 12 hours post-dose and had generally disappeared at 24 hours. The number of subjects with potentially clinically significant standing–blood–pressure decreases was greater for the combination.

An additional study was performed using tadalafil (20 mg single dose) and doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The augmentation appeared unrelated to dosing times and resulted in a greater number of outliers for the combination than had been observed in the previous study. Both of these studies reported some symptomatology associated with these blood pressure changes.

A further study was carried out with doxazosin (up to 4 mg daily) added to tadalafil (5 mg daily), which showed an augmentation of response. In this clinical pharmacology study, symptoms associated with the decrease in blood pressure, including syncope, were observed.

An interaction study with tadalafil (20 mg single dose) and alfuzosin, also an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, showed no clinically significant effect on blood pressure.

In two clinical pharmacology studies conducted with healthy volunteers, tadalafil (5 mg daily, and 10 mg and 20 mg single dose) had no clinically significant effect on blood pressure.

### Efficacy and safety of doxazosin for perioperative management of patients with pheochromocytoma [^1151rChb]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Despite adverse side effects, phenoxybenzamine has been widely used for the preoperative management of patients with pheochromocytoma. Doxazosin, a specific α1-adrenoceptor antagonist, has a pharmacologic profile more suited to controlling blood pressure in such patients. A sequential study of 35 patients with pheochromocytoma encompassed a definite and prescribed change in preoperative drug management from phenoxybenzamine to doxazosin. Hemodynamic, pharmacologic, and biochemical indicators of α- and β-adrenoceptor blockade were measured before, during, and after anesthesia and surgery in 8 patients pretreated with phenoxybenzamine and 27 patients pretreated with doxazosin.

Doxazosin (2–16 mg/day) was as effective as phenoxybenzamine in controlling arterial pressure and heart rate before and during surgery, but doxazosin caused fewer undesirable side effects both before and after surgery. Following phenoxybenzamine therapy, substantial α1-adrenoceptor blockade, detected as a right shift of phenylephrine dose-response curves, persisted for more than 2 days postoperatively, whereas after doxazosin, it was undetectable on the first postoperative day. Doxazosin provided safe, efficacious pre- and perioperative control of arterial pressure. In patients with predominantly norepinephrine-secreting tumors, pretreatment 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion gave an indication of the daily doxazosin requirement.

### Viagra [^117K7NmE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

In Study 2, a single oral dose of Viagra 50 mg or a matching placebo was administered in a 2-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). After at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin treatment, Viagra 50 mg or a matching placebo was given simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (17 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (3 subjects). The mean age of subjects in this study was 63.9 years.

Twenty subjects received Viagra 50 mg, but only 19 received the matching placebo. One patient discontinued the study prematurely due to an adverse event of hypotension following dosing with Viagra 50 mg. This patient had been taking minoxidil, a potent vasodilator, during the study.

For the 19 subjects who received both Viagra and the placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were calculated.

- **Mean profiles**: The changes from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure for subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 50 mg Viagra or matching placebo are illustrated in Figure 3.

- **Figure 3: Mean standing systolic blood pressure change from baseline**

Blood pressure was measured after administration of Viagra at the same times as specified for the first doxazosin study. There were two subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure of less than 85 mmHg. In these two subjects, hypotension was reported as a moderately severe adverse event, beginning approximately 1 hour after administration of Viagra 50 mg and resolving after approximately 7.5 hours.

### Cardura XL [^1128Q4Hk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Read this patient information leaflet before you start taking Cardura XL and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

- **What is Cardura XL**: Cardura XL is a prescription medicine called an "alpha-blocker". Cardura XL is used to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It may help to relax the muscles in the prostate and the bladder, which may lessen the symptoms of BPH and improve urine flow.

- **Before prescribing Cardura XL**: Your healthcare provider may examine your prostate gland and perform a blood test called a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test to check for prostate cancer. Prostate cancer and BPH can cause the same symptoms. Prostate cancer requires a different treatment.

Some medicines called "alpha-blockers" are used to treat high blood pressure. Cardura XL is not for the treatment of high blood pressure.

It is not known if Cardura XL is safe and effective in children.

- **Who should not take Cardura XL**: Do not take Cardura XL if you are allergic to doxazosin, other medications called quinazolines, or any of the ingredients in Cardura XL. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in Cardura XL.

### A double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating the onset of action of doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116bKCEV]. European Urology (2005). High credibility.

To determine the onset of improvement in benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, patients were treated with doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (DOX GITS) versus placebo. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, baseline values, including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urine flow rate (Q(max)), were determined following a 2-week placebo run-in. Patients received DOX GITS 4 mg/d (n = 108) or placebo (n = 105) for 14 days. IPSS was measured on Days 3, 7, and 14; Q(max) was measured on Days 1, 3, 7, and 14; and the patients' perception of improvement was assessed on Days 1 and 2 in the evening at home, and in the office on Day 14.

Significantly more patients treated with DOX GITS than placebo perceived improvement after Day 1 (60.6% vs. 41.9%) through Day 14 (84.3% vs. 64.1%). On Day 1, improvement in Q(max) with DOX GITS was not significantly different compared to placebo. By Day 3 of the trial:

- **IPSS improvement**: Significantly greater with DOX GITS than with placebo.
- **Proportion of patients with ≥ 30% improvement in IPSS**: Significantly greater with DOX GITS (49.5%) than placebo (28.4%) and remained so through Day 14.
- **Improvement in Q(max)**: Significantly greater with DOX GITS (3.7 mL/s) than placebo (1.9 mL/s) and remained so through Day 14.
- **Proportion of patients with ≥ 3 mL/s increase in Q(max)**: Statistically greater with DOX GITS (54.4%) versus placebo (30.8%) and remained so through Day 14.

DOX GITS significantly improved IPSS and Q(max) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^113c36eX]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

- **Summary**: Optimal drug treatment for patients with resistant hypertension remains undefined. This study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that resistant hypertension is most commonly caused by excessive sodium retention, and as such, spironolactone would be superior to non-diuretic add-on drugs in reducing blood pressure.

- **Background**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we enrolled patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater (or ≥ 135 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and home systolic blood pressure (18 readings over 4 days) of 130 mm Hg or greater. This was despite treatment for at least 3 months with maximally tolerated doses of three drugs, recruited from 12 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK.

- **Methods**: Patients rotated, in a preassigned, randomised order, through 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with each of spironolactone (25–50 mg), bisoprolol (5–10 mg), doxazosin modified release (4–8 mg), and placebo, alongside their baseline blood pressure medications. Random assignment was conducted via a central computer system. Both investigators and patients were masked to the identity of the drugs and their sequence allocation. The dosage was doubled after 6 weeks of each cycle. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in averaged home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and placebo, followed (if significant) by the difference between spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs, and finally by the difference between spironolactone and each of the individual active drugs.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of doxazosin mesylate PO (also known as Cardura):

- **Increased serum doxazosin levels**: Use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor for hypotension.

- **Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome**: Use caution in patients undergoing cataract surgery.

- **Mask symptoms of prostate cancer**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as prostate cancer can present with symptoms of BPH, and the two disorders frequently coexist. Exclude prostate cancer before initiating doxazosin.

- **Orthostatic hypotension, syncope**: Use caution in all patients, especially those taking PDE5 inhibitors.

- **Priapism**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving doxazosin.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111CT4G5]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

One hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is predominantly caused by sodium retention, partly due to the reduced doses of diuretics prescribed in recent years; if so, drugs with diuretic action would be the most effective additional treatment. An alternative hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is a heterogeneous state, with average responses in study cohorts masking substantial individual patient differences. In the latter case, treatment could be stratified by the use of biomarkers of sodium/volume status, particularly plasma renin level, to which sodium status is inversely related.

We selected spironolactone as the drug with diuretic action (through blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor) because of observational and limited randomised controlled trial data suggesting good blood pressure-lowering efficacy in resistant hypertension, recently summarised in a meta-analysis. However, spironolactone has not been compared with alternative drugs recommended for resistant hypertension. Thus, it has been unknown whether spironolactone is the most effective treatment, and if so, whether this applies to a subset of patients or the majority. We aimed to compare spironolactone with alternative fourth-line treatments targeting different pathogenetic mechanisms: the α1-adrenoceptor blocker, doxazosin, acting to reduce peripheral resistance, and the β1-adrenoceptor blocker, bisoprolol, which inhibits the release of renin and reduces cardiac output. Our primary aim was to determine, for the first time, whether spironolactone is overall the most effective add-on drug treatment.

- **Cimetidine**: In healthy volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin, and a slight but not significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin.

In vitro data in human plasma indicate that Cardura has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^113enLcA]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists (alpha-1 antagonists) are frequently used medications in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in the management of therapy-resistant arterial hypertension, two conditions frequently found in older adults. This systematic review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in individuals aged 65 and older. The goal is to derive recommendations for the safe application of alpha-1 antagonists in older adults based on the evidence found.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was performed (last updated March 25, 2022), including multiple databases (Medline/PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library) and using the PICOS framework to define search terms. Two independent reviewers conducted the selection of studies in a two-step approach, followed by systematic data extraction. Quality appraisal for each study was performed using standardized appraisal tools. The studies retrieved and additional literature were used to develop recommendations, which were then rated for strength and quality according to the GRADE methodology.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included: three meta-analyses, six randomized controlled trials, and nine observational trials. Doxazosin in the management of arterial hypertension was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure, compared to chlorthalidone. Regarding treatment of LUTS suggestive of BPH, alpha-1 antagonists appeared to be effective in therapy.

### Proscar [^111N2rEG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment with Proscar, doxazosin, or the combination of Proscar with doxazosin, reduced the mean symptom score from baseline at year 4. The results of MTOPS are consistent with the findings of the 4-year, placebo-controlled study PLESS [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], in that treatment with Proscar reduces the risk of acute urinary retention and the need for BPH-related surgery. In MTOPS, the risk of developing acute urinary retention was reduced by 67% in patients treated with Proscar compared to patients treated with placebo (0.8% for Proscar and 2.4% for placebo). Also, the risk of requiring BPH-related invasive therapy was reduced by 64% in patients treated with Proscar compared to patients treated with placebo (2.0% for Proscar and 5.4% for placebo).

- **Summary of clinical studies**: The data from these studies show improvement in BPH-related symptoms, reduction in treatment failure (BPH-related urological events), increased maximum urinary flow rates, and decreasing prostate volume, suggesting that Proscar arrests the disease process of BPH in men with an enlarged prostate.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^1134CPSd]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

PATHWAY-2 is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial to compare different blood pressure-lowering treatments in rigorously assessed patients with resistant hypertension, and the first comparison of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with alternative recommended classes that block the sympathetic nervous system (α blockers and β blockers). The size, crossover design, and hierarchical primary endpoints of PATHWAY-2 enabled demonstration at high significance (p < 0.0001) that spironolactone 25–50 mg/day is by far the most effective drug added to A + C + D for the treatment of resistant hypertension; blood pressure was controlled (home systolic blood pressure < 135 mm Hg) in 60% of patients. The role of sodium retention in causing resistant hypertension was strongly suggested by a low baseline plasma renin, despite treatment with three drugs which usually elevate renin, and by a significant inverse correlation between renin and blood pressure reduction by spironolactone. The individual crossover data show that spironolactone is the most effective add-on drug, by a large margin, in the overwhelming majority of patients confirmed as adherent, but resistant, to treatment with A + C + D.

The unequivocal superiority of spironolactone, together with supportive efficacy and safety data from longer-term observational studies, should influence treatment guidelines globally.

### Clinical ease of using doxazosin in BPH patients with and without hypertension [^114LAQNJ]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that doxazosin therapy reduced blood pressure (BP) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who were hypertensive at baseline, but not in patients who were physiologically or pharmacologically normotensive at baseline. In patients with BPH and uncontrolled hypertension, despite treatment with other antihypertensive drugs, the addition of doxazosin resulted in improved control with significant reductions in BP. The new formulation, doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), is initiated at a therapeutic dose, simplifying dose titration. Based on its efficacy and pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, doxazosin GITS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for normotensive and hypertensive patients with BPH.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^117EDv5q]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Use of doxazosin should not be considered as a first-line medication for the management of arterial hypertension. The use of alpha-1 antagonists in the management of LUTS suggestive of BPH appears promising in reducing urinary symptoms. Thus, the safety profile of different agents must be carefully assessed in a patient-oriented manner. Long-term safety and efficacy remain questionable, and an assessment of efficacy and safety profiles in comparison with other classes of drugs could not be performed.

Even though many older adults suffer from hypertension and a majority of older men experience LUTS from BPH, only eighteen eligible studies could be identified, primarily due to age restrictions, with only two of them being placebo-controlled randomized trials. This highlights the lack of evidence for older adults, although a large portion of medical interventions is performed in this age class. Additionally, randomized controlled trials with extended follow-up periods are needed to assess the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in long-term use, providing an enhanced understanding of the real-world use of these medications. To complete the picture of the management of LUTS suggestive of BPH in people aged 65 and older, it would be desirable for future research to focus on comparisons and combinations of different classes of drugs.

### Do we know everything about alpha-blockade in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms [^117ADtHD]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as tamsulosin, relieve voiding and filling LUTS. Improvement of the voiding ('obstructive') symptoms is related to alpha(1A)-related desobstruction. Improvement of the filling ('irritative') symptoms may be related to reduction of alpha(1D) (and alpha(1A))-related obstruction. Blockade of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors in the human prostate may be required for reduction of obstruction and improvement of related voiding symptoms and urinary flow. Blockade of alpha(1D) (and alpha(1A))-adrenoceptors in the human bladder may, in addition, be required to relieve filling LUTS. These concepts should be evaluated further before definitive conclusions can be drawn. If definitely proven, this could mean that alpha-blockers have to be considered to not only act on BPH (the causative disease) but also (and perhaps more) on the target organ, the bladder. Early treatment could have a protective effect on the bladder, and chronic treatment could prevent hypertrophic bladder modification.

### Proscar [^117T5WPf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Proscar may be administered with or without meals. For monotherapy, one tablet (5 mg) should be taken once a day [see clinical studies (14.1)]. When used in combination with the alpha-blocker doxazosin, one tablet (5 mg) is also taken once daily [see clinical studies (14.2)].

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^112HKpyL]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Spironolactone substantially increased the likelihood of achieving blood pressure control relative to bisoprolol or doxazosin, with almost 60% of participants achieving blood pressure control within three months of starting treatment. This challenges the concept that resistant hypertension cannot be treated adequately with existing drug therapies, a concept that might have contributed to the growth of non-drug-based therapies such as renal denervation. Indeed, only 15 out of 285 patients assessed on spironolactone failed to achieve a home systolic blood pressure lower than 150 mm Hg (equivalent to a clinic systolic blood pressure of roughly 160 mm Hg), the usual eligibility criterion for denervation.

Furthermore, it is clear from our data that spironolactone, unlike bisoprolol or doxazosin, exhibited a significant dose response regarding the magnitude of blood pressure lowering. A previous crossover comparison of spironolactone with even higher doses (i.e. 50–100 mg) in patients without resistant hypertension also showed a dose response, suggesting that the highest dose of spironolactone used in our study (i.e. 50 mg) might not be at the top of the dose range, and hence there is the potential for even better control rates with higher doses.

The superior response to spironolactone, compared to the other drugs, particularly in patients at the lower end of the distribution of plasma renin, supports the hypothesis that the predominant cause of resistant hypertension is sodium retention. The fact that spironolactone was the most effective drug across a wide range of baseline plasma renin values does not diminish its efficacy.

### Doxazosin, an alpha1-adrenergic antihypertensive agent, decreases serum oxidized LDL [^116Lqbwb]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is known to play an important role in atherogenesis through the recruitment of monocytes into vessel walls and the deposition of cholesterol ester in macrophages, which leads to the formation of lipid-rich plaque. It was previously assumed that only trace amounts of ox-LDL were present in plasma because its half-life was only a few minutes. Recently, through the use of a monoclonal antibody against ox-LDL, a quantitative method to measure serum ox-LDL concentration has been developed.

Metabolites of doxazosin, an alpha1-adrenergic antihypertensive agent, have been reported to inhibit the oxidation of LDL in vitro. In this study, we investigated the in vivo effect of doxazosin on LDL oxidation using this new method to measure serum ox-LDL concentration. After administering doxazosin for 1 to 2 months, the serum concentration of ox-LDL decreased significantly (P < .05). Although the reduction of ox-LDL concentration does not strictly indicate doxazosin's antiatherosclerotic effect, it may constitute one of its additional weapons besides lowering blood pressure and serum lipid values in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

### Inhibition of mitogenic signaling and induction of apoptosis in human bladder smooth muscle cells treated with doxazosin [^113L1vHj]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The alpha1 antagonist doxazosin is used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms and is believed to function primarily as a smooth muscle relaxant. However, doxazosin has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in nonbladder smooth muscle. Consequently, we examined the effects of doxazosin on human bladder smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and apoptosis.

Primary human bladder SMCs were cultured in M199 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) until they reached 65% confluency. They were then made quiescent by serum starvation in M199 with 0.4% FBS for 24 hours. The quiescent bladder SMCs were pretreated for 30 minutes with doxazosin or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) and then stimulated with 10% FBS for 24 hours. Measurement of 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake by flow cytometry was used to determine the effect of doxazosin on cell cycle progression. Western immunoblot was used to examine cell cycle protein expression and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and cyclin A, both of which regulate cell cycle progression.

Cellular proliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by doxazosin. There was nearly a 50% decrease in BrdU uptake at 10 μM doxazosin and an approximately 90% decrease in BrdU at 25 μM doxazosin. Notably, doxazosin inhibited phosphorylation of Rb and expression of cyclin A, both of which are necessary for cell cycle progression. At concentrations of 25 μM doxazosin or greater, apoptosis was induced in the bladder SMCs, as indicated by an increase in sub G1 DNA content.

Patient information about terazosin capsules, USP Rx only

Generic Name: Terazosin (Ter-A-so-sin)

When used to treat hypertension or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

Please read this leaflet before you start taking terazosin capsules, and make sure to refer to it each time you receive a new prescription. This leaflet is a summary and should not replace a full discussion with your doctor, who has more detailed information about terazosin capsules. It is important to discuss terazosin capsules and your condition with your doctor before starting the medication and during your regular checkups.

Terazosin capsules are prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension). They are also used to manage benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. This leaflet provides information on the use of terazosin capsules for hypertension or BPH.

- **What is hypertension (high blood pressure)**: Blood pressure refers to the force of blood within blood vessels. When blood is pumped with excessive force, or the blood vessels are too narrow, the pressure against the walls of the vessels increases. Without treatment, this elevated pressure can damage blood vessels over time, cause the heart to overwork, and potentially reduce blood flow to critical organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, leading to damage and dysfunction. By controlling high blood pressure, the likelihood of such damage occurring is reduced.

### Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and a baseline total prostate volume of 25 mL or greater [^112jZL65]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We examined data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial to determine the relationship between baseline TPV and the effect of medical therapy in men with LUTS secondary to BPH.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 3,047 patients with LUTS were randomized to placebo, 4 to 8 mg doxazosin, 5 mg finasteride, or the combination of doxazosin and finasteride. The average treatment duration was 4.5 years. The primary outcome was time to overall clinical progression of BPH, defined as a confirmed 4-point or greater increase in AUA SS, acute urinary retention, incontinence, renal insufficiency, or urinary tract infection. Secondary outcomes were the need for invasive therapy for BPH, and changes in AUA SS and the maximum urinary flow rate with time. TPV was measured by transrectal ultrasound at baseline and study end.

- **Results**: In patients with a small prostate (baseline TPV less than 25 ml), combination therapy was no better than doxazosin alone for decreasing the risk of clinical progression of BPH, the need for invasive therapy, as well as improving AUA SS and the maximum urinary flow rate. However, in patients with moderate size (25 to less than 40 ml) or enlarged (40 mL or greater) glands, combination therapy led to a clinical benefit in these outcomes that was superior to that of doxazosin or finasteride.

- **Conclusions**: Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride led to a greater decrease in the risk of clinical progression of BPH than either drug alone in patients with LUTS with a baseline TPV of 25 mL or greater.

### Carduraxl [^116Qv5pn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug-drug interactions**: No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed to assess the effect of concomitant medications on the pharmacokinetics of Cardura XL or to assess the effect of Cardura XL on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. In vitro studies suggest that doxazosin is a substrate of CYP 3A4. Caution should be exercised when concomitantly administering Cardura XL with a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, such as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole.

	- In one placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin IR on day 1 of a four-day regimen of cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in the mean AUC of doxazosin, a 6% increase in mean Cmax of doxazosin, and no significant change in the mean half-life of doxazosin. Based on the differences in dose and formulation, the applicability of these results to Cardura XL is unknown. Otherwise, the interaction potential with other inhibitors or substrates of CYP enzymes has not been determined. Pharmacodynamic interactions between Cardura XL and anti-hypertensive medications or other vasodilating agents have also not been determined. Finally, drugs that reduce gastrointestinal motility leading to markedly prolonged GI retention times (e.g. anticholinergic agents) may increase systemic exposure to doxazosin.

- **Use in specific populations**:

	- **Geriatric**: In a study to assess the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of Cardura XL, increases of 27% in plasma concentration were observed.

### ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 gene transcription is downregulated by activator protein 2alpha. Doxazosin inhibits activator protein 2alpha and increases high-density lipoprotein biogenesis independent of alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade [^111KKHMd]. Circulation Research (2007). High credibility.

ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a rate-limiting factor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis. The ABCA1 gene expression is known to be upregulated by various transcriptional factors. However, negative regulation factors would be better targets for pharmacological modulation of HDL biogenesis. Doxazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blocker, increased ABCA1 mRNA, its protein, and apolipoprotein A-I-mediated HDL biogenesis in THP-1 macrophages and CHO-K1 cells, independent of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade.

Analysis of the human ABCA1 promoter indicated that the region between the positions -368 and -147 contains an activator protein (AP)2-binding site responsible for the effects of doxazosin. Overexpression of AP2alpha inhibited ABCA1 transcription in a dose-dependent fashion. Mutation in the AP2-binding site caused an increase in the basal promoter activity and canceled both the transactivation by doxazosin and the trans-repression by AP2alpha.

Doxazosin had no effect on ABCA1 mRNA level in HepG2 cells, which lack endogenous AP2alpha, and it reversed the inhibitory effect of AP2alpha expression in this type of cell. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays revealed that doxazosin reduced the specific binding of AP2alpha to the ABCA1 promoter, as it suppressed the phosphorylation of AP2alpha. Finally, doxazosin increased ABCA1 expression and plasma HDL in mice. We thus concluded that AP2alpha negatively regulates the ABCA1 gene transcription. Doxazosin inhibits AP2alpha activity independent of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade and increases the ABCA1 expression.

### Novel quinazoline-based compounds impair prostate tumorigenesis by targeting tumor vascularity [^113zfp67]. Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Previous evidence showed the ability of the quinazoline-based alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonist, doxazosin, to suppress prostate tumor growth via apoptosis. In this study, we carried out structural optimization of the chemical nucleus of doxazosin and conducted a subsequent structure-function analysis toward developing a novel class of apoptosis-inducing and angiogenesis-targeting agents. Our lead compound, DZ-50, was effective at reducing endothelial cell viability via a nonapoptotic mechanism. Treatment with DZ-50 effectively prevented in vitro tube formation and in vivo chorioallantoic membrane vessel development. Confocal microscopy revealed a significantly reduced ability of tumor cells to attach to the extracellular matrix and migrate through endothelial cells in the presence of DZ-50.

In vivo tumorigenicity studies using two androgen-independent human prostate cancer xenografts, PC-3 and DU-145, showed that DZ-50 treatment leads to significant suppression of tumorigenic growth. Exposure to the drug at the time of tumor cell inoculation led to the prevention of prostate cancer initiation. Furthermore, DZ-50 resulted in a reduced formation of prostate-tumor derived metastatic lesions to the lungs in an in vivo spontaneous metastasis assay. Thus, our drug discovery approach led to the development of a class of lead quinazoline-based compounds with higher potency than doxazosin in suppressing prostate growth by targeting tissue vascularity. This new class of quinazoline-based compounds provides considerable promise as antitumor drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

### Effects of the inverse alpha-agonist doxazosin in allergic rhinitis [^113RgjAL]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

We examined the paradoxical hypothesis that the alpha-receptor inverse agonist doxazosin might produce beneficial effects in allergic rhinitis.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate single and chronic dosing effects of doxazosin on nasal airflow and symptoms in allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: Fifteen patients were randomized to receive 3–5 weeks of oral doxazosin 4 mg daily or a placebo in a crossover fashion. Measurements were taken at baseline and after the first and last doses.

- **Results**: There was a fall in peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) between baseline and the first dose of doxazosin: mean difference of -19 L/min (95% CI -35 to -2) P = 0.03, with recovery between the first and last doses: 21 L/min (95% CI 7–34) P = 0.006. Nasal visual analogue scale (VAS) and blockage scores were worse between baseline and the first dose of doxazosin: mean difference VAS -10 mm (95% CI -18 to -2) P = 0.02, blockage -0.7 (95% CI -1.3 to -0.1) P = 0.02, with recovery between the first and last doses: VAS 15 mm (95% CI 4–25) P = 0.009, blockage 1.1 (95% CI 0.5–1.6) P = 0.001. The oxymetazoline dose-response for PNIF was blunted after single versus chronic dosing with doxazosin: mean difference -17 L/min (95% CI -30 to -4) P = 0.01. Heart rate and diastolic blood pressure showed the same pattern. There was a significant difference between doxazosin and placebo for nasal blockage score and heart rate after single but not chronic dosing.

- **Conclusions**: There was a disconnect between single and chronic dosing effects of doxazosin for nasal symptoms, oxymetazoline response, and cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting alpha-1 receptor involvement without full resolution.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^116s5wjL]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Our study also has a number of strengths. The patients in this study were particularly well-characterized as resistant hypertension, with the use of home blood pressure monitoring to exclude so-called white coat hypertension. Standardization of background medication (A + C + D), directly observed therapy to exclude patients non-compliant with background medication, measurement of serum ACE to allow retrospective confirmation of the expected difference in distribution between patients receiving an ACE inhibitor or ARB as one of their background drugs, and oversight by national specialist hypertension centers to exclude secondary hypertension were all implemented.

In the late stages of the study, we incorporated a new assay for monitoring all commonly administered antihypertensive drugs in patients' urine and will report results from this substudy that strongly support a high adherence rate among our patients. Another strength was the design of the study, which incorporated a random crossover design, allowing each patient's best drug to be determined and predictive testing of this to be assessed. Mechanistic haemodynamic substudies, which could add to the predictive value of renin and help us to understand the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension, were included at most sites and will be reported separately. Finally, this was the first randomised controlled trial directly comparing different active drug treatments in resistant hypertension, and it produced an unequivocal result.

The results of PATHWAY-2 have broad international relevance because of convergent guideline recommendations, which reflect…

### Discontinuation of alpha-blockade after initial treatment with finasteride and doxazosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and clinical evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111xfvVP]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the effect of discontinuation of alpha-blockade and continuation of finasteride in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostates receiving combination treatment, and to explore whether the alpha-blocker dose influences the ability to discontinue it, we conducted a study with the following methods and results:

- **Methods**: We treated 272 consecutive men with a prostate size greater than 40 g and an American Urological Association symptom score greater than 20 with 5 mg finasteride and 2 mg doxazosin daily. Two hundred forty men reported a favorable response to therapy, defined as any reduction in symptom score and toleration of the medications. The dose was maintained at 2 mg doxazosin in 100 men, titrated to 4 mg in 80 patients, and to 8 mg in an additional 60 patients. We discontinued doxazosin at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months while continuing finasteride, then re-evaluated the patients 1 month later to determine whether any worsening of symptoms had resulted.

- **Results**: In patients discontinuing doxazosin at 3 months, success (defined as no increase in symptom score and no desire to resume doxazosin) was reported by 20%, 15%, and 13% of those taking 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively. At 6 months, success was reported by 48%, 45%, and 40%. At 9 months, success was reported by 84%, 80%, and 73%. At 12 months, success was reported by 84%, 85%, and 87% for the 2, 4, and 8 mg groups, respec

### Quinazoline-derived alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists induce prostate cancer cell apoptosis via an alpha1-adrenoceptor-independent action [^114iCkhB]. Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that the quinazoline-based alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists, doxazosin and terazosin, exhibit a potent apoptotic effect against prostate tumor epithelial cells, whereas tamsulosin, a sulfonamide-based alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, was ineffective in inducing a similar apoptotic effect against prostate cells. In this study, to identify the precise molecular mechanism underlying this apoptosis induction, we examined whether doxazosin and terazosin (both piperazinyl quinazolines) affect prostate growth via an alpha1-adrenoceptor-independent action.

Transfection-mediated overexpression of alpha1-adrenoceptor in human prostate cancer cells, DU-145 (which lack alpha1-adrenoceptor), did not alter the ability of prostate cancer cells to undergo apoptosis in response to quinazolines. Significantly, there was no modification of the apoptotic threshold of the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, to either quinazoline-based alpha1-agonist by androgens. Furthermore, human normal prostate epithelial cells exhibited a very low sensitivity to the apoptotic effects of doxazosin compared with that observed for the malignant prostate cells.

These findings provide the first evidence that the apoptotic activity of the quinazoline-based alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists (doxazosin and terazosin) against prostate cancer cells is independent of:

- **Their capacity to antagonize alpha1-adrenoceptors**
- **The hormone sensitivity status of the cells**:

This may have potential therapeutic significance in the use of quinazol…

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^116yeyjM]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

The medical treatment of older adults comes with many challenges. On the one hand, it is known that pharmacodynamics as well as pharmacokinetics differ between younger patients and older patients, leading to an increased risk of developing adverse drug events (ADEs) among the elderly. On the other hand, older adults are more frequently affected by multimorbidity, which may result in polypharmacy. This, in turn, increases the risk of ADEs, adverse drug interactions, and possibly hospitalization. The versions of diverse national potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) lists are inconclusive on how to categorize alpha-1 antagonists. Doxazosin is included in three PIM lists, two of which also include terazosin. However, the PIM lists of Austria, France, and Canada do not include any of the alpha-1 antagonists.

In light of the above, it seems overdue to summarize and synthesize the evidence available on the treatment of the elderly with alpha-1 antagonists. An aging population, associated with an expected substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the near future, will lead to an increased use of alpha-1 antagonists in patients older than 65 years. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the effectiveness and safety of alpha-1 antagonists in these patients and to develop recommendations on when to discontinue or reduce the dose of alpha-1 antagonists to prevent inappropriate prescribing.

To the best of our knowledge, so far no systematic review has analyzed the specific evidence on the use of alpha-1 antagonists in the aged population.

### Viagra [^11468euS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

In the third study, a single oral dose of Viagra 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 3-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH.

- **Study design**: In dose period 1, subjects were administered open-label doxazosin and a single dose of Viagra 50 mg simultaneously, after at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin. If a subject did not successfully complete this first dosing period, he was discontinued from the study. Subjects who had successfully completed the previous doxazosin interaction study using Viagra 50 mg, with no significant hemodynamic adverse events, were allowed to skip dose period 1. Treatment with doxazosin continued for at least 7 days after dose period 1. Thereafter, Viagra 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (14 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (6 subjects) in standard crossover fashion. The mean subject age in this study was 66.4 years.

- **Participant screening**: Twenty-five subjects were screened. Two were discontinued after study period 1: one failed to meet pre-dose screening qualifications, and the other experienced symptomatic hypotension as a moderately severe adverse event 30 minutes after dosing with open-label Viagra 50 mg. Of the twenty subjects who were ultimately assigned to treatment, a total of 13 subjects successfully completed dose period 1, and seven had successfully completed the previous doxazosin study using Viagra 50 mg.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^112eWD6x]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists (alpha-1 antagonists) are frequently used medications in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in the management of therapy-resistant arterial hypertension, two conditions frequently found in older adults. This systematic review aims to present a complete overview of evidence regarding the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in people aged 65 and older and to derive recommendations for the safe application of alpha-1 antagonists in older adults from the evidence found.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was performed (last updated March 25th, 2022), including multiple databases (Medline/PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library), and using the PICOS framework to define search terms. The selection of studies was done by two independent reviewers in a two-step approach, followed by systematic data extraction. Quality appraisal was performed for each study included using standardized appraisal tools. The studies retrieved and additional literature were used for the development of recommendations, which were rated for strength and quality according to the GRADE methodology.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included: 3 meta-analyses, 6 randomized controlled trials, and 9 observational trials. Doxazosin in the management of arterial hypertension was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure, than chlorthalidone. Regarding the treatment of LUTS suggestive of BPH, alpha-1 antagonists appeared to be effective in the management of these symptoms.

### Controlled-release doxazosin in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115zjLEq]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of controlled-release doxazosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

In this open-label, noncontrolled, observational surveillance study, 3,684 men with BPH received 4–8 mg of controlled-release doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) for six months. Out of these participants, 3,283 (89.1%) completed the trial. Researchers assessed changes in urinary symptoms and quality of life using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Blood pressure and adverse events were also evaluated.

After six months of treatment, doxazosin GITS resulted in significant improvements in IPSS. Blood pressure was reduced only among hypertensive patients. Doxazosin GITS was well tolerated.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^116y7CLw]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: PATHWAY-2 is the first randomised controlled trial to compare spironolactone with other blood pressure-lowering drug treatments in a well-characterised population of patients with resistant hypertension. The study shows that spironolactone was by far the most effective blood pressure-lowering treatment for patients with resistant hypertension.

This was true in terms of the magnitude of the blood pressure response, the proportion of patients achieving a stringent measure of blood pressure control (home systolic blood pressure < 135 mm Hg), and the proportion in whom it was more effective than either of the non-diuretic alternative drugs. These findings suggest that the predominant underlying pathophysiological cause of resistant hypertension is sodium retention, despite existing baseline diuretic therapy.

This conclusion is supported by our finding that the response to spironolactone had a clear inverse relation with plasma renin, was especially effective at lower plasma renin levels, and yet the most effective drug throughout the range of plasma renin.

### Association of glycolysis-enhancing α-1 blockers with risk of developing Parkinson disease [^112Dqkjg]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

- **Question**: Is the use of glycolysis-enhancing drugs, such as terazosin, doxazosin, and alfuzosin, associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson disease compared with the use of tamsulosin, a drug prescribed for similar indications but which does not enhance glycolysis?

- **Findings**: In this cohort study of 147,248 propensity score–matched pairs of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin users and tamsulosin users from Danish nationwide health registries and the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan, the use of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin was associated with a 12% to 37% decrease in Parkinson disease risk compared with the use of tamsulosin.

- **Meaning**: Use of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin may lower the risk of developing Parkinson disease.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^115FuQo3]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that spironolactone is the most effective add-on treatment for patients with resistant hypertension. The primary analysis used an average of home systolic blood pressure recorded throughout the treatment cycle. We prespecified hierarchical primary endpoints: (1) the difference in the home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and placebo, followed, if significant, by (2) the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs (doxazosin and bisoprolol), followed, if significant, by (3) the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and each of the other two active drugs.

- **Secondary objectives**: Included evaluation of clinic blood pressure responses to randomized treatments; blood pressure control rates, i.e. home systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg; whether plasma renin concentrations and other baseline characteristics could help personalize treatment by predicting the best drug treatment; and adverse event rates during each treatment cycle.

To test the hypothesis that plasma renin (measured on a background of three drugs — i.e. A + C + D) will predict the most effective fourth-line drug, we examined the relationship between plasma renin and the reduction of home systolic blood pressure with each drug, adjusted for the placebo response. We also identified the best treatment for each patient — i.e. the one on which they achieved the lowest blood pressure — and estimated for each drug the relationship between blood pressure outcomes and plasma renin levels.

### Alpha blockers: Are all created equal [^117QyjRV]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Drug therapy with alpha blockers has become the standard treatment for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Medical treatment is often preferred by patients compared to minimally invasive therapy or transurethral resection of the prostate. Alpha blockers reduce urethral pressure by blocking the motor sympathetic adrenergic nerve supply to the prostate. Several alpha blockers are available for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including alfuzosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. Different meta-analyses have shown these agents to be comparable in terms of efficacy in improving symptom scores and increasing urinary flow rates. The clinical uroselectivity of these agents differs, however, and translates into differences in side effects. Side effects that have been reported with some alpha blockers include dizziness, headache, postural hypotension, and retrograde ejaculation.

### Double-blind trial of the efficacy and tolerability of doxazosin in the gastrointestinal therapeutic system, doxazosin standard, and placebo in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111GnwjY]. European Urology (2000). Low credibility.

The alpha(1)-blocker doxazosin mesylate is an established efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, its clinical utility can be limited by the need for multiple titration steps, starting at an initial dose of 1 mg and increasing up to 8 mg once daily to achieve optimal therapeutic response. A new controlled-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin mesylate enhances the pharmacokinetic profile and drug delivery rate, reducing the plasma doxazosin mesylate peak-to-trough ratio and minimizing the need for titration.

- **Objective**: A study was conducted to assess the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily, doxazosin standard 1 mg to 8 mg once daily, and placebo in 795 men with BPH. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter Scandinavian study included a 2-week washout period, a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in phase, and a 13-week double-blind treatment phase. Doxazosin GITS was initiated at 4 mg once daily and titrated to 8 mg once daily after 7 weeks, if indicated. Doxazosin standard was initiated at 1 mg once daily, titrated to 2 mg after 1 week, 4 mg at 3 weeks, and to 8 mg at 7 weeks if indicated to achieve symptom control. The primary outcome measures were mean changes from baseline to the final visit for International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) and maximum urinary flow rate adjusted for baseline values.

- **Results**: Both doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard significantly improved the symptoms of BPH, as evidenced by least-squares mean reductions in total I-PSS of -8.0.

### Terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin: Current clinical experience [^112SR4WU]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction are common in aging men. Nearly 25% of men over 40 years of age experience LUTS. Medical therapy with alpha-blockade is the most common method of treating benign prostatic obstruction. In the past decade, multiple minimally invasive surgical therapies have been introduced. These methods include balloon dilatation, temporary and permanent urethral stents, various laser techniques, microwave thermotherapy, transurethral needle ablation, electrovaporization, and high-intensity focused ultrasound.

Alpha-receptor blockers, which reduce the sympathetic tone of the prostate, are considered first-line therapy for relieving symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Selective alpha(1)-receptor blockers relax prostatic smooth muscle, relieve bladder outlet obstruction, and enhance urine flow with fewer side effects. Additionally, treating patients with alpha-blockers has been shown to increase prostatic apoptosis.

The pharmacokinetic activity, mode of action, clinical efficacy, and side effects of the selective alpha(1)-receptor blockers terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin are reviewed.

### Prostate transition zone fibrosis is associated with clinical progression in the MTOPS study [^113iqo4B]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Medications targeting androgen receptor activity (e.g. finasteride) or smooth muscle contractility (e.g. doxazosin) do not resolve lower urinary tract symptoms indicative of lower urinary tract dysfunction in an important subgroup of men. Recently, fibrosis has been implicated as another pathobiology contributing to male lower urinary tract symptoms, but to our knowledge, no systematic studies have been done to assess fibrosis in the context of medical treatment. We determine whether fibrotic changes in the prostate transition zone are associated with an increased risk of clinical progression in participants treated with doxazosin, finasteride, or finasteride plus doxazosin in the MTOPS (Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms) study.

- **Materials and methods**: Transition zone biopsy tissues from men who did or did not experience clinical progression on placebo, doxazosin, finasteride, or combination therapy were assessed for collagen content and architectural changes using picrosirius red birefringence and CT-FIRE (Curvelet Transform-Fiber Extraction) analysis. Correlations were made with annotated demographic and clinical data. Statistical analyses were done with the Pearson correlation coefficient, ANOVA, and the t-test.

- **Results**: High levels of wavy, aligned prostate transition zone collagen significantly correlated with an increased risk of clinical progression among MTOPS trial participants treated with doxazosin plus finasteride, particularly those with a high body mass index.

- **Conclusions**: Fibrotic changes in the prostate transition zone are associated with an increased risk of clinical progression.

### Terazosin [^115AeLUK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

There are three main treatment options for BPH:

- Program of monitoring or "watchful waiting": Some men have an enlarged prostate gland without noticeable symptoms, or symptoms that are not bothersome. In such cases, you and your doctor may decide on a monitoring program, which includes regular checkups instead of medication or surgery.

- **Medication**: Various medications are used to treat BPH. Your doctor has prescribed Terazosin Capsules for you. Refer to the section "What Terazosin Capsules do to treat BPH" below.

- **Surgery**: Some patients may require surgery. Your doctor can describe several surgical procedures to treat BPH, with the choice of procedure depending on your symptoms and medical condition.

- **What Terazosin Capsules do to treat BPH**: Terazosin Capsules relax the tightness of a certain type of muscle in the prostate and at the opening of the bladder. This relaxation may increase urine flow and/or decrease the symptoms you are experiencing. Terazosin Capsules alleviate the symptoms of BPH but do not change the size of the prostate, which may continue to grow. However, an enlarged prostate does not necessarily cause more or worse symptoms.

If Terazosin Capsules are effective for you, an improvement in your symptoms should be noticeable within 2 to 4 weeks of starting the medication. Even if Terazosin Capsules help, they may not eliminate the need for surgery in the future.

### How carvedilol activates β-adrenoceptors [^111QBzgL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Understanding the mechanism of drug action is not a prerequisite for a drug to obtain approval from regulatory authorities, but it provides a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making throughout all stages of the drug discovery process. Conversely, if the mechanism of drug action remains enigmatic, or if consensus is lacking on how precisely a drug alters the function of its protein target, the molecular basis for therapeutic efficacy will remain obscure.

Carvedilol, a widely prescribed cardiovascular medication, is a case in point. It belongs to a class of drugs known as beta receptor blockers (β-blockers), which are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure. β-blockers are particularly effective in patients where myocardial damage is associated with overstimulation of β-adrenoceptors (βARs). βARs are prototypical class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the targets for the majority of prescription drugs in clinical use. They are also among the most powerful regulators of cardiac function and the primary targets for the endogenous catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which act as neurotransmitters and hormones to control heart rate and blood pressure. β-blockers oppose the stimulating effects of catecholamines, which explains their efficacy in the clinic to reduce heart rate and contractility and, consequently, lower the cardiac oxygen demand.

### Combination therapy with doxazosin and tenoxicam for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms [^115DcaKX]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy, doxazosin plus tenoxicam, and doxazosin alone for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), various combination therapies have been used to increase the efficacy of medical therapy. Alpha blocker agents have been widely used for the treatment of LUTS secondary to BPH.

Fifty-seven patients complaining of LUTS secondary to BPH were enrolled in this clinical trial. They were randomly assigned to receive doxazosin 4 mg or doxazosin 4 mg plus tenoxicam 20 mg. Patients were evaluated for BPH according to the European Association of Urology and American Urological Association clinical guidelines and assessed with the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Patients were reevaluated following a 6-week treatment course. As efficacy parameters, the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS-Quality of Life (IPSS-QoL), maximal urinary flow rates (Q(max)), and average urinary flow rates (AFR) were determined at baseline and again at 6 weeks.

The total IPSS, IPSS-QoL, and OABSS decreased significantly in both the tenoxicam plus doxazosin group and the doxazosin alone group compared with baseline (P < .01). Q(max) and AFR also significantly improved in both groups (P < .01). The improvements in IPSS, IPSS-QoL, and OABSS were significantly better in patients treated with combination therapy (P < .05).

COX-2 inhibitors in combination with an alpha blocker may increase the effectiveness of therapy.

### Piperazine-designed alpha 1A/alpha 1D-adrenoceptor blocker KMUP-1 and doxazosin provide down-regulation of androgen receptor and PSA in prostatic LNCaP cells growth and specifically in xenografts [^111crYBz]. The Prostate (2009). Low credibility.

KMUP-1 has been suggested to be beneficial in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study aims to further investigate whether KMUP-1 and doxazosin prevent prostate cancer cell growth via androgen-dependent as well as androgen-independent pathways in vivo and in vitro.

- **Methods**: KMUP-1's activity on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) was measured by MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The inhibition activities on androgen receptor (AR) and AR-targeting molecular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression by KMUP-1 and doxazosin were measured by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. Furthermore, we confirmed the effects of KMUP-1 on the growth of LNCaP xenografts in nude mice.

- **Results**: KMUP-1 significantly inhibited LNCaP cell growth and induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. KMUP-1 and doxazosin further inhibited the expression of AR and PSA. Treatment of LNCaP cells with KMUP-1 resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic activities, increasing p21 and p27, and decreasing expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK2, and CDK6. Moreover, KMUP-1 activated p53, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caspase-3, but reduced the expression of Bcl-2. Regular administration of KMUP-1 suppressed the LNCaP xenograft tumor growth in nude mice.

- **Conclusion**: These evidences indicate that KMUP-1 and doxazosin inhibit LNCaP cell growth and downregulate the expression of AR and PSA. KMUP-1 might be used as a chemopre…

None of the included meta-analyses met any of the criteria defined in the AMSTAR 2 assessment tool, with the exception of the statement of funding. Neither of the publications provides detailed information on the methodology used. All meta-analyses utilized unpublished information and presumably based their analyses on raw data. Due to a lack of transparency in the calculations performed, the published figures cannot be reconstructed, nor is it possible to assess the homogeneity of the data or the likelihood of publication bias of the included studies. A comprehensible reproduction of the results is therefore not possible.

- **Critical quality appraisal for included meta-analyses according to AMSTAR 2**: The table provides a critical quality appraisal of the included meta-analyses. Key notations are Y for Yes, N for No, U for Unclear, and RoB for Risk of Bias.

The result of the assessment for risk of bias, based on the appraisal of five different categories according to the RoB 2 tool, is shown for each study.

- **Interventional studies**: The overall risk of bias judgment was "low risk" for one study, one study was rated with "some concerns", and four trials were graded as "high risk". Selection bias arising from randomization of the patients raised some concerns in the trial by Gotoh et al. (2005) as baseline characteristics in the categories total IPSS (p-value = 0.088) and prostate volume (p-value = 0.06) were imbalanced between the two interventional groups.

- **Critical quality appraisal for included interventional studies according to the Cochrane Collaboration Tool**: The table provides critical quality appraisals, with LR indicating low risk of bias, HR high risk of bias, and SC some concerns.

### Doxazosin to treat hypertension: It's time to take it personally — a retrospective analysis of 19, 495 patients [^116U5k4S]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of α blockers on the cardiac outcomes of hypertensive patients who underwent myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).

A retrospective analysis of the nuclear cardiology laboratory database was performed. The study group included only hypertensive patients (n = 19,495). The cohort was divided into three groups: a reference group with no α-blocker therapy (n = 17,053), α blockers for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) (n = 1164), and doxazosin for hypertension (HTN) (n = 1258). We used Cox proportional regression models to examine the patient cardiac outcomes (composite of cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction), adjusted for the myocardial perfusion study results. The mean age was 65 ± 11.1 years, 55% were men, and the average follow-up was 79.2 ± 37.3 months.

In univariate analysis, the doxazosin for HTN group had the highest rate of adverse cardiac events compared to the BPH and reference groups (14.1% vs. 11.3% and 8.9%, respectively, P < 0.001). After stratifying for the degree of reversibility of perfusion defect, only individuals with a moderate-to-severe perfusion defect in the doxazosin for HTN group had a significant increase in adverse cardiac events [hazard ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval (1.14–1.98)].

Our data show that doxazosin treatment for HTN is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes only among patients with moderate-to-severe ischemia on myocardial perfusion imaging. Doxazosin and other α blockers appear to be safe in the vast majority of patients with a lesser degree of perfusion defect.

### Determination of the efficiency of 8 mg doxazosin XL treatment in patients with an inadequate response to 4 mg doxazosin XL treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117BnjvS]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective was to compare the efficacy of 4 mg and 8 mg doxazosin XL treatments in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia-related lower urinary tract symptoms and determine the efficiency of 8 mg in those patients with an inadequate response to 4 mg.

- **Methods**: A total of 162 patients were included in this study. Of the patients, 108 were randomized to receive 4 mg doxazosin XL (group 1), and 54 were randomized to receive 8 mg (group 2) treatments. After 1 month of treatment, 31 patients in group 1 whose quality of life (QoL) score was unchanged or had deteriorated were switched to 8 mg doxazosin XL treatment (group 1b).

- **Results**: The mean age was 59.8 years. After 1 month of treatment:
	- The mean alteration in the International Prostate Symptom Score was 3.9 and 5.2 (P = 0.028).
	- For the maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)), it was 3.0 and 3.6 mL/s (P = 0.206).
	- For the QoL score, it was 1.3 and 1.7 (P = 0.038) in groups 1 and 2, respectively.
	- For group 1b, during the period in which the patients were receiving 4 and 8 mg doxazosin XL treatments:
		- The International Prostate Symptom Score changes were 1.3 and 3.6 (P < .001).
		- The Q(max) changes were 1.6 and 3.2 mL/s (P < .019).
		- The QoL changes were 0.4 and 1.8 (P < .001) in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

With no changes in side effects, 8 mg doxazosin XL treatment is an efficient choice for patients who did not have an adequate response to 4 mg doxazosin XL treatment.
