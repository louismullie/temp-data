## Question

Work up for Scheuermanns disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step workup for Scheuermann disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype and case definition. Then, I should verify the history and examination elements that distinguish structural kyphosis from mimics. Next, I will confirm the radiographic cornerstone, including how to measure angles and apply Sørensen criteria. After that, I need to separate Scheuermann kyphosis from postural kyphosis and other pathologies. Finally, I will check functional assessments, severity thresholds, indications for advanced imaging, optional genetics, and follow-up protocols, including pre- and postoperative considerations [^115FDBuN] [^111JQU86].

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition so I do not jump ahead incorrectly. Scheuermann kyphosis is a rigid structural hyperkyphosis characterized radiographically by anterior wedging of at least three contiguous vertebral bodies by 5 degrees or more, usually arising in adolescence and sometimes presenting later, so diagnosis hinges on imaging rather than exam alone, and I should keep that anchor in mind throughout the workup [^114GErmy] [^115FDBuN].

> Now, I need to check the key elements of history that raise suspicion and help with severity and differential. Onset during adolescence with progression around growth spurts, activity-related or axial back pain pattern, neurologic complaints such as weakness or paresthesias that would prompt expedited imaging, shortness of breath in very large thoracic curves, and cosmetic and psychosocial concerns should be documented carefully, and I should also ask about family members with kyphosis or scoliosis given twin data supporting a genetic contribution, while screening for red flags suggesting infection, neoplasm, or metabolic bone disease that can mimic Scheuermann kyphosis [^113tVDHn] [^116hJrst].

> Hold on, let me verify the physical exam approach so I do not overcall flexibility. I should inspect sagittal alignment for exaggerated thoracic kyphosis and compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis, evaluate flexibility with hyperextension to distinguish postural roundback from a structural curve, perform a focused neurological examination, and consider respiratory evaluation when deformity is severe or apex is high; a scoliometer can quantify trunk rotation though it primarily supports scoliosis screening, and I must document aesthetics and patient-reported concerns following SOSORT recommendations [^117VhENp].

> Next, I should review initial imaging, but wait, I must be precise about the scope of imaging recommendations. While ACR criteria are written for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, their emphasis on full-length standing AP and lateral radiographs generalizes well to sagittal deformity assessment; I should obtain long-cassette, full-spine standing radiographs as the cornerstone of diagnosis and baseline monitoring, ensuring lateral images capture the entire sagittal profile and pelvic parameters for alignment analysis [^111JQU86] [^1154Mj8P] [^116ZrKmB].

> I will now examine how to measure and apply diagnostic thresholds, and I should double-check the Sørensen criteria before labeling a structural kyphosis. I need to measure thoracic kyphosis with the Cobb method, typically T5–T12 or T2–T12 depending on visibility, and measure thoracolumbar kyphosis if the apex is low, then apply Sørensen criteria: anterior vertebral wedging of 5 degrees or more in three or more adjacent vertebrae plus thoracic kyphosis greater than 40 degrees or thoracolumbar kyphosis greater than 30 degrees, remembering Schmorl nodes and endplate irregularities are supportive but not required in atypical presentations [^114GErmy] [^115FDBuN].

> Let me consider supplemental radiographic parameters because focusing only on the deformity apex might miss global imbalance. I should assess lumbar lordosis, sagittal vertical axis, and pelvic parameters including pelvic incidence, tilt, and sacral slope, noting that cohorts with Scheuermann disease often demonstrate lower pelvic incidence and sacral slope compared with normative values; in addition, if I need granularity at the apex, the vertebral wedge ratio can supplement the Cobb angle, which itself remains highly reliable for serial monitoring [^115DbGga] [^113NRePy].

> I need to ensure image acquisition quality because poor positioning can obscure the upper thoracic spine and skew kyphosis angles. Following SOSORT technique, I should position the arms in approximately 45 degrees of flexion with elbows extended and hands on a support, or have the arms crossed over the chest, while avoiding hands on the shoulders to prevent obscuration of the upper thoracic spine [^112ctdM7].

> Next, I should classify the curve location because thoracic versus thoracolumbar apex influences compensatory mechanics and cervical alignment. Thoracic Scheuermann kyphosis classically has an apex between T6 and T9, whereas thoracolumbar patterns apex T10–T12, and these categories track with different pre- and postoperative cervical sagittal alignment behaviors driven by T1 slope coupling [^114BzFcJ] [^114GErmy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding mimics. Postural roundback remains flexible on hyperextension and lacks vertebral wedging; osteoporotic compression fractures can mimic wedging, but thoracic vertebral height index ratios, especially the second derivative (A/M)/(M/P), are significantly higher in osteoporotic compression than in Scheuermann disease; I should also think through infectious spondylodiscitis, neoplastic, metabolic, congenital, and skeletal dysplasia etiologies when presentations are atypical or systemic signs are present [^113NRePy] [^111ok7i8] [^116hJrst].

> I should confirm functional impact and patient-reported outcomes because they guide management even when angles are borderline. The SRS-22 is appropriate to capture pain, function, self-image, mental health, and satisfaction, and in severe thoracic deformities with curves over roughly 70 degrees or high thoracic apices I should consider pulmonary function testing, given long-term data showing impacts on pain and self-image and variable respiratory implications over decades of follow-up [^116iztL7] [^117YCPX1] [^114GErmy].

> Let me think about a practical severity framework, realizing thresholds vary across studies. A reasonable stratification is mild when thoracic kyphosis is under about 55–60 degrees and largely asymptomatic, moderate at 60–70 degrees with mild symptoms, and severe at over 70 degrees or when there is progressive pain, neurologic compromise, or cardiopulmonary involvement, keeping in mind that these cut points guide but do not rigidly determine management [^114GErmy] [^115FDBuN].

> I need to check when advanced imaging changes management so as not to overuse MRI. MRI is indicated for atypical radiographs, neurologic symptoms or deficits, preoperative spinal canal assessment, and to exclude alternative pathologies; supine MRI consistently shows smaller Cobb angles than standing radiographs, so any flexibility inferred from supine imaging should be interpreted as positional rather than true structural correction, which I should reconcile with standing measures during decision-making; CT is rarely needed outside preoperative bony anatomy mapping in severe or complex deformities [^113KMAdc] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether genetics evaluation is warranted, but wait, I must avoid overextending limited evidence. Although twin studies support a genetic contribution to Scheuermann disease and dysplasia workups are appropriate when syndromic features are present, routine genetic testing is not standard of care for typical Scheuermann presentations and should be reserved for strong family history, unusually early or severe onset, or syndromic suspicion [^113tVDHn] [^116VtkxL].

> For monitoring, I should confirm intervals and metrics so progression is not missed during growth. In mild, nonoperative cases during the growth spurt, clinical exams every 6–12 months with standing lateral radiographs to trend thoracic kyphosis, vertebral wedging, compensatory lumbar lordosis, and global balance are appropriate; documentation should be consistent in technique to ensure measurement reliability and interpretability [^113NRePy] [^116ZrKmB].

> For preoperative planning, I need to assess flexibility and compensation reserves, but let me double-check which films best predict correction. Supine hyperextension or traction radiographs help estimate structural flexibility and correlate with achievable surgical correction, and comparing standing neutral to supine extension can identify patients who have exhausted lumbar hyperlordosis compensation, which may influence timing and goals of thoracic correction; also, intraoperative prone radiographs can approximate long-term standing thoracic and lumbar parameters, aiding real-time decision-making [^116ngoj5] [^114ELbDF] [^117N8Lx5].

> For postoperative care, I should verify the imaging cadence and common complications so surveillance is targeted. An immediate postoperative baseline radiograph is essential for future comparison, followed by standing radiographs at approximately 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, then annually for several years, with focused assessment for proximal junctional kyphosis, hardware failure, and loss of correction; posterior-only strategies are now common, but I should tailor fusion levels to balance correction and junctional risk [^113Kbr8P] [^116ph2tP] [^115vdapw].

> Let me summarize the algorithm in words to ensure I have not skipped a step. In an adolescent with hyperkyphosis, I start with history and exam to screen for red flags; if neurologic symptoms or systemic concerns are present, I escalate to MRI urgently; otherwise, I obtain full-length standing AP and lateral radiographs, measure thoracic and thoracolumbar Cobb angles, apply Sørensen criteria, classify thoracic versus thoracolumbar type, assess global sagittal balance and pelvic parameters, and stratify severity; I reserve MRI for atypical features or preoperative planning, use flexibility studies when surgery is contemplated, and consider surgical evaluation when curves exceed about 70 degrees, show progression with symptoms, or when compensation is exhausted despite conservative care [^111JQU86] [^114GErmy] [^116ngoj5].

> Before I conclude, I should double-check the key evidence anchors so the take-home points are consistent. Diagnosis is radiographic and requires wedging and increased kyphosis rather than posture alone, the Cobb angle remains a reliable standard despite its limitations, high-credibility imaging guidance supports long-cassette standing radiographs for deformity assessment, and distinguishing osteoporotic compression from Scheuermann disease is feasible with height ratio indices when the clinical context is ambiguous, even though much of the Scheuermann-specific literature is lower level and should be integrated judiciously [^114GErmy] [^113NRePy] [^111JQU86] [^111ok7i8] [^112VqeQb].

The diagnostic workup for Scheuermann's disease centers on **clinical assessment** and **radiographic confirmation** [^115FDBuN]. Clinically, expect a **rigid thoracic kyphosis** with an apex at T7–T9, compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis [^113dv5X3], and reduced spinal flexibility. Radiographically, confirm the diagnosis with **standing lateral spine X-rays** demonstrating ≥ 3 contiguous vertebrae with ≥ 5° anterior wedging [^113BCcaz], endplate irregularities, and Schmorl's nodes [^114GErmy]; measure the Cobb angle to assess severity [^113NRePy]. MRI is indicated for **atypical presentations, neurologic symptoms, or preoperative planning** to evaluate spinal cord or nerve root involvement. Laboratory tests are **not routinely required** but may be used to exclude other conditions when clinically indicated.

Differential diagnosis includes **postural kyphosis, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and other structural or metabolic spinal disorders** [^116hJrst].

---

## Clinical evaluation

Onset is typically during adolescence (12–17 years) [^115FDBuN], with symptoms including **back pain**, fatigue, progressive kyphotic deformity, and cosmetic concerns. Family history may suggest a genetic predisposition [^113tVDHn]. Functional impact includes **limitations in daily activities and sports**, as well as notable **psychosocial concerns** [^117YCPX1].

---

### Physical examination

- **Posture**: Rigid thoracic kyphosis (apex T7–T9), compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis.
- **Flexibility**: Reduced spinal flexibility; kyphosis persists on hyperextension [^115FDBuN].
- **Neurologic exam**: Usually normal; assess for rare neurologic deficits [^115FDBuN].
- **Adam's forward bend test**: Prominent thoracic hump, rigid deformity.

---

## Radiographic evaluation

Radiographic imaging is essential for **confirming the diagnosis and assessing severity** [^114GErmy].

---

### Plain radiographs (gold standard)

- **Standing lateral spine X-ray**: Essential for diagnosis [^113BCcaz].
- **Diagnostic criteria**: ≥ 3 contiguous vertebrae with ≥ 5° anterior wedging [^113BCcaz], endplate irregularities, Schmorl's nodes [^114GErmy].
- **Cobb angle measurement**: Quantifies kyphosis severity (normal thoracic kyphosis: 20–45°; Scheuermann's typically > 45°) [^114GErmy] [^113NRePy].

---

Additional radiographic features include **endplate irregularities** (flattened, irregular vertebral endplates) and **Schmorl's nodes** (intraverebral disc herniations into the vertebral bodies). Disc space narrowing is also common.

---

## Advanced imaging modalities

Advanced imaging is reserved for **specific clinical scenarios**.

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI indications include **atypical presentations, neurologic symptoms, and preoperative planning**; typical **findings** include vertebral wedging, endplate irregularities, Schmorl's nodes, disc degeneration, and spinal cord or nerve root involvement.

---

### Computed tomography (CT)

CT is **rarely indicated** and is typically reserved for complex cases or surgical planning; typical **findings** include detailed bony anatomy, vertebral wedging, and endplate irregularities.

---

## Laboratory tests

**Laboratory tests** are not routinely required but may be used to exclude other conditions when clinically indicated [^112VqeQb].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes:

- **Postural kyphosis**: Flexible deformity, no vertebral wedging.
- **Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis**: Lateral curvature, rotational deformity.
- **Congenital kyphosis**: Vertebral anomalies present at birth [^116hJrst].
- **Metabolic bone diseases**: Osteoporosis, osteomalacia [^116hJrst].
- **Inflammatory conditions**: Ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^113uRqEt].

---

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a detailed history and physical examination, with radiographic confirmation using a **standing lateral spine X-ray** as the gold standard [^115FDBuN]. MRI is reserved for atypical cases or neurologic symptoms, and laboratory tests are not routinely required.

### Adult Scheuermann kyphosis: Evaluation, management, and new developments [^113BCcaz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Scheuermann kyphosis is a structural hyperkyphosis defined radiographically as anterior wedging of ≥ 5° of at least three consecutive vertebral bodies. Typically, the disease develops during adolescence but may not present until adulthood. The etiology remains unknown. Indications for management include progressive deformity, pain, cosmesis, neurologic deficit, and cardiopulmonary compromise. Surgical intervention is indicated in patients with persistent pain and unacceptable deformity caused by significant kyphosis. Surgery can be performed through posterior-only, anterior-only, or combined anterior-posterior approaches. Correction should include the entire length of the kyphosis and should not exceed 50% of the original deformity. The most common postoperative complications are wound infection and loss of correction.

### A novel surgical indication for Scheuermann's kyphosis [^114GErmy]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Scheuermann kyphosis (SK) was described by Scheuermann as disturbances in the vertebral epiphyses with wedge-shaped vertebral bodies and pathology resembling Calvé-Perthes osteochondritis. SK can be primarily thoracic or thoracolumbar based on the apex of the kyphosis. The incidence of SK is relatively high, with rates up to 7.4%. It is thought to be multifactorial with a genetic component and is a common cause of structural hyperkyphosis in the pediatric population.

Normative values of thoracic kyphosis (TK) reported in the literature range considerably (10 to 55°).

- **Diagnosis of SK**: Diagnosis is made using Sorensen criteria: anterior wedging of > 5° in > 3 adjacent vertebrae and TK > 40° or thoracolumbar kyphosis > 30°. Vertebral end plate irregularities and Schmorl nodes are commonly seen, but not necessarily in atypical SK.

There are several accepted surgical indications for SK. While there is substantial variability in the literature regarding the threshold for surgery in terms of the degree of kyphotic deformity (50 to 80°), most agree that curves > 70° should be treated surgically.

- **Other established indications**: Neurologic deficits, pain refractory to conservative management, cardiopulmonary compromise, and patient dissatisfaction with their appearance.

There is often compensatory hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine in patients with SK to maintain sagittal balance. However, once the limit of lordosis is reached, patients cannot compensate for additional progression of their SK, and positive sagittal balance may occur. This has been associated with worse health-related quality of life.

### Sternoclavicular dislocation as a possible complication for surgical Scheuermann's deformity correction: a case report [^116X2jpN]. European Spine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

We present a sternoclavicular dislocation as a non-reported complication after spinal kyphotic deformity surgical correction.

- **Background**: The sternocostal complex seems to have an important role in the pathology of Scheuermann's kyphotic deformity. A role for the sternoclavicular complex has never been reported in association with Scheuermann's disease pathology but could explain anterior sternoclavicular dislocation after spinal kyphotic deformity correction.

- **Methods**: A 19-year-old male patient underwent surgery for a 74° thoracic kyphosis associated with a 35° thoracic and a 50° lumbar scoliotic curve. In the early postoperative period, the patient developed pain over the left sternoclavicular joint articulation, with a very obvious lump. An X-ray disclosed an anterior sternoclavicular dislocation. After surgical treatment failed, the dislocation was repaired in a second surgical procedure with a flexion and lengthening osteotomy of the middle third of the clavicle, followed by capsular repair reinforced with sternocleidomastoid fascia.

- **Results**: At an 8-year follow-up after his spine procedure and 6 years after his clavicular surgery, the patient had full shoulder range of motion and no joint pain, despite the presence of a new sternoclavicular anterior dislocation.

- **Conclusion**: Sternoclavicular dislocation after spine kyphotic deformity correction is presented for the first time; however, it is not possible to establish a causative association. Additional studies are necessary to delineate the role of the sternoclavicular complex in Scheuermann's disease.

Regarding specific circumstances for Paget's disease, particularly for patients undergoing orthopedic or spinal surgery, the ES 2014 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy preoperatively. This recommendation is specifically for patients with Paget's disease who are scheduled to undergo elective total joint replacement for severe osteoarthritis adjacent to Paget's disease. The goal is to prevent intraoperative hemorrhaging and postoperative loosening of the prosthesis.

### The reliability and diagnostic value of radiographic criteria in sagittal spine deformities: Comparison of the vertebral wedge ratio to the segmental Cobb angle [^113NRePy]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

A prospective, radiographic cohort study was conducted to assess the radiographic reliability and diagnostic value of the vertebral wedge ratio (WR) compared to the segmental Cobb angle (CA) concerning sagittal spine deformities.

The Cobb angle (CA) is frequently utilized to aid in diagnosing various sagittal spine deformities, yet its reliability and diagnostic capability remain questionable. It may not be sensitive to individual variations in vertebral integrity in such deformities.

Sixty patients aged 8 to 21 years were considered for the study. These patients were diagnosed with Scheuermann's kyphosis (Group 1; n = 16), postural roundback (Group 2; n = 23), or were regarded as normal (Group 3; n = 21). The radiographic evaluation aimed to analyze the reliability and diagnostic potential of the vertebral WR (assessed at the apex of the curve and adjacent vertebrae) and the segmental CA. Three independent, blinded observers conducted the radiographic assessments on three separate occasions.

Results indicated very strong intraobserver reliability with WR at α = 0.85–0.99 and CA at α = 0.97–0.99, as well as interobserver reliability with WR at α = 0.79–0.89 and CA at α = 0.95. Group 1 showed greater WR reliability, while CA reliability remained consistent across all groups. A statistically significant difference was observed among all groups regarding vertebral WR and segmental CA, particularly when the Cobb angle was ≥ 20 degrees.

### Evidence based medicine: Analysis of Scheuermann kyphosis [^112VqeQb]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

This study presents a review of the literature using evidence-based medicine (EBM) to address the etiology, natural history, and treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis.

- **Objective**: To provide concepts for the rational evaluation and treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis supported by EBM.

- **Summary of background data**: The literature on the etiology, natural history, and treatment of Scheuermann disease presents mixed views and recommendations, most of which lack strong levels of evidence.

- **Methods**: A thorough database search was conducted to obtain the best information and levels of evidence on the etiology, natural history, and treatment options for Scheuermann kyphosis based on EBM criteria.

- **Results and conclusion**: Scheuermann kyphosis is the most common cause of hyperkyphosis in adolescence. Its true etiology remains unknown, but there appears to be a strong genetic as well as an environmental contribution. The kyphotic deformity is often attributed to "poor posture", leading to delayed diagnosis, and treatment indications remain debated due to an unclear natural history. When recognized early in adolescence with progressive kyphosis, bracing treatment will usually result in modest correction of the deformity. Symptomatic adolescents with severe deformity have shown significant deformity correction following surgical intervention; however, clinical outcomes data are not yet available, and the existing studies do not have strong levels of evidence.

### Spinal manifestations of skeletal dysplasia: A practical guide for clinical diagnosis [^116VtkxL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Low credibility.

Skeletal dysplasias are a group of genetic conditions characterized by atypical bone or cartilage growth and development. Skeletal abnormalities include short stature, limb deformity, joint contracture, and spinal deformity. Over 90% of these disorders have a known genetic mutation that can definitively determine the diagnosis. As patients may present with a primary spinal concern, a careful clinical and radiographic evaluation can allow the physician to develop a working diagnosis to guide additional evaluation.

- **Spinal manifestations**: These include scoliosis and kyphoscoliosis, cervical instability, cervical kyphosis, thoracolumbar kyphosis, spinal stenosis, and atypical vertebral body morphology. An understanding of the affected conditions, prevalence, and natural history of these radiographic findings aids the orthopaedic surgeon in establishing a diagnosis and guides appropriate orthopaedic care.

### The utility of genetic testing in infantile epileptic spasms syndrome: A step-based approach in the next-generation sequencing era [^114SQq4v]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

To evaluate the utility of genetic testing for etiology-specific diagnosis (ESD) in infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) with a step-based diagnostic approach in the next-generation sequencing (NGS) era, a study was conducted with a cohort of 314 patients with IESS, followed by the Pediatric Neurology Division of Ege University Hospital between 2005 and 2021. The ESD was evaluated using a step-based approach: step I (clinical phenomenology), step II (neuroimaging), step III (metabolic screening), and step IV (genetic testing). The diagnostic utility of genetic testing was evaluated to compare the early-NGS period (2005 to 2013, n = 183) and the NGS era (2014 to 2021, n = 131).

- **Results**: An ESD was established in 221 of 314 (70.4%) infants with IESS: structural, 40.8%; genetic, 17.2%; metabolic, 8.3%; immune-infectious, 4.1%. The diagnostic yield of genetic testing increased from 8.9% to 41.7% in the cohort during the four follow-up periods. The rate of unknown etiology decreased from 34.9% to 22.1% during the follow-up periods. The genetic ESD was established as 27.4% with genetic testing in the NGS era. The genetic testing in the NGS era increased dramatically in subgroups with unknown and structural etiologies. The diagnostic yields of the epilepsy panels increased from 7.6% to 19.2%. However, the diagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing remained at similar levels during the early-NGS period at 54.5% and in the NGS era at 59%.

- **Conclusions**: The more genetic ESD (27.4%) was defined for IESS in the NGS era with the implication of precision therapy (37.7%).

### Noninvasive measurement and screening techniques for spinal deformities [^113W12V6]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Spinal deformities are caused by a heterogeneous collection of disease processes. The progression of the scoliotic curve can vary depending on the individual patient, as well as the curve etiology. Noninvasive measurement techniques have been developed to obtain a baseline and record curve progression.

- **Methods**: We designed our study based on a comprehensive literature review and clinical experience. A systematic review of Medline for articles related to spinal deformities (scoliosis) and screening techniques was conducted up to and including those published in March 2007.

- **Results**: There are numerous noninvasive modalities available to assess curve progression.

- **Conclusion**: The use of a detailed physical examination, serial examinations, and radiographic means serves well to document curve presence and monitor progression.

### Decompression alone or decompression with fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis: A randomized clinical trial with two-year MRI follow-up [^1179CYMh]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). High credibility.

The study involved four groups: fusion with spondylolisthesis, fusion without spondylolisthesis, decompression alone with spondylolisthesis, and decompression alone without spondylolisthesis. The required number of patients in each group was estimated to achieve sufficient power for the primary clinical outcome, rather than for the radiological outcome. An unexpected, more even distribution of patients with and without spondylolisthesis allowed for a reduction in the total sample size from initial calculations.

Differences between treatment groups were analyzed using an independent-samples t-test for continuous variables — specifically Welch's two-sample t-test — and dichotomized standard summary measures for ordinal variables, including Fisher's exact test and Pearson's chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction. Analyses were conducted with and without stratification for preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis. Interobserver reliability between the orthopedic surgeon and radiologist was evaluated using paired t-tests and confidence intervals.

Pfirrmann disc degeneration, inherently an ordinal variable (I, II, III, IV, V), was simplified and analyzed as a quantitative variable (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The analyses were executed using SAS version 9.4 (USA) and R version 3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Austria). Detailed statistical considerations prior to and during inclusion are comprehensively described in our two-year clinical report.

### Understanding the management of pediatric spondylodiscitis based on existing literature; a systematic review [^117GeLgo]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis can be based on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory tests, and imaging. The disease course is often chronic, and the absence of specific symptoms often delays the diagnosis, which increases morbidity and mortality. Although any level of the spine can be affected, in most cases (75% of patients), the lumbar spine or lumbosacral region is mainly affected, especially in children under five.

In laboratory investigations, the most common features are elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and leukocytosis. Conversely, the results of blood culture and fine needle aspiration (FNA) sample culture tests varied in different studies.

Radiological evaluation usually starts with plain radiographs. X-rays have very low sensitivity and specificity. After 2–3 weeks, a simple X-ray may show isolated intervertebral disc space narrowing. Then, within 3–4 weeks, irregularities in the vertebral plate, erosion of adjacent vertebral endplates, and scaling of the superior and inferior vertebral bodies can be detected in plain X-ray evaluation. For further evaluation, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and technetium Tc 99m (99mTc) scans may be used. MRI is the gold standard method, with higher sensitivity (96%) and specificity (94%) than nuclear studies or CT for detecting discitis early. MRI allows visualization of the disk, neural tissues, surrounding soft tissues, and pathophysiologic changes in the vertebral body.

### Three-dimensional spinal morphology can differentiate between progressive and nonprogressive patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis at the initial presentation: a prospective study [^112e5EFH]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

This case-control study showed that there are differences at the initial visit between a nonprogressive and a progressive group of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Progressive AIS presented hypokyphosis, higher values for rotational parameters (plane of maximal curvature, torsion, and apical intervertebral rotation), and lower values for local and regional slenderness.

### Hypermobility among adolescents and the association with spinal deformities: A large cross-sectional study [^117S2m6o]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and Scheuermann kyphosis are common spinal deformities (SD) among adolescents. The potential link between hypermobility and SD is a topic of debate. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of hypermobility and its association with SD.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional analysis of records of 17-year-old subjects who were recruited into mandatory military service was conducted. The study population comprised 1,220,073 subjects. Prevalence rates were calculated for hypermobility and different categories of SD by severity, studying the strength of the association between hypermobility and SD.

- **Results**: Of 1,220,073 subjects, 0.0111% exhibited hypermobility. Spinal deformities were identified in 10.5% of subjects. Specifically, 7.9% had mild SD, 2.4% had moderate SD, and 0.1% had severe SD. The overall association between hypermobility and SD showed an odds ratio of 2.31 (P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed ORs of 1.226 (P = 0.041) for mild deformities, 5.783 (P < 0.001) for moderate deformities, and 4.01 (P = 0.002) for severe deformities. The association was stronger for moderate and severe SD.

This study establishes a notable association between hypermobility and SD among adolescents. The findings highlight the importance of understanding this relationship, which could contribute to advancements in comprehending SD development. Additional research is warranted to expand upon these findings.

### Predictable correction of the unfused lumbar lordosis after thoracic correction and fusion in Scheuermann kyphosis [^113dv5X3]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

A retrospective examination of preoperative and postoperative radiographs of the sagittal spine was conducted on 30 patients with Scheuermann kyphosis. The objectives were to determine significant correlations between kyphosis and lordosis in Scheuermann kyphosis, to assess the predictability of spontaneous sagittal lordosis correction after thoracic correction and fusion, and to better understand the biomechanics of the spine.

Previous studies described relations between kyphosis and lordosis in healthy individuals. However, to our knowledge, no relationships have been described between kyphosis and lordosis in Scheuermann kyphosis. On radiographs, maximum kyphosis, maximum lordosis, sacral slope, and L5-S1 angle were measured in the preoperative and postoperative standing lateral radiographs of the spine. Correlations were calculated.

Preoperative significant correlations were present between kyphosis and lordosis (R = 0.421; P = 0.021), and between lordosis and sacral slope (R = 0.824; P < 0.001). Postoperative correlations were stronger (R = 0.591; P = 0.001 and R = 0.844; P < 0.001). The percentage of correction of kyphosis was correlated with the percentage of spontaneous decrease in lordosis (R = 0.593; P < 0.001). A negative correlation between the L5-S1 angle and the upper lumbar segment of lordosis was found before and after surgery.

In conclusion, this study shows a significant correlation between kyphosis and lordosis before and after surgery. Surgical correction of thoracic hyperkyphosis results in a predictable spontaneous decrease in lumbar lordosis.

### Scheuermann's kyphosis: Surgical management [^116ph2tP]. European spine journal (2005). Low credibility.

Indications for surgery in Scheuermann disease are not well codified and remain rare, as the natural history of the disease is, in most cases, benign. In the immature adolescent, conservative treatment, such as bracing or casting, can be tried for moderate curves. For larger curves, or in adults, conservative treatment is usually not effective, and surgery can be considered. Such indications are mostly cosmetic for large curves above 75 degrees. Pain over the deformity or in the low back may represent another surgical indication, especially in adults.

The question of anterior release or straight posterior fusion has become more prevalent with the advent of powerful, third-generation, stiff segmental instrumentation. However, the long-term results of a modern, posterior-only instrumentation fusion are not known. Concern about loss of correction, late pseudarthrosis, or the need to remove instrumentation for infected hardware or due to late pain at the operative site must make us careful about choosing this method. Very rigid and large curves still require an anterior release, either done in a conventional or mini-open fashion, or through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

The extent of the posterior instrumentation has now been better defined. One must fuse the whole Cobb angle without hypercorrection and stop distally, above the first lordotic disc, to avoid sagittal decompensation. New approaches such as short anterior fusion with bone-on-bone techniques and pedicle subtraction osteotomies have not yet been reported in the literature as having been used.

### Fat embolism prophylaxis with corticosteroids. A prospective study in high-risk patients [^116J5pLp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (1983). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Schonfeld's criteria for fat embolism syndrome" is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients at risk of developing this potentially life-threatening complication. It is particularly relevant for patients who have experienced trauma or surgical procedures involving long bones or the pelvis, where fat emboli may enter the bloodstream.

- **Components of Schonfeld's criteria**: The primary elements include the presence of petechiae, diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray, arterial partial pressure of oxygen less than 70 mmHg, fever greater than 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate exceeding 120 beats per minute, and respiration rate over 30 breaths per minute. Each of these components contributes to the overall score, which aids in the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome.

- **Calculator functionality**: The Schonfeld's criteria calculator evaluates six clinical signs and symptoms, taking user input as boolean (true/false) values. Each positive symptom is assigned a numerical score based on a predefined scale, and these scores are summed to determine if the diagnostic criteria are met.

- **Scoring system**:
	- **Petechiae**: 5
	- **Diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray**: 4

### Analysis of cervical sagittal alignment change following correction of thoracic and thoracolumbar Scheuermann's kyphosis [^114BzFcJ]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

To analyze pre-operative and post-operative changes of cervical sagittal alignment (CSA) in Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK) patients, 64 SK and 33 control patients were retrospectively reviewed. Whole spine X-rays obtained at pre-op, 3 months post-op, and at latest follow-up were reviewed and ten separate CSA radiological parameters were measured. Patients were divided into three groups: thoracic SK (TK group, apex T6-T9, n = 40), thoracolumbar SK (TLK group, apex T10-T12, n = 24), and controls.

Pre-operative C2-C7 lordosis was 21.1° ± 8.1° (TK), 6.1° ± 5.0° (TLK), and 11.4° ± 8.3° in control group and correlated significantly with T1 slope in both SK groups (r = 0.640, r = 0.772). Pre-operative T1 slope was dependent on deformity type, thoracic kyphosis (TK, β = 0.445), and lumbar lordosis (LL, β = -0.354). At final follow-up, C2-C7 lordosis decreased to 15.7° ± 5.5° in TK, and increased to 12.1° ± 4.1° in TLK group. C2-C7 lordosis changes linearly correlated with T1 slope changes post-operatively (r = 0.721). Post-operative T1 slope showed linear correlation with post-operative changes in TK (β = 0.728) and pelvic tilt (PT, β = 0.539) in TK, and LL (β = -0.669), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK, β = -0.434), and PT (β = 0.760) in TLK group.

Our study suggests that SK is not a homogenous group of patients. Two patterns of pre- and post-operative CSA are demonstrated in TK and TLK groups. T1 slope is the most important parameter in determining pre-operative CSA and correlates with other regional anatomical parameters (TK and LL).

### Thoracic and thoracolumbar kyphosis in adults [^111zAewa]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

The study focuses on author experience and a literature review. Its objectives are to investigate the spectrum of adult kyphosis and discuss various surgical and nonsurgical treatment options.

Kyphosis, with its various etiologies and associated pathophysiologies, has been discussed in the literature for many decades. Nonsurgical treatment primarily consists of symptom reduction via physical therapy, which has not changed significantly over time. In contrast, surgical treatment has evolved dramatically. A decade ago, most large kyphotic deformities required anterior and posterior procedures. However, with the advent of numerous posterior osteotomy techniques and pedicle fixation, most of these deformities are now treated via posterior methods only.

Using literature review and the author's experience, this study discusses kyphosis and its characteristics. Important details pertinent to presurgical planning and execution of surgery will be covered. Three cases will be presented to illustrate the surgical treatment options for three qualitatively different kyphotic deformities.

- **Results**: Flexible kyphotic deformities may respond well to aggressive facetectomies and cantilever corrections. Multisegmental osteotomies may be most appropriate for long sweeping deformities. Fixed, sharply angulated deformities may respond best to pedicle subtraction osteotomies or vertebral column resections.

- **Conclusion**: Segmental pedicle screw fixation coupled with one of four posterior osteotomy/resection techniques can be used to address most sagittal plane deformities.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) have a history of symptoms notable for pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks, known as neurogenic claudication. Patients with more pronounced LSS may develop lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and imbalance in gait. Typically, symptoms of neurogenic claudication abate with sitting down or leaning forward, referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis predominantly affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may report radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. As LSS is a slowly progressing condition, rapid onset of these symptoms may suggest a different pathology.

To confirm clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required. MRI remains the most common imaging modality to assess LSS because physical examination and X-ray imaging do not have high sensitivity or specificity. There is great variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and lack of standardization may contribute to increased heterogeneity of the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low-cost and readily available. Radiological AP and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may show segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes that are unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, must also be considered.

### A simple radiological method for recognizing osteoporotic thoracic vertebral compression fractures and distinguishing them from Scheuermann disease [^111ok7i8]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

The study design was blinded, with the objective to examine a new radiologic interpretation technique for distinguishing osteoporotic fractures from Scheuermann disease. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures represent a significant clinical issue. Various empirically derived standards have been proposed for their recognition, though the limits for normal variation remain somewhat arbitrary. This report introduces and evaluates a novel radiologic technique aimed at differentiating osteoporotic thoracic vertebral fractures from Scheuermann disease.

Vertebral body height measurements (anterior, middle, and posterior) of thoracic vertebrae T6-T10 were taken from lateral chest radiographs and measured by a digital caliper. These measurements included 44 individuals with osteoporotic fractures, 28 individuals with Scheuermann disease, and a control group of 120 individuals with unaffected vertebrae. For each vertebra, four indexes were calculated: three primary derivatives — anterior height/posterior height, anterior height/mid height (A/M), mid height/posterior height (M/P) — and a secondary derivative index (A/M)/(M/P). Qualitative analysis followed, using lateral spine radiographs of individuals with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and individuals with Scheuermann disease. Statistical analyses involved analysis of variance, paired t-tests, and t-tests.

The results indicated that the second derivative (A/M)/(M/P) indexes of thoracic vertebrae T6-T10 were significantly greater in the osteoporosis group compared to the control and Scheuermann groups (P < 0.05), indicating a marked difference.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: From diagnosis to treatment — a comprehensive review [^114F9WhN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

- **Vision/ocular related causes (ocular group)**: In the absence of relevant family history and no neurological signs, a complete pediatric ocular examination was conducted. The findings of the eye examination were used to guide further testing, prioritizing the most likely tests. If vision is severely impaired with high hyperopia, molecular genetic testing for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the first step. The presence of iris transillumination defects may warrant macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) or molecular genetic testing for albinism, especially if there is a history of easy bruising and bleeding or if the family seeks information for family planning. Handheld OCT is a valuable tool, especially for young infants who can be tested while awake or for toddlers under anesthesia. Evaluate pupil shape and consider PAX6 testing if the pupil appears ectopic or oval. If no specific findings guide testing, consider initiating an electroretinogram (ERG) as the initial test, which can help differentiate between genetic retinal dystrophies and other causes (neurological, anatomical, and motor). This group is also called the "sensory group".

- **Oculomotor/eye movement disorder causes (motor group)**: Examine eye movement patterns and nystagmus characteristics. Identify any unusual eye movements, including saccadic intrusions or oscillations. Diagnoses were based on specific characteristics and patterns observed, and further evaluation was considered necessary. Primarily a diagnosis of exclusion.

- **Diagnostic workup**: The diagnostic process emphasizes a comprehensive approach, considering various potential causes as per the observed patterns and characteristics.

### Scheuermann's kyphosis: a 39-year follow-up from diagnosis in non-operated patients [^117YCPX1]. European Spine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of Scheuermann's Kyphosis (SK) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adult patients and compare it to the general population. Additionally, the study aimed to assess whether the location of the kyphosis affects pelvic parameters, HRQOL, and pulmonary function.

Of a cohort of 251 patients seen for pediatric spinal deformity between 1972–1982 in our outpatient clinic, 55 had radiologically verified SK. Thirty-eight participated in the study and responded to HRQOL questionnaires, 34 had radiographs taken, and 31 underwent pulmonary function testing. The patients were divided into two groups according to the location of the SK apex: thoracic (Th) above Th10 and thoracolumbar (TL) from Th10 and below. Spinopelvic parameters were measured for all radiographs. The HRQOL scores for all SK patients were compared with normative data from a Scandinavian population, while pulmonary function measurements were compared between the Th and TL SK groups.

The mean follow-up was 39 ± 1.6 years, and the mean age at follow-up was 53 ± 2.4 years. We found a lower score in the TL group for the SRS-22r function domain (p = 0.027) compared with the Th group, but no significant difference in the remaining domains and SRS-22r subscore (p > 0.18). Patients had significantly lower mean scores compared to normative values on the SRS-22r domains of pain (p = 0.049) and self-image (p = 0.006), but no statistically significant difference on the SRS-22r subscore (p = 0.064). There was no difference in pelvic parameters between the two SK groups. No difference in pulmonary function based on percent predicted values was found.

### Spinal involvement in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio-Brailsford or Morquio A syndrome): presentation, diagnosis and management [^115vJEzq]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Axial spine

When atlantoaxial subluxation is associated with severe instability, a posterior cervical fusion is recommended to eliminate pathological movement and stabilize the spine (Ain et al.) As there is often craniocervical junction compression, where the C1 posterior arch may lie either at or within the foramen magnum, and the C1 or C2 bony elements are often inadequate for fixation, surgeons will favor an occipitocervical fixation and posterior fusion for C1-C2 subluxation and instability. If there is compression at the foramen magnum, then posterior resection of the foramen magnum rim may be required, with this bone potentially used as graft. The fixation may need to be extended to the subaxial segments as often the vertebral artery groove is too large to permit a C2 lateral mass or transarticular screw placement (Madawi et al; Solanki and Crockard; Solanki et al.) Often, an external orthotic device such as a halo ring and vest immobilization is required, starting prior to or at surgery, for a period of 3 months.

The techniques for fixation vary considerably.

- **Instrumentation advancements**: Instrumentation in the upper cervical spine has changed substantially in the past two decades. Previous stand-alone wiring techniques like Brooks or Gallie's fusion (Brooks and Jenkins; Gallie) have been largely made obsolete with the development of occipital plating, transarticular screws of Magerl (Ahmed et al; Claybrooks et al; Elgafy et al; Goel; Gunnarsson et al; Haid; Henriques et al; Lee et al.) and C1 lateral mass screws, as well as C2 pedicle, pars, and translaminar screws. Polyaxial screws and segmental fixation are also now used.

### Importance of diagnostics in epidemic and pandemic preparedness [^1167D9ef]. BMJ Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

Taking a holistic approach to diagnostic preparedness will require a multistakeholder response. The first step may be the assembly of multiple key stakeholders in this field to convene a global diagnostics forum. Bringing together all relevant parties, including industry (both diagnostics and vaccines, and large and start-up companies), WHO, other healthcare bodies such as UNICEF, Gavi, and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), governments, and subject matter experts, will allow for more efficient and productive discussions to determine the right solutions and how best to implement them. This could inform the development of new target product profiles that align with this comprehensive approach. This global forum approach has been commonly used in the vaccines sector in isolation; meetings of the CEPI forum and Joint Coordination Group are key examples. However, no such meeting for diagnostics or the combination of diagnostics and vaccines has taken place.

Beyond enabling a multistakeholder engagement plan, there may be opportunities to leverage mechanisms in place to help address outbreak preparedness challenges in vaccines. Expanding these mechanisms to include diagnostics would be more efficient, making use of existing expertise and processes. This would allow for a more integrated approach to outbreak preparedness by linking both diagnostics and vaccines, which are inherently connected. CEPI could act as a bridge between diagnostics needs and vaccine preparedness for research and development, and Gavi could provide support in this integration effort.

### A novel surgical indication for Scheuermann's kyphosis [^115XG4U6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Scheuermann kyphosis can be treated surgically to restore proper sagittal alignment. Thoracic curves greater than 70° are typically indicated for surgical intervention. However, patients who have reached their natural limit of compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis are at risk of accelerated degeneration. This can be determined by comparing lumbar lordosis on standing neutral radiographs and supine extension radiographs. Minimal additional lordosis in extension compared with neutral, abutment of the spinous processes, or greater lumbar lordosis standing than with attempted extension suggest the patient is maximally compensated.

We present a case of an adolescent boy with Scheuermann kyphosis who had reached the limit of his hyperlordosis compensation reserve. He subsequently underwent a T4 to L2 posterior spinal fusion with T7 to T11 Ponte Smith-Petersen grade two osteotomies. He tolerated the procedure well with no intraoperative complications or neuromonitoring changes. The patient has continued to do well and progressed to normal activity at a 5-month follow-up.

### Clinical outcome and radiographic results after operative treatment of Scheuermann's disease [^116iztL7]. European Spine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate radiographic findings, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcome, as well as to report complications and instrumentation failure after operative treatment of Scheuermann's disease using a combined anterior and posterior spondylodesis. The loss of sagittal plane correction after the removal of the posterior instrumentation was analyzed. Surgery was indicated for thoracic kyphosis greater than 60 degrees in adolescents and adults with persistent back pain that failed to respond to conservative treatment.

Thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis angles were measured using the Cobb method at preselected time points and at the final follow-up. Sagittal plane alignment was measured as translation. The validated Scoliosis Research Society Instrument (SRSI) questionnaire was sent to all patients at follow-up. P-values were calculated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, with P < 0.05 considered significant.

Between October 1987 and August 1999, 23 consecutive patients underwent operative treatment. The median follow-up was 75 months (range 25–126 months). The median preoperative thoracic kyphosis was 70 degrees (range 62–78 degrees), and the median preoperative lumbar lordosis was 68 degrees (range 54–84 degrees). Immediate postoperative median thoracic kyphosis improved to 39 degrees (range 28–54 degrees, P < 0.05), and immediate postoperative median lumbar lordosis improved to 49 degrees (range 35–63 degrees, P < 0.05). These significant corrections were maintained at early follow-ups conducted 1 year and 2 years postoperatively. At final follow-up…

### ATLS® and damage control in spine trauma [^111ZF2uZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

According to the original ATLS® protocol, primary diagnostics include X-ray of the pelvis, chest, and a lateral view of the cervical spine. These initial imaging techniques can indicate potential thoracolumbar and cervical spine trauma, such as a fracture of the transverse process in the lower lumbar spine on the pelvic film, which may suggest a rotationally unstable injury of the lumbosacral spine.

Substantial debate exists regarding the significance of conventional X-ray in primary diagnostics. Some researchers advocate for additional anterior cervical spine and odontoid axis films, which may rule out around 90–95% of spinal column injuries. However, under emergency room conditions, the quality of these obtained plain films is often poor. The cervicothoracic junction (C7 to T1) is particularly challenging to image, especially in obese and athletic patients due to dense soft tissues in the shoulder region. Plain X-rays often fail to address discoligamentous injuries.

In a recent series involving 118 polytraumatized patients with cervical spine injuries, a single lateral view failed to deliver the correct diagnosis in 37% of cases. Even CT scans missed diagnosing discoligamentous injuries in three patients. Approximately one-third of injuries were missed, as noted by Bohlmann nearly 30 years ago. Considering these high rates of overlooked injuries, and in contrast to ATLS® recommendations, precautions should not be abandoned even after an insignificant plain X-ray, until the polytraumatized patient is able to communicate and provide detailed information.

### Postoperative changes in sacropelvic junction in short-segment angular kyphosis versus Scheuermann kyphosis [^116yA3pq]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to comparatively evaluate the biomechanical alterations that occur in the sagittal plane of the sacropelvic junction in patients with angular kyphosis (AK) and Scheuermann kyphosis (SK) after surgery.

- **Methods**: The spine radiographs of 52 patients who underwent surgery for short-segment AK (n = 20) or SK (n = 32) were studied. The main outcome measures were sacral slope, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis, and thoracic kyphosis angles.

- **Results**: In the AK group, local and thoracic kyphosis angles, as well as the lumbar lordosis angle, showed a statistically significant reduction with surgery. In the SK group, thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis angles were significantly reduced. Postoperatively, there were significant differences between groups in lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt angle, and sacral slope (p = 0.021, p = 0.001, and p = 0.027, respectively). In the AK group, the thoracic kyphosis angle and sacral slope were increased, with a remarkable correlation between thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis values.

- **Conclusions**: The study suggests that significant sacropelvic improvement can be achieved by balancing the sagittal vertical axis and T1 spinopelvic alignment, leading to good sagittal alignment of the spine in patients with AK and SK. Changes in morphological parameters after surgery may be closely related to the baseline biomechanics and structure of the spine and pelvis. Further clinical and scientific trials are necessary to elucidate these biomechanics, understand their clinical implications, and develop new techniques and models for spine and pelvis surgery.

### Comparison of radiographic sagittal spinopelvic alignment between skeletally immature and skeletally mature individuals with Scheuermann's disease [^115DbGga]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare radiographic sagittal spinopelvic parameters between skeletally immature and skeletally mature patients with Scheuermann's disease (SD).

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional analysis of standing postero-anterior and lateral radiographs of the spine of patients with SD was performed. Sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), and sacral slope (SS) were measured on the lateral radiographs. Risser's sign was assessed on the postero-anterior radiographs. All parameters measured were compared between skeletally immature (Risser's sign 0–3) versus mature patients (Risser's sign 5). PI, PT, and SS in both groups were compared to PI, PT, and SS reported for normal children, adolescents, and adults.

- **Results**: Sixty-six patients with SD (33 immature and 33 mature) were retrospectively reviewed and included in the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups of SD patients in SVA (-16.6 vs. -22.9 mm, p = 0.74), TK (57.8° vs. 56°, p = 0.66), TLK (7.8° vs. 11.7º, p = 0.14), LL (63.2° vs. 62.2°, p = 0.74), PI (36.7° vs. 39.4°, p = 0.20), PT (3.8° vs. 7.3°, p = 0.10), and SS (32.8° vs. 32.1°, p = 0.75). Both the immature and mature groups of SD patients presented significantly lower PI and SS than normal children, adolescents, and adults, and significantly lower PT than normal adults.

- **Conclusions**: There is no significant difference in sagittal spinopelvic parameters between skeletally immature and mature subjects with SD.

### Diagnosing mucopolysaccharidosis IVA [^1161F2U6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

The path to diagnosis begins with the development of clinical suspicion of MPS IVA. Clinical suspicion can originate from clinical findings, radiographic findings, or a combination of both. Patients typically appear normal at birth, then begin to develop symptoms at varying rates depending on the severity of their disease. Severely affected patients will usually present with signs and symptoms within the first year of life, while patients with attenuated disease may not develop initial symptoms until later in childhood or adolescence. Initial signs and symptoms vary from patient to patient and may be present alone or in combination. The presence or absence of any particular sign or symptom does not rule out or confirm MPS IVA.

Many patients are initially seen by specialists such as orthopedic surgeons, ophthalmologists, or rheumatologists who may not be familiar with MPS IVA. Increased awareness of MPS disorder signs and symptoms, especially those that do not fit the classic phenotype, among these specialists is needed to facilitate prompt referral to a physician familiar with the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders, such as a clinical geneticist or a metabolic specialist.

The EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines on Wilson's disease emphasize specific circumstances for pediatric patients. For diagnostic evaluation, it is recommended to obtain a brain MRI at the diagnosis stage to evaluate the extent of disease, especially in older pediatric patients over 10 years of age, even if they are asymptomatic. Hence, brain MRI should be obtained in pediatric patients over 10 years of age who have a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

### A novel surgical indication for Scheuermann's kyphosis [^114ELbDF]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Scheuermann kyphosis can be treated surgically to restore proper sagittal alignment. Thoracic curves greater than 70° are typically indicated for surgical intervention. However, patients who have reached their natural limit of compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis are at risk of accelerated degeneration. This can be determined by comparing lumbar lordosis on standing neutral radiographs and supine extension radiographs. Minimal additional lordosis in extension compared with neutral, abutment of the spinous processes, or greater lumbar lordosis standing than with attempted extension suggest the patient is maximally compensated.

We present a case of an adolescent boy with Scheuermann kyphosis who had reached the limit of his hyperlordosis compensation reserve. He subsequently underwent a T4 to L2 posterior spinal fusion with T7 to T11 Ponte Smith-Petersen grade two osteotomies. He tolerated the procedure well with no intraoperative complications or neuromonitoring changes. The patient has continued to do well and progressed to normal activity at 5-month follow-up.

### Intraoperative prone radiographs during Scheuermann kyphosis correction closely estimate standing thoracic and lumbar parameters at 2 years [^117N8Lx5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Low credibility.

In patients with Scheuermann kyphosis (SK) undergoing posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation (PSFI), intraoperative lateral radiographs assess deformity correction in the prone position. The relationship between thoracic and partially un-instrumented lumbar parameters on prone intraoperative versus standing postoperative radiographs is unknown.

- **Methods**: Forty-five consecutive patients with SK who underwent PSFI between 2007 and 2014 were reviewed. Thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), instrumented level kyphosis [upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) to lower instrumented vertebrae (LIV)], and traditional sagittal parameters were recorded from preoperative standing, intraoperative prone, first outpatient standing, and over 2-year standing radiographs. Time periods were compared. Exclusion criteria included reduction modification after intraoperative radiographs and postoperative construct revision prohibiting comparison to initial intraoperative radiographs.

- **Results**: Twenty-five patients, averaging 16 (range 12 to 20) years old during surgery with a follow-up of 3.1 (range 2 to 7) years, met inclusion criteria. Average surgical variables included 13 ± 1 fusion levels, UIV at T2, LIV at L3, 3.8 ± 1.6 osteotomies per patient, and 43 ± 9% correction of TK. Preoperative TK and LL measured 82 and 76 degrees, respectively. TK on intraoperative (47 degrees), 6-week (49 degrees), and over 2-year (50 degrees) radiographs changed significantly only between intraoperative and over 2-year radiographs [P = 0.03] by just 3 degrees. LL increased by 5 degrees from intraoperative prone to 6-week standing radiographs.

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments [^1122qHsh]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

The cornerstone of the diagnostic assessment of a patient with symptoms concerning Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRD) is the history and examination. Although advances in molecular biomarkers of brain diseases leading to cognitive impairment will likely enable their detection in some patients at an asymptomatic stage, the ability of proficient clinicians to recognize and diagnose patients in the early symptomatic stages of these illnesses is critical to optimize early management and hopefully minimize the adverse impact of these diseases on daily function and safety.

Although it is common for a history to be taken and an examination to be performed without the use of specific validated instruments, evidence indicates, and the DETeCD‐ADRD workgroup strongly believes, that the use of such instruments will lead to better outcomes. Instruments to assess symptoms in daily life and their impact on function can be given to patients and informants prior to an office visit. They can serve as a mechanism for structuring the history and efficiently identifying areas for focused clinical interviewing while also providing a list of pertinent negatives.

A brief neurologic exam tailored to the patient is also important, as is a mental status exam augmented with a validated cognitive assessment instrument. The score on the test should not be interpreted in isolation but should be integrated with information from the history of present illness (HPI), the patient's demographic background and psychosocial history, family history, and other information relevant to the risk profile, medical history, medications, and other relevant information.

### Rate and predisposing factors for sacroiliac joint radiographic progression following a two-year follow-up period in recent-onset spondyloarthritis [^114yPRqF]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The recommended imaging investigations for patients with chronic inflammatory back pain (present for ≥ 3 months) occurring before the age of 45 years include both plain radiographs of the pelvis and, in the case of normal findings on radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis, since the suspected diagnosis in this case is axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), and the involvement of the sacroiliac (SI) joints seems to be a cornerstone of the disease. For epidemiologic studies and/or clinical trials, patients are enrolled according to existing classification criteria. The presence of structural damage of the SI joints observed on plain radiographs of the pelvis is mandatory in the first set of classification criteria (the New York criteria and the modified New York criteria). These abnormalities on radiographs are wrongly called "sacroiliitis", since "-itis" means an inflammatory process in medicine, and plain radiography cannot detect inflammation but only chronic change and structural damage, such as subchondral bone sclerosis and joint irregularities.

Imaging modalities

- **Plain radiographs (X-ray)**: Plain radiographs are the most frequent modality used for postoperative spine evaluation due to their easy access and cost-effectiveness, usually including anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and flexion–extension motion views. It is important to perform an immediate postoperative baseline radiograph to serve as a comparison parameter for future studies. Radiographs allow an overview of the relationship between surgical instruments and bone structures (Fig. 1 A), evaluating complications related to the implants, fusion status, and alignment. It can also assess instability by dynamic acquisition.

Fig. 1: Stabilization construct for deformity correction (scoliosis). Anteroposterior (a) radiograph and sagittal CT reformat in a bone algorithm (b) demonstrate a fusion/stabilization procedure using bilateral rods with transpedicular and lateral body screws (arrows) extending through the thoracolumbar spine (from T4-T5 to L5-S1). There is no sign of loosening (such as lucency around the screws) or fracture of components. Note the fusion (arthrodesis) of the posterior elements of the lumbar spine (arrowhead), indicating a successful outcome.

Panoramic radiographs play a major role in the preoperative evaluation for the detection of scoliosis, malalignment, vertebral counting, and assessment of transitional vertebrae to ensure that the surgery occurs at the correct level. They serve also as a reference for intraoperative fluoroscopy, especially to check spine levels and confirm the appropriate position and location of implants.

### Flexion myelopathy of the thoracic spine. Case report [^1169GAvy]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2007). Low credibility.

This report presents a rare case of surgically treated symptomatic thoracic kyphosis caused by dynamic compression in an elderly man. While myelopathy due to thoracic kyphosis has been documented in patients with congenital kyphosis, Scheuermann dorsal kyphosis, and Cushing's disease, this case is noted by the authors as the first report of dynamic kyphosis in an elderly person. The patient, an otherwise healthy 84-year-old man, experienced a 2-year history of progressive difficulty in walking and bilateral leg dysesthesia. Despite undergoing several cervical and lumbar surgeries, his symptoms continued to worsen. Radiological examination identified severe thoracic kyphosis with a lateral Cobb angle of 59 degrees from T-2 to T-12. A dynamic computed tomography (CT) myelogram showed severe thoracic spinal cord draping and stretching on flexion. However, on extension, there was no evidence of draping or stretching. Surgical intervention involved posterior corrective fusion with instrumentation spanning from T-2 to T-9. Postoperative CT myelography indicated the restoration of the cerebrospinal fluid space anterior to the spinal cord and a successful correction of the kyphosis to 44 degrees. The patient's neurological symptoms gradually improved over a follow-up period of six months.

### How does the supine MRI correlate with standing radiographs of different curve severity in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^113KMAdc]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was conducted to examine the correlation between supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and standing radiographs across various curve severities in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). It has been identified that there is a linear correlation between Cobb angles measured on supine MRI and those on standing radiographs. However, the impact of different curve severities on this correlation has not been thoroughly investigated.

Girls with AIS who had both standing radiographs and supine MRI were reviewed. For each participant, all structural and nonstructural Cobb angles were measured from standing radiographs. For individuals who had simultaneous lateral radiographs, thoracic kyphosis (TK) and lumbar lordosis (LL) angles were also measured. Measurements of coronal Cobb angles, as well as TK and LL, were taken on supine MRI. The coronal Cobb angles were categorized into three groups based on standing radiograph measurements: mild group for Cobb angles less than 20°, moderate group for 20° to 40°, and severe group for more than 40°. Correlations were analyzed using scatter plots.

Eighty patients with AIS and 122 coronal curves were reviewed. The coronal Cobb angles measured on standing radiographs were 14.7° ± 3.2°, 28.2° ± 5.1°, and 54.9° ± 11.3° for mild, moderate, and severe groups, respectively. On supine MRI, the Cobb angles averaged 10.1° ± 5.6°, 20.0° ± 6.3°, and 49.4° ± 12.3° for the respective groups. TK measurements were 16.3° ± 9.1° and 11.8° ± 6.1° for radiographs and MRI (P < 0.001), while LL averaged 45.5° ± 12.2° and 39.5° ± 10.5° for radiographs and MRI (P < 0.001).

### The assessment of the postoperative spinal alignment: MRI adds up on accuracy [^114A3XHN]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The sagittal profile of conventionally and surgically treated scoliotic spines is usually analyzed via lateral views of whole-spine X-rays in an upright position. Due to a more hypokyphotic configuration of scoliotic spines, the view onto the upper thoracic vertebrae is often difficult. We investigated whether additional supine MRI measurement supports valid kyphosis angle measurement.

- **Patients and methods**: Twenty patients with either short (n = 10, Halm-Zielke, VDS) or long spondylodesis (n = 10, dorsoventral) were assessed 5 years after surgery with standing radiographs and supine whole-spine MRI.

- **Results**: Up to 90% of the upper thoracic vertebrae were invisible on radiographs, whereas MRI allowed visibility of almost all vertebrae. No significant difference in thoracal kyphosis angles could be observed in the comparison of X-ray and MRI data.

- **Conclusion**: Thoracal kyphosis measurement of postoperative spines in MRI is a valid diagnostic tool with reliability comparable to that of X-ray. These results cannot be transferred to lumbar lordosis measurement and transferred only partly to coronal COBB angle measurement.

### Untreated Scheuermann's disease: A 37-year follow-up study [^111p6z5b]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

There are only a few follow-up studies of untreated Scheuermann's disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between vertebral changes, back pain, and disability in patients with untreated Scheuermann's disease following a 37-year follow-up.

- **Materials and methods**: Eighty patients responded to a postal questionnaire concerning back pain and disability, and 49 of them had classic Scheuermann's disease. Degree of kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis, the number of affected vertebrae, and mean and maximum wedge angles were measured from radiographs. Back pain and disability scores were compared to a sample of the general Finnish population (n = 3,835).

- **Results**: At follow-up, the patients were on average 59 (SD 8) years old (range 44–79 years), and the mean follow-up time was 37 (SD 7) years (26–54 years). The patients comprised more males than females (3.1:1). At follow-up, male patients were on average 3 cm taller than controls (p = 0.007). At age 20, female patients compared to controls were on average 6 kg heavier (p = 0.016) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) (mean 23.9 kg/m² vs. 20.8 kg/m², p = 0.001). Scheuermann's patients had a 2.5-fold [odds ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–4.5, p = 0.003] increased risk for constant back pain compared to controls. The risk for disability because of back pain during the past 5 years (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.4–4.7, p = 0.002), risk for back pain during the past 30 days (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.9–7.0, p < 0.001), and risk for sciatic pain (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.3–4.3, p = 0.005) were higher compared to controls.

### Surgical treatment of Scheuermann's kyphosis using a combined antero-posterior strategy and pedicle screw constructs: Efficacy, radiographic and clinical outcomes in 111 cases [^116ngoj5]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

There is sparse literature on how best to correct Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK). The efficacy of a combined strategy with anterior release and posterior fusion (AR/PSF) with regard to correction rate and outcome is yet to be determined.

- **Materials and methods**: A review of a consecutive series of SK patients treated with AR/PSF using pedicle screw-rod systems was performed. Assessment of demographics, complications, surgical parameters, and radiographs including flexibility and correction measures, proximal junctional kyphosis angle (JKA +1), and spino-pelvic parameters was performed, focusing on the impact of curve flexibility on correction and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: 111 patients were eligible with a mean age of 23 years, a follow-up of 24 months, and an average of eight levels fused. The Cobb angle at the fusion level was 68° preoperatively and 37° postoperatively. Flexibility on traction films was 34%, and the correction rate was 47%. Postoperative and follow-up Cobb angles were highly correlated with preoperative bending films (r = 0.7, p < 0.05). The screw density rate was 87%, with increased correction with higher screw density (p < 0.001, r = 0.4). Patients with an increased junctional kyphosis angle (JKA +1) were at higher risk of revision surgery (p = 0.049). 22 patients sustained complications, and 21 patients had revision surgery. 42 patients with ≥ 24 months follow-up were assessed for clinical outcomes (follow-up rate for clinical measures was 38%). This subgroup showed no significant differences regarding baseline parameters as compared to the whole group.

### A novel surgical indication for Scheuermann's kyphosis [^1116tgqU]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Alignment targets are often cited as 40 to 50°; however, surgical correction of thoracic kyphosis (TK) < 50° should probably be avoided. The flexibility of the curve is also an important consideration. This patient's T4 to T12 TK decreased to 41° during the supine MRI compared with his initial standing radiographs (36° versus 77°, respectively). Radiographs from postoperative day three demonstrated that 26° of T4 to T12 TK correction was achieved (77° to 51°). This resulted in a T4 to T12 TK-pelvic incidence (PI) mismatch of 5°. However, a 4° correctional loss was noted at the five-month postoperative visit, which increased the mismatch to 9° (55° to 46°). This loss is similar to early reports by Bradford et al, but more recent studies have reported minimal correction losses (2.6° to 6°) using a posterior approach.

- **Combined anterior-posterior spinal fusion**: This approach for Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK) has been recommended by many investigators to maximize initial deformity correction, prevent correctional loss, and minimize the risk of pseudarthrosis. Ponte advocated a posterior-only approach using thoracic pedicle screws, which has been widely used for correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis but has not been widely accepted owing to concerns that there would be a risk of correction loss and/or instrumentation failure. Geck et al. provided additional evidence to support the use of the Ponte procedure.

- **Segmental posterior shortening osteotomies**: Segmental pedicle screw fixation provides good correction of the deformity in SK. However, recent studies have demonstrated similar results for anterior-posterior and posterior-only approaches.

Refer to boxed **warnings**, **precautions**, **adverse reactions**, and **overdosage** sections for additional information on serious adverse reactions and steps to be taken, if any occur.

Extreme caution is necessary when using diagnostic skin tests or injection treatment in highly sensitive patients who have experienced severe symptoms or anaphylaxis by natural exposure, or during previous skin testing or treatment. In these cases, the potency for skin tests and the escalation of the treatment dose must be adjusted to the patient's sensitivity and tolerance.

The benefit versus risk needs to be evaluated in steroid-dependent asthmatics, patients with unstable asthma, or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.

Injections should never be given intravenously. A 5/8 inch, 25 gauge needle on a sterile syringe allows for deep subcutaneous injection. Withdraw the plunger slightly after inserting the needle to determine if a blood vessel has been entered.

Proper measurement of dose and caution in making injections will minimize reactions. Adverse reactions to allergenic extracts are usually apparent within 20–30 minutes following the injection of immunotherapy.

Extract should be temporarily withheld or dosage reduced in case of any of the following conditions:

1. Flu or other infection with fever
2. Exposure to excessive amounts of allergen prior to injection
3. Rhinitis and/or asthma exhibiting severe symptoms
4. Adverse reaction to previous injection until the cause of the reaction has been evaluated by the physician supervising the patient's immunotherapy program.

### Hypermobility among adolescents and the association with spinal deformities: A large cross-sectional study [^115Bd7N4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Spinal deformities (SD) in adolescents, primarily adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and Scheuermann kyphosis (SK), are widely studied. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most frequently observed type of scoliosis, manifesting after age 10 and occurring in 1% to 3% of the population. Spinal deformity manifests in several ways: even minimal curvatures have been linked to back pain experienced during adolescence and subsequent years, affecting notable psychosocial well-being, body image perception, and, in severe cases, may impair respiratory functions.

The cause and development of scoliosis and kyphosis remain enigmatic, although multiple factors likely influence these. Certain elements such as increased height, late onset of puberty, especially delayed menarche in females, and a diminished body mass index have been identified as contributors. Screening strategies encompass Adam's forward bend test, scoliometer measurements of trunk rotation angle, and back surface topography that harnesses digital imagery to detect spinal anomalies.

Hypermobility, a condition where the joints can move beyond the typical range, is observed in varying degrees across populations. While hypermobility pertains to the laxity of ligaments and joint capsules, hyperflexibility describes the excessive stretching capabilities of the musculotendinous unit. The two, although distinct, often manifest with overlapping symptoms and can be seen concurrently in individuals. In previous studies, hypermobility has been associated with low back pain, possibly due to excessive spinal segment motion.

### Scheuermann's kyphosis: Diagnosis, management, and selecting fusion levels [^115FDBuN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Low credibility.

Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK) is a rigid structural deformity of the thoracic spine, defined radiographically as three or more contiguous vertebrae with at least 5° of wedging anteriorly. The prevalence of the disease is thought to be between 0.4% and 10%. The true cause of SK remains unclear; however, various theories suggest growth irregularities, mechanical factors, genetic factors, and poor bone quality as potential causes.

Patients with mild disease (curves less than 70°) generally have a favorable prognosis with good clinical outcomes. Most patients with SK are successfully treated nonsurgically through observation, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. Surgical intervention is indicated for patients with curves greater than 70° to 75° thoracic or 25° to 30° thoracolumbar, as well as those with intractable pain, neurologic deficit, cardiopulmonary compromise, or poor cosmesis.

Advancements in posterior spinal instrumentation now allow surgery to typically be performed through a posterior-only approach. When surgical treatment is planned, appropriate selection of the upper- and lower-instrumented vertebrae is crucial to achieve a well-balanced spine, preserve motion segments, and reduce the risk of junctional kyphosis.

### The surgical treatment of severe Scheuermann's kyphosis [^115vdapw]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The study aimed to report the surgical outcomes of patients with severe Scheuermann's kyphosis treated using a consistent technique and perioperative management.

The methods involved reviewing 88 consecutive patients with severe Scheuermann's kyphosis who had undergone posterior spinal fusion with closing wedge osteotomies and hybrid instrumentation. The cohort included 55 males and 33 females, with a mean age of 15.9 years (ranging from 12.0 to 24.7 years) at the time of surgery. The study recorded demographic details, spinopelvic parameters, surgical correction, perioperative data, and assessed the impact of surgical complications on outcomes using the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 questionnaire.

The results showed a mean follow-up of 8.4 years (ranging from 2 to 14.9 years). Among the 88 patients, 85 (96.6%) exhibited a thoracic deformity. Posterior spinal fusion with closing-wedge osteotomies and hybrid instrumentation was performed in 86 patients, while two patients underwent a combination of anterior and posterior spinal fusion. The mean kyphosis was corrected from 94.5° to 47.5° (p < 0.001), and both coronal and sagittal balances returned to normal. The complication rate was 12.5%, with no neurological deficits, implant failures, or need for revision surgery reported. SRS-22 scores improved significantly from a mean of 3.6 (1.3 to 4.1) to 4.6 (4.2 to 5.0) at two years (p < 0.001), indicating high patient satisfaction. Non-smokers and those with lower preoperative SRS-22 scores exhibited greater improvement in quality of life. Notably, sagittal pelvic balance did not change after kyphosis correction and was found to correlate with lumbar lordosis, but not with thoracic or thoracolumbar kyphosis.

### Classical Scheuermann disease in male monozygotic twins: further support for the genetic etiology hypothesis [^113tVDHn]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Classic cases of Scheuermann disease in male monozygotic twins are reported. The primary objective of this study is to report these classic cases among male monozygotic twins and to discuss previous cases of Scheuermann disease in monozygotic twins, alongside the genetic etiology theory of Scheuermann kyphosis.

The etiology of Scheuermann disease remains unclear. Both genetic and mechanical factors, or a combination of the two, have been postulated to explain Scheuermann disease. The genetic etiology hypothesis suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. In support of this hypothesis, two cases of Scheuermann disease in monozygotic twins have been previously reported in the English literature.

The criteria of Sørensen and Sachs et al. were utilized to diagnose Scheuermann kyphosis. Clinical examination and lateral spinal radiographs were performed on a male monozygotic twin. Both parents were clinically investigated for signs of a kyphotic deformity. Scheuermann disease was noted in both patients at the same vertebral levels. The Cobb angle of the kyphosis was measured at 74 degrees and 48 degrees, respectively. Clinical examination of both parents did not show any kyphotic abnormality.

These cases of classic Scheuermann disease in monozygotic male twins support the theory that there is a genetic contribution to classic Scheuermann disease.
