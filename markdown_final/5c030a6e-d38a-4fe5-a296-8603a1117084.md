## Question

What is the dosage of doxycycline for acne

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dosage of doxycycline for treating acne, including standard dosing, subantimicrobial options, pediatric considerations, duration, administration, safety, and stewardship, with explicit self-verification of claims throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing for doxycycline in severe acne. Then, I should verify guideline-supported dosing ranges and whether a loading dose is necessary. Next, I will examine subantimicrobial dosing evidence and its mechanism. After that, I need to check pediatric dosing and age restrictions. I will then review duration limits and the requirement for concomitant topical therapy. Finally, I should confirm administration details, key safety issues, and antibiotic stewardship principles before summarizing practical dosing recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled regimen for severe acne, because that anchors the highest-credibility dosing source. The FDA labeling for doxycycline monohydrate specifies a loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 given in 2–4 divided doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg daily in 1–2 divided doses, which applies to adjunctive treatment of severe acne in adults [^115FejWY] [^111AQ2Z9]. Wait, I should verify whether a loading dose is universally required; the label frames it as standard for severe acne, but guidelines often allow flexibility in moderate disease, so I will keep that nuance in mind as I proceed [^115FejWY].

> Next, I should review contemporary guideline recommendations to ensure alignment with real-world practice. The 2024 AAD guidelines support doxycycline as a first-line systemic antibiotic for moderate to severe inflammatory acne, typically in the 1.7–2.4 mg/kg/day range, and explicitly endorse subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline 20 mg twice daily to 40 mg daily for moderate inflammatory acne, which operationalizes a lower-dose, anti-inflammatory strategy [^113679yM]. Hold on, I should verify whether any major guideline contradicts this. European guidance similarly prefers doxycycline or lymecycline over minocycline, reinforcing doxycycline's primacy and supporting dose flexibility within the tetracycline class [^114aLP7E].

> I will now examine the subantimicrobial dosing evidence, because mechanism and resistance concerns matter. Subantimicrobial doxycycline 20 mg twice daily achieved significant reductions in inflammatory lesions without exerting antimicrobial pressure on skin flora, with no emergence of resistance in a pivotal trial, supporting an anti-inflammatory mechanism rather than antibacterial killing [^115jmVcF]. Let me double-check comparative data: modified-release doxycycline 40 mg once daily has shown comparable efficacy to 100 mg once daily with fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, which strengthens the case for lower-dose strategies when tolerability is a concern [^112H6Vkv]. But wait, what if food affects absorption at low doses; I should confirm that point later when discussing administration.

> Now, pediatric considerations require careful verification. I initially thought doxycycline is contraindicated under age 8, but wait, let me verify the nuance here. Pediatric guidance recommends avoiding tetracyclines under age 8 due to risk of tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia, yet the FDA labeling provides weight-based dosing for children over 8 years and under 100 pounds, using 2 mg/lb on day 1 divided twice daily, then 1 mg/lb daily thereafter, which implies that use is permissible in children older than 8 with appropriate weight-based dosing and risk counseling [^113mPhvU] [^112Wju4E]. Hold on, I should verify that the acne indication is framed as adjunctive in severe cases on the FDA label; yes, the labeling aligns with adjunctive therapy in severe acne, reinforcing that systemic antibiotics are reserved for more severe or refractory presentations in pediatrics [^115FejWY].

> Next, I should review duration limits and the requirement for concomitant topical therapy, because stewardship is critical. Guidelines consistently recommend limiting systemic antibiotic use to the shortest effective duration, typically 3–4 months, with reassessment to decide continuation or transition, and they strongly advise against monotherapy with systemic antibiotics, mandating concomitant topical retinoid and/or benzoyl peroxide to mitigate resistance and maintain response [^113ZdjTj] [^113Wi2sn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall older practices sometimes extended antibiotics beyond 6 months; I need to ensure current guidance explicitly discourages that, and indeed contemporary recommendations emphasize limiting duration and pairing with topicals to reduce resistance and relapse risk [^113ZdjTj].

> I need to check administration details, including food effects and esophageal safety, because adherence and tolerability hinge on these. Doxycycline should be taken with a full glass of water and patients should remain upright to reduce esophagitis risk; while older teaching advised avoiding food, more recent data suggest taking doxycycline with food can reduce gastrointestinal upset, though high-fat meals may modestly reduce bioavailability, particularly with some modified-release formulations, so patient-specific counseling is prudent [^111HNExw] [^112LnSCo]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical significance of food effects; studies suggest the reduction in exposure may be modest and not always clinically meaningful, especially at higher doses, but for low-dose modified-release doxycycline, label instructions may still recommend fasting windows, so I should tailor advice to the specific product [^112LnSCo].

> Let me consider key safety issues and monitoring, and I should double-check which risks are dose-related. Photosensitivity is a notable class effect and appears dose-dependent, so sun protection counseling is essential, and patients should be educated to recognize early phototoxic reactions to enable timely intervention or medication adjustment [^1141xsdq]. I should confirm rare but serious risks: pseudotumor cerebri has been studied with tetracyclines, and while observational data suggest a small signal that attenuates with adjustment, vigilance for headache and visual symptoms is warranted, especially with prolonged use or interacting medications [^111EQcVm]. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common but often manageable with formulation choice and administration technique, and esophagitis risk is mitigated by upright dosing with water [^111HNExw].

> I will now examine antibiotic stewardship and resistance considerations, because this shapes dose selection and duration. Subantimicrobial dosing reduces selection pressure and has not been associated with increased resistance in Cutibacterium acnes or skin flora, supporting its role when anti-inflammatory control is the goal rather than bacterial eradication [^115jmVcF]. Guidelines also emphasize that even with antimicrobial-dose regimens, concomitant benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids should be used to limit resistance and maintain efficacy, and real-world data show many patients remain on oral antibiotics longer than recommended, underscoring the need for planned discontinuation and topical maintenance [^113ZdjTj] [^112Gm3BM]. Wait, let me verify that no major guideline endorses indefinite systemic antibiotics; none do, and all align on limiting duration and pairing with non-antibiotic topicals [^113ZdjTj].

> Putting this together, I should summarize practical dosing while preserving the earlier nuances. For adults with moderate to severe inflammatory acne, standard antimicrobial dosing is 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily, with some clinicians using a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 per FDA precedent for severe disease, though guidelines allow flexibility and a loading dose is not universally required in moderate disease [^115FejWY] [^113679yM]. For patients prioritizing tolerability or for moderate inflammatory acne, subantimicrobial dosing of 20 mg twice daily or modified-release 40 mg once daily provides comparable anti-inflammatory efficacy with fewer gastrointestinal adverse events and minimal resistance pressure, and can be used for 3–4 months alongside topical therapy before reassessing for continuation or transition to maintenance [^112H6Vkv] [^115jmVcF] [^113ZdjTj]. In children older than 8 years with severe acne, weight-based dosing of 2 mg/lb on day 1 divided twice daily, then 1 mg/lb daily, is acceptable with appropriate counseling on dental risks and monitoring, and systemic antibiotics should be reserved for more severe or refractory cases [^112Wju4E] [^113mPhvU]. I should confirm that all systemic antibiotic courses remain time-limited and paired with benzoyl peroxide and/or a topical retinoid to optimize outcomes and minimize resistance, which is consistently endorsed across contemporary guidelines [^113ZdjTj] [^113Wi2sn].

The standard doxycycline dose for acne is **100 mg orally once daily** [^115FejWY] or 50 mg twice daily [^115FejWY], typically for 3–4 months [^112KX3xB] alongside topical benzoyl peroxide and a retinoid to limit resistance [^113ZdjTj]. For patients who cannot tolerate higher doses, **subantimicrobial dosing of 40 mg once daily** (20 mg twice daily) is effective [^112H6Vkv] and reduces gastrointestinal and photosensitivity side effects [^115jmVcF]. Always take with food and a full glass of water to minimize GI upset and esophageal irritation [^111HNExw], and avoid use in pregnancy, breastfeeding, or children under 8 years [^113679yM] [^111KqDNs].

---

## Standard dosing regimen

- **Standard dose**: 100 mg orally once daily or 50 mg twice daily [^112Wju4E] [^115FejWY].
- **Duration**: Typically 3–4 months [^112KX3xB], reassessing at 3 months to determine continuation or transition to maintenance therapy [^113ZdjTj].
- **Combination therapy**: Always prescribed with topical benzoyl peroxide and a topical retinoid to reduce resistance and enhance efficacy [^113ZdjTj] [^113679yM].

---

## Subantimicrobial dosing

- **Subantimicrobial dose**: 40 mg once daily (20 mg twice daily) [^112H6Vkv] [^111MMm9k].
- **Efficacy**: Comparable to standard dosing for inflammatory lesions with fewer gastrointestinal and photosensitivity side effects [^112H6Vkv] [^115jmVcF].
- **Mechanism**: Anti-inflammatory effects without antimicrobial activity, reducing resistance risk [^115jmVcF].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimens

| **Dose** | **Efficacy** | **Side effects** | **Resistance risk** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 100 mg daily | High efficacy for moderate-to-severe acne | Higher GI and photosensitivity | Higher resistance risk |
| 40 mg daily | Comparable efficacy for inflammatory lesions | Lower GI and photosensitivity | Lower resistance risk |

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, esophagitis; take with food and water, remain upright after dosing [^111KqDNs].
- **Photosensitivity**: Use sunscreen and avoid prolonged sun exposure [^112KX3xB].
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Contraindicated due to fetal harm and effects on bone development [^111x9vYR].
- **Pediatric use**: Avoid in children under 8 years due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration and impaired bone growth [^113mPhvU].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing

- **Severity of acne**: Higher severity may require standard dosing; milder cases may benefit from subantimicrobial dosing.
- **Patient tolerance**: GI sensitivity or photosensitivity may necessitate lower doses [^112H6Vkv].
- **Comorbidities**: Renal or hepatic impairment may require dose adjustments [^notfound].
- **Concurrent medications**: Antacids, calcium, iron, and dairy products can reduce absorption; separate dosing [^117UwDTR].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **follow-up** should occur every 3 months to assess efficacy, side effects, and adherence [^notfound]. Discontinue **antibiotics** after 3–4 months and transition to topical maintenance therapy to minimize resistance [^112KX3xB] [^113ZdjTj].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard dose**: 100 mg orally once daily or 50 mg twice daily for 3–4 months with topical benzoyl peroxide and retinoid [^113ZdjTj].
- **Subantimicrobial dose**: 40 mg once daily (20 mg twice daily) for patients intolerant to higher doses or concerned about resistance [^112H6Vkv].
- **Precautions**: Take with food and water; monitor for GI and photosensitivity side effects; avoid in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and children under 8 years [^1133taGA] [^111x9vYR] [^113mPhvU].

---

Doxycycline is effective for acne at **100 mg daily** [^113ZdjTj] or **40 mg subantimicrobial dosing** [^112H6Vkv], with the latter offering comparable efficacy and fewer side effects. Use with topical benzoyl peroxide and a retinoid, limit duration to 3–4 months, and monitor for adverse effects.

### Management of acne vulgaris: an evidence-based update [^114f59ic]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

This review summarizes clinically important findings from 3 systematic reviews, 1 updated guideline and a selection from the 62 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between February 2007 and January 2009 on the topic of acne vulgaris. Low glycaemic-load diets might reduce acne severity but this remains unproven. Written patient information leaflets have not been surpassed by other communication methods. New combination topical treatments have not shown convincing advantages over current combination products such as clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide. Topical dapsone is superior to placebo but has yet to be compared with standard topical treatments. Long-term topical tretinoin to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer in elderly men was associated with higher all-cause mortality, but there is currently no evidence of increased mortality for topical retinoid use when treating acne. All oral tetracyclines have similar efficacy, yet minocycline is the most costly. Oral isotretinoin monotherapy remains the gold-standard treatment for severe acne. Flutamide plus the oral contraceptive pill is beneficial for acne associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. Photodynamic therapy, phototherapy and laser therapy cannot be recommended universally for acne until minimal postinflammatory pigmentation and longer-term benefit can be shown, especially with current high costs. Development of non-antibiotic therapies is preferable to minimize the risk of community antibiotic resistance. Future trials should use active comparators at optimum doses and avoid noninferiority comparisons unless appropriately powered. Trials need to shift from using multiple, unvalidated outcome measures to including patient-reported and quality-of-life outcomes, and all trials should be registered on a public clinical-trials database.

### Doxycycline exposure during adolescence and future risk of non-affective psychosis and bipolar disorder: a total population cohort study [^1122Kib9]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analyses

For each primary Cox regression, a set of corresponding sensitivity analyses were run:
Stratifying by gender to compare the results for women and men.
Different estimates within different age-spans. Five age intervals were defined by quintiles of age at event, i.e. with an approximately equal number of non-affective psychosis/bipolar disorder diagnoses within each span.
A cross-sectional approach using logistic regression. Exposure was measured from the age of 13–20, baseline set to 20 and follow-up at the age of 22 (i.e. only including individuals with data up until 22 and no recorded outcome before 20). Binary exposure threshold was set to ≥ 2000 mg of doxycycline to roughly reflect the cross-sectional approach's more limited time of exposure.
To investigate potential confounding by acne, analyses were performed excluding all individuals with a documented acne diagnosis before or during the study period.
Finally, to investigate potential associations to the nonantibiotic acne drug isotretinoin, analyses were performed on all individuals but with isotretinoin as exposure (instead of doxycycline). Binary exposure threshold was set to ≥ 3000 mg, covering most individuals with > 0 mg of dispensed isotretinoin. (A total of 3000 mg being the same threshold as for doxycycline exposure in primary analysis was a mere coincidence.)

### Doxycycline hyclate (doxycycline) [^114u7rnh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to doxycycline, culture and susceptibility testing are recommended.

Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative bacteria, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:

Escherichia coli.
Enterobacter aerogenes.
Shigella species.
Acinetobacter species.
Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae.
Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species.

Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:

Upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis, including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure): to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis.

When penicillin is contraindicated, doxycycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections:

Uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum.
Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue.
Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes.
Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme.
Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii.
Infections caused by Clostridium species.

In acute intestinal amebiasis, doxycycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides.

In severe acne, doxycycline may be useful adjunctive therapy.

Prophylaxis

Doxycycline is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (< 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine resistant strains (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section and Information for Patients subsection of the PRECAUTIONS section).

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^112zNxtm]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Other studies evaluating the association of doxycycline on antimicrobial resistance of non-STI pathogens are limited, but data have been reported for acne treatment and malaria prophylaxis. Studies have largely found no relation between daily doxycycline and doxycycline resistance in Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermis, or gastrointestinal pathogens causing diarrhea; however, lower doses of doxycycline were used in these studies (22, 23). Few studies have examined the characteristics of S. aureus in persons taking daily doxycycline, but one study found that Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive methicillin-sensitive S. aureus was more common in persons on daily doxycycline than persons taking other malarial prophylaxis, and all Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive doxycycline-resistant methicillin-sensitive S. aureus isolates were found in persons taking doxycycline (24). The ability to draw conclusions from these studies is limited by the heterogeneity of studies and dosage and treatment duration compared with doxy PEP, and consideration should be given to monitoring other pathogens such as those that cause community-acquired pneumonia. There are no studies to date on long-term, intermittent use of doxycycline and the microbiome. Current data suggest overall benefit of the use of doxy PEP, but potential risks related to the development of resistance and changes in the microbiome will need to be monitored as these guidelines are implemented.

### Sarecycline treatment for acne vulgaris: rationale for weight-based dosing and limited impact of food intake on clinical efficacy [^114Zb1Nd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Tetracycline-class antibiotics are frequently prescribed by dermatologists, commonly for acne vulgaris. Gastrointestinal absorption of first and second-generation tetracycline-class antibiotics, including doxycycline and minocycline, may be reduced by co-administration with food, resulting in potentially lower clinical efficacy. Development of novel compounds and formulations that are not impacted by diet could improve compliance, absorption, and effectiveness among patients. The objective of this study is to investigate weight-based dosing protocols and the impact of food intake, including high-fat meals, on the absorption, and clinical efficacy of sarecycline, a novel oral narrow-spectrum third-generation tetracycline-class antibiotic approved by the Food and Drug Administration for acne vulgaris treatment. Data from 12 clinical studies were analyzed using population pharmacokinetic modeling, exposure-response modeling and pharmacodynamics to evaluate sarecycline dosing recommendations. The extent of exposure is estimated to decrease by 21.7% following co-administration of a sarecycline tablet with a high-fat meal. Based on the PopPK-PD model, this is equivalent to a decrease in efficacy of 0.9 inflammatory lesions, which is not clinically meaningful. Sarecycline can be administered using weight-based dosing with or without food. Co-administration with high-fat food has a limited impact on clinical efficacy. The pharmacokinetics of oral sarecycline may provide added convenience and support ease of use and improved compliance for acne vulgaris patients.

### Efficacy and safety of subantimicrobial dose, modified-release doxycycline 40 mg versus doxycycline 100 mg versus placebo for the treatment of inflammatory lesions in moderate and severe acne: a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study [^112H6Vkv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Routine use of doxycycline (DC) 100 mg for the treatment of moderate to severe acne may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs), thus potentially impacting patient adherence, and antibiotic resistance. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of subantimicrobial, modified-release (MR) DC 40 mg compared to DC 100 mg and to placebo for the treatment of inflammatory lesions in moderate and severe acne.

Methods

662 subjects aged 12 years or older with moderate to severe acne received subantimicrobial, MR-DC 40 mg tablets, DC 100 mg capsules, or placebo once daily for 16 weeks.

Results

MR-DC 40 mg was superior to placebo in the mean reduction of the number of inflammatory lesions, median percent reduction in inflammatory and total lesions, and success rate. MR-DC 40 mg was also comparable to DC 100 mg in the reduction of the number of inflammatory lesions, and percent reduction of total lesions. Incidence of drug-related AEs for MR-DC 40 mg was similar to placebo and was markedly smaller compared to DC 100 mg.

Discussion

MR-DC 40 mg demonstrated comparable efficacy and superior safety to DC 100 mg in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne.

Future Prospects for Targeting Inflammation in Acne

Topical Treatments

New Formulations and Combinations of Existing Topical Acne Treatments

Several new topical treatments for acne are currently under investigation: this includes new formulations (including microencapsulation of ingredients for improved penetration into the pilosebaceous unit and retinoid lotions), classes, and combinations of longstanding treatments (such as combined BP and retinoids that are more effective and well tolerated than individual components). The combination of newer topicals and older systemic agents holds promise for increased efficacy, as evidenced by a study on combined topical trifarotene and oral doxycycline. There are numerous novel agents which are currently under investigation for the treatment of acne (Table 1).

Table 1
New treatments targeting inflammation in acne

Topical Synthetic Cannabinoids

Topical synthetic cannabinoids are reported to treat inflammatory acne by suppressing sebum production, reducing C. acnes concentration, and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). One human trial utilizing a 3% cannabis seed extract cream found reduction in skin sebum production and erythema without significant side effects. A current study is evaluating the efficacy of a topical synthetic cannabinoid in treating acne with promising early results.

Topical Tranexamic Acid

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine which inhibits the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin to reduce blood loss. Topical TXA treats melasma by inhibiting UV driven melanocyte activation and reducing plasmin-mediated arachidonic acid and MSH release. Topical TXA has been previously shown to improve acne-induced post-inflammatory erythema, and more recently a split-face RCT of mild-to moderate acne treated with topical TXA 10% serum demonstrated a significant reduction in papulopustular lesions through immunomodulatory mechanisms requiring further study.

Topical Meclizine Gel

Meclizine dihydrochloride, an H1 histamine antagonist typically taken orally for motion sickness, has recently showed promising results for acne. Meclizine reduced the in vitro production of IL-8 and IL-1β by C. acnes -stimulated human keratinocytes and monocytes and decreased IL-1β, TNF-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production in ex vivo human skin. Meclizine 2% gel reduced acne severity by 20.1% in 60 patients.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^1112b1fZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Low‐certainty evidence from one study (91 participants) at unclear risk of bias showed that 40 mg MR doxycycline is at least as effective as 100 mg, with fewer side‐effects. 94

A noninferiority study of minocycline 100 mg with doxycycline 40 mg MR was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias. 43 Patients' assessments showed that 22 of 40 participants with minocycline achieved excellent or good improvement vs. 20 of 40 in the doxycycline 40 mg MR group (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.72–1.67; low‐certainty evidence). These findings were in accordance with lesion count reductions. Quality of life was assessed using RosaQol and the MD was −0.24 [95% CI −0.30 to −0.18; P < 0.001; low‐certainty evidence], a small and possibly unimportant difference favouring minocycline. Physicians' assessments based on IGA (clear or near clear) favoured minocycline [RR 3.43, 95% CI 1.67–7.04 (P < 0.001); NNTB 2, 95% CI 2–4; high‐certainty evidence]. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing an adverse event (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.83–1.65; low‐certainty evidence) with the adverse events being similar (e.g. gastrointestinal side‐effects and headache).

In one study (unclear risk of bias) with 60 participants, minocycline 45 mg with or without topical azelaic acid demonstrated similar effectiveness in reducing inflammatory lesions 2013) (low certainty of evidence). 142 There was a reduction of 11–12 lesions in both treatment arms.

Azithromycin versus doxycycline

Azithromycin 500 mg three times a week (and then tapered) vs. doxycycline 100 mg daily was evaluated in one study at high risk of bias (67 participants). 80 There were no differences in effectiveness and safety for any of the outcomes (very‐low‐certainty evidence). Both treatments reduced inflammatory lesions by 16–18 lesions within 3 months.

### Doxycycline (Monodox) [^111AQ2Z9]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

The dosage of doxycycline monohydrate PO for adjunctive treatment for acne vulgaris in adults (severe) is:

- **Start at**: 200 mg PO daily, in 2–4 divided doses, on day 1
- **Maintenance**: 100 mg PO daily, in 1–2 divided doses

### The "Heart sign": an early indicator of dose-dependent doxycycline-induced phototoxicity [^1141xsdq]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Oral doxycycline is an antibiotic commonly used for the treatment of inflammatory acne in adolescents. Dose-dependent phototoxicity, unrelated to dose duration, is a well-known complication of its use. We present three adolescents who developed bilateral phototoxic rashes on the dorsal thenar spaces of their hands while taking doxycycline for their acne. Identification of the "heart sign" rash as a specific doxycycline-related phototoxic reaction should alert clinicians to the need for prompt intervention, including sun protection counseling and a possible change in antibiotics, in the uniquely vulnerable adolescent population. Early recognition may allow patients to avoid future, more widespread phototoxic drug reactions.

### ARTICLE: a novel antibiotic just for acne [^1172sc9s]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dermatologists consistently rank as the most frequent prescribers of systemic antibiotics, and one of the most common diagnoses for which we recommend these agents is acne vulgaris. Up to three quarters of the antibiotics that dermatologists prescribe are in the tetracycline class.1 Even though dermatology as a specialty is well-known for off-label prescribing, it may be surprising to note that no systemic antibiotic had been FDA approved solely for treatment of acne&mdash; until recently.

### Duration of oral tetracycline-class antibiotic therapy and use of topical retinoids for the treatment of acne among general practitioners (GP): a retrospective cohort study [^112knEYS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend limiting the duration of oral antibiotic therapy in acne to 3 to 6 months and prescribing concomitant topical retinoids for all patients.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the duration of therapy with oral tetracyclines and the use of topical retinoids among patients with acne treated primarily by general practitioners in the United Kingdom.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Health Improvement Network database.

Results

The mean duration of therapy was 175.1 days. Of antibiotic courses, 62% were not associated with a topical retinoid; 29% exceeded 6 months in duration. If all regions were to achieve uses similar to the region with the shortest mean duration of therapy, approximately 3.3 million antibiotic days per year could be avoided in the United Kingdom.

Limitations

The Health Improvement Network does not include information on acne severity and clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Prescribing behavior for oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne among general practitioners is not aligned with current guideline recommendations. Increasing the use of topical retinoids and considering alternative agents to oral antibiotics when appropriate represent opportunities to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated complications such as antibiotic resistance and to improve outcomes in patients treated for acne.

### Minocycline in acne vulgaris: benefits and risks [^114qMYAG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Minocycline is a semi-synthetic, second-generation tetracycline. It was introduced in 1972 and has both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Minocycline is used for a variety of infectious diseases and in acne. Even today, new indications beyond the antibacterial indications are being investigated such as its use in neurologic diseases. Formerly, minocycline was thought to have a superior efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory acne, especially with respect to antibacterial-resistant Propionibacterium acnes. A thorough review of the literature, however, shows that minocycline is not more effective in acne than other tetracyclines. Compared with first-generation tetracyclines, minocycline has a better pharmacokinetic profile, and compared with doxycycline it is not phototoxic. However, minocycline has an increased risk of severe adverse effects compared with other tetracyclines. It may induce hypersensitivity reactions affecting the liver, lung, kidneys, or multiple organs (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms [DRESS] syndrome) in the first weeks of treatment and, with long-term treatment, may cause autoimmune reactions (systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hepatitis). In addition, CNS symptoms, such as dizziness, are more frequent compared with other tetracyclines. Long-term treatment may induce hyperpigmentation of the skin or other organs. Resistance of P. acnes to minocycline also occurs, dependent on the prescribing behavior. Considering the aspects of efficacy, its adverse effect profile, resistance, price, and alternatives, minocycline is no longer considered the first-line antibacterial in the treatment of acne.

### Once-daily oral sarecycline 1.5 mg / kg / day is effective for moderate to severe acne vulgaris: results from two identically designed, phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trials [^1161o4zP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Side effects may limit the use of current tetracycline-class antibiotics for acne.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily sarecycline, a novel, narrow-spectrum tetracycline-class antibiotic, in moderate to severe acne.

Methods

Patients 9–45 years with moderate to severe facial acne (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score ≥ 3, 20–50 inflammatory and ≤ 100 noninflammatory lesions, and ≤ 2 nodules) were randomized 1:1 to sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg/day or placebo for 12 weeks in identically designed phase 3 studies (SC1401 and SC1402).

Results

In SC1401 (sarecycline n = 483, placebo n = 485) and SC1402 (sarecycline n = 519, placebo n = 515), at week 12, IGA success (≥ 2-grade improvement and score 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear]) rates were 21.9% and 22.6% (sarecycline), respectively, versus 10.5% and 15.3% (placebo; P less than 0.0001 and P equals 0.0038). Onset of efficacy in inflammatory lesions occurred by the first visit (week 3), with mean percentage reduction in inflammatory lesions at week 12 in SC1401 and SC1402 of -51.8% and -49.9% (sarecycline), respectively, versus -35.1% and -35.4% (placebo; P less than 0.0001). Onset of efficacy for absolute reduction of noninflammatory lesion count occurred at week 6 in SC1401 (P less than 0.05) and week 9 in SC1402 (P less than 0.01). In SC1401, the most common TEAEs (in ≥ 2% of either sarecycline or placebo group) were nausea (4.6% [sarecycline]; 2.5% [placebo]), nasopharyngitis (3.1%; 1.7%), headache (2.7%; 2.7%), and vomiting (2.1%; 1.4%) and, in SC1402, nasopharyngitis (2.5%; 2.9%) and headache (2.9%; 4.9%). Most were not considered treatment-related. Vestibular (dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo) and phototoxic (sunburn, photosensitivity) TEAEs both occurred in ≤ 1% of sarecycline patients. Gastrointestinal TEAE rates for sarecycline were low. Among females, vulvovaginal candidiasis (SC1401: 1.1% [sarecycline] and 0 [placebo]; SC1402: 0.3% and 0) and mycotic infection (0.7% and 0; 1.0% and 0) rates were low.

Conclusion

The narrow-spectrum antibiotic sarecycline was safe, well tolerated, and effective for moderate to severe acne, with low rates of side effects common with tetracycline antibiotics. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(9):987–996.

### Efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose clindamycin phosphate 1.2%, benzoyl peroxide 3.1%, and adapalene 0.15% gel for moderate-to-severe acne: a randomized phase II study of the first triple-combination drug [^11334VYa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The pathogenesis of acne, one of the most common dermatologic disorders, is a multifactorial process involving follicular proliferation of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acne s), abnormal keratinization, and increased sebum production and inflammation. Effective treatment, which requires pharmacologic targeting of one or more of these pathophysiologic mechanisms, includes various prescription oral and topical treatments such as benzoyl peroxide (BPO), retinoids (topical tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene, trifarotene; oral isotretinoin), antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, clindamycin, minocycline, doxycycline, sarecycline), and hormonal therapies. Adherence rates to oral or topical acne treatments, however, are typically poor and reasons for low adherence include complex regimens, lack of efficacy, and adverse effects. Combining treatments in an easy-to-use, fixed-dose formulation can improve treatment adherence by reducing complex drug regimens. Furthermore, combining topical treatments that target multiple processes of acne pathogenesis may improve efficacy and is a recommended treatment strategy for the majority of patients with acne per the US treatment guidelines published in 2016.

Clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel (IDP-126), once approved, will be the first triple-combination fixed-dose topical acne treatment. Formulated as an aqueous gel, with no alcohol, preservatives, occlusive agents, or surfactants, it is pH balanced for the skin and contains propylene glycol, a hydrating humectant. As a smaller particle size allows for better penetration of the pilosebaceous unit, BPO and adapalene have been micronized. Additionally, all ingredients are contained within a polymeric gel to allow for even distribution on the skin. As vehicle formulation can affect the tolerability of topical treatments, the use of micronized ingredients contained within a polymeric gel may also provide better tolerability. Although combining multiple acne treatments into one formulation can be difficult, as some retinoids, such as tretinoin, are more susceptible to oxidative breakdown in the presence of BPO, adapalene is more stable than tretinoin under such conditions.

### Influence of market competition on tetracycline pricing and impact of price increases on clinician prescribing behavior [^115xCvn8]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Oral tetracyclines are commonly used for acne and other conditions. Recent generic price increases threaten access to these medications. Using the OptumInsight Clinformatics DataMart, we retrospectively evaluated the underlying factors behind these price increases for oral tetracylines using the framework of a competitive market and evaluated the impact of these price increases on prescribing practices. Between 2011 and 2013, the mean cost of doxycycline hyclate prescriptions increased from $7.16 to $139.89 and the mean out-of-pocket cost increased by $9.69. A comparable cost increase was not observed for doxycycline monohydrate or minocycline. There was no significant association between the cost of doxycycline hyclate and market concentration as assessed by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (β = 0.030, 95% confidence interval -0.019 to 0.079, P = 0.213) and the market was highly concentrated throughout the study period. The percentage of prescriptions for doxycycline hyclate decreased by 1.9% from 2011 to 2013. This dramatic increase in the cost of doxycycline hyclate is not easily explained using the framework of a competitive market, suggesting that noncompetitive market forces may be responsible. In addition, clinicians have not altered their prescribing behavior in response to this price increase, suggesting that clinician or pharmacy level interventions could potentially increase the use of less costly substitutes.

### Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety [^116eRejQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Minocycline is an oral antibiotic used for acne vulgaris. Its use has lessened due to safety concerns (including potentially irreversible pigmentation), a relatively high cost, and no evidence of any greater benefit than other acne treatments. A modified-release version of minocycline is being promoted as having fewer side-effects.

Objectives

To assess new evidence on the effects of minocycline for acne vulgaris.

Search Methods

Searches were updated in the following databases to November 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials registers and checked reference lists for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane Skin Group's Trials Search Co-ordinator undertook searches exploring minocycline's adverse effects in EMBASE and MEDLINE in February 2012.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing minocycline, at any dose, to an active or a placebo control, in participants with inflammatory acne vulgaris. For adverse effects, we selected additional studies that reported the number of adverse effects and the number of participants treated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and participants' global assessments, adverse effects, and dropout rates. Two authors independently assessed the quality of each study. Effect sizes were calculated, and meta-analyses were undertaken where possible. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the review of adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 12 new RCTs for this update, giving a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants). These additional 12 RCTs have not changed the original conclusions about the clinical efficacy of minocycline. The identified RCTs were generally small and poor quality. Meta-analysis was rarely possible because of the lack of data and different outcome measures and trial durations. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe acne vulgaris, there was no evidence that it is better than any of the other commonly-used acne treatments. One company-sponsored RCT found minocycline to be less effective than combination treatment with topical erythromycin and zinc. No trials have been conducted using minocycline in those participants whose acne is resistant to other therapies. Also, there is no evidence to guide what dose should be used. The adverse effects studies must be interpreted with caution. The evidence suggests that minocycline is associated with more severe adverse effects than doxycycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, is associated with lupus erythematosus, but the risk is small: 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. The risk of autoimmune reactions increases with duration of use. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the more expensive extended-release preparation is safer than standard minocycline preparations.

Authors' Conclusions

Minocycline is an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris, but there is still no evidence that it is superior to other commonly-used therapies. This review found no reliable evidence to justify the reinstatement of its first-line use, even though the price-differential is less than it was 10 years ago. Concerns remain about its safety compared to other tetracyclines.

### Trends in oral antibiotic use for acne treatment: a retrospective, population-based study in the United States, 2014 to 2016 [^112Gm3BM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance related to prolonged antibiotic use is an emerging threat to public health.

Objective

To evaluate recent trends in oral antibiotic use for acne treatment.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted from January 2014 through September 2016 using the IBM MarketScan&reg; claims database. Patients were aged &ge;9 years, prescribed an oral antibiotic, and diagnosed with acne vulgaris on 2 separate occasions. The primary outcome was the duration of oral antibiotic treatment over 12 months; continuous use was defined as &le;30-day gap between prescriptions.

Results

The most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments (N = 46,267) were doxycycline (36.7%) and minocycline (36.5%). Overall, 36%, 18%, 10%, and 5% of patients continuously used any oral antibiotic at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. Among patients who continuously used tetracyclines, a similar percentage was prescribed minocycline (40.2%, 18.6%, 10.5%, and 5.1%) vs doxycycline (34.7%, 14.6%, 7.7%, and 3.9%) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. A greater percentage of patients continued use of tetracyclineclass antibiotics than other therapeutic classes.

Limitations

Retrospective analysis of health-care claims data. Relatively short study duration.

Conclusion

Nearly 20% of patients continuously used oral antibiotics for &ge;6 months, exceeding American Academy of Dermatology guideline recommendations of 3 to 4 months. J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(3):265–270. doi:10.36849/JDD.7345.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111u9x2K]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength of our review and NMA was the inclusion of a wide range of acne treatments and, subsequently, a much larger number of RCTs (112 for mild‐to‐moderate and 67 for moderate‐to‐severe acne) than either of the two previously published NMAs. Furthermore, our NMA assessed treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne. The NMA results informed national clinical guidance. Our methodology enabled evidence synthesis from direct and indirect treatment comparisons and allowed simultaneous inference on all treatments. Our NMA employed class models to gain precision on the effects of treatments within the same class and to connect networks disconnected at the treatment level, thus allowing consideration of a wider evidence base. We measured efficacy using the percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline, as this is commonly reported across RCTs or can often be estimated using other available data, which allowed inclusion of a large evidence base in the respective analyses. Another validated efficacy measure, the Investigator Global Assessment scale, recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the assessment of effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of acne vulgaris, was used by fewer studies in our dataset; therefore, had we selected this outcome to measure efficacy, we would have limited our evidence base.

Dietary interventions (e.g. milk‐free diet, low glycaemic load diet), which may have an effect on acne vulgaris and its response to treatment, were not included in this review but were assessed in another review conducted to inform the NICE guideline. Although we searched for treatments for acne vulgaris at any body site, the majority of the RCTs included in our review focused on facial acne. This is a limitation of the evidence base and not of the review per se. Another potential limitation of our review was its focus on evidence published in the English language, following NICE guidance. On the other hand, evidence suggests that use of language restrictions in systematic review‐based meta‐analyses in conventional medicine does not introduce systematic bias. Furthermore, as the purpose of our NMA was to inform national guidance in England, we focused on pharmacological treatments that are available in the UK. This resulted in the exclusion of a number of potentially effective drug treatments for acne from the NMA, as they were not licensed in the UK at the time of the analysis (e.g. topical dapsone, topical tetracyclines). Final searches for evidence were conducted in May 2020, and it is possible that new evidence (and new treatments) have emerged since.

### Acne vulgaris [^112hQdzT]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris affects over 80% of teenagers, and persists beyond the age of 25 years in 3% of men and 12% of women. Typical lesions of acne include comedones, inflammatory papules, and pustules. Nodules and cysts occur in more severe acne and can cause scarring and psychological distress.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of topical and oral treatments in people with acne vulgaris? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 69 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: topical treatments (adapalene, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, erythromycin [alone or plus zinc]; isotretinoin, tetracycline, tretinoin); and oral treatments (doxycycline, isotretinoin, lymecycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline).

### Sarecycline treatment for acne vulgaris: rationale for weight-based dosing and limited impact of food intake on clinical efficacy [^114pLcCf]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Tetracycline‐class antibiotics are frequently prescribed by dermatologists, commonly for acne vulgaris. Gastrointestinal absorption of first and second‐generation tetracycline‐class antibiotics, including doxycycline and minocycline, may be reduced by co‐administration with food, resulting in potentially lower clinical efficacy. Development of novel compounds and formulations that are not impacted by diet could improve compliance, absorption, and effectiveness among patients. The objective of this study is to investigate weight‐based dosing protocols and the impact of food intake, including high‐fat meals, on the absorption, and clinical efficacy of sarecycline, a novel oral narrow‐spectrum third‐generation tetracycline‐class antibiotic approved by the Food and Drug Administration for acne vulgaris treatment. Data from 12 clinical studies were analyzed using population pharmacokinetic modeling, exposure–response modeling and pharmacodynamics to evaluate sarecycline dosing recommendations. The extent of exposure is estimated to decrease by 21.7% following co‐administration of a sarecycline tablet with a high‐fat meal. Based on the PopPK‐PD model, this is equivalent to a decrease in efficacy of 0.9 inflammatory lesions, which is not clinically meaningful. Sarecycline can be administered using weight‐based dosing with or without food. Co‐administration with high‐fat food has a limited impact on clinical efficacy. The pharmacokinetics of oral sarecycline may provide added convenience and support ease of use and improved compliance for acne vulgaris patients.

​INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline tablets and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.

Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

### Sarecycline treatment for acne vulgaris: rationale for weight-based dosing and limited impact of food intake on clinical efficacy [^111HNExw]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Especially with immediate‐release formulations, patients are commonly instructed to ingest doxycycline with food to reduce GI side effects., and a large volume of liquid (water). Administration of doxycycline taken without food and a large glass of water has been associated with "pill esophagitis" which causes pain, and gastric side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Likewise, ingestion of food along with minocycline is reported to help reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. Lastly, oral tetracycline is currently suggested to be given 1–2 h before meals to reduce potential impact of food on GI absorption.

Currently, sarecycline has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved specifically for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older, and can be taken once daily with or without food. The recommended dosage of sarecycline is based on body weight and is available in three daily dosages (60, 100, and 150 mg)(Table 1). Previous clinical and non‐clinical studies of sarecycline pharmacokinetics (PK) suggest that it may be administered with or without food, which supports this recommendation in the approved product labeling. The data evaluation below reports integrative PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) analyses evaluating both the relevance of weight‐based dosing and the impact of food intake on the efficacy of sarecycline.

### Effects of subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline in the treatment of moderate acne… [^115jmVcF]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Steady-state doxycycline plasma concentrations. Administration of 20 mg of doxycycline hyclate twice daily to healthy adults resulted in concentrations well below the minimum antimicrobial level. Mean percent decrease from baseline to 6 months in the total number of comedones, inflammatory lesions, and all lesions combined. Mean number of target organisms at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with placebo or 20 mg of doxycycline hyclate twice daily. Conclusions Twice-daily SD doxycycline treatment significantly reduced the number of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in patients with moderate facial acne, was well tolerated, had no detectable antimicrobial effect on the skin flora, and did not result in any increase in the number or severity of resistant organisms. TETRACYCLINES ARE indicated for use as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe acne; doxycycline and minocycline are the most commonly prescribed.

1, 2 Doxycycline treatment at doses of 100 to 200 mg/d has been shown to reduce the number and severity of inflammatory lesions. 1, 2. The differences in these scores between the study groups were not statistically significant but consistently trended toward improvement in the treatment group. The pharmacokinetic profile of SD doxycycline administered twice daily shows that plasma concentrations remain well below antimicrobial levels. In addition, long-term doxycycline therapy at this dosage resulted in fewer adverse events such as gastrointestinal upset, vaginitis, and phototoxic effects than have been reported with higher doxycycline doses. The present study shows that SD doxycycline administered twice daily for 6 months in patients with moderate inflammatory acne resulted in a greater than 50% reduction in the number of total lesions and a similar reduction in the number of comedones and inflammatory lesions measured independently.

Treatment with SD doxycycline twice daily had no effect on P acnes or other microflora of the skin, and there was no change in the composition of the normal skin flora. In conclusion, this is the first placebo-controlled trial of SD doxycycline treatment administered twice daily for acne and the first to show that the nonantimicrobial properties of doxycycline are effective and sufficient in controlling and improving the clinical signs and symptoms of acne without any effect on the skin flora. Twice-daily treatment with SD doxycycline for adults with moderate facial acne for 6 months significantly reduced the number of acne lesions, was well tolerated, had no detectable antimicrobial effect on the cultivable skin flora, and did not result in the emergence of resistant organisms.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^112KX3xB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Systemic antibiotic safety and stewardship in acne vulgaris are summarized as follows: Adverse events with the tetracycline class vary with each medication, with photosensitivity seen across the class and "doxycycline being more photosensitizing than minocycline", and doxycycline is "more frequently associated with gastrointestinal disturbances". When minocycline is compared to other tetracyclines, "more serious adverse events are reported (8.8 cases per 100,000 patient years)". For trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), adverse events include "gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, and drug eruptions", and the most severe eruptions are "Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis", which are "more common in patients with HIV"; with long-term therapy, patients "should be periodically monitored with a complete blood cell count", and "the concurrent use of TMP/SMX and methotrexate (MTX) can be associated with severe toxicity". For macrolides, "The macrolide class of antibiotics is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal disturbances", and macrolides "can also decrease metabolism of cyclosporine". Penicillins and cephalosporins are "most associated with the adverse events of hypersensitivity reactions ranging from mild drug eruptions to anaphylaxis". Regarding duration to limit resistance, "Limiting antibiotic use to the shortest possible duration, ideally 3–4 months, can be accomplished with the concomitant use of a retinoid".

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^113fS3sJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Treatments

Topical antibiotics for the treatment of acne include benzoyl peroxide (BP), clindamycin, erythromycin, dapsone, and minocycline. These agents reduce the concentration of C. acnes, have anti-inflammatory properties, and can be combined with topical retinoids for increased efficacy. BP releases free radicals, which break down keratin and cause peroxidation of C. acnes without leading to antimicrobial resistance unlike monotherapy with other antibiotics. Common first-line combination therapies include BP with clindamycin or erythromycin. Clindamycin is preferred because of resistance rates of C. acnes to erythromycin. Topical dapsone is a newer second-line agent which can also be used as initial therapy in skin of color, women with inflammatory acne, and/or those with sensitive skin, allergies, or other contraindications. Another newer agent, topical minocycline, has been shown to have excellent efficacy in treating inflammatory acne. Lastly, sodium sulfacetamide, sulfur, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid are other topical agents with antimicrobial properties which may be useful in treating acne. Salicylic acid and azelaic acid have the added benefit of improving PIH. Adverse effects associated with topical antibiotics include localized irritation.

Oral antibiotics are another cornerstone of acne treatment; tetracyclines are the most utilized, consisting of doxycycline, minocycline, and the newer agent sarecycline. They inhibit the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and have potent anti-inflammatory properties, as evidenced by the sustained efficacy of submicrobial dosing in treating acne. Penicillins, sulfonamides, and macrolides are used less commonly. Adverse effects of oral antibiotics include gastrointestinal upset and, particularly with tetracyclines, photosensitivity and teratogenicity.

### Oral antibacterial therapy for acne vulgaris: an evidence-based review [^115Vfmg9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To some degree, acne vulgaris affects nearly every individual worldwide. Oral antibiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne; however, long-term use of oral antibiotics for acne may have unintended consequences.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the efficacy and appropriate use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Overall, 41 articles that examined oral antibiotics compared with placebo, another oral therapy, topical therapy, alternate dose, or duration were included in this study.

Results

Tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Superior efficacy of one type or class of antibiotic could not be determined, therefore the choice of antibiotic is generally based on the side-effect profile. Although different dosing regimens have been studied, there is a lack of standardized comparator trials to determine optimal dosing and duration of each oral antibiotic used in acne. The combination of oral antibiotics with a topical therapy is superior to oral antibiotics alone.

Conclusion

This article provides a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence of the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Due to heterogeneity in the design of the trials, there is insufficient evidence to support one type, dose, or duration of oral antibiotic over another in terms of efficacy; however, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, dermatologists should heed consensus guidelines for their appropriate use.

### Oral antibiotics for acne [^116b7tvs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral antibiotics are integral for treating inflammatory acne based on what is understood about the pathogenesis as well as the role of Cutibacterium acnes. However, rising concerns of antibiotic resistance and the perception of "antibiotic phobia" create potential limitations on their integration in an acne treatment regimen. When prescribing oral antibiotics, dermatologists need to consider dosage, duration, and frequency, and to avoid their use as monotherapy. These considerations are important, along with the use of newer strategies and compounds, to reduce adverse-event profiles, antibiotic resistance, and to optimize outcomes. Aside from concomitant medications, allergies, and disease severity, costs and patient demographics can influence variability in prescribing plans. There are multiple published guidelines and consensus statements for the USA and Europe to promote safe antibiotic use by dermatologists. However, there is a lack of head-to-head studies and evidence for comparative superiority of any individual antibiotic, as well as any evidence to support the use of agents other than tetracyclines. Although oral antibiotics are one of the main options for moderate to severe acne, non-antibiotic therapy such as isotretinoin and hormonal therapies should be considered. As newer therapies and more outcomes data emerge, so will improved management of antibiotic therapy to foster patient safety.

### Use of dapsone 5% gel as maintenance treatment of acne vulgaris following completion of oral doxycycline and dapsone 5% gel combination treatment [^111yeQyq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common, chronic skin disease that requires long-term therapy. Oral antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment, but extended use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance. Topical therapies are often combined with oral antibiotics to achieve an initial improvement, after which the oral agents may be discontinued and the topical therapy used as maintenance.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with dapsone 5% gel with oral doxycycline hyclate 100mg, followed by monotherapy with dapsone 5% gel in improving and maintaining response in patients with moderate to severe acne.

Methods

In this open-label study, all patients applied dapsone 5% gel twice daily along with doxycycline hyclate 100mg once daily for 12 weeks. Subjects who achieved a qualifying improvement at week 12 continued to the second phase of the study in which they applied only dapsone 5% gel twice daily for maintenance therapy of 12 more weeks. Subjects were evaluated for safety and efficacy at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.

Results

All subjects (n = 30) in the initial phase qualified to enter the maintenance phase. 82% of participants maintained their treatment response (Investigator's Global Assessment score) at week 24. The regimen was safe and well tolerated.

Conclusions

The combination oral doxycycline hyclate 100 mg with topical dapsone 5% gel twice daily is an effective and well-tolerated regimen to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris. After discontinuation of doxycycline, topical dapsone 5% gel is effective at maintaining a therapeutic response. These data suggest that topical dapsone 5% gel can be used effectively for long-term acne maintenance treatment without the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.

### Rethinking treatment of acne in the severe patient [^111GU91s]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Managing acne continues to be a challenge. The data presented here provide a rationale for rethinking our approach to the use of oral antibiotics in moderate-to-severe acne and suggest strategies that favor combination regimens that limit the use of oral antibiotics.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^115r57uW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

As for systemic treatments of papules/pustules, there is low‐certainty evidence that tetracycline is effective and moderate‐certainty evidence for doxycycline (40 mg MR). There is low‐certainty evidence that 40 mg MR doxycycline is at least as effective as 100 mg, with fewer adverse events with 40 mg MR. The evidence for the efficacy and safety of low‐dose minocycline 45 mg is of low certainty and of very low certainty for azithromycin. There is probably little‐to‐no difference between minocycline 100 mg and doxycycline 40 mg MR (moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious adverse events have been reported in rare cases with minocycline, such as autoimmune hepatitis, lupus erythematosus and hyperpigmentation of the skin and tissues. 4 Low‐dose isotretinoin 0.25 mg kg −1 results in far more participants with a minimum 90% lesion count reduction when compared with placebo (high‐certainty evidence). Isotretinoin is known to be teratogenic and should therefore not be prescribed to pregnant women or women who are trying to become pregnant. 4 Compared with doxycycline (100 mg tapered to 50 mg after 2 weeks), low‐dose isotretinoin 0.3 mg kg −1 probably results in a small effect, but that difference in reducing lesion counts may not be important. Both oral isotretinoin and oral doxycycline showed important reductions in lesion counts (moderate‐certainty evidence).

For most treatments, or combinations thereof, there is no clear evidence favouring any with regard to higher remission rates or fewer adverse events. However, more participants experienced an adverse event with topical azelaic acid, topical minocycline and oral isotretinoin, when compared with vehicle or placebo.

No studies could be included that addressed treatment of phymatous rosacea.

For ocular rosacea, ciclosporin 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion was shown to be more beneficial than artificial tears (low‐certainty evidence). Ciclosporin 0.05% was also more effective than doxycycline 200 mg for the first month and 100 mg for the following 2 months for all the addressed outcomes (low‐certainty evidence). Omega‐3 fatty acids improved symptoms of dry eyes and improved tear gland function (moderate‐certainty evidence).

### Sarecycline treatment for acne vulgaris: rationale for weight-based dosing and limited impact of food intake on clinical efficacy [^112LnSCo]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The results of the current PK studies demonstrate that sarecycline can be administered using a weight‐based dosing regimen and can be taken with or without food without a clinical relevant impact on efficacy. As described above, data with older first‐ and second‐generation tetracycline‐class antibiotics report diet‐related effects, which may potentially have impact on efficacy in some patients. Co‐administration of a delayed‐release doxycycline formulation with a high‐fat meal reduced the overall bioavailability (AUC) by 15%–18% compared to a fasted state, with published reports stating reduction in doxycycline bioavailability by 26% and tetracycline bioavailability by 46%. Given that patients who take doxycycline are commonly instructed to ingest the drug with food (including dairy products) to prevent GI tract‐associated AEs, it is difficult to assess the true clinical impact of this decrease in bioavailability, especially when lower doses are prescribed. Similarly, coadministration of minocycline with iron or food decreases its bioavailability by 77% and 13%–14%, respectively.

### Doxycycline plus levamisole: combination treatment for severe nodulocystic acne [^112z1SKR]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Levamisole is an agent without much potential use alone, but through immunomodulation, may synergistically improve the efficacy of other drugs like doxycycline in the treatment of acne vulgaris.

Objective

The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of levamisole in addition to doxycycline in the treatment of patients suffering from severe nodulocystic acne.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the dermatology clinic of Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in Tehran, Iran in 2006. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups. The case group was administered oral levamisole 2.5 mg/kg/wk (up to 150 mg/wk) plus doxycycline 100 mg daily and the control group was given 100 mg of oral doxycycline daily and a placebo. Patients were evaluated at baseline, and at 2-month, 4-month, and 6-month checkpoints.

Results

The responses to treatment were significantly higher in the case group according to the reduction in total lesions count, acne severity index; and papule/pustule and nodule/cyst count at the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th visits.

Conclusion

Results indicated that adding oral levamisole to doxycycline is an effective treatment for severe nonresponsiveness to conventional treatments of acne vulgaris. In the patient group, levamisole was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. At the time of publication, this study is the first clinical trial that suggests levamisole as an effective new treatment for severe acne vulgaris.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^1137Fu5Q]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral tetracyclines

Two short studies (4 and 6 weeks' duration, respectively), at unclear risk of bias, including a total of 151 participants compared oral tetracycline 250 mg twice daily with placebo. 106, 121 The certainty of evidence was low for all outcomes. Tetracycline may result in a large reduction in lesion count, which is supported by physician‐assessed improvement in rosacea severity. However, patients considered there was no difference in effectiveness between tetracycline and placebo. 106

Two studies at low risk of bias and two studies at unclear risk of bias assessed doxycycline 40 mg modified release (MR) vs. placebo. 19, 34, 93 None assessed participant‐assessed rosacea severity. There was high‐certainty evidence that more participants with doxycycline 40 mg MR achieved 'clear' or 'almost clear' (n = 91/353) on the IGA than with placebo (n = 53/354) [RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26–2.28 (P < 0.001; I² = 0%); NNTB 9, 95% CI 6–20]. 19, 93 One study was excluded from pooling (I 2 = 70%) owing to lower number of lesions at baseline. 19 The MD of pooled data was −5.51 lesions [95% CI −7.81 to −3.21 (P < 0.001); I² = 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence]. 93 Doxycycline 40 mg MR probably reduced erythema slightly based on three studies and was assessed with the Clinician's Erythema Assessment [MD −0.48, 95% CI −0.97 to 0.00 (P = 0.05; I² = 28%); moderate‐certainty evidence]. 19, 93 Slightly more adverse events occurred with doxycycline 40 mg MR (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.49; moderate‐certainty evidence), but the majority was considered mild or moderate in both groups. 19, 34, 93

### DOMINO, doxycycline 40 mg vs. minocycline 100 mg in the treatment of rosacea: a randomized, single-blinded, noninferiority trial, comparing efficacy and safety [^113rKK3S]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is a lack of evidence for minocycline in the treatment of rosacea.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of doxycycline 40 mg vs. minocycline 100 mg in papulopustular rosacea.

Methods

In this randomized, single-centre, 1: 1 allocation, assessor-blinded, noninferiority trial, patients with mild-to-severe papulopustular rosacea were randomly allocated to either oral doxycycline 40 mg or minocycline 100 mg for a 16-week period with 12 weeks of follow-up. Our primary outcomes were the change in lesion count and change in patient's health-related quality of life (using RosaQoL). Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses were performed.

Results

Of the 80 patients randomized (40 minocycline, 40 doxycycline), 71 were treated for 16 weeks. Sixty-eight patients completed the study. At week 16, the median change in lesion count was comparable in both groups: doxycycline vs. minocycline, respectively 13 vs. 14 fewer lesions. The RosaQoL scores were decreased for both doxycycline and minocycline, respectively by 0.62 and 0.86. Secondary outcomes were comparable except for Investigator's Global Assessment success, which was seen significantly more often in the minocycline group than in the doxycycline group (60% vs. 18%, P < 0.001). At week 28, outcomes were comparable, except for RosaQoL scores and PaGA, which were significantly different in favour of minocycline (P = 0.005 and P = 0.043, respectively), and fewer relapses were recorded in the minocycline group than in the doxycycline group (7% and 48%, respectively; P < 0.001). No serious adverse reactions were reported.

Conclusions

Minocycline 100 mg is noninferior to doxycycline 40 mg in efficacy over a 16- week treatment period. At follow-up, RosaQoL and PaGA were statistically significantly more improved in the minocycline group than in the doxycycline group, and minocycline 100 mg gives longer remission. In this study there was no significant difference in safety between these treatments; however, based on previous literature minocycline has a lower risk-to-benefit ratio than doxycycline. Minocycline 100 mg may be a good alternative treatment for those patients who, for any reason, are unable or unwilling to take doxycycline 40 mg.

### Is there a place for biologics in acne? [^111EQc2T]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Reports with Biologicals in Acne: Rethinking the Diagnosis

Despite the absence of clear evidence from systematic clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of biologicals in treating acne, a number of publications are known in the scientific literature offering contradictory findings. Case reports highlight the successful use of TNFα inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) and an IL-17 inhibitor (secukinumab) in severe, treatment-resistant cases of acne.

One case report described a 22-year-old man who presented with painful, inflamed nodular lesions, sinus tracts, pustules, and comedones on the face, neck, and trunk. The patient had failed conservative acne treatments, including topical agents, systemic antibiotics, and isotretinoin. Therefore, etanercept was initiated at a dosage of 25 mg twice weekly, leading to a complete regression of lesions within 24 weeks.

Another case report detailed a 22-year-old man with a 6-year history of severe nodular inflammatory acne involving the neck, chest, and posterior shoulders, notably without facial involvement, pustules, or comedones. The patient also had a history of ulcerative colitis. Previous treatments, including oral antibiotics (doxycycline), potent topical corticosteroids (clobetasol propionate 0.05%), intralesional corticosteroids, and isotretinoin (up to 80 mg daily), were ineffective. Infliximab was initiated at a dosage of 5 mg/kg administered intravenously every 8 weeks. Substantial improvement was observed after the first infusion, with no new lesions or reactivation of old lesions after three doses.

Shirakawa et al. reported a 64-year-old man with a three-month history of large, painful draining cysts. On examination, the patient also suffered from fluctuant nodules, pustules, and fibrotic scars on the anterior and posterior trunk, buttocks, and proximal areas of the arms and thighs. After 14 weeks of isotretinoin treatment (40 mg twice daily), the patient developed three draining lesions on the buttocks and trunk. Infliximab (3 mg/kg or 300 mg) dramatically reduced the size and number of cystic lesions, along with significant pain relief.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^116Z9EP4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment options and guidelines

International guidelines recommend either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) as first line treatments, but with differences regarding prescribing products individually or as combination products. The NICE guideline on acne, based on systematic review and network meta-analysis comparisons of acne treatments, acknowledged uncertainty in the evidence base and recommended the options in table 2 as first-line treatments.

Topical treatments

First-line treatments for mild or moderate acne are fixed combination topical preparations containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, as outlined in table 2. It is important that patients understand that these have a delayed onset of action (6–8 weeks) and are aware of how to avoid skin irritation when starting treatment (table 1).

Oral antibiotic treatments

The NICE guideline recommends limiting oral antibiotics to 3–6 months, while other guidelines suggest a maximum duration 3 months in order to avoid emergence of antibiotic resistance. First-line oral antibiotic recommendations are lymecycline or doxycycline. If these are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the NICE guideline recommends that trimethoprim or an oral macrolide may be considered. However, clinicians report barriers to discontinuing oral antibiotics once they have been started including patients' understandable concerns about acne relapse. Monotherapy with an oral or topical antibiotic should not be used, because there is good evidence that antimicrobial resistance is significantly reduced by coprescribing benzoyl peroxide. Consensus from clinical guidelines is that continuing topical treatments as maintenance therapy after discontinuing oral antibiotics is important in reducing the risk of relapse.

Hormonal treatments

Hormonal treatments are an alternative for women with acne. Except for co-cyprindiol, hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or spironolactone) have an advantage over oral antibiotics and isotretinoin in that they can be continued for longer courses.

Combined oral contraceptives

COCs remain an option for women ('off-label' use in acne). Although inferior to oral antibiotics at 3 months, COCs are equivalent to antibiotics at reducing acne at 6 months. There is no firm evidence to support the use of any one COC over another in terms of acne.

Co-cyprindiol

Co-cyprindiol 2000/35 (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 µg) is licensed as a second-line treatment for women with severe acne, but is not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns about rare, but cumulative dose-dependent, increased risk of meningioma.

### Adapalene 0.1% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a review of its use in the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients aged ≥ 12 years [^113YVfmc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel (Epiduo™, Tactuo™) is the only fixed-dose combination product available that combines a topical retinoid with benzoyl peroxide; it targets three of the four main pathophysiologic factors in acne. This article reviews the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of topical adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel in the treatment of patients aged ≥ 12 years with acne vulgaris, as well as summarizing its pharmacologic properties. In three 12-week trials in patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate acne, success rates were significantly higher with adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel than with adapalene 0.1% gel or benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel alone, and combination therapy had an earlier onset of action. In addition, significantly greater reductions in total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesion counts were seen in patients receiving adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel than in those receiving adapalene 0.1% gel or benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel alone. Adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel did not significantly differ from clindamycin 1%/benzoyl peroxide 5% gel in terms of the reduction in the inflammatory, noninflammatory, or total lesion counts in patients with mild to moderate acne, according to the results of a 12-week trial. Twelve-week studies showed that topical adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel in combination with oral lymecycline was more effective than oral lymecycline alone in patients with moderate to severe acne, and topical adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel in combination with oral doxycycline hyclate was more effective than oral doxycycline hyclate alone in patients with severe acne. In patients with severe acne who responded to 12 weeks' therapy with topical adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel plus oral doxycycline hyclate or oral doxycycline hyclate alone, an additional 6 months' therapy with adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel was more effective than vehicle gel at maintaining response, with further improvement seen in adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel recipients. A noncomparative study also demonstrated the efficacy of 12 months' therapy with adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel in patients with acne vulgaris. Topical adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel was generally well tolerated in patients with acne. In 12-week trials, the most commonly occurring treatment-related adverse events included erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning; these dermatologic treatment-related adverse events were usually of mild to moderate severity, occurred early in the course of treatment, and resolved without residual effects. Topical adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel was generally well tolerated in the longer term, with dry skin being the most commonly occurring treatment-related adverse event over 12 months of treatment. In conclusion, adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel is a valuable agent for the first-line treatment of acne vulgaris.

### Reply to Martinez-Garciaand to Wang [^116PooMz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We thank Martinez-Garcia and colleagues and Wang and colleagues for their thoughtful comments.

By design, we enriched our study sample for those with histories of exacerbations, and infection is recognized as a major cause of such exacerbations. Therefore, the bacteriostatic action of doxycycline is a probable mechanism of action, as we discuss. Delineating the mechanism responsible is important. Microbial analyses of sputum collected during this clinical trial were not a prespecified trial outcome, so they were not reported as such. Sputum samples were not available from all study participants, but the available samples are the subject of our ongoing research.

As with all chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapies, clinicians must consider the potential risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis when developing personalized chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management plans. The development of antimicrobial resistance is a legitimate concern, and we have shown that this is a frequent occurrence with both doxycycline and azithromycin. Although prior clinical trials focused predominantly on macrolides, when such therapy is not an option, some clinicians prescribe prophylactic doxycycline therapy instead. This may reflect the substantial impact of exacerbations on their patients and some clinicians' being familiar with using long-term doxycycline therapy to treat nonrespiratory conditions, such as acne. We hope our study provides useful insights and will drive further work to better understand if doxycycline benefits some of these individuals.

### Long-term inflammatory rosacea management with subantibiotic dose oral doxycycline 40 mg modified-release capsules once daily [^114dK82h]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The current study demonstrated that, among subjects given successful combination therapy to treat a flare of inflammatory lesions of rosacea, long‐term treatment with SDD 40 used as monotherapy extended the duration of remission, providing continued relief from rosacea signs and symptoms.

Due to the chronic nature of rosacea, effective treatment is important to avoid the long‐term consequences of flares and the potential of worsening rosacea severity. Rosacea may be incurable, but it is possible to consistently improve the physical appearance and quality of life of many affected individuals, and to forestall potential progression of fixed manifestations of rosacea by prolonging the time to relapse. Rosacea therapy may be optimized by using combination regimens that incorporate different and complementary modes of action that target multiple pathophysiologic pathways of rosacea. Because rosacea is characterized by episodic and unpredictable flares, an effective and safe therapy that extends the duration of remission is highly valuable.

SDD 40 is the only FDA‐approved oral therapy for the treatment of the inflammatory lesions of rosacea, with an extensive body of data supporting its safety and efficacy; a comprehensive Cochrane review of rosacea treatments rated the published evidence supporting the use of SDD 40 for the inflammatory lesions of rosacea as "high". It is thought that the primary mode of action of doxycycline in rosacea is via the inhibition of multiple inflammatory processes, however, use of both short‐term and/or long‐term administration of antibiotic dose doxycycline or other antibiotics increases the risk of antibiotic resistance.SDD 40 has demonstrated anti‐inflammatory activity in rosacea, and avoids antibiotic selection pressure and bacterial resistance. In the current two‐part study, SDD 40 was safe and tolerable, and after prior control of a rosacea flare with initial combination therapy, this treatment as monotherapy reduced the rate of relapse and papulopustular lesion counts when compared with placebo after 40 weeks of treatment.

### A randomized, phase 2, dose-ranging study in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory facial acne vulgaris with doxycycline calcium [^115Nacz6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Doxycycline calcium (WC2055) is a drug substance with a possible role in the treatment of acne. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses of doxycycline calcium tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory facial acne vulgaris.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 dose-ranging study in subjects with moderate to severe inflammatory acne aged 12 years to 45 years. Subjects were randomized to receive doxycycline calcium tablets 0.6, 1.2, or 2.4 mg/kg/day or placebo, and instructed to take their tablets once daily for 12 weeks, in the evening at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after mealtime. The primary efficacy variables were the dichotomized Investigator's Global Assessment score (success or failure) at week 12 (success defined as ≥ 2 score decrease from baseline) and the absolute change from baseline to week 12 in inflammatory lesion count.

Results

A dose-response effect was seen with doxycycline calcium formulation in subjects with moderate to severe inflammatory acne. The highest dose-group (corresponding to approximately 2.4 mg/kg/day) showed a statistically significant difference from placebo. The dose-response effect was confirmed by logistic regression analysis for both treatment success and incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. A limitation of this study is that safety and efficacy were only studied on moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Also, the study was not prospectively powered to show efficacy differences.

Conclusion

Doxycycline calcium shows a dose-response effect in reducing inflammatory lesions in subjects with moderate to severe inflammatory acne.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^1133taGA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety

Adults generally tolerate doxycycline well. Studies demonstrate the most commonly reported side effects are related to gastrointestinal (< 1–55% of patients) and skin (< 1–42% of patients), including photosensitivity (6–42%), toxicity over 7 days to 6 months of use. The most severe gastrointestinal effects are esophageal erosion and ulceration; these are most commonly associated with uncoated doxycycline hyclate. Infrequent, more serious side effects in adults, including allergic reactions, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, anemia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, neutropenia, intracranial hypertension, and tooth staining, are rare. Most serious adverse effects resolve with discontinuation of doxycycline. Despite the known side effects, in clinical trials discontinuation due to side effects has been uncommon.

Clinicians routinely prescribe low doses (40–100 mg daily) of doxycycline for weeks to months for acne and rosacea and months to years for malaria prophylaxis. Multiple studies on side effects among patients using doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis have been contradictory or insufficient to draw clear conclusions. Researchers have studied prolonged doxycycline use (3–18 months) for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm. No serious adverse reactions were seen in those studies and fewer than 10% of patients withdrew because of medication side effects.

Formulation, Tolerability, and Regimen

Doxycycline monohydrate and doxycycline hyclate are the most commonly used formulations of doxycycline. Due to the pH at which they are soluble, esophageal side effects may be less frequent with doxycycline monohydrate or enteric-coated doxycycline hyclate compared with uncoated doxycycline hyclate. Since the formulation of doxycycline used may impact side effects and patient adherence, this should be tracked closely in future RCTs.

Patient preference is another major consideration. A small qualitative study in Australia (N = 13) found that participants have a strong preference for daily dosing. Patients preferences may vary by HIV infection status, use of HIV PrEP, and how individuals use HIV PrEP (eg, daily or intermittently).

### Sarecycline treatment for acne vulgaris: rationale for weight-based dosing and limited impact of food intake on clinical efficacy [^117UwDTR]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Sarecycline is an immediate‐release tetracycline derivative, designed with a stable structural modification at hydrocarbon C7, to produce a narrow spectrum antibiotic profile inclusive of activity against Cutibacterium acnes. The structural modifications incorporated result in direct binding to the bacterial mRNA within the bacterial ribosome 30S subunit and a low propensity to induce antibiotic resistance. The rationale for an immediate‐release formulation of sarecycline is supported by minimal GI‐associated AEs noted in clinical studies. Sarecycline has demonstrated activity against clinically relevant Gram‐positive bacteria, and reduced activity against Gram‐negative bacteria commonly found in the GI tract, with a low rates of AEs reported in pivotal phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials and in an 40‐week safety extension study.

Oral antibiotics may vary in their bioavailability depending on several factors including intra‐individual weight‐to‐dose ratio and potential food‐drug interactions. The existing tetracyclines‐class antibiotics, tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline, are structurally bound by diets and medications that are high in divalent and trivalent metal ions such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and aluminum, which can reduce GI absorption of the antibiotics; iron has been shown to markedly reduce GI absorption of doxycycline and minocycline. In addition, ingestion with a high‐fat meal may reduce doxycycline GI absorption. Following single dose administration of enteric‐coated delayed release 150‐mg doxycycline tablet, the mean maximum plasma concentration (C max) was 19% lower with a high fat meal, including milk, compared to fasted conditions. The effect from food can vary based on the dose (less effect at higher doses). However, the clinical impact has not been studied. Additionally, a decrease in the rate (C max) and extent (area‐under‐the curve [AUC]) of GI absorption of 45% and 22%, respectively, were reported in human subjects given a single oral dose of a brand doxycycline 40 mg modified‐release capsule after ingestion with a 1000 calorie, high fat, high protein meal that included dairy products when compared to fasted conditions. The FDA‐approved prescribing information with this doxycycline modified‐release formulation states that this decrease in systemic exposure may be clinically significant with the recommendation that it be taken at least 1 h prior to or 2 h after meals.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113679yM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotics indications and dosing — Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of acne treatment for years; they are indicated for use in moderate to severe inflammatory acne and should be used in combination with a topical retinoid and BP. Evidence supports the efficacy of tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), trimethoprim, erythromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be considered first-line therapy in moderate to severe acne, except when contraindicated because of other circumstances (ie, pregnancy, < 8 years of age, or allergy). Minocycline in an extended release form appears safest (at 1 mg/kg), but no dose response was found for efficacy; doxycycline appears effective in the 1.7 to 2.4 mg/kg dose range, and subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline (ie, 20 mg twice daily to 40 mg daily) has also shown efficacy in patients with moderate inflammatory acne. Azithromycin has been primarily studied in the treatment of acne in open label studies with different pulse dosing regimens ranging from 3 times a week to 4 days a month, with azithromycin being an effective treatment in the time span evaluated — usually 2 to 3 months. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing 3 days per month of azithromycin to daily doxycycline did show superiority of doxycycline. Outside of case reports, there is 1 small, double-blind study showing that TMP/SMX is as effective as oxytetracycline.

### Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety [^112TormG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is commonly used in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Although it is more convenient for patients to take than first-generation tetracyclines, as it only needs to be taken once or twice a day and can be taken with food, it is more expensive. Concerns have also been expressed over its safety following the deaths of two patients taking the drug. There is a lack of consensus among dermatologists over the relative risks and benefits of minocycline. As most acne prescribing is undertaken by general practitioners, it is important that guidelines issued to them are based on the best available evidence rather than personal judgements.

Objectives

To collate and evaluate the evidence on the clinical efficacy of minocycline in the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris. Specific objectives were to compare the efficacy of minocycline with other drug treatments for acne and to collate information on the incidence of adverse drug reactions.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of minocycline for acne vulgaris were identified by searching the following electronic databases; MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, Biological Abstracts, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Skin Group's Trial Register, Theses Online, BIDS ISI Science Citation Index, National Research Register, Current Controlled Trials and Bids Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Other strategies used were scanning the references of articles retrieved, hand-searching of major dermatology journals and personal communication with trialists and drug companies.

Selection Criteria

To be eligible for the review, studies had to be RCTs comparing the efficacy of minocycline at any dose to active or placebo control, in subjects with inflammatory acne vulgaris. Diagnoses of papulo-pustular, polymorphic and nodular acne were also accepted. Trials were not excluded on the basis of language.

Data Collection and Analysis

27 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The comparators used were placebo (2 studies), oxytetracycline (1), tetracycline (6), doxycycline (7), lymecycline (2), topical clindamycin (3), topical erythromycin/zinc (1), cyproterone acetate/ ethinyloestradiol (1), oral isotretinoin (2), topical fusidic acid (1) and there was one dose response study. Two studies are ongoing and it remains to be clarified whether one further study is a RCT. Major outcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and patients' global assessments, adverse drug reactions and drop out rates. The quality of each study was assessed independently by two assessors and an effect size calculated where possible. An additional three RCTs and three safety studies were identified by searches conducted in November 2002; these will be reviewed for a major update in early 2003 when it is anticipated that the results of the two ongoing studies will be available.

Main Results

The trials were generally small and of poor quality and in many cases the published reports were inadequate for our purpose. Pooling of the studies was not attempted due to the lack of common outcome measures and endpoints and the unavailability of some primary data. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for acne vulgaris, in only two studies was it found to be superior to other tetracyclines. Both of these were conducted under open conditions and had serious methodological problems. A third study showed it to be more effective than 2% fusidic acid, applied topically, against inflammatory lesions in mild to moderate acne. Differences in the way adverse drug reactions were identified could have accounted for the wide variation between studies in numbers of events reported. This meant that no overall evaluation could be made of incidence rates of adverse events associated with minocycline therapy. No RCT evidence was found to support the benefits of minocycline in acne resistant to other therapies and the dose response has only been evaluated up to eight weeks of therapy.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Minocycline is likely to be an effective treatment for moderate acne vulgaris, but this review found no reliable RCT evidence to justify its continued use first-line, especially given the price differential and the concerns that still remain about its safety. Its efficacy relative to other acne therapies could not be reliably determined due to the poor methodological quality of the trials and lack of consistent choice of outcome measures. Similarly the relative risk of adverse drug reactions could not be ascertained reliably and no recommendations can be made concerning the appropriate dose that should be used. It is hoped that this review will highlight the inadequacy of acne trials in general and encourage improvements in methodological quality and standards of reporting.

### Comparison of efficacy of azithromycin vs. doxycycline in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^114uBh3Z]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory disorder of the skin. Oral antibiotics are known to be effective in its treatment. A randomized, investigator-blinded study was performed to compare the efficacy of azithromycin with doxycycline. Fifty-one patients were randomized to receive either azithromycin 500 mg/day on 3 consecutive days per week in the first, on 2 consecutive days per week in the second, and on 1 day per week in the third month. The other group was given doxycycline twice a day for the first month and once a day for the second and third months. Clinical assessment was made at baseline, at the end of first, second, third, and post-treatment first and second months. Side effects were recorded. Statistically significant improvement for the facial lesions were obtained with both drugs. Neither drug was shown to be more effective than the other. The beneficial effect continued until 2 months after treatment. In the azithromycin group three patients had diarrohea, while photosensitivity was seen in two patients using doxycycline. This study indicates that azithromycin is at least as effective as doxycycline in the treatment of acne.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acne [^111YUVYr]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Acne can cause significant embarrassment and anxiety in affected patients. It is important for family physicians to educate patients about available treatment options and their expected outcomes. Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, sulfacetamide, and azelaic acid are effective in patients with mild or moderate comedones. Topical erythromycin or clindamycin can be added in patients with mild to moderate inflammatory acne or mixed acne. A six-month course of oral erythromycin, doxycycline, tetracycline, or minocycline can be used in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne. A low-androgen oral contraceptive pill is effective in women with moderate to severe acne. Isotretinoin is reserved for use in the treatment of the most severe or refractory cases of inflammatory acne. Because of its poor side effect profile and teratogenicity, isotretinoin (Accutane) must by prescribed by a physician who is a registered member of the manufacturer's System to Manage Accutane-Related Teratogenicity program.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113ZdjTj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotic recommendations — Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments. Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other. Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children < 8 years of age), and erythromycin use should be restricted because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance. Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unable to tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients. Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3–4 months to minimize the development of bacterial resistance, and monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended. Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy.

### Doxycycline (Oracea) [^112UfCrV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Doxycycline is a member of the tetracycline-class of drugs. The plasma concentrations of doxycycline achieved with ORACEA during administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.2)] are less than the concentration required to treat bacterial diseases. ORACEA should not be used for treating bacterial infections, providing antibacterial prophylaxis, or reducing the numbers or eliminating microorganisms associated with any bacterial disease [see Indications and Usage (1.2)]. In vivo microbiological studies utilizing a similar drug exposure for up to 18 months demonstrated no detectable long term effects on bacterial flora of the oral cavity, skin, intestinal tract and vagina.

Papulopustular (acneiform) rash — preventive and reactive management: Based on the high frequency of rash and presentation within the first 2–4 weeks of therapy, preventive/prophylactic management is recommended unless there are contraindications based on patient and/or health care provider factors. A recommended prophylactic regimen is hydrocortisone 1% combined with moisturizer, sunscreen, and doxycycline 100 mg bid for the first 6 weeks; another study found prophylactic minocycline 100 mg daily effective in reducing lesions during the first 8 weeks, with doxycycline having a more favorable safety profile and minocycline being less photosensitizing. For reactive care, reactive use of medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids is recommended; vitamin K3 is being investigated while vitamin K1 reports lack control groups; and consistent reports of isotretinoin at doses lower than those used for acne support the recommendation of their use when other measures have failed. The rash peaks in weeks 4–6 after EGFRI initiation and decreases in severity after weeks 6–8, and active management should be considered throughout EGFRI treatment and follow-up to minimize late effects.

### Azithromycin monthly pulse vs daily doxycycline in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^114n2Jv5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease seen primarily in adolescent and young adults. As the treatment involves long term therapy with antibiotics, an agent with a long half life can be very useful in increasing the compliance. To evaluate the role of a monthly dose of azithromycin and compare it with daily doxycycline, we conducted this randomized comparative study. Sixty patients with moderate to severe acne were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, A & B. Patients in group A received 100 mg doxycycline daily in addition to topical 0.05% tretinoin cream, whereas patients in group B were given 500 mg azithromycin once a day for four days per month along with 0.05% topical tretinoin for a total of 12 weeks. Of the 60 patients, 22 in group A and 28 in group B were evaluated. The monthly dose of azithromycin was found to be as effective as daily doxycycline on a pure protocol basis and statistically significantly better than doxycycline by intention to treat analysis.

### Double-blind study of doxycycline in acne vulgaris… [^114EQWr3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of doxycycline in acne vulgaris, 62 patients with predominantly inflammatory acne were treated in a double-blind crossover study. The drug was given orally, 100 mg/day, as a single dose every morning for four weeks. No concomitant internal or external therapy was permitted. Noninflamed open and closed comedones were not affected by active or placebo treatment. A good or excellent response in the reduction of inflammatory lesions was obtained in 21 of the subjects receiving doxycycline, compared to 14 while receiving placebo. Statistically, the improvement produced by doxycycline was significant, while there was no significant improvement from the placebo. Plewig G, Petrozzi JW, Berendes U.

### Anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline plus adapalene 0.3% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel for severe acne [^1144wAv7]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acne is primarily an inflammatory disease. Anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline (40mg: 30mg immediate release and 10mg delayed release beads) is approved for the treatment of rosacea but with demonstrated efficacy for acne. Fixed combination adapalene 0.3% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel is a once-daily formulation approved for the topical management of acne vulgaris. It has both anti-inflammatory and anti-comedogenic properties.
Options for management of severe acne are somewhat limited; many patients are not candidates for or refuse treatment with isotretinoin. Systemic antibiotics may be indicated; acne treatment guidelines emphasize antibiotic stewardship in light of increasing concerns about antibiotic resistance and call for the judicious use of conventional systemic antibiotics.
This single-center, open label pilot study involving 20 subjects with severe acne assessed the effects of combination treatment using anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline plus adapalene 0.3% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel on IGA scores as well as inflammatory lesion, non-inflammatory lesion, and nodule counts.
By week 12, 95% of subjects had at least a 2-grade improvement in IGA scores. Reductions in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts were statistically significant beginning at week 4 and continuing through week 12. By week 4, the percentage of patients with 0 nodules was 70%, compared to baseline of 20%. Further improvements were seen through week 12. Treatment was well-tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events.
Combination treatment with anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline plus combination adapalene 0.3% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel is safe and effective for management of severe acne.

### Doxycycline tablets and advanced acne wash (benzoDox 30 kit) [^112Wju4E]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

Adults: The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

For pediatric patients above eight years of age: The recommended dosage schedule for pediatric patients weighing 100 pounds or less is 2 mg/lb of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by 1 mg/lb of body weight given as a single daily dose or divided into two doses, on subsequent days. For more severe infections up to 2 mg/lb of body weight may be used. For pediatric patients over 100 pounds the usual adult dose should be used.

Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men): 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

### Common and alternate oral antibiotic therapies for acne vulgaris: a review [^114wfhAk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extremely common disorder affecting many adolescents and adults throughout their lifetimes. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial and is thought to involve excess sebum, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial colonization, and inflammation. Many therapeutic options exist for treating acne, including topical benzoyl peroxide, topical and oral antibiotics, topical and oral retinoids, and oral contraceptives. Oral antibiotics have been a mainstay in the treatment of acne for decades and function by exerting an antibacterial effect by reducing the follicular colonization of Propionibacterium acnes. Systemic antibiotics also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This article reviews the English language literature on the efficacy of various systemic antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris, including second-line and less historically used medications. We discuss the tetracyclines, including subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, macrolides (notably azithromycin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as treatment options for acne vulgaris.

### Doxycycline and minocycline for the management of acne: a review of efficacy and safety with emphasis on clinical implications [^111fUpG7]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

A significant number of patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne are candidates for oral antibiotic therapy. Use of tetracycline for acne has yielded to second-generation molecules doxycycline and minocycline, which are associated with numerous benefits over their predecessor, especially less frequent dosing and improved safety. Nonetheless, these agents are associated with certain potential side effects, including gastrointestinal (GI) concerns, staining of developing teeth in children, candidiasis, vestibular concerns and, somewhat more controversially, photosensitivity. Additionally, minocycline may be associated with the development of autoantibodies, including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and anti-phospholipid antibodies with or without associated clinical symptoms. Given their similar efficacy for the management of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, the choice of doxycycline or minocycline may depend on specific clinical considerations, including patient satisfaction with therapy, compliance and convenience. Data and clinical experience suggest that enteric-coated doxycycline, with its low rate of GI symptoms, may represent a more tolerable treatment option for many acne patients and therefore be associated with better likelihood of compliance.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^115JQyyu]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Model input parameters were obtained from sources of varying quality (ranging from RCTs through to large retrospective analyses to expert opinion), depending on data availability. The time horizon of the analysis (1 year) was considered adequate to capture longer‐term outcomes and costs associated with a course of acne treatment, but some long‐term effects, such as potential subsequent scarring and associated management costs were not captured because of insufficient evidence. Costs and utility decrements associated with side effects of treatment were not considered; however, we did incorporate the impact of intolerable side effects on HRQoL and costs. Antimicrobial resistance associated with antibiotic use was not considered. These omissions constitute limitations of our analysis.

We carried out probabilistic analyses to handle uncertainty around model parameters and deterministic sensitivity analyses to address gaps in the evidence. The results were characterized by some uncertainty; however, they were overall robust to scenarios tested through deterministic sensitivity analysis.

Our analysis was conducted from the perspective of the NHS in England. The results may be generalizable to other settings with similar funding and structure of healthcare services and comparable care pathways for people with acne. Conclusions on cost‐effectiveness ultimately rely on the cost‐effectiveness threshold adopted, and this depends on the policymakers' willingness to pay for treatment benefits, which may vary across countries and health systems.

The results of this economic analysis, along with clinical evidence from the NMAand other considerations, informed the NICE national guidance on the management of acne vulgaris. These considerations included concerns about antibiotic resistance, current regulations regarding oral isotretinoin, long‐term harms of chemical peel use outside specialist settings (e.g. risk for significant skin damage from inappropriate strength or type of peel) and limited availability and use of some treatments in NHS routine practice (e.g. chemical peels, photochemical therapies, PDT, topical antifungals). Doxycycline was considered a suitable alternative to lymecycline, as they have similar efficacy, AE profile and acquisition cost.

Potential Harms from Doxycycline

Clinical Adverse Events in Doxy PEP Trials

Three clinical trials of doxy PEP were found that reported on adverse events (13–15). In the IPERGAY study, gastrointestinal side effects were more commonly reported in the PEP group (53% versus 41%; p = 0.05) (13). In the DoxyPEP study, one grade 2 laboratory abnormality and five grade 3 adverse events occurred that were possibly or probably related to doxycycline. No serious adverse events were attributed to doxycycline. The observed difference in mean absolute annualized weight change adjusted for baseline weight was not statistically significant between the two groups. Eighteen participants discontinued the study early; five in the doxy PEP arm discontinued the medication because of intolerance or patient preference and 13 in the standard of care arm, including six who discontinued so that they could take doxy PEP outside of the study (14). In the DOXYVAC study, three persons (0.9%) discontinued doxy PEP because of gastrointestinal adverse events (n = 2) or fear of adverse events (n = 1) (15).

Clinical Adverse Events from Other Uses of Doxycycline

To further examine data on daily longer-term (≥ 8 weeks) doxycycline use, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted (18). A total of 67 articles published during 1987–2022 were included in the review on clinical adverse events; half of the studies included doxycycline use for acne treatment (N = 13), malaria prophylaxis (N = 11), and rosacea treatment (N = 14). A meta-analysis conducted by CDC included 18 studies that enrolled generally healthy persons and that also had a placebo arm to evaluate any adverse events between participants in the doxycycline group versus the no doxycycline (placebo) group. The meta-analysis found an increased risk for persons on daily doxycycline experiencing gastrointestinal or dermatological adverse events compared with placebo. No significant differences were observed for any, severe, or neurologic adverse events. Participants were more likely to be unenrolled from clinical trials because of adverse events in the doxycycline group compared with the placebo group. Serious side effects were rare.

### A multicentre, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, vehicle-controlled phase IIb study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1% and 3% topical minocycline gel in patients with papulopustular rosacea [^1113wckP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results from the current study demonstrate that a topical minocycline gel is generally safe, well tolerated and potentially efficacious in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. Both minocycline 1% and minocycline 3% significantly decreased the number of inflammatory lesions at week 12, compared with vehicle, in a dose‐dependent manner (P = 0.014 and P = 0.007, respectively). Notably, this decrease had an early onset of action and durability of effect after cessation of treatment, with significance noted as early as week 4 and persisting through the treatment period and maintaining significance for 4 weeks following the cessation of treatment in the 3% treatment arm. In addition to achieving the primary efficacy endpoint, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the minocycline 3% arm achieved an assessment of 'clear' or 'almost clear' on the IGA (P = 0.038).

While oral therapy with minocycline is usually well tolerated, there may be systemic side‐effects. 16 While such side‐effects are typically mild and transient, they may sometimes be serious. Gastrointestinal side‐effects are the most common side‐effects seen with oral minocycline, while more serious adverse events such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness, drug‐induced lupus‐like reaction, pigmentary changes, photosensitivity, candidiasis and paediatric tooth discoloration are all reported for oral minocycline. In addition, minocycline is associated with a higher frequency of several severe reactions than doxycycline. 17

One proposed advantage of topical minocycline gel over the oral delivery of the medication is the limited systemic absorption associated with topical application. The current study showed that levels of systemic minocycline were very low following the final administration at week 12 in most patients in both treatment arms. Solodyn ©, an extended‐release minocycline used for acne rosacea, has a Cmax of 2.63 μg mL −1 and a mean AUC of 33.32 h ∙ μg mL −1. 15 In comparison, serum exposure to minocycline in this study was much lower in both treatment arms, with the higher dose arm (minocycline 3%) presenting a Cmax of 0.001 μg mL −1 and an AUC of 0.021 h ∙ μg mL −1.

### Subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline in the treatment of moderate facial acne [^111MMm9k]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Acne is a common inflammatory skin disorder. Oral antibiotics play a significant clinical role in treating acne.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of doxycycline at antimicrobial and subantimicrobial doses for the treatment of acne.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was performed. One hundred patients with moderate facial acne were randomized into 2 treatment groups, one receiving a tablet containing 20 mg of doxycycline to be taken twice daily and the other receiving a tablet containing 100 mg of doxycycline and a matching placebo tablet to be taken twice daily.

Results

Subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline administered twice daily for 3 months in patients with moderate inflammatory acne results in significant reduction in the number of total inflammatory lesions. There was an 84% reduction in number of papules and a 90% reduction in number of pustules with treatment.

Conclusion

Subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline is an effective treatment for patients with moderate acne vulgaris.

### Abstract… [^115Aj4Dm]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Acne is a disease of pilosebaceous units in the skin. It is thought to be caused by the interplay of four factors. Excessive sebum production secondary to sebaceous gland hyperplasia is the first abnormality to occur. 1 Subsequent hyperkeratinization of the hair follicle prevents normal shedding of the follicular keratinocytes, which then obstruct the follicle and form an inapparent microcomedo. 2 Lipids and cellular debris soon accumulate within the blocked follicle. This microenvironment encourages colonization of Propionibacterium acnes, which provokes an immune response through the production of numerous inflammatory mediators. Inflammation is further enhanced by follicular rupture and subsequent leakage of lipids, bacteria, and fatty acids into the dermis. Acne may be triggered or worsened by external factors such as mechanical obstruction, occupational exposures, or medications.

Common medications that may cause or affect acne are listed in Table 1. 4 Cosmetics and emollients may occlude follicles and cause an acneiform eruption. Topical corticosteroids may produce perioral dermatitis, a localized erythematous papular or pustular eruption.
5. Classification In 1990, the American Academy of Dermatology developed a classification scheme for primary acne vulgaris. 7 This grading scale delineates three levels of acne: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild acne is characterized by the presence of few to several papules and pustules, but no nodules. Patients with moderate acne have several to many papules and pustules, along with a few to several nodules. With severe acne, patients have numerous or extensive papules and pustules, as well as many nodules. Referral The patient who has not responded to treatment as expected may need to be referred to a dermatologist.

Gram-negative folliculitis should be suspected if inflammatory acne worsens after several months of oral antibiotic therapy. Acne fulminans is the rapid onset of severe, inflammatory acne, often accompanied by fever, arthralgia, and bone diathesis. The triad of severe acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and dissecting cellulitis of the scalp may require aggressive treatment. Intralesional corticosteroid injections may benefit nodulocystic disease. If treatment with isotretinoin is indicated, the prescribing physician must be enrolled in the manufacturer's SMART program.

### Treatment of acne in children [^115mGhs4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne is a common skin condition in adolescents. It is not uncommon in childhood and it persists into adulthood. A broad range of acne treatments are available and have been shown to be safe and effective in adolescents and adults. However, there is limited literature regarding acne treatment in childhood and its available therapeutic options. It seems reasonable to extrapolate findings of the various studies reported on treatment of acne in the adolescent and adult age group, with the exclusion of the use of tetracycline derivatives. As clinicians, we must be more familiar with the clinical presentation of acne and available treatment options in our younger patients. Early recognition of acne with prompt and appropriate initiation of therapy in childhood will help prevent severe scarring in children.

Cycline antibiotics (CAs) are commonly used to treat acne, blepharitis, and dry eye syndrome. Prescribers or patients may hesitate to use Cas because they may increase the risk of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS).

Objective

We sought to assess whether CA use is associated with an increased risk of PTCS or papilledema and whether the risk depends upon dosage or duration of CA intake.

Methods

We studied patients 12 to 65 years of age who were diagnosed with acne, blepharitis, or dry eye syndrome, who were enrolled in a nationwide managed care network between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2015, and who had no preexisting diagnosis of papilledema or PTCS. Multivariable Cox regression modeling was used to assess the risk of developing papilledema or PTCS from exposure to CAs.

Results

Among the 728,811 eligible enrollees (mean age, 34.7 years; 72% female), 42.0% filled ≥ 1 CA prescription. Of the 305,823 CA users, 170 (0.06%) were diagnosed with papilledema or PTCS. By comparison, of the 57.0% with no record of CA use, 121 (0.03%) were diagnosed with papilledema or PTCS (P < .0001). In the unadjusted model, every additional year of CA use was associated with a 70% (doxycycline: hazard ratio, 1.70 [95% confidence interval 0.98–2.97]; p = 0.06) or 91% (minocycline: hazard ratio, 1.91 [95% confidence interval 1.11–3.29]; p = 0.02) increased hazard of papilledema/PTCS relative to nonusers of CAs. After adjustment for confounders, the increased hazard of PTCS/papilledema with CA use was no longer statistically significant (P = 0.06, doxycycline; p = 0.08, minocycline).

Limitations

This study relies on claims data, which lack clinical data.

Conclusion

This study offers some evidence that CAs may increase the risk of PTCS/papilledema. However, after accounting for confounding factors in our multivariable models, we found no statistically significant association between CA use and the development of PTCS. Moreover, there was no dose-response effect whereby greater CA use was associated with a higher PTCS risk.

### New antibiotic therapies for acne and rosacea [^1166DiZ7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Acne and rosacea compromise a substantial portion of the dermatology clinical practice. Over the past century, many treatment modalities have been introduced with antibiotics playing a major role. Today, both oral and topical antibiotics are used in the management of acne and rosacea, with several novel formulations and/or combination regimens recently introduced. The latest studies suggest anti-inflammatory actions to be the most likely mechanism of antibiotics in acne and rosacea, shifting the focus to subantimicrobial-dose oral antibiotics and/or topical antibiotic regimens as the preferred first-line agents. Here we will discuss the most recent oral and topical antibiotic therapies available for treatment of acne and rosacea, with special focus on efficacy data, indication, dosing, and mechanism of action.

### Efficacy of tetracyclines in the treatment of acne vulgaris: a review [^112MYmha]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Oral tetracyclines are routinely used for the management of inflammatory acne. However, there is a lack of evidence-based data on their relative effectiveness and appropriate dosages.

Objectives

To assess the relative effectiveness and the optimal dosage of tetracyclines for the treatment of inflammatory acne.

Methods

We designed a systematic review of the clinical trials (1962–2006) investigating oral tetracyclines for the treatment of inflammatory acne. We obtained data from MEDLINE, PubMed, Current Contents, reference lists and specialist textbooks.

Results

There was substantial heterogeneity in the design of the trials. We identified only seven randomized trials which were set up to compare the efficacy of tetracyclines in reducing acne lesion counts. These showed no evidence of superiority of one tetracycline over another. Overall, there was also no significant difference between the available tetracyclines in terms of improvement in inflammatory (32 trials, P = 0.898) and noninflammatory (23 trials, P = 0.429) lesions. In the range of investigated dosages, the antibiotic dosage had no impact on efficacy in inflammatory (P = 0.609) and noninflammatory (P = 0.654) lesions. There was no decrease in efficacy during the study period.

Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support one tetracycline rather than another in terms of efficacy. In the range of investigated dosages, the antibiotic dosage seems to have no impact on efficacy. Despite increased resistance to antibiotics, oral tetracycline formulations displayed no change in efficacy during the study period. Further studies are, however, required to determine if the anti-inflammatory properties of tetracyclines are sufficient in managing acne.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111KqDNs]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Doxycycline prescribing information — adjunctive treatment in severe acne is indicated. Children > 8 years of age and < 100 pounds: 2 mg/lb of body weight divided into 2 doses on the first day of treatment, followed by 1 mg/lb of body weight given as a single daily dose or divided into 2 doses, on subsequent days; adults and children > 100 pounds: 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. Contraindication is hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal events (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, hepatotoxicity, esophagitis, or esophageal ulcerations), skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens — Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, maculopapular and erythematous rashes, exfoliative dermatitis, or photosensitivity), renal effects (rise in blood urea nitrogen (dose-related)), hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, or exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus), blood disorders (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or eosinophilia), and other effects (bulging fontanels, intracranial pressure). Interactions include antacids (eg, aluminum, calcium, magnesium containing), oral anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, bismuth subsalicylate, hormonal contraceptives, iron-containing preparations, methoxyflurane, penicillins, proton-pump inhibitors, oral retinoids, and urinary catecholamine assay. Use as monotherapy should be avoided. Pregnancy category is D; nursing considerations note it is distributed into milk and to discontinue nursing or the drug. Pediatric safety and efficacy are not established.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113Dgat7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on the NMA findings, the above considerations and cost‐effectiveness findings 36 the NICE guideline on acne vulgaris management recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations (adapalene with BPO, clindamycin with BPO, or tretinoin with clindamycin) for mild‐to‐moderate acne, and fixed topical treatment combinations (adapalene with BPO, tretinoin with clindamycin) or oral tetracyclines (doxycycline or lymecycline) combined with topical treatments (fixed combination of adapalene with BPO; or azelaic acid) for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Where oral lymecycline or doxycycline are not tolerated or are contraindicated, alternative oral antibiotics such as trimethoprim or an oral macrolide (e.g. erythromycin) might be considered. Choice should be determined following shared decision making with the person with acne, taking into account their values and preferences on the benefits, risks and other characteristics of each treatment, their history of previous therapy and scarring, their risk of future scarring and the psychosocial burden imposed by acne. BPO alone may be considered as an option across all acne severity levels if other recommended first‐line treatments are contraindicated (e.g. during pregnancy) or there is a patient preference against their use. Topical retinoids and BPO should be initiated with alternate‐day or short‐contact application because of their increased risk of discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Photodynamic therapy may be considered as an option for adults with moderate‐to‐severe acne if other treatments are ineffective, not tolerated or contraindicated.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^1162UVfh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris commonly affects adults, adolescents, and preadolescents aged 9 years or older.

Objective

The objective of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne.

Methods

A work group conducted a systematic review and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

This guideline presents 18 evidence-based recommendations and 5 good practice statements. Strong recommendations are made for benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, and oral doxycycline. Oral isotretinoin is strongly recommended for acne that is severe, causing psychosocial burden or scarring, or failing standard oral or topical therapy. Conditional recommendations are made for topical clascoterone, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid, as well as for oral minocycline, sarecycline, combined oral contraceptive pills, and spironolactone. Combining topical therapies with multiple mechanisms of action, limiting systemic antibiotic use, combining systemic antibiotics with topical therapies, and adding intralesional corticosteroid injections for larger acne lesions are recommended as good practice statements.

Limitations

Analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time of the systematic review.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne vulgaris.

### Minocycline for acne-an update [^111Px2Bw]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Minocycline is an oral tetracycline that, unlike some other drugs in its class, is a once-daily treatment and need not be taken on an empty stomach.1 Such potential advantages together with preferential use in secondary care helped to establish minocycline as the oral tetracycline of choice for acne.2,3 However, concerns over the safety of minocycline and the lack of therapeutic advantage over other tetracyclines have challenged this view.1,4,5 Here we consider how trends in prescribing of minocycline have changed in the UK in recent years.

### Antibacterial therapy for acne: a guide to selection and use of systemic agents [^112bnUkK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a very common disorder, affecting virtually every adolescent at some point in time. Systemic antibacterials have been used in the treatment of acne for many years, and there are several commonly used antibacterials which have established efficacy and safety records. In recent years, the issue of antibacterials resistance has become more prominent, especially with concerns that Propionibacterium acnes can transfer antibacterials resistance to other bacteria within the resident skin flora. Commonly used antibacterials include tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin (and other macrolides) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole). The choice of antibacterial should take into account efficacy, cost-effectiveness, benefit-risk ratios, patient acceptability and the potential for the development of resistance. Poor clinical response can be the result of poor compliance, inadequate duration of therapy, development of gram-negative folliculitis, resistance of P. acnes to the antibacterial(s) administered, or a high sebum excretion rate. In order to help prevent the development of resistance a number of measures should be undertaken: antibacterials are prescribed for an average of 6 months; if retreatment is required, utilize the same antibacterial; generally, antibacterials should be given for at least 2 months before considering switching due to poor therapeutic response; concomitant use of oral and topical chemically-dissimilar antibacterials should be avoided (try benzoyl peroxide and/or retinoids instead) and systemic isotretinoin should be considered if several antibacterials have been tried without success.

### Doxycycline exposure during adolescence and future risk of non-affective psychosis and bipolar disorder: a total population cohort study [^112aEbgt]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe mental illness (SMI) often results in lifelong and extensive consequences for individuals and society, whereof most evident is a reduced life expectancy in the magnitude of decades. Recent studies suggest that individuals with SMI have not benefited from the same increase in life expectancy as the general population. Thus, the substantial gap in mortality, a major indicator of a disadvantaged life, is not closing but rather widening. There are no current interventions that prevent or delay SMI onset.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two SMIs that exhibit substantial overlap in terms of polygenetic risk and brain structural abnormalities. Both illnesses are associated with reductions in cortical thickness and subcortical volumes. Recent studies indicate that microglia may play important roles in the pathogenesis of SMI. Results from several lines of research support the hypothesis that excessive activity in the removal (pruning) of synapses by microglia that normally occurs during adolescence contributes to the onset of schizophrenia in early adulthood. Two substances known to suppress microglia activation, in both experimental in vivo settings and in vitro, are the chemically closely related tetracycline antibiotics minocycline and doxycycline with comparable abilities to cross the blood–brain barrier. Recently, Sellgren et al. reported that minocycline indeed reduced microglia-mediated synapse uptake in vitro. Moreover, Sellgren et al. added analyses of 22,027 electronic health records from two large US medical centers and found an inverse association (HR 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39–0.88) between minocycline and/or doxycycline exposure during adolescence for a minimum of 90 days (3811 individuals) and risk of later diagnosis of non-affective psychosis, including schizophrenia (F20–F29). This contrasts an earlier electronic healthcare register study from UK by Herrero-Zazo et al. who compared 13,248 minocycline exposed for a minimum of 42 days with 14,393 matched controls and found no preventive effect on SMI from early minocycline prescription. Comparing exposure between these two studies is not entirely trivial. Minocycline and doxycycline are slightly different substances. In addition, days of exposure cannot be directly translated to exposure in mg as daily dosage for long-term treatment of acne varies. However, 50–100 mg/day is a common acne dosage for both minocycline and doxycycline. If a typical dosage of 100 mg/day is used for conversion, then the Sellgren et al. threshold would roughly translate to a total exposure of ≥ 9000 mg and the Herrero-Zazo et al. to ≥ 4200 mg.

### Optimizing use of oral antibiotics in acne vulgaris [^111M41To]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

Oral antibiotics are commonly used to treat acne vulgaris, primarily in patients presenting with moderate to severe facial or truncal disease severity. These agents are most appropriately used in combination with a topical regimen containing benzoyl peroxide and a topical retinoid. The most common oral antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris are the tetracycline derivatives, although macrolide agents such as erythromycin have also been used extensively. Over the past 4 decades, as the sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes to several oral and topical antibiotics has decreased, the efficacy of oral tetracycline and erythromycin has markedly diminished, leading to increased use of doxycycline, minocycline, and other agents, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114ibQjt]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fixed topical treatment combinations [adapalene with benzoyl peroxide (BPO); clindamycin with BPO; tretinoin with clindamycin] were recommended as first‐line treatments of mild‐to‐moderate acne. Fixed topical treatment combinations (adapalene with BPO; tretinoin with clindamycin), or oral tetracyclines (doxycycline or lymecycline) combined with topical treatments (azelaic acid, or a fixed combination of adapalene with BPO) were recommended as first‐line treatments of moderate‐to‐severe acne. Where oral lymecycline or doxycycline are contraindicated or not tolerated, alternative oral antibiotics (trimethoprim or an oral macrolide such as erythromycin) might be considered. BPO might be considered across both severity levels if other recommended first‐line treatments are contraindicated (e.g. during pregnancy) or if there is a patient preference against their use. PDT might be considered for adults with moderate‐to‐severe acne if other treatments are ineffective, not tolerated or contraindicated.

### Sarecycline treatment for acne vulgaris: rationale for weight-based dosing and limited impact of food intake on clinical efficacy [^113beFyS]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tetracycline‐class antibiotics are frequently prescribed by dermatologists, primarily for the treatment of acne vulgaris and rosacea. Tetracycline‐class antibiotics include tetracycline (first generation), doxycycline and minocycline (second generation), and sarecycline (third generation). Prior to sarecycline, all tetracycline‐class antibiotics exhibited broad‐spectrum activity against a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria. This broad‐spectrum activity may induce bacterial resistance and disrupt the microflora, leading to dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) tracts, which are associated with adverse events (AEs) such as diarrhea and vulvovaginal mycotic/candidiasis infections. In addition, prolonged use of broad‐spectrum antibiotics such as doxycycline has been associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease

### Clinical experience results with clindamycin 1% benzoyl peroxide 5% gel (duac) as monotherapy and in combination [^112FzAiG]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This article will examine various clinical experiences with acne patients successfully treated with topical clindamycin 1% benzoyl peroxide 5% gel (Duac) alone and in combination with other acne treatments. Clindamycin 1% benzoyl peroxide 5%, the only once-daily prescription topical aqueous gel combining a benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, has demonstrated excellent tolerability and efficacy and is stable when used concomitantly with other therapies. A regimen of topical clindamycin 1% benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, oral doxycycline hyclate (Doryx), and adapalene gel (Differin) seems especially advantageous from a theoretical and practical perspective. Improvement is noted by means of photographic, physician, and/or patient assessments at baseline and follow-up visits.

### The use of oral antibiotics in treating acne vulgaris: a new approach [^111z8VWp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Although acne is not an infectious disease, oral antibiotics have remained a mainstay of treatment over the last 40 years. The anti-inflammatory properties of oral antibiotics, particularly the tetracyclines, are efficacious in treating inflammatory acne lesions. Common prescribing practices in Dermatology exert significant selection pressure on bacteria, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic use for acne not only promotes resistance in Propionibacterium acnes, but also affects other host bacteria with pathogenic potential. This review will summarize the commonly used treatments for acne vulgaris, and how they should be combined as rational treatment. The indications for using oral antibiotics in acne will be highlighted. Strategies described in the literature to conserve the utility of oral antibiotics will be summarized. These include limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy, concomitant use of a topical non-antibiotic agent, use of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, and the introduction of topical dapsone.

### Management of acne vulgaris: a review [^113kKKqz]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that primarily involves the face and trunk and affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide (approximately 85% of individuals aged 12–24 years, and approximately 50% of patients aged 20–29 years). Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.

Observations

Acne vulgaris is classified based on patient age, lesion morphology (comedonal, inflammatory, mixed, nodulocystic), distribution (location on face, trunk, or both), and severity (extent, presence or absence of scarring, postinflammatory erythema, or hyperpigmentation). Although most acne does not require specific medical evaluation, medical workup is sometimes warranted. Topical therapies such as retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapalene), benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0.025% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63% compared with baseline. Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents (oral antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral contraception [COC] or spironolactone, or isotretinoin) are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62%, placebo was associated with a 26% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Isotretinoin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne but is often used to treat resistant or persistent moderate to severe acne, as well as acne that produces scarring or significant psychosocial distress.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acne vulgaris affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide and approximately 85% of those aged 12 to 24 years. First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective.
