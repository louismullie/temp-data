## Question

what can cause ketones in the urine on testing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause ketones in the urine (ketonuria) on testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology of ketone production and what standard urine tests actually measure. Then, I should categorize the etiologies by pathophysiology and prioritize the urgent ones (e.g. DKA and SGLT2-associated euglycemic DKA). Next, I will distinguish true ketonuria from testing artifacts and limitations. After that, I'll outline context-specific diagnostic pathways (diabetes vs. non-diabetes, pregnancy, pediatrics). Finally, I need to recommend an optimal testing strategy emphasizing β-hydroxybutyrate and summarize key clinical pearls with practical thresholds and follow-up actions.

> Let me first confirm the physiological basis. Ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate [BHB], acetoacetate [AcAc], and acetone) rise when insulin is insufficient or carbohydrate availability is low; importantly, BHB predominates in DKA, while routine urine dipsticks detect mostly AcAc, which already hints at potential discordance between blood and urine during treatment trajectories [^113eLXyY]. Hold on, I should verify breath acetone relevance — yes, acetone correlates with plasma ketones and can be measured, but clinical devices are not widely used; still, this supports the concept that "ketosis" has multiple measurable compartments that may not align temporally with urine dipstick results [^112ZueNY].

> Next, I will examine insulin-deficient states as the most urgent causes. Classic DKA features hyperglycemia, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria, typically triggered by missed insulin, infection, or new-onset diabetes; here, serum BHB testing is preferred over urine ketones for diagnosis and monitoring, and I need to ensure I emphasize that per current guidance [^111N7noh]. But wait, what if glucose is normal? I should not miss euglycemic DKA — particularly with SGLT2 inhibitors — where significant ketosis and acidosis occur with glucose often below 250 mg/dL; this mandates ketone assessment regardless of glucose and immediate drug cessation with standard DKA management [^114EzAFr] [^1147X3RR] [^114mmSiF] [^114PixxV] [^114PixxV].

> I need to check a nuance specific to SGLT2 inhibitors: persistent glucosuria and prolonged or relapsing courses. Hold on, I should verify duration — FDA labeling and case series note glucosuria for 3–4 days, sometimes up to 10–14 days post-discontinuation, with documented DKA relapse during hospitalization; this means insulin and dextrose may be required longer than in classical DKA, and monitoring for relapse is prudent [^1163RMNH] [^1147X3RR] [^114mmSiF] [^112adUHE] [^115xwCN4].

> Let me consider physiological or adaptive ketosis. Nutritional ketosis from ketogenic or very-low-carbohydrate diets and fasting states can cause benign ketonuria; in children, early-phase ketosis can drive osmotic natriuresis and polyuria, so I should remember volume status and electrolyte shifts during initiation [^115x4jMq]. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought "up to 30%" of first-morning urine samples after overnight fasting might show ketones in healthy nonpregnant adults, but I should double-check the exact figure; the cited guideline clearly reports up to 30% in pregnant women's first morning samples and recognizes starvation and post-hypoglycemia as contexts for positive urine ketones, so I will qualify that claim accordingly to avoid overgeneralization [^notfound].

> I will now examine alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA). I need to ensure I separate it from DKA: AKA often presents after binge drinking with vomiting and poor intake, shows ketonemia/ketonuria, but typically lacks marked hyperglycemia; recognition matters because the therapy centers on volume, dextrose, and thiamine rather than insulin unless diabetes coexists [^114o9ADe].

> Hold on, I should review rare but critical pediatric etiologies. Inborn errors include ketogenesis defects (e.g. HMG-CoA synthase/lyase deficiencies) leading to hypoketotic hypoglycemia and ketolysis defects (e.g. SCOT or mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiencies) leading to ketoacidosis; a high anion gap acidosis with ketonuria in a child without diabetes should prompt urgent metabolic workup and sample preservation for definitive testing [^116oKfK7] [^116HbY9W]. I should also remember glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD 0) causing ketotic hypoglycemia in children, and that citrin deficiency can produce hypoketotic hypoglycemia — so the ketone pattern in the face of hypoglycemia helps triage the differential and testing [^111oud9X] [^116AGNa7].

> Next, I should consider medication-induced false positives on urine dipsticks. Wait, let me verify specific interferents: thiol-containing agents like mesna and carbidopa-levodopa can cause false-positive ketones with nitroprusside methods; cefiderocol has also been implicated; the mesna color-change behavior (cherry-red that fades) can help differentiate from true red-violet positives, and ACE inhibitors are noted as potential interferents [^112CTDSo] [^116FgpG8] [^1146VvrK] [^113eLXyY].

> Let me now distinguish true ketonuria from testing artifacts and timing effects. Urine nitroprusside strips detect AcAc, not BHB; during DKA treatment, BHB oxidizes to AcAc, so urine ketones can paradoxically rise as the patient clinically improves — this is a classic pitfall I need to highlight; false negatives occur with strip degradation, high ascorbic acid, or bacterially altered samples; proper storage and awareness of these limitations are essential [^113eLXyY] [^116bcBjA].

> I should map a context-first diagnostic approach. In patients with diabetes and illness, first assume possible DKA or euglycemic DKA and check serum/capillary BHB, electrolytes, anion gap, and venous blood gas; if on SGLT2 therapy, maintain high suspicion even with normal glucose and discontinue the drug immediately while treating DKA [^111N7noh] [^1163RMNH]. In those without diabetes but symptomatic with high anion gap acidosis, consider alcoholic ketoacidosis and toxic ingestions, and in children with acidosis plus ketonuria, evaluate urgently for inborn errors with targeted metabolic labs and sample preservation for confirmatory testing [^114o9ADe] [^116HbY9W].

> Let me verify the optimal testing strategy. Blood BHB is superior to urine AcAc for diagnosing and monitoring DKA: both are highly sensitive, but BHB is far more specific, reducing unnecessary workups; randomized and observational data suggest BHB-guided sick-day protocols improve care engagement and reduce hospital utilization, and guidelines endorse serum/capillary BHB in preference to urine ketones for DKA assessment when available [^111GPjM9] [^116LErv3] [^112H9My1] [^111N7noh] [^114o9ADe]. I should confirm pregnancy nuances — fingerstick BHB correlates well with significant ketonuria in pregnant patients with nausea/vomiting, supporting its use when clinically indicated [^116k4dB6].

> But wait, what about emerging technologies? Continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) is being explored to preempt DKA, with proposed action thresholds around 1.0–1.5 mmol/L and urgent evaluation at ≥ 3.0 mmol/L; until approved for non-adjunctive use, any elevations should be confirmed by fingerstick BHB; this may be particularly useful in T1D, pregnancy, SGLT inhibitor use, low-carbohydrate diets, and recurrent DKA phenotypes [^115jR868] [^117JvfCe].

> Summarizing the clinical pearls, I need to ensure the following: ketonuria ranges from benign nutritional ketosis to life-threatening DKA; interpret in context of symptoms, diabetes status, and medications; prefer blood BHB for diagnosis and monitoring; in SGLT2-associated cases, expect prolonged glucosuria and consider extended insulin/dextrose support; in children with acidosis and ketonuria without diabetes, promptly evaluate for inborn errors; and always account for dipstick interferences and storage issues before acting on isolated urine results [^117SrKhk] [^113eLXyY].

Ketones in urine (ketonuria) reflect **increased fatty acid metabolism** when glucose is unavailable or insulin is deficient. The most clinically significant cause is **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** [^111N7noh], but ketonuria also occurs with **fasting, low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets, prolonged exercise, pregnancy, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and alcohol use** [^114o9ADe]. Medications such as **SGLT2 inhibitors** [^1147X3RR], valproic acid, and aspirin can trigger ketosis. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g. glycogen storage diseases, organic acidemias) may also cause persistent ketonuria [^111oud9X] [^116HbY9W]. Urine ketone tests can yield false-positive or false-negative results due to interfering substances or improper storage [^113eLXyY]; therefore, confirmatory blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is recommended when DKA is suspected [^111GPjM9] [^111N7noh].

---

## Physiological and dietary causes

Increased fatty acid oxidation and ketone production occur with **prolonged fasting or caloric restriction** [^114o9ADe]. Similarly, ketosis is induced by **low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets** [^112ZueNY] to meet energy needs. Reliance on fatty acid oxidation can increase with **sustained, intense exercise** [^116xm6bK], yielding measurable urinary ketones. During **pregnancy** [^116k4dB6], increased metabolic demands and relative insulin resistance can lead to ketonuria — especially when nausea and vomiting reduce caloric intake [^114o9ADe].

---

## Pathological conditions

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)**: A life-threatening complication of insulin deficiency, mainly in type 1 diabetes, with hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonuria [^111N7noh].

- **Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis**: DKA with normal/near-normal glucose, often with SGLT2 inhibitors [^114mmSiF] [^111N7noh] [^114EzAFr].

- **Alcoholic ketoacidosis**: Chronic alcohol use with poor nutrition causes ketosis and metabolic acidosis [^114o9ADe].

- **Starvation ketosis**: Prolonged caloric deprivation increases ketone production [^114o9ADe].

- **Inborn errors of metabolism**: Disorders such as glycogen storage diseases and organic acidemias cause persistent ketonuria [^111oud9X] [^116HbY9W].

---

## Medications and substances

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin [^114mmSiF] increase ketosis risk and can cause euglycemic DKA [^111N7noh].

- **Valproic acid**: Associated with hyperammonemia and ketosis.

- **Aspirin (salicylates)**: Overdose can cause metabolic acidosis and ketosis.

- **Levodopa/carbidopa**: May cause false-positive urine ketone tests [^116FgpG8].

- **Cefiderocol**: May cause false-positive urine ketone tests [^1146VvrK].

---

## Clinical significance and interpretation

For DKA diagnosis and monitoring, urine ketones are adjunctive; **blood β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred** for both diagnostic accuracy and trend monitoring [^111GPjM9] [^111N7noh]. In patients on SGLT2 inhibitors [^1147X3RR] with compatible symptoms, assess for euglycemic DKA even when glucose is normal or near-normal [^111N7noh]. During pregnancy, ketonuria is common and may indicate inadequate caloric intake or an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

---

## Limitations and potential errors in urine ketone testing

- **False positives**: Highly colored urine [^113eLXyY], sulfhydryl-containing drugs [^112CTDSo], and improper storage can cause false positives.

- **False negatives**: Highly acidic urine, ascorbic acid intake [^113eLXyY], and microbial degradation can cause false negatives.

- **Delayed detection**: Urine ketones reflect past levels, potentially delaying recognition of acute ketosis [^116bcBjA].

- **Limited sensitivity**: Urine tests detect acetoacetate/acetone but not β-hydroxybutyrate [^114YBuYr], the predominant ketone in DKA [^114o9ADe].

---

## Clinical approach to ketonuria

When DKA is suspected, **obtain confirmatory blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing** [^111GPjM9] [^111N7noh]. Always interpret ketonuria in clinical context — alongside glucose level and acid–base status — and educate patients on SGLT2 inhibitors [^114mmSiF] or insulin therapy to recognize symptoms of ketosis or DKA and to seek prompt medical attention. Ketones in urine reflect increased fatty acid metabolism from insulin deficiency, carbohydrate restriction, or metabolic stress; while DKA is the most clinically significant cause, ketonuria also occurs with fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, prolonged exercise, pregnancy, and certain medications [^114o9ADe].

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114o9ADe]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation**: Ketones measured in urine or blood in the home setting by patients with diabetes and in the clinic/hospital setting should be considered only an adjunct to the diagnosis of DKA GPP.

- **Urine ketone measurements**: The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes, or a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but who presents with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia, suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may occur rarely in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first-morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

- **Recommendation**: Blood ketone determinations that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used only as an adjunct to diagnose DKA and should not be used to monitor DKA treatment. Specific measurement of βHBA in blood can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of DKA B (moderate).

- **Blood ketone measurements**: Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis because the results do not quantify βHBA, the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy, because AcAc and acetone may increase as βHBA decreases during successful therapy.

When a child presents with high-anion gap metabolic acidosis, the pediatrician can proceed with confidence by recalling some basic principles. Defects of organic acid, pyruvate, and ketone body metabolism that present with acute acidosis are reviewed. Flowcharts for identifying the underlying cause and initiating life-saving therapy are provided. By evaluating electrolytes, blood sugar, lactate, ammonia, and urine ketones, the provider can determine the likelihood of an inborn error of metabolism. Freezing serum, plasma, and urine samples during the acute presentation, for definitive diagnostic testing at the provider's convenience, aids in the differential diagnosis.

Glycogen synthase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism, characterized by fasting hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic seizures, and ketonuria. Only 7 families with 14 affected children have been reported. Here, we report an additional patient with this deficiency. Findings in this patient were clinically and biochemically consistent with those reported in patients with ketotic hypoglycemia and may alert the clinician to consider glycogen synthase deficiency.

### Fasting ketonuria is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in non-diabetic individuals [^116Yjb9y]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

Increased levels of ketone bodies, an alternative fuel when glucose availability is low, may exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Whether increased ketone bodies are associated with coronary artery calcium (CAC), a recognized and strong cardiovascular risk factor, remains unknown. We investigated the association of fasting ketonuria with CAC and its progression.

- **Methods**: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were conducted in adults without diabetes or CVD. Subjects underwent routine health examinations, including cardiac computed tomography estimations of CAC scores. Logistic regression models were performed to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalent CAC scores > 0 according to fasting ketonuria categories (0, 1, and ≥ 2). Linear mixed models with random intercepts and random slopes were used to estimate CAC progression.

- **Results**: Of 144,346 subjects, 12.3% had CAC scores > 0 at baseline. Overall, higher fasting ketonuria was associated with decreased prevalence of coronary calcification compared to no ketonuria. Multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for prevalent CAC by comparing ketonuria categories 1 and ≥ 2 with no ketonuria were 0.94 (0.84–1.06) and 0.82 (0.71–0.95), respectively. The associations did not differ according to clinically relevant subgroups. Ketonuria was associated with lower CAC progression over time; the multivariable-adjusted ratio of progression rates comparing ketonuria ≥ 2 versus no ketonuria was 0.976 (0.965–0.995).

- **Conclusions**: We found an inverse association between fasting ketonuria and coronary artery calcification, suggesting potential cardiovascular benefits associated with ketonuria in non-diabetic individuals.

### Steglujan [^114PixxV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Steglujan significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to those who received placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses. Steglujan is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders**: Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors.

- **Precipitating conditions**: Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

- **Signs and symptoms**: Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 4 days.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: A case report [^115x4jMq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The connection between low carbohydrate diets and reductions in body water composition has been previously documented. Under physiological conditions, ketones are not present to an appreciable degree in urine in either the postprandial or overnight fasting state. Yet, once a ketogenic diet is begun, the presence of urinary ketones may be detectable within two days after the initiation of the diet. Furthermore, in some individuals undergoing a very-low carbohydrate diet, the amount of urinary ketones measured during the first three days of a fast was found to be proportional to the amount of natriuresis.

Other studies have similarly shown that decreases in total body, intracellular, and extracellular water were correlated with the greatest levels of ketosis during ketogenic diets. Therefore, it is likely that the initiation of a ketogenic diet results in osmotic polyuria driven by elevations in serum and urinary ketones. Furthermore, it is likely that the increased natriuresis is sufficient to change body water composition, although the clinical significance and mechanism by which this occurs are not fully known.

At the time of this publication, it is also not fully known if, or the extent to which, different ketogenic diets may induce polyuria in pediatric versus adult populations. Increased metabolic demands in pediatric populations and significant variation in the different types of low carbohydrate diets likely confound this factor, and further work on this topic is required.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: β-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^111GPjM9]. Diabetes Care (2011). High credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

- **Research design and methods**: Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL underwent urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

- **Results**: Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick showed a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

- **Conclusions**: Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113eLXyY]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Urine ketones: Preanalytical**. The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure the accuracy of test results.

- **Analytical**. Several assay principles have been described. Most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones.

### Sick day management using blood 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) compared with urine ketone monitoring reduces hospital visits in young people with T1DM: a randomized clinical trial [^116LErv3]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening acute complication of Type 1 diabetes, may be preventable with frequent monitoring of glycaemia and ketosis along with timely supplemental insulin. This prospective, two-centre study assessed sick day management using blood 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) monitoring compared with traditional urine ketone testing, aimed at averting emergency assessment and hospitalization.

One hundred and twenty-three children, adolescents, and young adults, aged 3–22 years, and their families received sick day education. Participants were randomized to receive either a blood glucose monitor that also measures blood 3-OHB (blood ketone group, n = 62) or a monitor plus urine ketone strips (urine ketone group, n = 61). All were encouraged to check glucose levels ≥ 3 times daily and to check ketones during acute illness or stress, when glucose levels were consistently elevated (≥ 13.9 mmol/l on two consecutive readings), or when symptoms of DKA were present. Frequency of sick days, hyperglycaemia, ketosis, and hospitalization/emergency assessment were ascertained prospectively for six months.

There were 578 sick days during 21,548 days of follow-up. Participants in the blood ketone group checked ketones significantly more during sick days (276 of 304 episodes, 90.8%) than participants in the urine ketone group (168 of 274 episodes, 61.3%) (P < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalization/emergency assessment was significantly lower in the blood ketone group (38/100 patient-years) compared with the urine ketone group (75/100).

### Invokana [^1163RMNH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing Invokana [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days, with some cases extending up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

- **Consider ketone monitoring**: In patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Invokana, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Invokana.

- **Withhold Invokana**: If possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Invokana when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

- **Educate all patients**: On the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Invokana and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

### Inborn errors of ketogenesis and ketone body utilization [^116oKfK7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies, such as acetoacetate and 3-hydroxy-n-butyric acid, are metabolites derived from fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids like leucine. They are primarily produced in the liver through reactions catalyzed by the ketogenic enzymes mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase. During prolonged starvation, ketone bodies can supply up to two-thirds of the brain's energy requirements.

- **Ketone body utilization**: The rate-limiting enzyme of ketone body utilization, also known as ketolysis, is succinyl-coenzyme A:3-oxoacid coenzyme A transferase. The subsequent step in ketolysis is catalyzed by 2-methylacetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase, which is also involved in isoleucine catabolism.

Inborn errors of metabolism affecting these four enzymes are presented and discussed in the context of differential diagnoses. Disorders of ketogenesis can present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, whereas inborn errors of ketolysis are characterized by metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis. If these diseases are considered early and appropriate treatment is initiated without delay, patients with inborn errors of ketone body metabolism often have a good clinical outcome.

### Breath acetone is a reliable indicator of ketosis in adults consuming ketogenic meals [^112ZueNY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Ketogenic diets are used therapeutically to treat intractable seizures. Clinically, it appears that the maintenance of ketosis is crucial to the efficacy of the diet in ameliorating seizures. To understand how ketosis and seizure protection are related, a reliable, noninvasive measure of ketosis that can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort is needed.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine which index, breath acetone or urinary acetoacetate, is more strongly related to the plasma ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

- **Design**: After fasting overnight for 12 hours, 12 healthy adults consumed 4 ketogenic meals over 12 hours. Blood, breath, and urine samples were collected hourly. Blood was analyzed for plasma acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, breath for acetone, and urine for acetoacetate.

- **Results**: By the end of the 12-hour dietary treatment, plasma acetoacetate, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and breath acetone had increased 3.5-fold, whereas urinary acetoacetate increased 13-fold when measured enzymatically and 25-fold when measured with urinary ketone dipsticks. Plasma acetoacetate was best predicted by breath acetone (R² = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally predicted by breath acetone and urinary acetoacetate (R² = 0.54, P = 0.0040).

- **Conclusions**: Breath acetone is as good a predictor of ketosis as urinary acetoacetate. Breath acetone analysis is noninvasive and can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort to patients. As an indicator of ketosis in epilepsy patients consuming a ketogenic diet, breath acetone is valuable.

### Steglatro [^114yDprM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Steglatro, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for the resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Steglatro.

Withhold Steglatro, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Steglatro when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Steglatro and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Lower limb amputation**: In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Event rates were 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, Steglatro 5 mg, and Steglatro 15 mg treatment arms, respectively.

	- Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent, occurring in 81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations. Some patients underwent multiple amputations, involving both lower limbs.

	- Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis were compared with the urine dipstick.

Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL underwent urine dipstick testing, a chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB showed a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Glyxambi [^1174HhCj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin, a component of Glyxambi, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to those who received placebo, and fatal ketoacidosis has occurred with empagliflozin. Glyxambi is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Glyxambi.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse. Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL).

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^115sDkrf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 273 unique patient records were identified and reviewed for inclusion. Reasons for exclusion included: no inpatient or emergency room admission for DKA (249 cases) and not on SGLT2i prior to admission (13 cases). The remaining 11 cases were analyzed for this study.

Data for the 11 cases are summarized below. Patients with type 2 diabetes tended to be older and have more comorbidities than those with type 1. Among all patients, the average time to resolve DKA, as defined by the closure of the AG, was 37.8 hours. The ICU stay averaged 4.5 days, and the total length of stay was 9.5 days. Our investigation reveals a subset of six patients who had prolonged ICU courses of four or more days, were on an IV insulin infusion for over 40 hours, had glucosuria for at least 3 days following admission, and, in three cases, had a relapse of DKA while admitted.

Glucosuria persisted for up to 10 days after discontinuing the SGLT2i despite adequate glycemic control in most cases, suggesting that glucosuria is evidence of continued drug action. For one case (#5), urine glucose concentration was quantified during hospitalization and demonstrated a significant elevation of urine glucose for several days after discontinuation of the drug, despite normal plasma glucose levels. Notably, two cases (#7 and #8) had recently initiated a ketogenic diet.

Our study suggests not only that the time to close the anion gap may be longer in such cases, but also that there might be underlying factors contributing to the delayed recovery when patients are under SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

### Capillary ketone level and future ketoacidosis risk in patients with type 1 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors [^1158sRrT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

We aimed to determine if routine capillary blood ketone testing on well days predicts future diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) using sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTi).

- **Research design and methods**: We examined previously collected data from empagliflozin-assigned participants in a T1D trial that included weekly fasted ketone levels. Over 6–12 months, ketone levels were subdivided into 28-day periods, and the outcome was subsequent adjudicated DKA or severe ketosis.

- **Results**: Among 1,194 participants, 325 had 49 DKA and 568 severe ketosis events. On-treatment maximum ketone levels were higher in the 28 days before an outcome compared with levels in those without an outcome, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71–0.82). Maximum ketone level ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 66.0%, specificity of 79.6%, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 7.6.

- **Conclusions**: Routine surveillance of capillary ketone levels in T1D using SGLTi may represent a DKA mitigation strategy and implies a potential threshold for continuous ketone monitoring.

### Mesnex [^112CTDSo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Laboratory test interferences**: A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with Mesnex when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). Mesnex may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. Additionally, Mesnex may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

- **Use in patients with a history of adverse reactions to thiol compounds**: Mesnex is a thiol compound, i.e. a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Mesnex.

### Farxiga [^1147X3RR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Farxiga significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received a placebo. Farxiga is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing Farxiga.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: A potential complication of treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition [^114EzAFr]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the most recently approved antihyperglycemic medications. We sought to describe their association with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) in hopes that it will enhance recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication.

- **Research design and methods**: Cases identified incidentally are described.

- **Results**: We identified 13 episodes of SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euDKA or ketosis in nine individuals, seven with type 1 diabetes and two with type 2 diabetes, from various practices across the U.S. The absence of significant hyperglycemia in these patients delayed recognition of the emergent nature of the problem by patients and providers.

- **Conclusions**: SGLT-2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis, perhaps as a consequence of their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance, hyperglucagonemia, and volume depletion. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who experience nausea, vomiting, or malaise or develop a metabolic acidosis in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy should be promptly evaluated for the presence of urine and/or serum ketones. SGLT-2 inhibitors should only be used with great caution, extensive counseling, and close monitoring in the setting of type 1 diabetes.

### Qtern [^1127Yov7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, dapagliflozin, a component of Qtern, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. Qtern is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders, such as a history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery, are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis, such as less than 250 mg/dL. Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for three days.

### Jardiance [^114mmSiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue JARDIANCE, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting JARDIANCE.

Withhold JARDIANCE, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume JARDIANCE when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Instruct patients to discontinue JARDIANCE and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: JARDIANCE can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including JARDIANCE. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate for ketonuria in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting [^116k4dB6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a rapid, fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) test predicts ketonuria in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of 82 pregnant women who presented to the Barnes-Jewish Hospital emergency department (ED) with complaints of nausea or vomiting were enrolled into an institutional review board-approved, prospective, observational study. Exclusion criteria were temperature of > 38.3°C, altered mental status, prisoners, and > 1 L of any intravenous (IV) fluid before screening. Subjects had fingerstick β-OHB tests, with results reported in increments of 0.1 mmol/L. Urine ketone results were made available once reported as part of standard care and varied from 0 (trace) to +4 values. Ketonuria was defined as a urine ketone value of 3+ or 4+ and was analyzed as a dichotomous, categorical variable. A contingency table and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve were constructed for comparing the β-OHB values to those urine ketone values for each patient.

- **Results**: Mean (± SD) β-OHB was 0.43 (± 0.52) mmol/L, and median urine was 1+ for the cohort as a whole. The area under the ROC curve equaled 0.95. The sensitivity and specificity for a fingerstick test of > 0.45 mmol/L were 89% and 94.5%, respectively. The positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 16, and the negative LR was 0.12.

- **Conclusions**: Fingerstick β-OHB is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool that correlates well with ketonuria and identifies ketonemia in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Fingerstick β-OHB testing has the potential to…

### An unusual case of hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and increased anion gap acidosis [^117KgwXK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this case report, we aim to illustrate the importance of correct diagnostic reasoning and the misleading features of point-of-care testing. This case demonstrates that while hyperglycemia, ketonuria, a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute abdominal pain almost inevitably warrant a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, other possibilities still exist and must be excluded. In this context, we emphasize the clinical and therapeutic significance of determining serum lactate and urinary ketones in the differential diagnosis of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### Bedside detection of urine beta-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^114YBuYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

While critically important, the rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empirical treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the previous assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and use of a silver nitrate (AgNO₃) catalyst was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H₂O₂ (3%) at a ratio of 1:9 (H₂O₂:urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO₃ sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs), blinded to the preparation technique, evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

- **Results**: Multistix detected AcAc appropriately; ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H₂O₂ improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L).

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114QEcyy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

2.2 Blood testing for ketones

Best practice in Australia advises that ketone levels should be checked using finger‐prick capillary blood with a handheld meter and ketone testing strips. Blood ketone testing measures β‐hydroxybutyrate, which constitutes the major circulating ketone body. There is no clear consensus in the literature regarding thresholds of blood ketone levels that should be considered as significantly elevated. Generally, levels below 1.0‐1.5 mmol/L are considered to exclude DKA, while those above 2.5‐3.0 mmol/L suggest a diagnosis or the need for an urgent medical review.

Blood testing for ketones has greater sensitivity and specificity for DKA than urine testing. A blood sample is usually readily available, and because it provides a measurement quickly, it minimizes delays in diagnosis. Although ketone meters may vary in accuracy depending on the manufacturer, these devices generally represent mature technology, and many combine blood glucose and ketone testing, meaning that a person is not required to carry an additional device. Conversely, ketone meters and their strips are expensive, ketone strips have a short shelf‐life of typically 12 months, and testing is painful and involves blood exposure. As with urine ketone measurements, interfering substances may impact specificity.

2.3 Real‐world experience with ketone testing options

Although there is evidence that continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provision has resulted in a reduction in DKA, this is probably because insulin has been administered sooner in response to real-time glucose levels.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^1141ZnRR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications that increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and the inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, are not well-characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116bcBjA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Urine testing for ketones is a long-established method that offers a relatively inexpensive and painless option for users. It does not require carrying a meter and involves minimal technical skill to implement. Despite these advantages, many patients prefer to avoid urine tests. The color-coded, strip-based test employs a nitroprusside reaction, providing a semiquantitative measure of acetoacetate and, with some brands, acetone. This test reflects the average ketone levels excreted in urine since the last void, which may delay recognition of impending diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or its resolution.

Importantly, during treatment, the circulating pool of β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate. This can cause urine ketone readings to rise while blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations are declining. The paradoxical increase in urinary acetoacetate can misleadingly suggest that the condition is not improving. Additionally, acetoacetate accounts for only about 20% of circulating ketone bodies, affecting the sensitivity of urine testing. False positive results may occur due to highly pigmented urine and interfering substances, such as levodopa and drugs present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free-sulphydryl compounds.

Finally, testing relies on the individual recognizing an increased risk of DKA to initiate testing. This may be challenging due to factors such as oliguria from dehydration and acute renal failure or the absence of a private environment to obtain a urine sample.

### Phenylketonuria [^114YqvDD]. Lancet (2010). High credibility.

Phenylketonuria is a disease that can be associated with a range of symptoms and conditions. It includes behavioral or personality changes, congenital heart disease, gait disturbance, microcephaly, parkinsonism, and musty body odor. Other issues that may arise are miscarriages, learning difficulties in school, hypopigmentation, and seizures. The disease is linked to the PAH gene mutation, which results in increased serum phenylalanine and decreased serum tyrosine.

Additional signs include hair hypopigmentation, cognitive impairment, autism spectrum disorder, skin rash, social isolation, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. A characteristic musty breath odor is also noted, along with an increased serum phenylalanine-to-tyrosine ratio, developmental delay, and ADHD.

### Exploring the clinical utility of blood ketone levels in the emergency department assessment of paediatric patients [^114mDkrT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Ketonuria, as identified through standard urine testing, is a frequent finding in children presenting to emergency departments. With the advent of hand-held ketone meters, blood ketone levels can now be rapidly quantified.

- **Hypothesis**: Point of care testing (POCT) of blood ketone levels could provide clinically useful information regarding the severity of illness in children and the risk of hospital admission.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was conducted using POCT of blood ketone levels in a convenience sample of children. A level of 1.2 mmol/l has a positive predictive value of 66.7% for admission. The ketone levels showed a good correlation with decreased oral intake (R² = 0.25; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: A strong association was found between ketone levels, decreased oral intake, and fever. Although ketone levels do not correlate well with more traditional markers of illness severity, they can help provide additional insights.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^113htq7h]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

This study is the first detailed analysis of the inpatient course of all SGLT2i‐related DKA cases within a single center, including an evaluation of glucosuria. Prior investigations have primarily focused on defining the risk of developing DKA with SGLT2i use in large populations, indicating an increased risk in some analyses, but not in others. Two more recent studies designed to identify risk factors for developing SGLT2i‐associated DKA also reported hospital stay characteristics. However, these studies focused on precipitating events leading to DKA rather than the inpatient course, and the duration of glucosuria was not reported. Case reports suggest that despite half-lives of 10–19 hours (depending on the agent), the glucosuric effects of SGLT2i can persist up to nine days. In our cohort of 11 patients, six exhibited elevated urinary glucose concentrations for 3–10 days despite cessation of the medication upon admission, with three of those experiencing DKA relapse during their admission.

Our study suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized with SGLT2i‐related DKA are likely older and have more comorbidities than those with type 1 diabetes, requiring a longer period on IV insulin and in the hospital. Age and comorbidities may have certainly played a role in their clinical course. Given new SGLT2i indications for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events and progression of renal failure, increasing numbers of chronically ill patients may be started on this therapy. In cases of DKA, particularly when clinical circumstances may require prolonged fasting or… (text cutoff)

### Synjardy [^112B6qW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for three days after discontinuing Synjardy or Synjardy XR; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than six days, with some cases up to two weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Synjardy or Synjardy XR.

Withhold Synjardy or Synjardy XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Synjardy or Synjardy XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs occur.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115uU7Uc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Blood ketones**: Serum/plasma ketones can be measured with the tablets or dipsticks routinely used for urine ketone measurements. Although samples can be diluted with saline to "titer" the ketone concentration (results are typically reported as "positive at a 1/ x dilution"), βHBA, the predominant ketone body in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), is not detected, as with urine ketone testing.

	- For specific βHBA measurements, sample requirements differ among methods, as described below. In general, blood samples can be collected into tubes containing heparin, EDTA, fluoride, citrate, or oxalate. Ascorbic acid interferes with some assay methods. Acetoacetic acid (AcAc) interferes with some assay methods unless the samples are highly dilute. Sample stability differs among methods, but whole-blood samples are generally stable at 4°C for up to 24 hours. Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to 1 week at 4°C and for at least several weeks at −20°C (long-term stability data are not available for most assay methods).

- **Analytical methods**: Several different assay methods (e.g. colorimetric, gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and enzymatic) have been described for blood ketones, including specific measurement of βHBA. Enzymatic methods appear to be the most widely used for the quantification of βHBA for routine clinical management. The principle of the enzymatic methods is that β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, in the presence of NAD+, converts βHBA to AcAc and NADH. Under alkaline conditions (pH 8.5–9.5), the reaction favors the formation of AcAc from βHBA. The NADH produced can be quantified.

This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa-levodopa therapy have been reported. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa-levodopa therapy.

The patient should be checked for ketonaemia (> 3.0 mmol/L) or significant ketonuria (> 2+ on urine sticks) if the capillary blood glucose (CBG) exceeds 12 mmol/L. If the patient has diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and requires emergency surgery, the involvement of senior multidisciplinary input from intensivists, anaesthetists, surgeons, and diabetologists should be considered to agree on optimal peri-operative management. Operating on a patient with DKA carries significant mortality and should be avoided if at all possible.

The discussion should include: the requirement for surgery, as DKA can be associated with abdominal pain (negative laparotomies have been reported); the area in which the patient should be resuscitated before theatre; whether saline 0.9% with pre-mixed potassium chloride or Hartmann's solution should be the main resuscitation fluid; whether a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) or a fixed-rate infusion should be used to treat DKA in theatre; and the area in which the patient will be recovered after surgery. Recent guidelines and evidence suggest that a fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion is superior to a VRIII in treating DKA in a ward environment. However, the use of a fixed-rate infusion is associated with hypoglycaemia and requires the administration of glucose 20% if the CBG is under 14 mmol/L.

Early involvement of the diabetes inpatient specialist team should be sought. If possible, long-acting insulins (Levemir, Lantus, Tresiba) should be continued in all patients at 80% of the usual dose. This is to avoid rebound hyperglycaemia when intravenous insulin is stopped.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis following traumatic brain injury [^112twAqq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower glucose levels by reducing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, which can lead to ketogenesis. Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of SGLT2 inhibitors that can be triggered by trauma. However, the absence of significant hyperglycemia can delay its diagnosis and treatment, which may lead to detrimental consequences. Herein, we report a case of euglycemic DKA following traumatic brain injury in a patient with type 2 diabetes who was taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. Delayed recognition of euglycemic DKA in this case led to progressive metabolic deterioration. This report emphasizes the importance of promptly suspecting, diagnosing, and treating euglycemic DKA in patients with traumatic injuries who exhibit high anion-gap metabolic acidosis, ketonuria, and glucosuria — even if they do not have significant hyperglycemia.

### Recurrent hypoglycemia in a toddler [^112BavKA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia is the most common cause of hypoglycemia in toddlers. This diagnosis should be considered in any hypoglycemic toddler with no prior history of abnormal growth who is developmentally normal when toxic ingestions and sepsis are inconsistent with the clinical picture. Diagnosis is important in preventing serious long-term sequelae and is made in the setting of hypoglycemia, ketonuria, and ketonemia. Therefore, checking urine and blood ketones is an essential part of the evaluation in any hypoglycemic toddler. We report the case of a 3-year-old girl with hypoglycemia secondary to idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for phenylketonuria, specifically in relation to clinical and laboratory follow-up, the ESPKU 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining an annual nutritional review with clinical examination. This includes measuring weight, height, and BMI, as well as laboratory assessments, which should include plasma amino acids, plasma homocysteine or MMA, hemoglobin, MCV, and ferritin. This applies to all patients on a low phenylalanine diet or those self-restricting high-protein foods. It may be necessary to assess other micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals including calcium, zinc, and selenium, or hormones such as PTH, if clinically indicated.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116414cU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Breath-based ketone testing, although not widely available clinically, measures ketones through a person's breath. The predominant ketone measured is acetone, a volatile compound exhaled naturally. Advantages of this method include painless ketone level assessment and the elimination of the need for blood exposure or urine collection. Changes in acetone levels are dynamic and may provide an early indicator of a change in a person's metabolic state. However, breath ketone meters are expensive, the test must be user-initiated, and the individual is required to carry an additional device.

A proof-of-concept study evaluated the Ketonix breath ketone analyzer (Varberg, Sweden) in 10 adults and nine children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The study concluded that the device could effectively rule out ketosis in adults but not in children. Generally, there is a lack of evidence regarding the accuracy and dynamic range of these devices for individuals with T1D. This is because they are typically developed for those pursuing ketogenic diets rather than being intended for medical use.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^111FNs5s]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Polyuria refers to the excessive production of urine, generally defined as greater than 2000 mL/m²/24h in the pediatric population. It is differentiated from urinary frequency, which is the increased need to urinate without excessive urine volume production. While urinary frequency is a relatively common phenomenon in children, often occurring in the setting of lower genito-urinary tract infections, the causes of polyuria in pediatric patients are less common and require prompt recognition and diagnosis. Polyuria frequently presents in the context of underlying conditions that result in either water diuresis or solute diuresis. The differential diagnosis for new-onset polyuria in the pediatric population includes diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, in addition to other less common metabolic, endocrine, renal, and psychological causes.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^115XfTJk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The ideal ketone monitor needs to address several limitations associated with current approaches to ketone testing. We propose the following:

- **Measurement range**: An ideal device would measure ketones over a relevant dynamic range (0‐10 mmol/L) and provide automated alerts without requiring the user to initiate a measurement.

- **Precision**: Measurements should be precise, particularly at the lower end, to avoid a significant number of false alerts that could result in alarm fatigue.

- **Display**: The display should be discreet unless needed.

- **Integration**: The technology should integrate with the user's existing glucose-management system to eliminate the need for an additional device. For instance, ketone levels and trend information could be shown on a smartphone or insulin pump screen.

Ideally, the device should minimize discomfort and psychological, financial, and physical burdens on the user. It needs to be reliable and durable. Additional refinement, though not essential, could include instructions on the most appropriate response to the information provided. Current methods of urine, blood, and breath ketone testing do not meet these criteria, indicating a need for exploring other approaches.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^116gd9TW]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, the diagnosis of polyuria typically requires a 24-hour urine void collection to confirm the presence of excessive urine output. Subsequent laboratory analysis, including urine osmolality, urine electrolytes, renal function tests, blood gas, and serum and urine glucose measurement, can assist in making a diagnosis. In our patient, the history of recent diet initiation, presence of ketonuria, and normal blood glucose was suggestive of ketosis-induced osmotic diuresis. It was recommended for the patient to immediately discontinue the diet and increase carbohydrate intake rather than obtain a 24-hour urine collection, which is difficult in a non-potty trained toddler. The subsequent resolution of the patient's excessive urination with normal urinalysis further supports the diagnosis.

This case illustrates the inadvertent consequences that can occur when parents impose new fad diets on their young children. While ketogenic diets were once a mainstay treatment for epilepsy in pediatrics and are still used for refractory cases, they have since been replaced as an early treatment modality by various classes of antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet is recommended after the failure of two anticonvulsant medications in a pediatric patient with intractable epilepsy. However, attention must be paid to associated complications such as nausea, lethargy, fatigue, food refusal, hypoglycemia, and confusion. Furthermore, life-threatening complications such as selenium deficiency cardiomyopathy and QT interval prolongation should also be considered.

### Update on measuring ketones [^116xm6bK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During states of insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases and a flood of circulating free fatty acids is converted in the liver into ketone bodies — mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate.

During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which becomes the predominant ketone in urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might increase even as DKA is resolving.

Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood and urine ketones through measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, and are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acetone forms through spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology has been announced for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid.

Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets; assessment of acidosis associated with alcohol use; and in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, both of which can increase the risk of DKA. Additionally, measuring ketones can help identify DKA due to insulin deficiency.

This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^116JHDXY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

It is essential that inpatient therapy of SGLT2i-related DKA focuses on providing adequate insulin and dextrose independent of serum glucose concentrations, given ongoing glucosuria despite the resolution of metabolic acidosis. Monitoring urine glucose concentration may also assist in the risk assessment for DKA relapse in this setting. A larger, prospective multicenter study comparing patients with DKA on SGLT2i to a control group of DKA without SGLT2i, which closely monitors urine glucose concentrations and other relevant clinical factors, is necessary to define recommended monitoring and management strategies. Guidelines for the treatment of SGLT2i-related DKA should recognize that patient characteristics and course may differ from those of classical DKA, thus requiring vigilance to prevent relapse and extended hospitalization.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116cdNdL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The standard management of established diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin, and addressing precipitating factors. These interventions should occur in a hospital environment where the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters, who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances, to late presenters, who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid-base balance, volume status, and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery, and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is the recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires the person to recognize that they are at an increased risk of DKA and proactively initiate a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and thirst occur late, and hyperglycemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^117JvfCe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The rationale behind the use of continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) in an ambulatory setting is to pre-empt diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rather than to recognize and manage the fully established condition. In support of this approach, Song et al. reported that maximum fasted blood ketone levels of 0.8 mmol/L or higher, as determined by point-of-care testing, predicted future DKA. It should also be noted that in the EASE, DEPICT, and TANDEM studies, levels of 0.8–1.0 mmol/L were not uncommon. These minor elevations in ketones may provide part of the protective effect of SGLT inhibitors. Therefore, we suggest that responses to CKM data should be initiated early at ketone levels of either 1.0 or 1.5 mmol/L, as levels below these thresholds effectively exclude DKA. Conversely, ketone levels of more than 3.0 mmol/L are consistent with a diagnosis of DKA. Levels between 1.5 and 3.0 mmol/L represent an intermediate 'transition zone', providing a window of opportunity to avert DKA. It should be noted that until these CKM devices are approved for non-adjunctive use, confirmation with a finger-prick ketone measurement is recommended.

### Phenylketonuria [^113FrQB5]. Lancet (2010). High credibility.

Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the PAH gene, resulting in a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.

- **Pathophysiology**: Phenylketonuria is caused by a mutation in the PAH gene, most commonly a missense mutation, resulting in a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the body, causing brain dysfunction if untreated. In classic phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is absent or significantly reduced, while in mild phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia, partial enzymatic activity is preserved. The accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites triggers several biochemical changes involved in the pathogenesis of brain damage, including reduced activity of pyruvate kinase, HMG-CoA reductase, and monoamine oxidase B, along with impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission and hypomyelination.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of phenylketonuria is estimated at 1 in 15,000 live births in the US and 1 in 100,000 live births in Europe.

- **Disease course**: Phenylketonuria is typically detected through newborn screening, enabling early intervention. If left untreated, it can lead to seizures, eczema, intellectual disability, behavioral disturbances with autistic traits, parkinsonism, musty body odor, and reduced skin and hair pigmentation.

### Hypoketotic hypoglycemia in citrin deficiency: a case report [^116AGNa7]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Here, we described the clinical history of a baby boy with repetitive episodes of hypoglycemia without adequate ketone production. The fasting tolerance test showed that the patient demonstrated hypoglycemia without appropriate ketone body elevation. A genetic test revealed pathogenic SLC25A13 gene variants and led to the diagnosis of CD; the use of MCT-containing formula resolved the hypoglycemic episodes.

We collected serial blood samples during a starvation test, allowing us to precisely determine the ketone body dynamics in response to hypoglycemia. Inappropriately low levels of ketones in the presence of severe hypoglycemia may provide a diagnostic clue for CD. Characterizing the metabolic profile using accessible and convenient laboratory tools could help physicians and patients, as CD exhibits nonspecific symptoms and has little diagnostic evidence. Moreover, it is important to recognize that a hypoglycemic state in CD is associated with insufficient ketone levels; relatively high ketone levels have been reported in some patients with CD. A previous case of CD reported as ketotic hypoglycemia was determined using a urine sample, while the blood ketone levels might have been relatively low for blood glucose (0.78 mM). A 2+ result of qualitative tests for urine ketones would be approximately 400 μM of acetoacetic acid. The blood ketone levels might be relatively low in the hypoglycemic situation. Moreover, another study describing ketotic hypoglycemia revealed a CD case with hypoglycemic convulsion, while blood ketone levels (total).

### Farxiga [^112adUHE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and individuals at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Farxiga, promptly evaluate the patient, and provide treatment if ketoacidosis is confirmed. Monitor patients for the resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Farxiga.

Withhold Farxiga if possible during temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Farxiga when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Instruct patients to discontinue Farxiga and seek immediate medical attention if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Farxiga can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine levels. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Farxiga in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^115jR868]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication usually affecting people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and, less commonly, people with type 2 diabetes. Early identification of ketosis is a cornerstone in DKA prevention and management. Methods for ketone measurement by people with diabetes include capillary blood or urine testing. These approaches have limitations, including the need to carry testing strips that have a limited shelf life and a requirement for the user to initiate a test. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) via interstitial fluid with a sensor inserted subcutaneously, employing an enzymatic electrochemical reaction. Ketone readings can be updated every 5 minutes.

In the future, one would expect that commercialized devices will incorporate alarms linked with standardized thresholds and trend arrows. Ideally, to minimize the burden on users, CKM functionality should be integrated with other devices used to implement glucose management, including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. We suggest CKM provision to all at risk of DKA and recommend that the devices should be worn continuously. Those who may particularly benefit are individuals who have T1D, are pregnant, on medications such as sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) inhibitors that increase DKA risk, people with recurrent DKA (reDKA), those with T1D undertaking high-intensity exercise, are socially or geographically isolated, or those on low carbohydrate diets. The provision of ketone profiles will provide important clinical insights that have yet to be fully explored.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: A systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in the prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL (up to April 2012, no language restrictions, studies in humans) were searched for experimental and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined were prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery, healthcare costs, and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings, and expert contacts.

- **Results**: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centers. The risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing, compared with urine testing, was associated with reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery (three studies), cost benefits (one study), and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in study design and data.

- **Conclusions**: There is evidence suggesting…

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^115xwCN4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have become increasingly popular glucose-lowering agents, and interest in this class has broadened due to their demonstrated cardioprotection in patients with established cardiovascular disease and their ability to slow the progression of renal dysfunction. There is also interest in extending this therapy to patients without diabetes, as it appears to lower the risk of heart failure or cardiovascular death, even in patients with heart failure in the absence of diabetes. SGLT2i increase serum ketones, and a recognized adverse effect of SGLT2i therapy is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). While the incidence and risk factors for developing DKA on SGLT2i have been studied, recognition and prevention of DKA have become part of society and consensus guidelines. It has been assumed that DKA in this setting mimics classical DKA typically seen in type 1 diabetes; however, there are no detailed studies of the inpatient course for patients who develop this adverse medication effect.

We performed a systematic medical records search at a large academic medical center in Boston, MA, to identify common patterns and inpatient courses for cases with DKA associated with SGLT2i. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) electronic medical record was systematically queried to identify cases of DKA in patients prescribed SGLT2i. The BIDMC Institutional Review Board exempted this protocol from review. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 or older, admitted between January 1, 2013, and May 16, 2019, and prescribed any SGLT2i.
