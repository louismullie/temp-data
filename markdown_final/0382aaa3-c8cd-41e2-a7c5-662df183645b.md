## Question

How should obstructive uropathy due to a newly diagnosed prostate cancer be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how obstructive uropathy should be managed at the time of a new prostate cancer diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about where the obstruction is occurring and whether there are emergent complications that mandate immediate action. Then, I should confirm the initial diagnostic workup including labs and staging imaging. Next, I will examine acute decompression strategies for ureteral versus bladder outlet obstruction. After that, I need to verify how hormonal status and disease stage influence prognosis and treatment intensity. I will then consider initiation of systemic therapy and how it interfaces with decompression. Finally, I should discuss goals-of-care, quality-of-life tradeoffs, monitoring plans, and special considerations including when intervention might reasonably be deferred, integrating high-quality guidelines throughout.

> Let me first confirm the level and mechanism of obstruction, because bladder outlet obstruction at the urethra/bladder neck from prostatic enlargement is more common than ureteral obstruction from direct tumor invasion or extrinsic compression, and this distinction will drive whether I pursue ureteral stenting/nephrostomy versus bladder outlet procedures such as TURP or laser vaporization [^116heSpA] [^1173UKgM].

> Wait, let me verify emergent indications before anything else, because sepsis, acute kidney injury, severe electrolyte derangements, and uremic complications compel urgent decompression regardless of oncologic prognosis; contemporary data in malignant ureteric obstruction report sepsis in about 9% and AKI in over half of patients, underscoring the need for prompt resuscitation, antibiotics if infected, and rapid urinary diversion when these are present [^115m2Ywk].

> I need to check the initial workup to avoid missing staging or reversible precipitants; this should include serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood count, urinalysis with culture if infection is suspected, and cross-sectional imaging to define obstruction and stage disease; for newly diagnosed patients with high-risk features, guideline-concordant staging with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus a bone scan is recommended to guide management decisions and anticipate complications of metastatic disease [^111fxeM1].

> Next, I should review decompression options for ureteral obstruction and weigh patient-centered tradeoffs; retrograde ureteral stents and percutaneous nephrostomy both palliate obstruction, restore renal function in a meaningful subset, and enable systemic therapy, but survival benefit remains uncertain and decisions should incorporate tools like the Scottish MUO Score to frame prognosis and burdens of care [^115m2Ywk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality equivalence without checking symptomatic profiles; prospective palliative data show quality-of-life scores are broadly similar across nephrostomy, internal double-J stents, and nephroureteral stents over 7 to 90 days, but double-J stents tend to cause more urinary symptoms and pain while requiring longer fluoroscopy time, whereas nephrostomies incur more frequent minor tube-related issues requiring exchanges, all of which should be discussed during shared decision-making [^116RVS8T].

> I should confirm how age and selection bias influence access and outcomes, because older patients are less likely to undergo ureteral stenting and observational cohorts suggest higher mortality among those receiving nephrostomies versus no intervention, findings that likely reflect confounding by indication and underscore the importance of individualized, goals-of-care–aligned choices rather than assuming a mortality signal is causally related to the device itself [^117Y8u5J].

> For bladder outlet obstruction at the prostate/bladder neck, let me consider palliative options carefully; transurethral resection of the prostate remains an established decompressive approach in advanced prostate cancer, and photoselective laser vaporization has also shown symptom and flow improvements in small series of older patients with advanced disease when anesthetic risk or bleeding risk is a concern, while a suprapubic catheter is reasonable when surgical risk or life expectancy precludes endoscopic intervention [^1165fZbi] [^112zMGe2].

> Wait, I should double-check medication cautions in this setting; anticholinergics with antimuscarinic effects can precipitate urinary retention and are contraindicated in obstructive uropathy for certain agents such as methscopolamine and hyoscyamine, so they should be avoided or used only with extreme caution and a clear decompression plan in place; I initially thought there was an FDA black box warning, but let me verify and correct that — these are formal contraindications, not boxed warnings, which still mandates avoidance in true outlet obstruction until safely decompressed [^112pegA8] [^115RCGkG] [^114CPhEV].

> I will now examine how hormonal status and laterality of obstruction inform prognosis and urgency; retrospective data suggest median survival after nephrostomy is longer in hormone-naïve patients than in hormone-responsive or hormone-resistant disease, and bilateral obstruction portends worse survival than unilateral disease, which should be transparently discussed to align intervention intensity with expected benefit and patient preferences [^115yuXWh].

> Next, I should review stage-directed systemic therapy, because in symptomatic metastatic patients, immediate androgen deprivation therapy is recommended to palliate symptoms and reduce the risk of serious sequelae such as spinal cord compression, fractures, and ureteral obstruction; in those with impending complications, starting with an LHRH antagonist or orchiectomy provides rapid and reliable castration, and for castration-sensitive metastatic disease treatment intensification with apalutamide is recommended regardless of disease volume when the patient is fit [^115m2Ywk] [^115GtWP8] [^115bNmYh].

> But wait, what if this is high-risk localized disease rather than metastatic; I should confirm the staging before assuming systemic-first therapy, since selected patients with organ-confined or locally advanced high-risk disease and adequate life expectancy may be candidates for curative-intent approaches such as radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, although the presence of obstructive uropathy at diagnosis more often signals advanced disease requiring initial systemic palliation and decompression rather than upfront curative surgery [^111pBa7o] [^111fxeM1].

> I need to ensure the broader prognostic context is clear; obstructive uropathy in advanced prostate cancer has been associated with reduced overall survival compared to similar patients without obstruction, and it often co-segregates with higher stage and androgen-insensitive biology, which emphasizes early identification and management to preserve renal function and allow access to systemic therapies that may prolong life or improve quality of life [^113X2MEk].

> Let me think about how to structure the goals-of-care discussion with the patient and family; beyond survival, the actionable benefits of diversion include symptom palliation and renal recovery sufficient to receive oncologic therapy, but device-related burdens, procedure frequency, and expected symptom profiles should be reviewed up front using the evidence on stent- versus nephrostomy-related QoL and procedure characteristics to match modality to patient values and home supports [^116RVS8T] [^115m2Ywk].

> Next, I should review monitoring after intervention; early reassessment of renal function allows timely planning of systemic therapy, and repeating symptom and QoL assessments at roughly 7, 30, and 90 days mirrors the time points reported in palliative stent/nephrostomy literature and can surface device-specific problems needing attention; ongoing oncologic surveillance with PSA and interval imaging should follow guideline-directed care paths for the disease state once decompression enables treatment [^116RVS8T] [^115bNmYh].

> Hold on, I should verify device care logistics to prevent avoidable complications; nephrostomy tubes and internal stents require planned maintenance and exchanges, and coordination with interventional radiology or urology for routine checks and timely exchanges can reduce infection, blockage, and emergency visits, which should be explicitly arranged before discharge to the community [^117G9Hwr].

> I will now examine special urological considerations that affect outcomes after bladder outlet relief; bladder dysfunction related to chronic outlet obstruction can persist even after technically successful de-obstruction, with detrusor overactivity or underactivity contributing to residual storage and voiding symptoms in a substantial minority, so preoperative counseling and, when indicated, urodynamic assessment may refine expectations and downstream management of persistent LUTS [^112vFU13] [^1117ziY4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should address a frequent misconception underlying presentations; most prostate cancers arise in the peripheral zone and are asymptomatic from a urinary standpoint, whereas LUTS usually reflect central gland enlargement from benign hypertrophy, explaining why PSA density outperforms PSA alone for cancer prediction and why obstructive symptoms at diagnosis more commonly signify concurrent benign obstruction or advanced disease rather than early cancer per se [^112yoT7r].

> Let me reconsider scenarios where deferring intervention might be appropriate; in patients with a very limited prognosis, minimal symptoms, and no emergent indications like sepsis or life-threatening AKI, it is reasonable to avoid invasive decompression after a careful shared decision-making conversation that weighs the modest and uncertain survival impact against the procedural burdens and device maintenance demands in the context of overall goals [^115m2Ywk] [^116RVS8T].

> To synthesize the pathway, I should confirm a practical sequence that keeps the patient safe and preserves options; stabilize and treat sepsis or AKI urgently, obtain staging imaging and labs to define disease extent and mechanism of obstruction, perform decompression tailored to ureteral versus bladder outlet involvement with modality chosen by anatomy, feasibility, and patient preferences, initiate immediate ADT with rapid castration strategy in metastatic symptomatic disease and add treatment intensification when appropriate, and schedule structured follow-up for renal recovery, device care, symptoms, and oncologic response while keeping the patient's goals front and center throughout [^114LmN5i] [^115GtWP8] [^115bNmYh] [^115m2Ywk] [^116RVS8T].

Management of obstructive uropathy from newly diagnosed prostate cancer requires rapid relief of obstruction [^114LmN5i] and immediate androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [^115GtWP8] to prevent renal damage and stabilize disease. Initial decompression is by urethral catheterization for retention or ureteric stenting/percutaneous nephrostomy for hydronephrosis [^115m2Ywk]; if stenting fails, use nephrostomy [^117G9Hwr]. Start ADT promptly with an LHRH antagonist or orchiectomy [^114LmN5i], and add an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor for high-risk or metastatic disease [^115bNmYh]. Palliative TURP [^1165fZbi] or laser vaporization [^112zMGe2] is reserved for persistent obstruction after medical therapy [^111pBa7o]. Monitor renal function, electrolytes, and PSA, and coordinate multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes.

---

## Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

A prompt and thorough evaluation is essential to confirm obstruction, assess severity, and guide intervention [^114LmN5i].

- **Clinical assessment**: Document urinary symptoms, retention, flank pain, hematuria [^114LmN5i], and systemic signs (e.g. sepsis, renal failure) [^113rq75N].

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes, PSA [^114LmN5i], and urinalysis [^117ET38w].

- **Imaging studies**: Use renal ultrasound or CT to detect hydronephrosis [^114LmN5i], obstruction level, and renal impairment; MRI may help delineate local disease extent [^1173UKgM].

- **Urodynamic studies**: Consider when detrusor dysfunction [^115cXjTM] is suspected or to distinguish obstruction from detrusor underactivity [^116Qkow2].

---

## Immediate management of acute urinary retention

Acute retention requires urgent decompression to prevent renal injury and relieve symptoms. Urethral catheterization is first-line for acute retention, using a 16–18 Fr Foley catheter, with suprapubic catheterization if urethral catheterization fails or is contraindicated. Tamsulosin or alfuzosin [^113SNUGs] can improve catheter-free voiding after decompression.

---

## Management of upper urinary tract obstruction (hydronephrosis)

Hydronephrosis from prostate cancer requires timely decompression [^115m2Ywk] to preserve renal function.

- **Ureteric stenting**: Preferred initial approach; retrograde stenting is less invasive and maintains internal drainage [^117G9Hwr].

- **Percutaneous nephrostomy**: Use when stenting fails or is not feasible; effective but with higher morbidity and quality-of-life impact.

- **Choice of intervention**: Base on obstruction severity, patient comorbidities, life expectancy, and preferences [^117Y8u5J].

---

## Systemic therapy for prostate cancer

Systemic therapy is essential to reduce tumor burden and prevent further obstruction [^114LmN5i].

- **Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)**: Start immediately with LHRH antagonists (e.g. degarelix, relugolix) [^115GtWP8] or orchiectomy in impending complications (e.g. obstruction).

- **Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors**: Add abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide [^115bNmYh] for high-risk or metastatic disease [^114LmN5i].

- **Chemotherapy**: Docetaxel for high-volume or aggressive disease [^114LmN5i].

---

## Surgical interventions for persistent obstruction

Surgery is indicated for persistent obstruction despite medical therapy [^111pBa7o]. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) [^1165fZbi] is effective for relieving obstruction in advanced prostate cancer. Laser vaporization [^112zMGe2] is an alternative with favorable outcomes and lower morbidity. Open or robotic prostatectomy may be considered in selected patients with localized disease and significant obstruction [^116ZkMhG].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is critical to detect recurrence and complications early. Monitor renal function with periodic serum creatinine and eGFR, and use ultrasound or CT [^1173UKgM] to assess hydronephrosis and obstruction. Track PSA to monitor disease progression and treatment response [^114LmN5i], and assess quality of life to address urinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and psychological impact [^111KRWec].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and patient-centered approach

A multidisciplinary approach improves outcomes and quality of life [^111pBa7o]. Urologists lead diagnostic evaluation and surgical management, oncologists guide systemic therapy and disease control, and radiologists provide imaging and interventional support. Palliative care specialists manage symptoms and enhance quality of life [^116RVS8T]. Shared decision-making ensures patient involvement to align care with preferences and goals.

---

## Prognostic implications

Obstructive uropathy in prostate cancer signals advanced disease and worse survival [^113X2MEk], especially with androgen-insensitive tumors. Early detection and prompt management can improve outcomes and quality of life.

---

Management of obstructive uropathy from newly diagnosed prostate cancer centers on rapid decompression and immediate ADT [^114LmN5i], with escalation to stenting, nephrostomy, or surgery as needed. Coordinated multidisciplinary care and close monitoring are essential to preserve renal function, control disease, and maintain quality of life [^116RVS8T].

Decision-making in this area is complex, and a rationale for intervention for palliation remains in certain patients even when survival is expected to be poor. Potential immediately life-threatening indications, including sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI), were present in 9.4% and 57.6% of the patients, respectively, where intervention may be justified in the face of imminent death, even with the prospect of poor oncological outcomes. Indeed, although most patients did not have a significant improvement in renal function, there was a sizeable proportion of patients in this cohort with an arguably life-threatening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 15 mL per min per 1.73 m² who showed an improvement to over 45 mL per min per 1.73 m². However, an understanding of the survival benefit with intervention is important. Understanding potential benefits allows patient-centred discussion of the balance of risks and benefits, particularly in view of the morbidity associated with intervention. Even among teams unfamiliar with the individual patient, the Scottish MUO Score can aid this discussion. Although the proportion of patients in this cohort who received further oncological treatment is similar to that in previous reports, the data do not allow assessment of quality-of-life or outcomes without intervention, which is the subject of an ongoing prospective study.

Comorbidity detection: The following comorbidities were included in this study: diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM code 250.xx), hypertension (ICD-9-CM codes 401.xx–405.xx), dyslipidemia (ICD-9-CM code 272.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ICD-9-CM codes 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496.xx), Parkinson disease (ICD-9-CM code 332.xx), chronic renal disease or renal failure (ICD-9-CM codes 584.xx and 585.xx), ischemic heart disease (ICD-9-CM codes 410.xx–414.xx), stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 430.xx–437.xx), and heart failure (ICD-9-CM 428.xx). The presence of a comorbidity was ascertained when there was at least one claim of inpatient admission or two claims of outpatient visits one year prior to the index date.

Outcome detection: The outcomes compared in this study were urinary tract infection (UTI) and urinary retention (UR). UTI was defined as hospitalization or an emergency department or outpatient visit with a UTI-related diagnosis (ICD-9-CM codes 599.0× and 595.0×) and antibiotic prescription. UR was defined as the occurrence of either an intermittent catheterization or indwelling Foley catheterization. Other geriatric adverse events that were compared included inguinal hernia (Taiwan NHI codes 75606B, 75607C, 75613C, 75614C, and 75610B), hemorrhoids (Taiwan NHI codes 74406C, 74407C, 74410C, 74411C, 74412C, and 74417C), stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 430.xx–437.xx), and acute myocardial infarction (ICD-9-CM code 410.xx). We also compared the incidence of emergent bone fracture, which was defined as visiting the emergency department or hospitalization with a principal diagnosis of skeletal fracture.

### Do functional changes occur in the bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction? - ICI-RS 2018 [^112vFU13]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Low credibility.

Most studies on functional-urodynamic changes in the bladder as a result of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) have been conducted in aging males with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). Other prevalent causes of BOO include bladder neck obstruction (BNO), posterior urethral valves (PUV), and urethral strictures (US). Conceptually, bladder dysfunction (BD) might be induced by BOO but could alternatively be pre-existing; a combination of these factors might also be possible. BPO- or BOO-associated BD has been classified as follows: (a) detrusor overactivity (DO) with or without reduced bladder compliance, (b) detrusor underactivity (DU), or (c) a mixed pattern. BD is clinically relevant since it persists in up to one-third of men after transurethral resection of the prostate.

This leads to several questions:

1. How might BOO lead to BD, and what are its structural, histological, and biochemical backgrounds?
2. Is BD reversible after treatment of BOO, and if so, is this always the case? In other words, can the detrusor recover after treatment?
3. If detrusor function does not recover, why is this? Is there a certain period of exposure to BOO that predisposes one to non-recovery or decompensation of the bladder? And if so, how can this point of no return be characterized? Or is decompensation mainly related to acute or acute-on-chronic retention?

Is the age of onset of BOO relevant? Are any clinical mitigating factors involved?

These are the proceedings of the Think Tank: "Do functional changes occur in the bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction?"

### Racial disparities in the use of palliative therapy for ureteral obstruction among elderly patients with advanced prostate cancer [^117Y8u5J]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Palliative issues are an important but understudied aspect for patients with advanced cancer. Ureteral obstruction, a complication of advanced prostate cancer, is usually alleviated with the placement of a retrograde ureteral stent (RUS) or percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) to palliate symptoms associated with obstructive uropathy and/or renal failure. This study investigates predictors of the receipt of RUS and PCN and their association with survival for older patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, patients aged 65 or older with stage IV (n = 10,848) or recurrent (n = 7,872) prostate cancer were identified. A multivariable analysis was employed to compare those with ureteral obstruction treated with RUS or PCN to those not treated, and to analyze the association between RUS, PCN, and survival.

Sixteen percent (n = 2,958) of the sample developed ureteral obstruction. Compared to no treatment, African Americans were more likely to undergo placement of PCN [odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–2.13] than Whites, but were equally likely to receive a stent. Subjects over 80 years old were less likely to undergo RUS (ages 80–84, 0.41, 95% CI 0.27–0.63; ages ≥ 85, 0.30, 95% CI 0.16–0.54) compared to patients aged 65–69 years. Subjects who received a PCN were 55% more likely to die than those who were untreated. There was no difference in survival among those receiving RUS compared to untreated. Nine percent of subjects received either RUS or PCN within 30 days of dying.

### Obstructive uropathy secondary to metastasis from carcinoma of the breast [^113Kk7gr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Obstructive uropathy secondary to malignant ureteral strictures is rare, with carcinoma of the breast accounting for less than 2% of cases. We present the case of a woman in her late 50s with a history of breast cancer who developed bilateral ureteral obstruction. She presented with bilateral flank pain, vomiting, fever, and reduced urine output, with a serum creatinine of 12mg/dL. Imaging showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis leading to percutaneous nephrostomy placement. Further investigation confirmed metastatic breast cancer causing ureteral strictures. The patient was treated with palliative radiotherapy.

This case highlights the importance of considering malignant causes in patients with a history of cancer presenting with obstructive uropathy, emphasizing the need for thorough diagnostic workup, including fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans, to guide appropriate management and avoid unnecessary surgical interventions. Early urinary diversion and targeted therapy are crucial for symptom relief and disease control.

### Nephrostomies in obstructive uropathy; how should hormone resistant prostate cancer patients be managed and can we predict who will benefit [^115yuXWh]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Use of nephrostomies in hormone-naive patients with obstructive uropathy is advocated, whereas hormone-resistant patients require an individual approach. Patients undergoing a nephrostomy for uropathy were retrospectively analyzed, with a particular focus on hormone status and blood levels. Over a 46-month period, 26 out of 112 nephrostomies were performed for prostate cancer-induced uropathy. Survival was 226.5 days for hormone-naive patients, 114.3 days for the responsive group, and 100.2 days if resistant. Bilateral cases survived 72.1 days versus 157.6 days for unilateral patients. All patients should be considered for nephrostomy regardless of their hormone status.

### Physical activity for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction [^112ELiZk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in men. Physical activity might represent a viable first-line intervention for treating LUTS/BPO.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of physical activity for lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO).

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP); checked the reference lists of retrieved articles; and handsearched abstract proceedings of conferences with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status from database inception to 6 November 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included published and unpublished randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials that included men diagnosed with LUTS/BPO. We excluded studies in which medical history suggested non-BPO causes of LUTS or prior invasive therapies to physical activity or that used electrical stimulation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We assessed primary outcomes (symptom score for LUTS; response rate, defined as a 20% improvement in symptom score; withdrawal due to adverse events) and secondary outcomes (change of medication use; need for an invasive procedure; postvoid residual urine). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included six st

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: An analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^1121KemT]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

In summary, a multitude of guidelines for the surgical treatment of LUTS/BPO is available. They largely agree on established therapies backed by a substantial body of evidence but also exhibit relevant discrepancies. These differences may not only indicate gaps in evidence but also the need for clearer criteria regarding the evidence required for a guideline recommendation of novel treatments. The plethora of treatment options facilitates more patient-oriented therapy. However, this also means that guidelines should pay more attention to systematic representation of patient factors, such as comorbidities, anticoagulation status, and desire to preserve ejaculation. Our consensus algorithm not only facilitates a quick overview of different scenarios but also highlights areas of agreement and discrepancy among key guidelines, aiding urologists in decision-making and patient counseling.

### Urinary obstruction in prostate cancer patients from the Dutch trial (68 Gy vs. 78 Gy): Relationships with local dose, acute effects, and baseline characteristics [^114HZht8]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2010). Low credibility.

To investigate the relationship between late urinary obstruction and the details of the dose distribution in irradiated prostate cancer patients, researchers considered baseline symptoms and acute complaints.

We selected patients from the Dutch multicenter trial randomized between 68 Gy and 78 Gy, for whom toxicity data and dose data were available (n = 557). The absolute dose surface parameters of the delineated bladder were calculated. Next, we constructed three-dimensional dose maps of the area around the prostate, providing an approximate identification of the corresponding anatomic locations. The dose difference maps were constructed by subtracting the mean dose maps of the patients with and without late urinary obstruction. Selected local dose points were analyzed using Cox regression analysis.

Urinary obstruction was scored for 40 patients, including 19 of 296 patients who received 68–72 Gy and 21 of 261 patients who received 76–78 Gy. A total of 19 events occurred within 2 years after irradiation and 21 events after 2 years. The bladder surface receiving ≥ 80 Gy predicted (p < .01) the occurrence of obstruction within 2 years. The dose difference map indicated highly significant differences in the bladder neck situated in the trigonal region (p < .001), which were especially predictive of obstruction after 2 years and of the diagnosis of bladder neck obstruction. Baseline complaints and transurethral resection of the prostate, along with acute complaints, were mainly predictive of obstruction within 2 years.

In conclusion, relativel…

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: an analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^112SW85h]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms supposed secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO) are among the most prevalent conditions in older males. Surgical treatment is usually recommended if pharmacotherapy fails, is not well tolerated, or when BPO-related complications arise. Surgical options can also be used at an earlier stage following a thorough joint decision has been made. As established surgical therapies have drawbacks and the threshold for surgical treatment seems to have become much lower with the implementation of minimally invasive treatments (MITs), LUTS/BPO surgery has become an economically significant area. Consequently, novel therapeutic devices and procedures are being developed at an unprecedented rate.

The rapid adoption of new surgical techniques is influenced by a range of factors, including patient demand, competitive healthcare dynamics, and regulatory pathways that are often less stringent than those applied to pharmaceuticals. Consequently, some interventions may enter clinical use before a comprehensive evidence base is available. A comprehensive understanding of the array of procedures, including their benefits and risks, safety profiles, and ideal indications, is essential for successful, individualized treatment. However, for physicians not deeply specialized in the field, staying abreast of these developments can be challenging. Clinical guidelines provide critical support in this context.

Nonetheless, guidelines are not without their limitations. The required level of evidence for recommending novel treatments is not uniformly defined…

### Are there specific health-related factors that can accentuate the risk of suicide among men with prostate cancer [^111KRWec]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014).

Although the degree of disease progress is central to symptom-giving and disease-related health problems, prostate cancer (PCa) can cause hematuria, urinary obstruction, and edema from regional lymphatic obstruction, pain from bone metastasis, sexual dysfunction, and impaired bowel function. It can also cause general physical impairments and impairment in playing social roles. Not only the disease but also its treatment can cause health problems. Treatments such as androgen deprivation, radical prostatectomy, and radiotherapy cause urinary, bowel, or sexual dysfunction. Although the frequency, duration, and severity of these treatment-related health problems can vary from one treatment option to the other, no conclusive evidence has been found that could make one treatment option better than the other.

The diagnosis, as well as disease- and treatment-related health problems, can affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of men with PCa. HRQoL in PCa can also be influenced by factors such as tumor level, time elapsed since diagnosis, individual factors such as educational level and social background, age at diagnosis, and treatment type. For example, patients with stage I tumor exhibited higher HRQoL scores compared to those with tumor stage IV. Men with advanced PCa face severe and several health- and treatment-related problems compared with men with localized PCa. Research has shown that after baseline similarities with controls (i.e. men without PCa diagnosis), men with PCa experienced significant deteriorations in physical, mental, and social aspects of their lives.

### Urinary symptoms and prostate cancer-the misconception that may be preventing earlier presentation and better survival outcomes [^113PTW1x]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The relationship between male urinary symptoms and prostate cancer presents a conundrum: is there a causality, association, or no link at all? For decades, symptoms, particularly lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), have been recommended as indicators to look for possible cancer. However, uncovering the origins and evidence of this linkage is challenging. The notion of 'urinary symptoms as a sign of prostate cancer' is commonly promoted by the media and included in information from national guidelines and charities to encourage men to get tested.

Although many official sites mention that most prostate cancers may not cause symptoms, they prominently list several urinary symptoms to monitor. This stems from the belief that prostate cancer may manifest with symptoms such as slow urinary flow, frequency, or nocturia, which should prompt a visit to the GP for testing to exclude cancer. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) distinguishes between patients with and without symptoms when managing suspected prostate cancer. For example, they have recently reviewed the evidence base for PSA thresholds but only in the 'symptomatic' population. Much of this distinction is based on studies in primary care referral practices of symptomatic men.

The widely used QCancer® tool, developed using data from over 2 million men presenting to GPs, considers urinary retention, frequency, urgency, and impotence as predictors of a diagnosis. However, PSA is not part of the model, and there is no detail on the stage of cancers found.

Regarding the medical management of prostate cancer, particularly in the context of castration-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic hormonal therapy, the AUA/SUO 2023 guidelines recommend offering continued androgen deprivation therapy with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, docetaxel, or enzalutamide. This is advised for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not received prior androgen receptor pathway inhibitors.

### The Lancet commission on prostate cancer: Planning for the surge in cases [^111pBa7o]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Surgery plays a crucial role in various aspects of prostate cancer management, including diagnosis (e.g. biopsy, staging examinations), treatment (such as palliative procedures like transurethral resection of the prostate and orchiectomy), and alleviating urinary outflow obstruction and hydronephrosis. Radical prostatectomy is widely practiced in high-income countries (HICs) for treating localized prostate cancer. For patients with clinically significant localized prostate cancer and a good life expectancy (i.e. more than 10 years), management with curative intent using either surgical approaches or radiotherapy is recommended.

The most important determinant of favorable outcomes (i.e. long survival with minimal side effects) after surgery is the surgeon and center's level of experience. Low surgical volumes are associated with high operative mortality. Robot-assisted surgery has gained popularity in HICs and its outcomes are largely similar to those after open surgery. In light of findings from the ProtecT study, which indicated that 15-year prostate cancer-specific survival did not differ among men diagnosed after PSA testing and whose initial disease was managed with surgery, radiotherapy, or initial surveillance, there is a pressing need to better define who actually benefits from surgery. Based on available evidence, radical prostatectomy appears to offer only a small increase in survival compared to more conservative non-surgical approaches, and this benefit is primarily limited to men with a long life expectancy.

### Benign prostate hyperplasia: A review of the year's progress from bench to clinic [^111Muqx8]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Therapeutic tools for classic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have focused on the dynamic component of obstruction and/or elimination of the static component via surgical or pharmaceutical therapies. Unfortunately, an exact cause for this disease process has not been identified, but additional insight has been achieved. This article presents an update of the BPH literature with a special focus on basic science or translational studies concerned with the cause of clinically significant BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Investigators are exploring connections between BPH with clinically significant LUTS, the metabolic syndrome, inflammation, alterations in cell signaling, and genetics, which have provided additional information concerning pathogenesis and medical as well as surgical therapies.

BPH is a chronic, progressive disease with important care implications and financial risks to the healthcare system. Continued improvements in length of life will demand that we unlock the cause of LUTS secondary to BPH with the goal of prevention as the ideal therapy. Studies reported in the last year have contributed to our understanding of the disease process and provide insight for additional studies.

### Modeling study of the effect of placebo and medical therapy on storage and voiding symptoms, nocturia, and quality of life in men with prostate enlargement at risk for progression [^112sQmaP]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines provide clear recommendations for assessing men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) as a result of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). These guidelines have two main objectives: to establish a differential diagnosis — since the origin of LUTS in men is multifactorial — and to define the clinical profile, which includes risk of disease progression, such as higher prostate volume (PV), higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, advanced age, higher post-void residual volume (PVR), and lower urinary flow. This helps provide personalized and appropriate care.

Men with LUTS/BPE can be affected by voiding, storage, and post-micturition symptoms. Voiding symptoms are thought to arise from urethral obstruction, often as a result of BPE. Storage symptoms, including nocturia, are often seen in men with overactive bladder (OAB) and BPE and result from altered smooth muscle structure and function in the bladder and prostate. Both voiding and storage symptoms cause distress and impair quality of life (QoL). Notably, nocturia is among the most frequently reported and bothersome symptoms and is a major cause of physician consultations in men with LUTS/BPE. LUTS/BPE can progress to worsening symptoms and complications, such as acute urinary retention (AUR) and BPE-related surgery. Therefore, a treatment approach that targets the underlying disease mechanism and improves different symptom types, as well as reduces the risk of AUR and surgery, would be advantageous.

### De-obstruction of bladder outlet in humans reverses organ remodelling by normalizing the expression of key transcription factors [^1117ziY4]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia can, independent of prostate size, cause bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in elderly males, termed benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). BPO is a dynamic chronic process accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including storage symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and nocturia and voiding symptoms such as weak stream, delayed or intermittent voiding, and incomplete emptying. Moderate to severe LUTS are found in approximately 25% of men aged 40 to 49 and in 50% aged 70 to 79. After exhausting less invasive medical treatment options, patients are offered surgical treatment, for example, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) to de-obstruct the bladder outlet. Although voiding parameters significantly improve, 20 to 40% of patients continue to experience at least some bothersome LUTS, inciting further research into the factors contributing to BPO-induced bladder dysfunction. Specifically, identifying the men at risk of irreparable bladder damage due to BPO and optimal timing of de-obstruction surgery are paramount to avoid loss of bladder function. Limited evidence from human studies and animal models, summarized in a recent report, supports the notion that BPO gradually progresses from inflammation to hypertrophy to fibrosis. BPO-induced bladder remodeling includes initial bladder hypertrophy during the compensated stage characterized by increased detrusor contractility/pressure during voiding and can be accompanied by detrusor overactivity (DO). This ultimately can lead to a loss of bladder function.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on obstructive voiding symptoms secondary to prostate disease [^1173UKgM]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Obstructive voiding symptoms are most commonly due to prostatic hyperplasia, but other causes include bladder neck contractures, prostatic carcinomas, neurogenic bladder, and urethral stricture. Symptoms include hesitancy, dribbling, decreased force of stream, and postvoid fullness. Imaging is useful in evaluating the presence and degree of hydronephrosis, estimation of renal function, evaluation of the bladder and prostate, and detection of incidental upper tract malignancies or stones. Various modalities have been used for evaluation of the cause of obstruction. Literature on the indications and usefulness of these radiologic studies for obstructive voiding symptoms in different clinical settings is reviewed.

Regarding the medical management of prostate cancer, particularly the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer, the CUA/CUOG 2022 guidelines emphasize the importance of recognizing patients who do not respond to first-line androgen deprivation therapy or those who progress clinically or radiologically without significant PSA elevations. These patients may exhibit neuroendocrine differentiation. It is recommended to consider performing a biopsy of accessible lesions to identify such patients. For treatment, offer combination chemotherapy, such as cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/etoposide, to these patients.

### Urinary symptoms and prostate cancer-the misconception that may be preventing earlier presentation and better survival outcomes [^113DNUKi]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

**Prostate cancer and gland size**: Bladder outlet obstruction, most often due to benign prostate enlargement, manifests symptomatically as difficulty with flow, hesitancy, nocturia, and poor stream. These are the most common symptoms causing a man to visit his GP and undergo a PSA test. The relationship between prostate size and cancer has been extensively explored since the earliest days of routine PSA and biopsies. Karakieweiz et al. were among the first to report that mean prostate volume was lower in men found to have prostate cancer compared to those with benign biopsies. Since then, other studies have reported identical findings. A meta-analysis compiled by Moolupuri et al. found that 28 out of 30 studies showed a clear inverse relationship between prostate size and the chance of finding prostate cancer at biopsy. The remaining 2 studies were equivocal, and none showed a positive correlation. This relationship is so strong that PSA density (PSA corrected for prostate volume) is now well known to be significantly more accurate than PSA in predicting a positive biopsy and is used in everyday clinical practice. In an elegant computer simulation, Lorenzo et al. postulated that an enlarged prostate could cause mechanical suppression of tumor growth, which may explain the inverse size relationship with cancer detection.

### Prostate cancer outcomes in France: treatments, adverse effects and two-year mortality [^117KLkrX]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

This study demonstrated a very high rate of PCa treatment-related adverse effects. Over a 2-year period, treatments for urinary and erectile disorders were reported in 19% and 21% of all men with newly diagnosed PCa, respectively. These rates were even higher among men aged 50–54 years (20% and 47%) and among men of all ages who had undergone prostatectomy (24% and 61%). In contrast with studies on urinary disorders and erectile dysfunction based on the presence of symptoms or quality of life assessment, using various definitions and instruments, in the present study, these disorders were estimated on the basis of health care consumption. These estimates depend on the patient's perception of the disorder, the efficacy of treatment of the disorder, and the physician's or surgeon's impression.

These adverse effect rates, although underestimated, can nevertheless be considered to accurately reflect the impact of PCa treatments on quality of life. Specific health care consumption was very rare in the control group without PCa and who had not undergone BPH surgery. As expected, treatment rates for acute urinary retention and urinary disorders were higher among controls that had undergone BPH surgery. Higher rates of treatment for acute urinary retention were observed in men with untreated PCa compared to men with treated PCa, which may be linked to tumour progression. As also reported in quality of life studies, lower rates of adverse effects were observed after external beam radiotherapy than after prostatectomy. In our study, surgery for incontinence during the two years following…

### Role of urodynamic studies in management of benign prostatic obstruction: A guide for interventional radiologists [^112aGauJ]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Urodynamic testing is the most accurate representation of bladder outlet obstruction physiology. As prostate artery embolization becomes an increasingly common therapy for benign prostatic obstruction, knowledge of urodynamic assessment and reports can assist the interventional radiologist in selecting appropriate patients. This review summarizes the role of urodynamic studies in the management of benign prostatic obstruction, including patient selection, interpretation of urodynamic studies, and their potential to predict patient outcomes.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care: What you need to know [^111Tca3G]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed recent literature and treatment guidelines regarding the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as well as the management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH.

Published literature and treatment concepts were reviewed regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for BPO. BPH is a histological diagnosis that can contribute to medical problems, including enlargement of the prostate and BPO. These conditions should be treated only if the symptoms are troublesome, there is a considerable risk of progression, or cancer is suspected. Very effective medical and surgical options are available to treat BPO and improve patient quality of life.

BPO is highly treatable but should be managed in close collaboration with the patient. Pharmacological agents and minimally invasive procedures, when appropriate, are generally preferred to more invasive surgery. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms usually can be treated by a primary care physician; more complicated cases should be referred to a urologist for evaluation and management.

### Detrusor underactivity in men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic obstruction: Characterization and potential impact on indications for surgical treatment of the prostate [^115cXjTM]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Detrusor underactivity is a highly prevalent type of voiding dysfunction in men, responsible for residual urine and decreased voiding efficiency. Patients with detrusor underactivity often have unfavorable outcomes after prostatic surgery and do not show better long-term results than untreated detrusor underactivity patients. Therefore, differentiating between detrusor underactivity and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is crucial for predicting the outcome of prostatic surgery.

Patients with detrusor underactivity report more frequent issues such as decreased or interrupted urinary flow, hesitancy, the feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, and/or decreased bladder sensation compared with men with normal pressure-flow studies. Determination and differentiation between detrusor underactivity and BOO are only possible through pressure-flow studies. Threshold values for diagnosing detrusor underactivity must be adjusted to the BOO-grade. A nomogram using the BOO-index and maximum Watts factor is currently the most advanced tool for diagnosing detrusor underactivity and/or BOO; values below the 25th percentile line indicate detrusor underactivity. It is desirable to establish tests for noninvasive diagnosis of detrusor underactivity. The combination of ultrasound detrusor wall thickness and bladder capacity can reliably detect detrusor underactivity.

Careful assessment of voiding dysfunction to discriminate between detrusor underactivity and BOO, preferably through pressure-flow studies, can avoid unsuccessful prostate surgery and aid in counseling patients.

### Primary bladder neck obstruction in men-new perspectives in physiopathology [^113S8igM]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The hypothesized relationship between infection, inflammation, and the development of primary bladder neck obstruction is illustrated by changes from the normal bladder neck, initial inflammatory changes during prostatitis, and the evolution of chronic prostatitis. Continuous collagen deposition and underlying chronic inflammation lead to bladder neck obstruction.

These observations have significant clinical value, providing a comprehensive and precise diagnostic framework, especially in young individuals experiencing pelvic pain and voiding and storage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) despite having small prostate volumes. The authors suggest that an accurate diagnosis could facilitate timely treatment proposals aimed at halting symptomatic progression or, in some instances, reversing inflammation and collagen deposition, thereby limiting the risk of future obstruction.

### Urinary symptoms and prostate cancer-the misconception that may be preventing earlier presentation and better survival outcomes [^1156CyNj]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

We therefore call on guideline bodies, charities, and the media to take urgent action to review the public messaging and referral recommendations. Paramount is to abolish the public messaging suggesting that prostate cancer directly causes urinary symptoms. Maintaining this fallacy is misleading. Efforts should instead be made to raise awareness that prostate cancer does not manifest with urinary symptoms.

We are not advocating for an immediate screening program, nor are we asking to change already existing pathways (e.g. serendipitous investigation of men seeing primary care doctors for urinary symptoms). We recognize that this remains an important route for detection, particularly for men who may not access health information resources or are in hard-to-reach socio-demographic groups. For many of these men, the only reason to see a doctor is if they are experiencing bothersome symptoms.

However, if men were aware that the absence of symptoms does not mean the absence of cancer, more men might be inclined to undertake tests. This could lead to more tumors being identified at an earlier stage and reduce the number of men experiencing late presentations with incurable disease. Eventually, we hope for the development of an intelligent tiered screening program. Until then, a simple change in message to correct years of misinformation would be a strong starting point.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms in elderly men: Considerations for prostate cancer testing [^112zYydP]. The Prostate (2024). Low credibility.

Both lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and prostate cancer (PCa) are common in elderly men. While LUTS are generally due to a benign etiology, they may provoke an evaluation with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which can lead to a cascade of further testing and possible overdiagnosis in patients with competing risks. There is limited patient and provider understanding of the relationship between LUTS and PCa risk, and a lack of clarity in how to evaluate these men to balance appropriate diagnosis of aggressive PCa with avoidance of overdiagnosis.

- **Methods**: A literature review was performed using keywords to query the electronic database PubMed. All articles published before November 2023 were screened by title and abstract for relevance to our subject.

- **Results**: Epidemiological studies suggest that LUTS and PCa are largely independent in elderly men. The best available tools to assess PCa risk include PSA permutations, novel biomarkers, and imaging, but there are limitations in older men based on lack of validation in the elderly and unclear applicability of traditional definitions of "clinically significant" disease. We present a three-tiered approach to evaluating these patients.

- **Conclusion**: Elderly men commonly have LUTS as well as a high likelihood of indolent PCa. A systematic and shared decision-making-based approach can help balance the objectives of appropriate detection of phenotypically dangerous disease and avoidance of over-testing and overdiagnosis.

### Optimal PSA density threshold for prostate biopsy in benign prostatic obstruction patients with elevated PSA levels but negative MRI findings [^115unDNt]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Patient baseline data, including age, IPSS, medical treatment with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, history of bladder stones, and indwelling urinary catheters, as well as PSA levels, F/T PSA ratio, DRE, TRUS, and mpMRI findings, were collected. Since treatment with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors for more than 3 months reduces PSA levels by an average of approximately 50%, the PSA value of these patients was doubled for further analysis. For patients with prostate cancer (PCa), the Gleason score of the biopsy specimen was obtained. Prior to 2015, patients without PI-RADS V2 scoring information were individually scored by radiologists with over 5 years of experience at our hospital. The radiologists who scored using the PI-RADS V2 system were blinded to the pathological results. The prostate volume (PV) was calculated based on the mpMRI data (PV = 0.52 × anteroposterior diameter × transverse diameter × craniocaudal diameter). The PSA density (PSAD) is defined as the ratio of the PSA value to the PV.

All prostate biopsies were performed using a transrectal systematic 12-core procedure in the left lateral decubitus position under local anesthesia. BPH surgery was performed using either monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate or greenlight laser enucleation of the prostate. The histopathology of all biopsies was reported separately and analyzed by an experienced uropathologist using the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) modified classification. For BPH surgery, all the removed prostatic tissues were subjected to pathological examination.

### The role of urodynamics in the surgical management of benign prostatic obstruction [^111gyQ82]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) is a common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in elderly men. However, these symptoms are often caused by primary detrusor overactivity or underactivity. Surgical management, where BPO is absent or merely incidental, has a lower chance of success and exposes the patient to the potential complications of surgery. This review discusses the diagnostic challenges associated with this common presentation.

Most evidence comes from small, historical prospective cohort studies. A Cochrane review found only two studies that met the prespecified inclusion criteria. It concluded that while urodynamics changed decision-making regarding surgery for LUTS, it was not possible to determine whether this impacted the outcome. A systematic review of several noninvasive alternatives to urodynamics could not recommend any of them over urodynamic pressure-flow study assessment. Further research is currently in progress, including the 'UPSTREAM' study, which is a randomized, multicentre trial. Men are randomized to undergo investigation with clinical evaluation and uroflowmetry, or to additionally receive urodynamics. The primary aim is to determine the impact of urodynamics on the assessment pathway.

Assessment of BPO involves determining whether it has a contributory role in individual patients. This is crucial, as surgery can yield poor results if the symptoms are principally caused by detrusor dysfunction, whether overactivity or underactivity. Urodynamics can assist in determining this if undertaken to a suitable standard.

### Urinary symptoms and prostate cancer-the misconception that may be preventing earlier presentation and better survival outcomes [^112MrmtK]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Awaiting troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms as a trigger to consult a general practitioner about prostate cancer may potentially delay earlier diagnosis and management. There is no evidence of a causal link between prostate cancer and either prostate size or troublesome male urinary symptoms; in fact, most evidence points to an inverse correlation. Modern image-based diagnostics and risk-adapted management strategies have reduced the risks of over-investigation and overtreatment, which previously deterred greater promotion of PSA testing in men with no symptoms.

It is now timely to re-brand early, curable prostate cancer as primarily an asymptomatic disease to encourage more men to come forward and get tested earlier.

Offer the following treatment options:

- **Debulking surgery with radiotherapy**: This approach aims to reduce the tumor burden and address symptomatic relief.
- **Vertebrectomy with stabilization and radiotherapy**: This procedure provides structural support and targets the tumor with focused radiation.
- **Radiotherapy with corticosteroids**: This treatment combination is recommended for its potential to reduce inflammation and manage tumor progression effectively.

### Asymptomatic bladder stones exacerbate acute genitourinary adverse events during radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Insights from two case reports [^112npUXK]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer is among the most frequently diagnosed malignancies in men worldwide. Treatment for localized diseases typically consists of radical prostatectomy or a combination of radical radiation therapy as well as androgen deprivation therapy. Although these approaches generally yield favorable outcomes, they are often associated with complications. Genitourinary (GU) toxicities are well-documented adverse events of radiation therapy, including hematuria, dysuria, urinary retention, and increased urinary frequency. Most post-radiation therapy GU toxicities are mild (grades 1 or 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). However, acute GU toxicities classified as grade 3 or more are relatively rare but can significantly disrupt treatment.

Bladder stones are a well-recognized risk factor for urinary complications, as they can irritate the bladder mucosa and exacerbate symptoms. Although asymptomatic bladder stones are often managed conservatively based on factors such as stone size, the patient's overall condition, and the risk of complications, their presence during radiation therapy may increase the acute GU toxicities.

Here, we present two cases of prostate cancer with preexisting asymptomatic bladder stones that developed acute grade 3 GU toxicities during radiation therapy. These cases highlight the potential for untreated bladder stones to cause severe complications and emphasize the importance of proactive risk assessment and management in preventing similar outcomes.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, specifically concerning screening indications and high-risk populations, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend considering early PSA screening. This involves obtaining a baseline PSA followed by risk-adapted follow-up in males aged over 50 years, or earlier for individuals with any of the following characteristics:

- **Family history of prostate cancer**: Initiate screening for individuals older than 45 years.
- **African-Americans**: Initiate screening for individuals older than 45 years.
- **BRCA1/2 mutation carriers**: Initiate screening for individuals older than 40 years.

### Is benign prostatic obstruction surgery indicated for improving overactive bladder symptoms in men with lower urinary tract symptoms [^112xMtRh]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men are highly prevalent and include both storage and voiding symptoms in many cases. However, the effect of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) relief on storage symptoms remains unclear.

The present review summarizes data about the relationship between overactive bladder (OAB), voiding symptoms, and urodynamic characteristics in men with LUTS. Pathomechanisms of OAB in the context of BPO are reviewed. Furthermore, rates of persistent bladder dysfunction after BPO relief are described, along with predictive factors of persisting OAB.

OAB is a common clinical feature in a population of male LUTS, often concomitant with voiding symptoms. Although detrusor overactivity is found in some patients with OAB and BPO, there is no absolute correspondence between clinical symptoms and urodynamic findings. In the context of BPO, OAB pathophysiology implicates the nitric oxide pathway, bladder ischemia, aging of the urinary tract, and calcium-activated potassium channel activity. BPO relief can be followed in the medium term by the persistence of OAB symptoms, and preoperative detrusor overactivity has been identified as the main predictive factor. However, preoperative urodynamics remain only indicated in specific cases when it could directly influence clinical decision-making. Antimuscarinics may be the treatment of choice for persistent symptoms after surgery, but there is no firm recommendation in this clinical setting.

### Does this man with lower urinary tract symptoms have bladder outlet obstruction? The Rational Clinical Examination: a systematic review [^116Qkow2]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms may reduce the need for invasive testing, such as catheter placement and urodynamics. It may also facilitate early treatment to provide symptomatic relief and avoid complications.

The objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate: (1) the diagnostic accuracy of office-based tests for bladder outlet obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms, and (2) the accuracy of the bladder scan as a measure of urine volume, since management decisions rely on measuring postvoid bladder residual volumes.

- **Data sources and study selection**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1950-March 2014) were searched, along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify studies of diagnostic test accuracy among males with lower urinary tract symptoms due to bladder outlet obstruction. Additionally, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library (1950-March 2014) were searched for studies of urine volumes measured with a bladder scanner versus those measured with bladder catheterization. Prospective studies were selected if they compared one or more office-based, noninvasive diagnostic test with the reference test or were invasive urodynamic studies, and if urine volumes were measured with a bladder scanner and bladder catheterization.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: For the bladder outlet obstruction objective, 8,628 unique citations were identified, with ten studies (1,262 patients among nine unique cohorts) meeting the inclusion criteria. For the bladder scan objective, 2,254 unique citations were identified.

### Quality-of-life assessment after palliative interventions to manage malignant ureteral obstruction [^116RVS8T]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Malignancies may cause urinary tract obstruction, which is often relieved with the placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube, an internal double J nephro-ureteric stent (double J), or an internal external nephroureteral stent (NUS). We evaluated the effect of these palliative interventions on quality of life (QoL) using previously validated surveys.

Forty-six patients with malignancy-related ureteral obstruction received nephrostomy tubes (n = 16), double J stents (n = 15), or NUS (n = 15) as determined by a multidisciplinary team. QoL surveys were administered at 7, 30, and 90 days after the palliative procedure to evaluate symptoms and physical, social, functional, and emotional well-being. The number of related procedures, fluoroscopy time, and complications were documented. Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman's test were used to compare patients at 7, 30, and 90 days. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between clinical outcomes/symptoms and QoL.

Responses to QoL surveys were not significantly different for patients receiving nephrostomies, double J stents, or NUS at 7, 30, or 90 days. At 30 and 90 days there were significantly higher reported urinary symptoms and pain in those receiving double J stents compared with nephrostomies (P = 0.0035 and P = 0.0189, respectively). Significantly greater fluoroscopy time was needed for double J stent-related procedures (P = 0.0054). Nephrostomy tubes were associated with more frequent minor complications requiring additional changes.

### Bladder outlet obstruction: Etiology and evaluation [^115wgU91]. Reviews in Urology (2005). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bladder outlet obstruction:

- **Definition**: BOO is a condition characterized by an impediment to the flow of urine from the bladder to the urethra, leading to urinary retention and increased detrusor pressure.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BOO is multifactorial and can be caused by a variety of conditions, involving anatomical, neurologic, and functional etiologies. Anatomical causes include BPH, urethral stricture, urethral diverticulum, urethral caruncle, urethral leiomyoma, uterine fibroids, pelvic organ prolapse, rectal cancer, bladder cancer, and bladder stones. Neurologic causes include neurogenic bladder, and functional causes include dysfunctional voiding, primary bladder neck obstruction, and Fowler's syndrome.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence rates of LUTS due to BOO is estimated at 18.7–18.9% and 24.3–24.7% in women and men, respectively.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BOO include age, with older individuals being more susceptible, and gender, with men being more prone due to conditions like BPH. Certain medical conditions like neurological disorders can also increase the risk of BOO. Additionally, iatrogenic causes such as post-surgical retentions, for example, after anti-urinary incontinence surgery, can also contribute to the development of BOO.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, BOO can present with a range of symptoms from mild urinary frequency and urgency to severe urinary retention. Other symptoms can include a weak or interrupted urine stream, straining to urinate, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying.

### EAU guidelines on non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [^113Fjt2q]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, specifically concerning the management of urinary incontinence through surgical means, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend offering augmentation cystoplasty to patients with overactive bladder or urgency urinary incontinence who have failed all other treatment options and are able and willing to perform self-catheterization. It is essential to inform patients undergoing augmentation cystoplasty about the high risk of complications, the possibility of needing to perform clean intermittent self-catheterization, and the requirement for lifelong surveillance.

### Transurethral ethanol injection for prostatic obstruction: An excellent treatment strategy for persistent urinary retention [^113bW6ZG]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of transurethral ethanol injection into the prostate (TUEIP) for patients with persistent urinary retention resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia or advanced prostate cancer, a study was conducted involving twenty-one Japanese men. These patients, either elderly or at high anesthetic risk, had developed persistent urinary retention due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or advanced prostate cancer and were treated with TUEIP between January 2001 and January 2005.

The age range of the patients was 64 to 92 years, with a median age of 84. Their preoperative prostate volume ranged from 24.1 to 125 cm³, with a mean of 57.6 cm³. Under sacral or lumbar anesthesia, 6 to 14 mL of dehydrated ethanol (mean 10.6 mL) was injected into the prostate under endoscopic guidance. This was followed by the placement of an indwelling catheter. The mean ratio of ethanol to prostate volume was 22.7%.

Of the patients, 16 had benign prostatic hyperplasia and 5 had advanced prostate cancer. Post-treatment, 87.5% of those with benign prostatic hyperplasia and 60% of those with advanced prostate cancer were able to void spontaneously after catheter removal. The catheter was left in place for 7 to 37 days, with a mean duration of 12.4 days.

No additional treatment was required during the 2 to 24 months of follow-up, with an average follow-up period of 16 months. The postoperative residual urine volume for these 17 patients ranged from 20 to 150 mL, and the mean prostate volume decreased from 52.7 to 37.9 cm³, a reduction of 28.1% at 6 months postoperatively (P < 0.001). No major complications were experienced.

In conclusion, for patients with persistent urinary retention due to prostatic obstruction who do not have severe complications, TUEIP obviates the need for catheterization.

### Terazosin [^11243RDo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018).

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**: The symptoms associated with BPH are related to bladder outlet obstruction, which comprises two underlying components: a static component and a dynamic component. The static component results from an increase in prostate size. Over time, the prostate will continue to enlarge; however, clinical studies have demonstrated that the size of the prostate does not correlate with the severity of BPH symptoms or the degree of urinary obstruction. The dynamic component is a function of an increase in smooth muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck, leading to constriction of the bladder outlet. Smooth muscle tone is mediated by sympathetic nervous stimulation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, and bladder neck. The reduction in symptoms and improvement in urine flow rates following the administration of terazosin is related to the relaxation of smooth muscle produced by the blockade of alpha-1 adrenoceptors in the bladder neck and prostate. Because there are relatively few alpha-1 adrenoceptors in the bladder body, terazosin is able to reduce bladder outlet obstruction without affecting bladder contractility.

Terazosin has been studied in 1,222 men with symptomatic BPH. In three placebo-controlled studies, symptom evaluation and uroflowmetric measurements were performed approximately 24 hours following dosing. Symptoms were quantified using the Boyarsky Index. The questionnaire evaluated both obstructive symptoms such as hesitancy, intermittency, terminal dribbling, and impairment of size and force of stream.

### Urethral stricture disease: Evaluation of the male urethra [^112MyDQR]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Although every patient evaluation begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination, specific aspects of the medical history are particularly relevant for patients with suspected or known urethral stricture disease. Obstructive symptoms in a man with a history of hypospadias, particularly following reconstructive surgery, are highly suggestive of urethral stricture disease. Furthermore, prior instrumentation and catheterization are associated with strictures of the fossa navicularis. When there is a history of any prior dilation or urethrotomy, obstructive symptoms are likely due to urethral stricture recurrence, as these endoscopic treatments are seldom curative.

- **Obstructive symptoms and trauma history**: When there is a history of straddle trauma, bulbar stricture disease should be suspected. In cases of acquired meatal stenosis or a history of adult circumcision for phimosis, balanitis xerotica obliterans (also known as lichen sclerosis, LS) is often the underlying cause. Although all the above are associated with a diagnosis of anterior stricture disease, stricture should also be suspected in less obvious presentations, including obstructive symptoms with a history of prostatitis or epididymitis, or benign prostatic hypertrophy unresponsive to medical management.

In addition, pelvic fracture urethral injuries initially managed with suprapubic tube urinary diversion, as well as strictures following prostate surgery, radiation, and/or high-intensity focused ultrasound, are examples of disorders of the posterior urethra that require evaluation before treatment.

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: An analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^111p1gfJ]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

We conducted a structured and comprehensive search for guidelines on the surgical treatment of LUTS/BPO. To ensure broad international coverage, we systematically screened the websites of all national societies listed as members of the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU) because many relevant guidelines are not published in peer-reviewed journals and may only be accessible via professional society websites. A conventional PRISMA-based systematic review would not have identified these documents and was therefore not suitable for our research objective.

Our methodology aligns with the approach described by Zumstein et al. in a prior BMC Urology publication, which used a similar society-based strategy to identify and compare urological guidelines. In addition, we conducted a targeted online search to capture any recent guidelines not listed by SIU members but relevant to our topic.

Eligibility for further analysis was determined by the following criteria: (I) surgical treatment recommendations for LUTS/BPO, (II) guidelines updated within the last three years as of 15th April 2024, (III) versions not considered obsolete, and (IV) guidelines providing not just general surgical recommendations but also those discriminating between treatment scenarios based on patient-specific factors, such as prostate volume and anatomy (i.e. presence of a middle lobe).

The identified guidelines were examined for their recency, comprehensiveness, level of detail, procedural recommendations, and statements on specific treatment scenarios.

### Urinary outcomes of minimally invasive treatments for prostate cancer — a systematic review by Young Academic Urologists' Urotechnology Working Group [^112Y1v3t]. Journal of Endourology (2025). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive treatments (MITs) have emerged as viable treatment options for carefully selected patients with localized disease. Their major advantage is that MITs enable the preservation of nearby healthy prostate tissue and critical structures such as the urethral sphincter and neurovascular bundles without compromising oncologic outcomes. The aim of the review is to describe the impact of different MITs for prostate cancer (PCa) on urinary continence.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria were as follows: all clinical trials conducted and related to the urinary outcomes (UO) of PCa MITs. Exclusion criteria were as follows: any reviews, articles, conference abstracts, articles whose subject fell outside the scope of this review, or any articles published more than five years ago.

- **Results**: In the last five years, a total of 114 articles on MITs for PCa have been published. Among them, only 36 dealt with UO for MITs. Brachytherapy, cryoablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) seem to be the most widely used technologies, whereas irreversible electroporation, focal brachytherapy, focal cryoablation, and multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound-guided (mpMRI-US-guided) HIFU seem to be the safest techniques in terms of UO. The use of MITs for treating PCa is a fast-growing option that can help preserve functional parameters and urinary continence.

### Optimal PSA density threshold for prostate biopsy in benign prostatic obstruction patients with elevated PSA levels but negative MRI findings [^115XiZAS]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

To propose the best biopsy strategy for BPH patients with elevated PSA levels and negative mpMRI results, we conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from our center over the past ten years. The data included information on prostate biopsy and prostate surgery for BPH patients with negative mpMRI results and elevated PSA levels. We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify a sensitive threshold for predicting prostate cancer and to improve the accuracy of biopsy. Our aim was to optimize the prostate biopsy strategy for BPH patients with bladder outlet obstruction.

### Palliative transurethral prostate resection for bladder outlet obstruction in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer [^1165fZbi]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The outcome of patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing palliative transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is not well defined in the literature. This study determined the preoperative characteristics, operative morbidity, and postoperative outcomes of patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing palliative TURP and compared these outcomes to those of patients undergoing TURP for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

A retrospective review of all patients with prostate cancer undergoing palliative TURP at a single institution between 1994 and 2001 was performed. Operative reports and outpatient and inpatient records were reviewed. Serum prostate-specific antigen, cancer grade, and stage at cancer diagnosis were compared with findings at TURP. Operative statistics, postoperative outcomes, and complication rates were compared between the palliative prostate cancer TURP group and a large cohort of 520 patients undergoing TURP at our institution for BPH during the same period. The Fisher exact and 1-sample t-test were used to determine statistical differences in outcomes between these two groups.

A total of 24 palliative TURPs were performed in 19 patients. At prostate cancer diagnosis, the mean patient age was 68.7 years (range 49 to 87) and the median prostate-specific antigen ± SD was 39.7 ± 78.3 ng/ml (range 1.5 to 334). Radiation therapy was the initial treatment in 11 patients (58%), and the remainder received initial hormonal therapy. The mean age at TURP was 74.2 years (range 50 to 91), with an average time from prostate cancer diagnosis to TURP.

### Urinary symptoms and prostate cancer-the misconception that may be preventing earlier presentation and better survival outcomes [^112yoT7r]. BMC Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Prostate cancer is an epidemic of the modern age, and despite efforts to improve awareness, it remains the case that mortality has hardly altered over the decades, driven largely by late presentation. There is a strong public perception that male urinary symptoms are key indicators of prostate cancer, and this continues to be part of messaging from national guidelines and media health campaigns. This narrative, however, is not based on evidence and may be seriously hampering efforts to encourage early presentation.

- **Anatomical considerations**: Prostate cancer most often arises in the peripheral zone, while urinary symptoms result from compression of the urethra by prostatic enlargement more centrally. Biopsy studies show that mean prostate volume is actually lower in men found to have early prostate cancer compared to those with benign biopsies. This inverse relationship between prostate size and the probability of cancer is so strong that PSA density (PSA corrected for prostate volume) is significantly more accurate in predicting a positive biopsy than PSA alone. Thus, this disconnect between scientific evidence and perception is very striking.

- **Implications for diagnosis**: There is also evidence that using symptoms for investigating possible cancer may lead to higher proportions of men presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease compared to PSA testing or screening programs. Concerns about overwhelming healthcare services if men are encouraged to get tested without symptoms may be overstated, with recent newer approaches to reduce over-testing.

Interventional radiologists are commonly called upon to manage patients with benign and malignant ureteral pathologic conditions. Unfortunately, treatments for both cure and palliation can be fraught with problems, causing patients to be undesirably maintained with lifelong catheters.

### Photoselective laser vaporization of the prostate in the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction in advanced-stage prostate cancer: a single-center experience [^112zMGe2]. Journal of Endourology (2012). Low credibility.

The study conducted in China is the first to explore photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) applied to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) or urinary retention resulting from advanced-stage prostate cancer (PCa). The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PVP in treating patients with BOO secondary to advanced-stage PCa.

- **Patients and methods**: Forty-five patients (mean age 76.13 ± 5.88 years, range 62–89 years) with BOO or urinary retention secondary to advanced-stage PCa received PVP using a potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The treatment outcome was evaluated using subjective and objective tests at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after PVP. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) score, postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume, and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) were assessed. Operative time, indwelling catheterization time, and operative complications were also observed.

- **Results**: All 45 patients recovered without incident. The mean operative time was 50 ± 7.6 minutes. The catheterization duration was 3.2 days (range 2–7 days). There was significant improvement in Qmax from 7.29 ± 0.93 to 12.16 ± 2.75 mL/sec at 12 months post-treatment. Mean PVR volume decreased from 210.94 ± 179.49 mL to 54.45 ± 33.16 mL. The mean IPSS score decreased from a preoperative 28.19 ± 3.64 to a postoperative 14.61 ± 2.81 (P < 0.05), and the QoL score decreased from 5.03 ± 0.69 to 3.66 ± 0.65 (P < 0.05). There were no intraoperative adverse events. Postoperative complications included mild transient hematuria in 12 (26.7%) patients and mild dysuria in 11 (24.4%) patients within 4 weeks.

- **Conclusions**: The study concludes with…

### Management of urinary retention in patients with benign prostatic obstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113SNUGs]. European Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Practice patterns for the management of urinary retention (UR) secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO; UR/BPO) vary widely and remain unstandardized. This review examines evidence for managing patients with UR/BPO through pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments included in the European Association of Urology guidelines on non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms.

A detailed search was conducted up to April 22, 2018, using CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. This systematic review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective comparative studies, following methods detailed in the Cochrane Handbook. Certainty of evidence (CoE) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

The literature search identified 2074 citations, and twenty-one studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The evidence for managing patients with UR/BPO with pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatments is limited. CoE for most outcomes was low/very low. Only α1-blockers (alfuzosin and tamsulosin) have been evaluated in more than one RCT. Pooled results indicated that α1-blockers provided significantly higher rates of successful trial without catheter compared with placebo [alfuzosin: 322/540 (60%) vs. 156/400 (39%) (odds ratio {OR} 2.28, 95% confidence interval {CI} 1.55 to 3.36; participants = 940; studies = 7; I² = 41%; low CoE); tamsulosin: 75/158 (47%) vs. 40/139 (29%)].

### Prognostic significance of obstructive uropathy in advanced prostate cancer [^113X2MEk]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

To report the incidence and prognostic implications of obstructive uropathy (OU) in patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy, and to define the impact initial local therapy has on the development of OU in patients with prostate cancer who develop recurrence and begin androgen deprivation therapy.

- **Methods**: From a population of 260 patients with advanced prostate cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 2003, OU was identified in 51 patients. The OU treatment options included ureteral stent, percutaneous nephrostomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, Foley catheter placement, and urinary diversion. Overall survival and the factors that influenced survival were calculated using standard statistical methods.

- **Results**: OU was diagnosed in 15 (16%) of 80 patients who received local therapy with curative intent and in whom local therapy subsequently failed, and in 36 (19%) of 180 patients who had never received local therapy (P = 0.7, chi-square test). Of these 51 patients, 39 had bladder neck obstruction and 16 had ureteral obstruction. Overall survival was significantly worse for the men with OU compared with those without OU (41 versus 54 months). OU was associated with tumor stage as well as androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.

- **Conclusions**: OU results in significantly reduced survival in men with prostate cancer. In a select group of patients with prostate cancer with progression after local therapy (primarily radiotherapy), no statistically significant reduction in the development of OU was observed relative to patients matched for stage and other factors.
