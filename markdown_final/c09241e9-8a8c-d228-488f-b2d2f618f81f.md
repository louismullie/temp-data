## Question

Works of elevated hs-crp

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical significance of elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), including its prognostic value, how to interpret it, and how to act on it in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biology and why hs-CRP matters mechanistically. Then, I should verify the strength of epidemiologic and trial evidence for risk prediction and treatment response. Next, I will review guideline positions and practical thresholds. After that, I need to check special populations and limitations, including discordance with lipids and variability over time. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, stepwise approach to testing, interpretation, and management, and I will double-check that each claim aligns with the cited evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the biological rationale. hs-CRP is a hepatically synthesized acute-phase reactant driven largely by IL-6 signaling; in atherosclerosis, it reflects systemic low-grade inflammation that participates in endothelial dysfunction, plaque formation, instability, and thrombosis, although hs-CRP itself is best viewed as a risk marker rather than a proven causal driver in most contexts, which I should keep in mind to avoid over-attributing causality [^113UQF6d] [^111HJx2b] [^1133aMSk].

> Next, I should review the prognostic evidence in primary prevention. Multiple large prospective cohorts show that elevated hs-CRP independently predicts incident cardiovascular events, with risk rising across clinically used categories of < 1, 1–3, and > 3 mg/L; importantly, adding hs-CRP to traditional risk factors improves discrimination and reclassification, albeit modestly, and cumulative exposure to elevated hs-CRP tracks with higher event risk in a dose–response fashion, which strengthens the case for considering hs-CRP in borderline-risk patients [^113Rmhst] [^1119xERa] [^114wkYA1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify randomized trial data that translate hs-CRP into actionable therapy. The JUPITER trial in primary prevention patients with LDL-C < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L showed a 44% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with rosuvastatin 20 mg daily, with the absolute benefit greatest in those with the highest baseline hs-CRP, supporting the concept that hs-CRP can identify a high-risk subgroup benefiting from statin therapy even when LDL-C is not markedly elevated [^116dwyEf] [^111kTcwA] [^114wkYA1].

> I need to check secondary prevention and residual inflammatory risk. Observational and trial analyses indicate that in patients with established CVD, hs-CRP remains a strong predictor of recurrent events independent of LDL-C, and on-treatment hs-CRP levels correlate with outcomes; moreover, anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-1β (canakinumab) reduced events in patients with prior MI and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L, reinforcing the clinical relevance of residual inflammatory risk and the potential value of hs-CRP to enrich selection for anti-inflammatory strategies [^111buT1H] [^115bt94h] [^117HvGpk].

> Let me consider special populations and thresholds. In acute coronary syndromes, admission hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L predicts worse outcomes, and in diabetes, baseline and on-treatment hs-CRP carry prognostic information; however, I should confirm that diabetes may blunt the relative risk gradient at a given hs-CRP level, suggesting that higher thresholds or different risk framing may be needed when interpreting hs-CRP in diabetic patients, which aligns with observational and trial subgroup signals [^115M2iRd] [^117HvGpk]. In stroke, very high hs-CRP levels (for example, ≥ 10 mg/L) associate with increased mortality, particularly in milder strokes, though this reflects acute-phase biology and should be interpreted in clinical context [^114bmegb].

> Wait, let me verify the relationship with lipids and potential discordance. hs-CRP captures lipid-independent inflammatory risk; patients can have elevated hs-CRP with normal LDL-C, and conversely, some have high LDL-C with low hs-CRP. Discordance analyses and long-term cohort data show that hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L identifies additional ASCVD risk even when atherogenic lipids appear favorable, supporting the concept of dual-pathway risk and the rationale for statin therapy in selected patients with elevated hs-CRP despite acceptable lipid panels [^112tLWPu] [^114wkYA1].

> I should confirm guideline positions to anchor practice. The 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment guideline allows hs-CRP as an optional risk enhancer when treatment decisions are uncertain, particularly in intermediate-risk adults, while the 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline highlights hs-CRP as a risk enhancer in intermediate-risk women. More recent ACC 2025 scientific statements recommend obtaining hs-CRP in routine practice for primary prevention and emphasize its prognostic value in secondary prevention, with suggestions to intensify statins when hs-CRP is > 2 mg/L regardless of LDL-C, reflecting evolving consensus on residual inflammatory risk [^113DA71j] [^111SpaeW] [^116LTvVH] [^114mwJx7] [^1128tdrW].

> Let me think about practical interpretation and thresholds. Clinically, hs-CRP < 1 mg/L is low risk, 1–3 mg/L is average, and > 3 mg/L is high risk; values > 10 mg/L should prompt evaluation for acute illness or noncardiac inflammatory drivers before using hs-CRP for cardiovascular risk stratification. I should double-check that a single elevated value is insufficient; repeating hs-CRP after 2–4 weeks to confirm persistence improves specificity and avoids misclassification due to transient inflammation or assay variability [^114wkYA1] [^113UQF6d].

> Next, I should review how to act on elevated hs-CRP. Lifestyle modification reduces hs-CRP and improves cardiometabolic risk; in the Look AHEAD trial, intensive weight loss and exercise reduced hs-CRP by about 44% at 1 year. Pharmacologically, statins lower hs-CRP independent of LDL-C, and in JUPITER-eligible patients, rosuvastatin reduced events; in secondary prevention, intensifying statin therapy when hs-CRP remains > 2 mg/L is reasonable, and for selected high-risk patients with persistent inflammatory risk, anti-inflammatory strategies such as IL-1β blockade have evidence of benefit, though patient selection and bleeding risk must be weighed carefully [^114mbaue] [^116dwyEf] [^1128tdrW] [^115bt94h].

> But wait, what if hs-CRP is discordant with other risk markers or the patient is on therapy. I should confirm that hs-CRP complements, not replaces, traditional risk assessment; it adds value particularly when global risk is borderline or when LDL-C and other atherogenic measures appear discordant with clinical suspicion. Importantly, hs-CRP does not capture all residual risk, and emerging biomarkers or imaging may be needed in select cases, so I need to ensure holistic risk evaluation and shared decision-making before escalating therapy solely on hs-CRP [^113Rmhst] [^112tLWPu] [^113UQF6d].

> In summary, I should confirm that elevated hs-CRP identifies patients with increased cardiovascular risk via inflammatory pathways, refines risk stratification beyond traditional factors, and can guide more aggressive prevention strategies, including statin therapy and lifestyle change; however, hs-CRP is a marker, not a treatment target per se, and results must be interpreted in context, repeated when elevated, and integrated with the patient's overall risk profile and preferences to optimize outcomes [^114wkYA1] [^116LTvVH] [^111buT1H].

Elevated hs-CRP reflects **low-grade systemic inflammation** [^114CtaH3] and is a strong, independent predictor of cardiovascular risk [^113Rmhst], especially in primary prevention [^114wkYA1]. It improves risk stratification beyond traditional factors [^113Rmhst] and identifies patients who benefit from statins even when LDL-C is low [^116dwyEf] [^114wkYA1]. Persistent elevation (> 2 mg/L) warrants **lifestyle and pharmacologic risk reduction** [^115hnSRJ] [^114mwJx7]; in secondary prevention, it signals residual inflammatory risk and may guide intensified therapy [^111buT1H] [^1128tdrW]. hs-CRP is not specific, so confirm persistence and exclude acute illness before acting [^112gPtho].

---

## Pathophysiological significance of elevated hs-CRP

hs-CRP is a **nonspecific marker of inflammation** [^114CtaH3] produced by the liver in response to IL-6 and other cytokines [^111GeQ8y]; elevated levels reflect low-grade systemic inflammation central to atherogenesis [^114CtaH3]. While not directly causal, hs-CRP correlates with endothelial dysfunction, plaque instability, and thrombosis, and is a robust surrogate of inflammatory activity in cardiovascular disease [^114CtaH3].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated hs-CRP

### Cardiovascular risk prediction

- **Primary prevention**: hs-CRP independently predicts MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death [^113Rmhst] and improves risk stratification beyond traditional factors [^113Rmhst]; elevated hs-CRP identifies patients who benefit from statins even with low LDL-C [^116dwyEf] [^114wkYA1].
- **Secondary prevention**: hs-CRP predicts recurrent events [^111buT1H] and mortality in patients with established CVD [^notfound]; persistent elevation signals residual inflammatory risk despite guideline-directed therapy [^111buT1H].
- **Risk thresholds**: < 1 mg/L low, 1–3 mg/L intermediate, and > 3 mg/L high risk [^114wkYA1]; values > 10 mg/L suggest acute inflammation and should be interpreted cautiously [^116sJTRY].

---

### Therapeutic decision-making

- **Statins**: Reduce hs-CRP and events in primary prevention [^116dwyEf]; JUPITER showed a 44% relative risk reduction in patients with elevated hs-CRP and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL [^116dwyEf] [^114wkYA1].
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes lower hs-CRP and cardiovascular risk [^114mbaue] [^111vJbPo].
- **Anti-inflammatory therapy**: IL-1β blockade (canakinumab) reduced events in patients with elevated hs-CRP and prior MI, supporting inflammation as a therapeutic target [^115bt94h] [^117HvGpk].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Specificity**: hs-CRP is nonspecific; elevations can reflect acute illness, obesity, smoking, or chronic inflammatory conditions [^116sJTRY] [^113PtcfH].
- **Variability**: Single measurements may misclassify risk; repeat testing improves reliability [^1119xERa] [^111inLY2].
- **Clinical context**: Interpret alongside traditional risk factors, symptoms, and clinical judgment [^112gPtho].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical context** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Primary prevention | Consider hs-CRP when risk is borderline or uncertain [^113DA71j]; elevated hs-CRP supports statin initiation [^114mwJx7] [^114wkYA1] |
| Secondary prevention | hs-CRP predicts recurrence and mortality [^111buT1H]; persistent elevation may prompt intensified therapy [^1128tdrW] |
| General use | Repeat testing to confirm persistence; exclude acute illness before acting [^112gPtho] |

---

Elevated hs-CRP signals **inflammatory cardiovascular risk** and meaningfully refines risk assessment and treatment decisions; confirm persistence, exclude acute causes, and integrate with the overall clinical picture to guide lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^116EVoyT]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Newer CV risk stratification strategies incorporating hs-CRP (e.g. Reynolds Risk Score) have also been shown to improve risk stratification better than algorithms incorporating only traditional risk factors. There is also evidence from several landmark statin trials that on-treatment hs-CRP levels predict the likelihood of CV events. Although there is increasing evidence that CRP may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the question of whether reduction in CRP levels and/or its associated downstream effects will provide novel therapeutic avenues to reduce CV risk requires further investigation.

CV diseases are the number one cause of mortality worldwide. Recent efforts directed at primary prevention of atherosclerosis have significantly reduced the incidence of initial clinical presentation of atherosclerosis. It is well established that patients with known diabetes or other traditional CV risk factors have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, 15–20% of major CV events occur in patients with no major traditional CV risk factors. As a result, recent preventive efforts have been directed at finding newer, nontraditional, biomarkers to improve risk stratification, particularly in otherwise apparently low-risk individuals.

hs-CRP, previously considered to be an indicator of systemic inflammation, has recently received much attention in the scientific literature, not only as a potential marker of increased atherosclerotic risk, but also as a potential target of therapy for the prevention of atherosclerotic CV disease. In this review, we discuss whether hs-CRP should indeed be a target for therapy in the prevention of CV disease as well as other potential clinical implications related to hs-CRP.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a risk assessment tool for cardiovascular disease [^114d5gxH]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Almost half of first cardiovascular events occur in individuals with no known risk factors. Attempts in the last decade to predict cardiovascular risk more accurately have led to the emergence of a novel risk factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), which has proved to be as good a risk predictor as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. C-reactive protein is an index of inflammation that is now believed to promote directly all stages of atherosclerosis, including plaque rupture. As measured by high-sensitivity assays, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) also independently predicts recurrent events in patients with known coronary artery diseases. Recent evidence implicates hs-CRP, and thus inflammation, in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, particularly in women. As a clinical tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, hs-CRP testing enhances information provided by lipid screening or global risk assessment. Statin therapy and other interventions can lower hs-CRP. Whether or not such reductions can prevent cardiovascular events is under investigation.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk: from concept to clinical practice to clinical benefit [^113vj4PG]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Advances in vascular biology have shown that inflammation plays an integral role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Extensive study of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has demonstrated that this measure of inflammation predicts cardiovascular risk not reflected by traditional risk factors, adds prognostic information to traditional risk assessment, and predicts long-term cardiovascular risk in individuals with no prior evidence of cardiovascular disease. Patients with elevated hs-CRP levels in the absence of elevated cholesterol appear to derive preventive benefit from statin therapy that is similar in magnitude to that in patients with elevated cholesterol. The large-scale Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosvastatin (JUPITER) trial represents a critical study to determine the utility of a strategy for targeting statin therapy to prevent incident cardiovascular disease in patients at increased cardiovascular risk on the basis of elevated hs-CRP who would not be considered candidates for therapy on the basis of hypercholesterolemia or traditional risk assessment. Inclusion of hs-CRP measurement in risk screening and use of this information to guide preventive therapy could result in a marked improvement in prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiovascular disease: a resolute belief or an elusive link? [^111HJx2b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The role of inflammation in the propagation of atherosclerosis and susceptibility to cardiovascular (CV) events is well established. Of the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers that have been studied, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has received the most attention for its use in screening and risk reclassification and as a predictor of clinical response to statin therapy. Although CRP is involved in the immunologic process that triggers vascular remodeling and plaque deposition and is associated with increased CV disease (CVD) risk, definitive randomized evidence for its role as a causative factor in atherothrombosis is lacking. Whether measurement of hsCRP levels provides consistent, clinically meaningful incremental predictive value in risk prediction and reclassification beyond conventional factors remains debated. Despite publication of guidelines on the use of hsCRP in CVD risk prediction by several leading professional organizations, there is a lack of clear consensus regarding the optimal clinical use of hsCRP. This article reviews 4 distinct points from the literature to better understand the current state and application of hsCRP in clinical practice: 1) the biology of hsCRP and its role in atherosclerosis; 2) the epidemiological association of hsCRP with CVD; 3) the quality of hsCRP as a biomarker of risk; and 4) the use of hsCRP as a tool to initiate or tailor statin therapy. Furthermore, we highlight recommendations from societies and important considerations when using hsCRP to guide treatment decisions in the primary prevention setting.

### C-reactive protein and other emerging blood biomarkers to optimize risk stratification of vulnerable patients [^112n83RG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Several emerging plasma biomarkers may ultimately prove useful in risk stratification and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. The clinical utility of these biomarkers will depend on their ability to provide a reflection of the underlying atherosclerotic burden or activity; the ability to provide reliable, accurate, and cost-effective information; and the ability to predict future events. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) fulfills many, if not all, of these criteria, and blood levels of hs-CRP are now commonly used in clinical practice to improve vascular risk prediction in primary and secondary prevention across all levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), all levels of the Framingham Risk Score, and all levels of metabolic syndrome. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein may also have clinical relevance as an adjunct to LDL-C for both the targeting and monitoring of statin therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that several other selected emerging biomarkers may also potentially prove useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, data are accumulating on the potential clinical utility of lipoprotein-associated lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, myeloperoxidase, oxidized LDL, lipoprotein (a), isoprostanes, and small, dense LDL. This review focuses on hs-CRP and these emerging plasma biomarkers, and their potential diagnostic and prognostic utility in cardiovascular disease. Plasma biomarkers that reflect the clinical potential of atherothrombotic disease may allow more precise risk stratification and prognostication in high-risk populations, and perhaps earlier diagnosis and intervention in patients at risk for or with occult cardiovascular disease.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein in every chart? The use of biomarkers in individual patients [^116er6nS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) for risk stratification for cardiovascular disease is supported by epidemiologic evidence but remains controversial. The metabolic milieu in which hsCRP is likely to be elevated, namely abdominal obesity and insulin resistance, provides a framework for the understanding of the role of hsCRP as well its limitations. This commentary provides a critical assessment of the data in support of the use of hsCRP in clinical practice.

### Utility of C-reactive protein measurement in risk stratification during primary cardiovascular disease prevention [^116yaHwy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) adds prognostic information beyond that provided by the Framingham risk score. The clinical utility of hs-CRP evaluation per guidelines was investigated by determining how it changed the cardiovascular risk stratification of 100 patients deemed at intermediate risk. Screening guidelines defined the cardiovascular risk due to hs-CRP as low (< 1.0 mg/L), intermediate (1.0 to 3.0 mg/L), or high (> 3.0 mg/L). After hs-CRP evaluation, risk was adjusted in 66% of the patients. Because hs-CRP evaluation significantly altered the cardiovascular risk strata of most intermediate-risk patients, it may therefore be a useful test during primary cardiovascular disease prevention.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiovascular risk: rationale for screening and primary prevention [^113gfPYx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a major factor in atherothrombotic disease. Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation and a mediator of atherothrombotic disease, have been shown to correlate with cardiovascular disease risk. Recent findings in 27,939 healthy women in the Women's Health Study indicate that hs-CRP (1) is a stronger predictor of risk than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, (2) predicts elevated risk in subjects without overt hyperlipidemia, and (3) adds prognostic information to risk scoring and LDL cholesterol categories. Other data from this cohort show that hs-CRP level adds prognostic information to the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome. Taken together with other data in men on the association of hs-CRP with vascular risk, a strong argument is provided for screening in the primary prevention population. With regard to potential treatment, statins have been found to reduce hs-CRP levels, and data from statin treatment trials raise the possibility that subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels may derive greater benefit from treatment than do patients without elevated hs-CRP. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial is planned to examine the effects of rosuvastatin treatment in preventing cardiovascular events in 15,000 healthy subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels in the absence of overt hyperlipidemia.

### Inflammation and atherosclerosis: role of C-reactive protein in risk assessment [^113ni3sa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation participates critically in atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of several inflammatory markers rise in individuals at risk for atherosclerotic events. In particular, elevation of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific acute-phase reactant that is easily and reliably measured, has strong predictive power for cardiovascular events. Indeed, measurements of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) plasma levels add to both the prognostic information gleaned from assay of plasma lipid risk factors and the risk levels estimated by means of Framingham study-based criteria. Retrospective data suggest the hypothesis that hs-CRP plasma levels may be useful for guiding use of lipid-lowering therapy in individuals who appear to be at low risk according to traditional risk assessment. A large-scale, randomized clinical trial-Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER)-will test whether rosuvastatin therapy will reduce incident cardiovascular disease in subjects with elevated plasma hs-CRP concentrations who do not meet current criteria for initiation of lipid-lowering drug therapy. Such clinical trial data may provide an evidence base for the use of plasma CRP assay as an adjuvant guide to therapy to complement the established traditional risk factors such as plasma lipid levels. Thus, medical practitioners are ushering in an era in which the biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis will find its way into clinical application.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^1166HEJF]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CLINICAL UTILITY OF CRP

Whereas the potential of hs-CRP as a therapeutic target for the prevention of CV disease remains unresolved, hs-CRP has been demonstrated to have other clinical utilities.

In particular, hs-CRP may be useful in cardiac risk prediction. Traditional CV risk prediction algorithms such as the Framingham Risk Score fail to take into account family history of premature CV disease and nontraditional risk biomarkers such as hs-CRP. The Reynolds Risk Score, in contrast, is a recently developed CV risk prediction algorithm that incorporates the hs-CRP value and family history in addition to the traditional risk factors.

The Reynolds Risk Score was initially developed and validated in women and was shown to improve global CV risk prediction. For example, it reclassified 40–50% of the women who were at intermediate risk (5–20% 10-year risk) into either higher- or lower-risk categories. In addition, global CV risk prediction with the Reynolds Risk Score more accurately matched actual event rates. The Reynolds Risk Score has subsequently been validated in men, again with improved CV global risk prediction. A total of 15–20% of men at intermediate risk were reclassified into higher- or lower-risk categories.

Beyond global risk prediction of CV events, an association between higher hs-CRP levels and new onset of future diabetes has been demonstrated. In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), another primary prevention statin trial, which studied the effects of pravastatin on 6,595 men with high LDL cholesterol levels, it was found that high hs-CRP levels (defined as > 3 mg/L) (in combination with the presence of metabolic syndrome) demonstrated greatest prognostication for both CHD as well as future onset of diabetes. Another study found that hs-CRP was independently associated with insulin levels in nondiabetic women, strengthening the previously elucidated association between hs-CRP levels and increased risk of future diabetes.

### Interleukin-1 blockade with canakinumab to improve exercise capacity in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) [^1153SvFp]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

Interleukin-1 Blockade With Canakinumab to Improve Exercise Capacity in Patients With Chronic Systolic Heart Failure and Elevated High Sensitivity C-reactive Protein ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The proposed study is a sub-study of the CANTOS trial). The study proposes to perform serial Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests to prospectively measure changes in aerobic exercise capacity in patients with prior myocardial infarction, elevated C reactive protein plasma levels, and symptomatic heart failure with reduced systolic function, who are enrolled in the main CANTOS trial and are randomly assigned to Canakinumab or Placebo.

The subjects enrolled in this substudy will undergo repeated CPX and echocardiograms over the first 12 months of the CANTOS trial. The subjects will received the experimental treatment as randomized in the main CANTOS trial and they will not receive any additional experimental treatment as part of the sub-study. This study is a an Investigator-initiated single-center sub-study of the CANTOS trial, supported by Novartis pharmaceuticals. Patients enrolled in the CANTOS trial who also have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and are symptomatic for heart failure will be offered to take part in this sub-study at the Virginia Commonwealth University site.

As part of the sub-study, patients will undergo a cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline prior to initiation of treatment, then repeated at 3 and 12 months, and a transthoracic echocardiogram at baseline and at 12 months. Other: Cardiopulmonary exercise test Other: Echocardiogram

### Role of C-reactive protein in coronary risk reduction: focus on primary prevention [^117GTkZB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Given the limitations of current risk assessment strategies, adjunctive markers are needed to improve the prediction of a first coronary event. Research into the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis suggests that inflammatory-response proteins may serve as potential predictors of clinical events. One in particular, C-reactive protein, has been the focus of much attention. Epidemiologic studies have shown a fairly consistent independent association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) elevations and coronary risk, although a causal relation has not yet been established. Given this association, current guidelines recommend the optional use of hs-CRP to predict enhanced absolute risk in selected patients. The use of a marker in general clinical practice should be based on statistical measures that show incremental benefit over established risk factors and on randomized clinical trials in which therapy initiated as a result of marker screening improves patient outcomes. Thus far, statistical evidence concerning the incremental benefit of hs-CRP is not conclusive. Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is now being conducted to compare the efficacy of statin therapy versus placebo in subjects considered to be at increased risk on the basis of hs-CRP elevations, despite low to normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In conclusion, although epidemiologic studies suggest that low-grade C-reactive protein elevations are independently associated with coronary risk, more complete evidence is needed to validate the use of hs-CRP as a risk assessment tool in general practice and as a target for therapy in individual patients.

### Should we measure C-reactive protein on earth or just on JUPITER? [^117Bffgr]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence for the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is compelling and has generated interest in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a marker of cardiovascular risk. Data regarding hs-CRP and cardiovascular risk, though largely consistent, is of unclear clinical relevance. Most recently, the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial has led to further debate regarding the utility of hs-CRP. This article provides a comprehensive review of the data regarding cardiovascular risk and hs-CRP with an emphasis on the JUPITER trial and concludes with an evidence-based analysis of the current role of hs-CRP in cardiovascular risk assessment.

### A test in context: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [^114wkYA1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) adds prognostic information on cardiovascular risk comparable to blood pressure or cholesterol. Values < 1, 1 to 3, and > 3 mg/l indicate lower, average, or higher relative cardiovascular risk, respectively. Global risk algorithms that include hsCRP outperform those solely using Framingham covariates. Although diet, exercise, and smoking cessation are first steps for patients with a proinflammatory response, JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial data demonstrate that statins reduce by 47% the rate of first myocardial infarction, stroke, or confirmed cardiovascular death when given to patients with low-density lipoprotein-C levels of < 130 mg/dl and hsCRP of > 2 mg/l (hazard ratio: 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.40 to 0.69; p < 0.00001). In current U.S. guidelines, hsCRP carries a class IIb assessment and is most appropriate in primary prevention when clinical decisions to initiate statin therapy are uncertain. Ongoing multinational trials are pursuing whether reducing inflammation will decrease vascular event rates.

### The use of high-sensitivity assays for C-reactive protein in clinical practice [^112gPtho]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity assays that accurately measure levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein have been proposed for use in assessments of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A growing body of evidence supports recommendations for these tests in selected asymptomatic individuals deemed to be at intermediate risk of CVD according to traditional risk-factor assessments and who do not already warrant chronic treatment with aspirin and statin therapy. Data suggests that these high-sensitivity assays should be used in combination with measurements of LDL-cholesterol levels to assist risk stratification of selected patients for prevention of CVD.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein elevation in patients with prior myocardial infarction in the United States [^111e1JpF]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Importance

The extent to which levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a known marker of increased cardiovascular risk, are elevated and are associated with standard cardiovascular risk factors in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown.

Objectives

To determine the pattern and determinants of the distribution of hs-CRP in those with a prior MI in the United States using a nationally representative sample.

Design and Participants

Adults with hs-CRP data in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999–2010.

Results

Among 1296 individuals in our cohort, the median age was 65 years and the median hs-CRP level was 2.69 mg/L, measured an average of 7.1 years after the MI. Among these patients, 22% had hs-CRP levels of < 1 mg/L, 61% had ≥ 2 mg/L, and 48% had ≥ 3 mg/L. Increasing hs-CRP was associated in a multivariable model with increasing body mass index (partial R² [pR²] 0.113, P < .001), increasing non-high-density lipoprotein [HDL] (pR² 0.030, P < .001), increasing age (pR² 0.008, P = 0.017), and decreasing HDL (pR² 0.005, P = 0.046). Adjusted mean hs-CRP was also higher in women (3.6 vs 2.7 mg/L; P < .001), in people with hypertension (3.5 vs. 2.8, P = 0.030), and among smokers (4.2 vs 2.3 mg/L; P < .001), and lower in people with hyperlipidemia (2.8 vs. 3.5, P = 0.007). Standard cardiovascular risk factors accounted for only 22% of the variability in hs-CRP levels.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with prior MI, elevated hs-CRP is prevalent several years after the MI, and standard cardiovascular risk factors explain only a small proportion of hs-CRP variability. In light of emerging evidence on the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, the high prevalence of elevated hs-CRP in patients with prior MI in the United States may have public health implications.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^1123Pu1G]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular risk assessment — high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): Evidence indicates hs-CRP is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) events and that adding hs-CRP to risk prediction among initially intermediate-risk persons improves risk stratification, but few studies directly assessed reclassification in intermediate-risk persons and it was not clear whether reclassification led to a net improvement in prediction, with reports suggesting impact probably modest. Broader epidemiology notes continuous associations with coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, vascular mortality, and certain cancers, although the relevance to such a range of disorders is unclear, and a large collaboration did not directly assess value in risk prediction and provided no additional evidence for discrimination, calibration, reclassification, or cost-effectiveness. For myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality, adding hs-CRP to traditional risk factors improves risk prediction, but the clinical relevance and cost-effectiveness remain unclear; absolute differences in c-statistics between models including and not including hs-CRP ranged from 0.00 to 0.027.

### Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and dyslipidaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications for cardiovascular risk prediction in Nigerian patients [^114yuc5g]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Inflammation, marked by elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, and dyslipidaemia, are critical contributors to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. In Nigeria, where T2DM prevalence is rising, there is a need for more comprehensive risk prediction tools, incorporating both traditional and newer biomarkers such as hs-CRP. This study aimed to investigate the association between elevated hs-CRP levels and dyslipidaemia in Nigerian patients with T2DM and to explore the potential implications for cardiovascular risk prediction.

Methods

A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 T2DM patients and 150 age-matched controls. Data on socio-demographics, medical history, clinical characteristics, and laboratory parameters, including lipid profiles and hs-CRP levels, were collected. The relationship between hs-CRP levels and lipid parameters was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and independent t-tests.

Results

T2DM patients exhibited significantly higher hs-CRP levels (2.2 ± 1.8 mg/L vs. 1.2 ± 1.0 mg/L, p < 0.001), dyslipidaemia (p < 0.001), and blood pressure (SPB– 127.6 ± 12.4 mmHg, DBP– 77.6 ± 6.6 mmHg vs. SBP– 119.6 ± 10.8 mmHg, DBP– 72.1 ± 8.0 mmHg; p = 0.001) compared to controls. However, no significant correlation was found between hs-CRP levels and lipid parameters.

Conclusion

Although no direct association was found between elevated hs-CRP levels and dyslipidaemia, hs-CRP remains an important marker of cardiovascular risk possibly through non-lipid pathways, such as inflammation-driven endothelial dysfunction. Further research is needed to evaluate its potential role in refining cardiovascular risk assessment in the Nigerian T2DM population.

### Olpasiran, oxidized phospholipids, and systemic inflammatory biomarkers… [^115pscrT]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the effects of olpasiran on OxPL, high-sensitivity interleukin 6, and hs-C-reactive protein in the OCEAN-DOSE randomized clinical trial. Design, Setting, and Participants. Intervention Participants were randomized to receive 1 of 4 active subcutaneous doses of olpasiran vs placebo: 10 mg, administered every 12 weeks; 75 mg, Q12W; 225 mg, Q12W; or 225 mg, administered every 24 weeks. OxPL on apolipoprotein B, hs-CRP, and hs-IL-6 were assessed at baseline, week 36, and week 48 in 272 patients. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was placebo-adjusted change in OxPL-apoB from baseline to week 36. Results. Among 272 participants, median age was 62 years, and 86 participants were female. Baseline median Lp concentration was 260. 3 nmol/L and median OxPL-apoB concentration was
26. 5 nmol/L.

These effects were maintained to week 48. There was a strong correlation between percentage reduction in Lp and OxPL-apoB for patients treated with olpasiran. Olpasiran did not significantly impact hs-CRP or hs-IL-6 compared with placebo to weeks 36 or 48. Conclusion and Relevance In the OCEAN-DOSE multicenter randomized clinical trial, olpasiran led to a significant and sustained reduction in OxPL-apoB but no significant effects on hs-CRP or hs-IL-6.

### Prognostic impact of admission high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in acute myocardial infarction patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^115M2iRd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common comorbidity in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and it is associated with two-fold higher in-hospital and long-term mortality rates and with a higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Both DM and atherosclerosis are multifactorial conditions, which share a common inflammatory basis. Indeed, on the one hand, DM is an independent risk factor for AMI and is considered a state of low-grade inflammation. On the other hand, inflammation plays a critical role in all phases of coronary athero-thrombosis, including plaque progression, rupture, and thrombosis leading to AMI.

C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein secreted by the liver, is the most widely used biomarker for detecting inflammatory conditions. The elevation of CRP levels frequently occurs in AMI, and it has been associated with adverse outcomes, including higher risk of major adverse cardiac events, cardiovascular death, chronic kidney disease progression, acute kidney injury, and all-cause mortality. To assess cardiovascular risk, physicians have now adopted high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), instead of standard CRP assays that monitor infections and other inflammatory conditions. In particular, in the AMI setting, hs-CRP demonstrated to be a more reliable indicator of outcome than CRP measured through traditional assays, showing that even a mild increase (≥ 2 mg/L) is of prognostic relevance.

Elevated hs-CRP levels in AMI patients may reflect a variable combination of chronic and acute (due to the ongoing cardiac event) inflammation. Since DM is more frequently associated with some degree of chronic inflammation, it is possible that, in AMI patients with DM, hs-CRP has a different prognostic relevance as compared to their non-DM counterpart.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between hs-CRP levels, measured at hospital admission, and in-hospital outcome and two-year mortality in a cohort of AMI patients according to DM status.

### Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and dyslipidaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications for cardiovascular risk prediction in Nigerian patients [^113Ky5aK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Nigeria. The interrelationship between diabetes and cardiovascular risk is well-established, with multiple pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the increased risk observed in diabetic patients. Among these, chronic low-grade inflammation and dyslipidaemia are recognized as pivotal factors in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of most cardiovascular events. Considering the high burden of diabetes and its complications in Nigeria, accurately identifying those at increased risk of CVD is essential to guide effective preventive measures and mitigate the overall impact of the disease.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, has garnered considerable attention as a potential predictor of cardiovascular events, with elevated levels correlating strongly with increased CVD risk, independent of traditional risk factors. Conversely, dyslipidaemia characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the presence of small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) particles is a common metabolic disturbance in T2DM patients that accelerates atherogenesis. These lipid abnormalities not only exacerbate cardiovascular risks but are also influenced by the inflammatory state indicated by elevated hs-CRP levels. Thus, this temporal relationship between systemic inflammation and dyslipidaemia in T2DM creates a synergistic effect, further amplifying the development of atherosclerosis and consequently increasing cardiovascular risk in diabetic individuals.

### What does minor elevation of C-reactive protein signify? [^116sJTRY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Reports of the predictive value of minor elevation of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (between 3 and 10 mg/L) for atherosclerotic events have generated considerable interest, as well as a degree of controversy and confusion. CRP concentrations in this range are found in about one third of the American population. To better understand the mechanisms underlying minor elevation of CRP, we have surveyed its reported associations with a variety of states and conditions. It has become clear that even minimal environmental irritants and inflammatory stimuli elicit a minor CRP response. Minor CRP elevation has been found associated with a number of genetic polymorphisms, with membership in different demographic and socioeconomic groups, with a variety of dietary patterns and with many medical conditions that are not apparently inflammatory. Finally, minor CRP elevation bears negative prognostic implications for many conditions, particularly age-related diseases, and predicts mortality in both diseased and apparently healthy individuals. In sum, minor CRP elevation is associated with a great many diverse conditions, some of which are, or may prove to be, causal. Many of these reported associations imply a mild degree of tissue stress or injury, suggesting the hypothesis that the presence of distressed cells, rather than a resulting inflammatory response, is commonly the stimulus for CRP production.

### C-reactive protein and coronary heart disease: a critical review [^114TjJkV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Modestly elevated baseline concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute phase protein, are associated with the long-term risk of coronary heart disease in general populations, whilst the major acute phase response of CRP following myocardial infarction is associated with death and cardiac complications. The pathogenic and clinical significance of these associations is controversial. Here we critically review the evidence and describe large-scale epidemiological studies, novel experiments and possible specific therapies which will rigorously inform the debate. We distinguish between the potential pathogenicity of high acute phase circulating CRP concentrations in individuals with substantial tissue damage and modest but persistent increases in baseline values in generally healthy subjects.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein predicts cardiovascular risk in diabetic and nondiabetic patients: effects of insulin-sensitizing treatment with pioglitazone [^114AzvSM]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammatory activity has turned out to play a key pathogenic role in vascular atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inflammatory biomarkers may therefore be a valuable tool for risk evaluation. Among them, the best evidence to date supports the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) to monitor insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Data suggest that hs-CRP may also participate directly in the process of atherogenesis. A growing number of clinical trials tested the hypothesis that antidiabetic drugs specifically targeting insulin resistance could benefit individuals by reducing inflammation, atherogenesis, and thus cardiovascular risk. One such class are the thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone). These agents act as selective ligands of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). This article reviewed published data on hs-CRP changes with the thiazolidinedione agent pioglitazone. Here we found pronounced insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties in different clinical settings, including diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Coadministration of pioglitazone to antilipidemic statin therapy resulted in additional effects on low-grade inflammation, and hs-CRP reduction has been demonstrated to occur independently of glucose lowering. The anti-inflammatory effect appeared to be a rapid physiologic reaction on PPARgamma activation and could be observed within a short-term interval after starting pioglitazone therapy. In summary, clinical study results underline the benefit of an early insulin resistance treatment to oppose systemic vascular inflammation and cardiometabolic syndrome in patients with elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

### Inflammation and atherosclerosis: the value of the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein assay as a risk marker [^113PtcfH]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a prototypic marker of inflammation. Numerous prospective studies in healthy volunteers have confirmed that high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) predicts cardiovascular events (CVEs), and hsCRP seems additive to an elevated total cholesterol level and a total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in men and women in predicting risk. In smokers and people with metabolic syndrome, hsCRP levels are elevated; in elderly people, there seems to be a relationship between hsCRP and CVEs and mortality. Several properties of CRP make it proatherogenic; however; pending further studies, it should be considered as a risk marker. In people with acute coronary syndromes, hsCRP measurement may be valuable. Elevated levels in the highest quantile seem to predict greater mortality and poorer prognosis in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI). While hsCRP is a strong independent predictor of risk of future MI, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and vascular death, the validity of hsCRP as a risk marker needs to be assessed in all populations. Weight loss, statin drugs, aspirin, and high-dose alpha tocopherol therapy could affect hsCRP. It has its greatest validity as an adjunctive measure in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to hs-CRP screening in primary prevention, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a single measurement of hs-CRP (> 3 mg/L) in routine clinical practice to identify patients at increased inflammatory risk, provided the patient is not acutely ill.

### Relation of baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level to cardiovascular outcomes with rosuvastatin in the justification for use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) [^111kTcwA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In the Justification for Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), random allocation of rosuvastatin compared to placebo among primary prevention patients with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of < 130 mg/dl and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level of ≥ 2 mg/L resulted in a highly significant 44% reduction in major vascular events. However, the relation of baseline hs-CRP levels to risk within JUPITER has not previously been described and has been an area of controversy for study interpretation. As reported in the present study for the first time, despite enrolling patients with a constrained range of values, increasing baseline hs-CRP levels within JUPITER were nonetheless associated with increasing vascular risk in analyses treating hs-CRP as a continuous variable, as an ordinal variable, and as a threshold variable. As anticipated, the relative risk reduction associated with rosuvastatin was similar in magnitude across the tertile and threshold levels of entry hs-CRP. In conclusion, as the absolute risk increased with increasing hs-CRP, the absolute risk reduction associated with rosuvastatin within JUPITER was also greatest among those with the greatest entry hs-CRP levels.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein: potential adjunct for global risk assessment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^115HA4Tm]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Inflammation plays a major role in atherothrombosis, and measurement of inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) may provide a novel method for detecting individuals at high risk of plaque rupture. Several large-scale prospective studies demonstrate that HSCRP is a strong independent predictor of future myocardial infarction and stroke among apparently healthy men and women and that the addition of HSCRP to standard lipid screening may improve global risk prediction among those with high as well as low cholesterol levels. Because agents such as aspirin and statins seem to attenuate inflammatory risk, HSCRP may also have utility in targeting proven therapies for primary prevention. Inexpensive commercial assays for HSCRP are now available; they have shown variability and classification accuracy similar to that of cholesterol screening. Risk prediction algorithms using a simple quintile approach to HSCRP evaluation have been developed for outpatient use. Thus, although limitations inherent to inflammatory screening remain, available data suggest that HSCRP has the potential to play an important role as an adjunct for global risk assessment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Clinical implications of JUPITER (justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) in a U.S. population insights from the ARIC (atherosclerosis risk in communities) study [^112UDVBF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to describe the proportion of "JUPITER-eligible" (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) individuals and clinical outcomes of individuals based on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) strata in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study.

Background

Questions remain after the JUPITER study, including whether the observed cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rates would persist with time and how these event rates would compare with other populations (lower hs-CRP and/or higher LDL-C levels).

Methods

After stratification into 4 groups based on LDL-C and hs-CRP levels, with cutoffs at 130 mg/dl and 2.0 mg/l, respectively, incident CVD events were examined (mean follow-up, 6.9 years) and compared.

Results

Of 8,907 age-eligible participants, 18.2% (n = 1,621) were JUPITER-eligible (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/l, LDL-C < 130 mg/dl) and had an absolute CVD risk of approximately 10.9% over a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (1.57% per year). If JUPITER hazard ratios were applied to this group, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 CVD event would be estimated at 38 over 5 years and 26 over 6.9 years.

Conclusions

ARIC participants with elevated hs-CRP and low LDL-C had a CVD event rate of 1.57% per year over 6.9 years, similar to the CVD event rate noted in the JUPITER study placebo group (1.36% per year over 1.9 years). The association of hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/l with increased CVD risk and mortality regardless of LDL-C provides us a simple method of using age and hs-CRP level for identifying higher risk individuals.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^115Em7eM]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in HIV — evidence and recommendation: Although hs-CRP is valuable to discriminate individuals at higher risk of CVD events in the HIV seronegative population, the data are not as clear in those with HIV infection. In a single center database, Triant and colleagues studied 70,357 patients with hs-CRP measured and found an increased risk of acute MI with elevated hs-CRP in HIV-infected individuals (OR 2.51), but bias in who was tested (n = 487 vs n = 729) and the lack of an absolute cut-off limit generalizability. Elevated CRP prior to initiation of ART was associated with a higher risk of progression to AIDS, CRP levels did not decline after 96 weeks with efavirenz, and in a randomized trial of pravastatin and fenofibrate there was no change in hs-CRP despite declines in LDL-C and TG, whereas in JUPITER the 44% risk reduction with rosuvastatin was associated with a decline in hs-CRP. However, until such time, the use of hs-CRP to adjudicate CVD risk in persons with HIV is not recommended.

### Prognostic impact of admission high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in acute myocardial infarction patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^117HvGpk]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study clinical implications

Our study may have some potential clinical implications. Firstly, in AMI patients, hs-CRP allows physicians to identify high-risk patients. This is true also for DM patients, in whom, however, a higher hs-CRP threshold than that usually considered (2 mg/L) should be identified to improve risk stratification. This concept is further suggested by the fact that, in our study population, a significant interaction was found between DM status and hs-CRP when long-term mortality was considered. Moreover, the RR of two-year mortality was constantly lower in patients with DM than in those without DM at each given hs-CRP level. For instance, the two-year mortality RR of a non-DM patient with hs-CRP level of 2 mg/L was similar to that of a DM patient with hs-CRP level of 14 mg/L (Fig. 5). Secondly, as hs-CRP has been recently considered a potential therapeutic target in AMI, DM status should be taken into account when anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies are investigated. The Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) trial showed that, among patients with prior AMI and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L, treatment with a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β is associated with fewer cardiovascular events. However, in the CANTOS trial, the beneficial effects, in terms of cardiovascular endpoints, were mainly observed in non-DM patients, with a non-significant risk reduction in those with DM. This highlights the possible need of a different hs-CRP cutoff value for the identification of high-risk AMI patients with DM who may benefit the most from an anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy. Novel therapeutic approaches aiming at reducing hs-CRP levels during AMI are also under investigation, and preliminary experimental and clinical data are being reported on the use of apheresis in this clinical setting. This strategy demonstrated to rapidly and safely lower hs-CRP levels by about 50%, independently of the initial concentration. Interestingly, this reduction was associated with a smaller infarct size in animal models.

### The role of very high high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels on mortality after stroke [^114bmegb]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity C-reaction protein (hsCRP) levels are correlated with risk of vascular disease. The clinical implications of markedly elevated hsCRP levels in the setting of acute stroke are less understood.

Objective

To determine the association of very high admission hsCRP levels (≥ 10mg/L) on all-cause mortality in patients with acute stroke.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of 1176 patients hospitalized with acute stroke between 2005 and 2012 who had a hsCRP assay drawn within seven days of admission. Mortality data was obtained using Ohio Death Index. Cox proportional analysis was used to determine hazard ratios of death among patients with hsCRP values > 10mg/L after adjusting for age, sex, race and relevant co-morbid conditions. NIHSS was also adjusted in a subset of patients in whom it was available (n = 378).

Results

Patients with hsCRP > 10mg/L had 2.65 (95% CI: 1.99, 3.53) increased hazard of all-cause mortality compared to stroke patients with hsCRP ≤ 10mg/L. Association of hsCRP with mortality was greater for patients with low NIHSS and declined in patients with increasing NIHSS scores. A higher proportion of patients with hsCRP > 10 died from nonvascular causes than patients with hsCRP ≤ 10mg/L.

Conclusion

Very high levels of hsCRP may be a useful marker to identify stroke patients at increased risk for death, especially those with stroke of mild severity. More research is needed to determine how this information can be used to improve patient care, especially in patients with mild stroke.

### Inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk: association or cause and effect? [^115kzt4g]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

With the current understanding that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, markers of the associated systemic inflammatory response have been extensively studied as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Recently the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been proposed for risk assessment in individuals at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease. The traditional view of inflammatory biomarkers, including CRP, regards them as risk markers rather than risk factors. Either category of marker would serve a diagnostic role, monitor disease activity, and indicate the efficacy of therapy or changing prognosis. However a risk factor with a causal role would be a potential target for therapy. This review discusses the available evidence that argues for and against a causal role for inflammatory biomarkers, with specific reference to CRP, in the atherosclerotic process.

### C-reactive protein and the prediction of cardiovascular events among those at intermediate risk: moving an inflammatory hypothesis toward consensus [^116CTEga]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Over 20 large-scale prospective studies show that the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events that additionally predicts risk of incident hypertension and diabetes. In many studies, the relative impact of hsCRP is at least as large as that individually of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, or smoking, and knowledge of hsCRP correctly reclassifies a substantial proportion of "intermediate-risk" individuals into clinically relevant higher- or lower-risk categories. Other studies show the relative benefit of statins to be greater among those with increased hsCRP and that achieved hsCRP levels after statin therapy predict recurrent event rates as much as achieved levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Nonetheless, it remains controversial whether the time has come to modify traditional algorithms used for global risk detection. As described here, 6 areas of controversy regarding hsCRP are resolvable with a consensus position that focuses in primary prevention on selective use among individuals with 5% to 20% 10-year risk as estimated by Adult Treatment Panel III, and focuses in secondary prevention on high-risk patients being treated with statin therapy. Forthcoming trial data could expand or contract this "screen selectively" policy, and investigators should be open to the possibility that second-generation inflammatory biomarkers may be developed that supplant hsCRP altogether. In the meantime, however, this consensus position on hsCRP should be one to which both advocates and critics of the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis can adhere because it is one that can immediately improve patient care.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^116dwyEf]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CRP AS A TARGET FOR THERAPY

The largest study to suggest an integral role for CRP as a target for therapy in primary prevention of CV disease is the recent Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial. The investigators randomized 17,802 men ≥ 50 years of age and women ≥ 60 years of age with low LDL cholesterol levels < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L and no history of CV disease or diabetes to 20 mg rosuvastatin daily or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, or CV death.

JUPITER was terminated early because of evidence of a reduction in CV morbidity and mortality in patients treated with rosuvastatin compared with placebo. During the 1.9-year median follow-up duration (maximum follow-up period 5 years), rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 50% and hs-CRP by 37%, and this result was associated with a 44% reduction in the JUPITER primary trial end point (P < 0.00001; 95% CI 0.46–0.69). Moreover, the NNT extrapolated out to 5 years to prevent one major event was only 25, a value that is less than that associated with the use of statin therapy for primary prevention among individuals with more overt hyperlipidemia (Fig. 1). Thus, despite targeting a population outside current guidelines and with low levels of LDL cholesterol, JUPITER demonstrated a magnitude of effect larger than that of almost all prior statin trials. Based on the results of the JUPITER study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010 agreed to broader labeling for rosuvastatin. As per the FDA, rosuvastatin is currently approved for the reduction of risk for stroke, MI, and revascularization procedures in individuals who have normal LDL cholesterol levels and no clinically evident CHD but who do have an increased risk based on age, CRP levels, and the presence of at least one additional CVD risk factor.

### Lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and all-cause mortality in a primary prevention cohort [^111HM34B]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been recognized as a genetically determined independent causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and valvular heart disease. Lp(a)-mediated CVD risk is graded, dose-dependent, and independent of elevations in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, the association of elevated Lp(a) with all-cause mortality independent of hsCRP elevation has been more controversial. Most studies do not find a relationship between all-cause mortality and elevated Lp(a) alone, and the studies that do report only a modest effect size with very high elevations of Lp(a). We suspect that elevated hsCRP, as a downstream marker of inflammation, amplifies the mortality risk from elevated Lp(a) and reliably identifies the highest-risk cohort of primary prevention patients.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Does elevated lipoprotein(a) increase mortality risk in patients without prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease?

What is the main finding?

Elevated Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL does not independently increase all-cause mortality, but elevated high-sensitivity CRP does, with greater magnitude as Lp(a) levels increase.

We analyzed patient data from the Cleveland Clinic Preventive Cardiology Information System (PRECIS) database to examine long-term all-cause mortality across Lp(a) levels in a clinical primary prevention population being monitored and treated for other CVD risk factors. The PRECIS database has been approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. Patients ≥ 18 years of age were eligible for analysis if they had ≥ 1 record of Lp(a) and hsCRP measurement during the study period and no history of coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease, stroke, or atherosclerosis on ultrasound or computed tomography. Baseline covariates were taken from the closest available values in time to index Lp(a). Mortality data were gathered from the Social Security Death Index, the Ohio State Department of Health Vital Statistics, and the electronic medical record. Continuous variables were summarized by mean ± SD for normally distributed data, or median (IQR) if non-normally distributed. Normality was assessed graphically and by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Time-to-event data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, kidney and liver disease, valvular heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and psychiatric disease. Covariates for adjustment were selected by univariate analysis and by clinical relevance, and the proportional hazards assumption was tested and held.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein to detect metabolic syndrome in a centrally obese population: a cross-sectional analysis [^116aWVCm]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. In recent years systemic inflammation - which can be measured by high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) - has become an important marker for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Moreover hs-CRP is associated with the MetS and its separate components. Early diagnosis of the MetS is desirable as lifestyle interventions and adequate treatment of risk factors associated with the MetS can prevent cardiovascular disease. However, it is not clear whether hs-CRP can also predict the presence of the MetS. Previous research showed that measuring an increased waist circumference was a reliable first step in detecting individuals with the MetS and was easy to perform. However, a substantial part of the individuals with central obesity have no other cardiovascular risk factors. Further assessment of risk for cardiovascular disease, after initial (self-)measurement of waist circumference, involves physical examination and laboratory assays. An elevated hs-CRP could be used to further distinguish those with the MetS from those without and diminish the group qualifying for further examinations. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of hs-CRP to discriminate those with the MetS from those without the MetS in a population with central obesity.

### Association of baseline, longitudinal serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein and its change with mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients [^114jgQ4R]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is used as a marker of systemic inflammatory in the clinical setting. Previous studies have demonstrated that an elevated serum hs-CRP level at a single time point is an important predictor of cardiovascular events both in general population and dialysis patients. The relationship is seen even when controlling for usual established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

However, hs-CRP levels are not static which may reflect a chronic inflammatory process in the dialysis patients, intercurrent clinical events, comorbidities, protein-energy wasting, decreased residual renal function and dialysis modality. In a study of hemodialysis (HD) patients, serum CRP levels increased annually during 3 years of follow-up. Further, HD patients with persistently high CRP levels but not an elevated CRP level only at a signal time point was associated with increased mortality risk, compared with a persistently low CRP levels. Additionally, biological inter-individual and intra-individual variability of CRP levels in dialysis patients might be greater than the variability in health individuals. Nevertheless, only a few small studies have assessed the consequences of longitudinal conventional CRP, but not hs-CRP, fluctuation on mortality among peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

Therefore, the relationship between longitudinal hs-CRP and its change and survival in PD patients has not been completely identified. In this retrospective cohort study, we sought to investigate the association of baseline, longitudinal hs-CRP levels and its change with all-cause and CVD mortality among continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We hypothesized that serial monitoring of hs-CRP levels could better capture prognostic information than a single baseline determination.

### MRI and serum high-sensitivity C reactive protein predict long-term mortality in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy [^1147u5ez]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Previously, small studies have demonstrated a correlation between hs-CRP levels and poor prognosis of DCM. Interestingly, in this study, hs-CRP levels at admission were not associated with adverse outcomes, although 41% of patients with LGE-CMR did exhibit elevated hs-CRP at stable state, and the combination of LGE-CMR and elevated hs-CRP at stable state was associated with poor prognosis. The results of our study confirm the value of assessing hs-CRP levels at stable state, and suggest that elevated hs-CRP should be considered an important predictor of risk in the long-term follow-up of patients with DCM with LGE-CMR. Therefore, LGE-CMR and hs-CRP might play complementary roles in the risk stratification of patients with DCM after acute decompensation. Interestingly, previous CMR studies in DCM have been limited to American Heart Association grading stage B, or to stage C in a clinically stable condition (New York Heart Association functional class II or less). The mortality rate of patients with stage C heart failure is known to be particularly high, and our results might have important clinical implications, as these high-risk patients would benefit greatly from precise risk stratification. Accurate stratification could be used to select advanced therapeutic modalities, such as assist device implant and/or heart transplantation, in a timely manner. However, it is unclear whether our findings can be applied to patients with Stage C heart failure who have had a recent episode of acute decompensation.

### C-reactive protein as a potential signpost to trained immunity [^1133aMSk]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been more than 30 years since markers of systemic inflammation (measured by the acute phase proteins: C-reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A) have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes — initially in patients with acute coronary syndromesand subsequently in apparently healthy men. Significantly, the precise "drivers" of this subclinical inflammation are still not clear.

It seems plausible that the levels of these nonspecific markers of inflammation, which are released by the liver, reflect a cumulative "inflammatory load", components of which also drive pathogenic processes relevant to atherosclerosis in parallel. In support of this notion, adverse outcomes pertain across a range of rheumatological and autoimmune diseases, and the precise nature of chronic inflammation seems to matter little. Processes of inflammation within the walls of arteries contribute to the manifestations of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but these (sometimes small, focal) lesions seem more likely to be responding to systemic proinflammatory cues than driving the systemic inflammatory response that is reflected by elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). In other words, systemic drivers of processes of inflammation probably serve to activate cells in the atherosclerotic plaque, as they do elsewhere. This interpretation is supported by events, such as experimental myocardial infarction, that drive inflammation and accelerate atherosclerosis.

### Utility of inflammatory markers in the management of coronary artery disease [^115C5WzD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Certain markers of systemic inflammation are powerful predictors of cardiovascular events. Fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cytokines are among the inflammatory markers associated with various cardiovascular end points. Fibrinogen and CRP both have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality in patients with stable angina. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen also have prognostic value in patients with unstable angina. In addition to prognostic implications, several cardiovascular risk factors (eg, smoking, obesity, diabetes) are associated with high levels of fibrinogen and hs-CRP. Benefits from aspirin are more likely in patients whose hs-CRP levels are very high. Some fibrates decrease fibrinogen levels and hs-CRP. Statin therapy either reduces the CAD risk associated with system inflammation or lowers circulating levels of hs-CRP.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention among individuals with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 5% to 10% and 10% to 20% 10-year risk. implications of the justification for use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial for "intermediate risk" [^1116iqAN]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent primary prevention guidelines issued in Canada endorse the use of statin therapy among individuals at "intermediate risk" who have elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, trial data directly addressing whether this recommendation defines a patient population in which statin therapy is effective have not previously been published.

Methods and Results

In the Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, which demonstrated a 44% reduction in first vascular events when rosuvastatin 20 mg was compared with placebo among 17 802 primary prevention patients with LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L, 6091 participants (2525 women, 3566 men) had baseline estimated 10-year Framingham risks of 5% to 10% and 7340 participants (1404 women, 5936 men) had baseline estimated Framingham risk of 11% to 20%. In these 2 "intermediate risk" subgroups, relative risk reductions consistent with the overall trial treatment effect were observed (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.84; 5-year number needed to treat = 40, P = 0.005 for those with 5% to 10% risk; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.68, 5-year number needed to treat = 18, P < 0.0001 for those with 11% to 20% risk). Use of the Reynolds Risk Score to stratify the study population gave similar results but reclassified large numbers of individuals into lower- or higher-risk groups. The majority of women with elevated hsCRP who benefited from rosuvastatin were at 5% to 10% 10-year risk at study entry using either global risk scoring system.

Conclusions

Consistent with recent evidence-based Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for primary prevention, the JUPITER trial demonstrates that rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduces major cardiovascular events among men and women with elevated hsCRP and "intermediate risk" defined either as 5% to 10% or 10% to 20% 10-year risk.

### Cumulative exposure to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease [^1119xERa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

One measurement of hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this study was to characterize the association of cumulative exposure to increased hs-CRP with incident cardiovascular events.

Methods and Results

We included 53 065 participants with hs-CRP measured at 3 examinations in 2006, 2008, and 2010. Cumulative exposure to hs-CRP was calculated as the weighted sum of the average hs-CRP level for each time interval (level×time). Participants were classified into nonexposed group (hs-CRP < 3.0 mg/L in all 3 examinations), 1-exposed group (hs-CRP ≥ 3.0 mg/L in 1 of the 3 examinations), 2-exposed group (hs-CRP ≥ 3.0 mg/L in 2 of the 3 examinations), and 3-exposed group (hs-CRP ≥ 3.0 mg/L in 3 examinations). Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of cumulative hs-CRP with incident CVD. The study showed a dose-response pattern with risk of CVD and myocardial infarction as the number of years of exposure to hs-CRP increases. Participants in the 3-exposed group had significantly increased CVD risk with hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.38 (1.11–1.72), in comparison with 1.28 (1.07–1.52) for participants in the 2-exposed group and 1.13 (0.97–1.31) for those in the 1-exposed group (P < 0.05); meanwhile, the similar and significant associations were also observed for myocardial infarction with respective hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.13 (1.42–3.18), 1.60 (1.12–2.27), and 1.57 (1.17–2.10). The associations between stroke and cumulative hs-CRP were not statistically significant (P = 0.360).

Conclusions

Cumulative exposure to hs-CRP was dose dependently associated with a subsequent increased risk of CVD and myocardial infarction.

### Additive value of immunoassay-measured fibrinogen and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels for predicting incident cardiovascular events [^116wp2WT]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines suggest measuring high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as an aid to coronary risk assessment in adults without cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether other inflammatory biomarkers, such as fibrinogen, add further prognostic information is uncertain.

Methods and Results

In a prospective study of 27,742 initially healthy middle-aged women, the associations of baseline immunoassay fibrinogen and hs-CRP measurements with incident CVD were examined over a 10-year follow-up period. Compared with women in the bottom biomarker quintile, age-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for incident CVD for quintiles 2 to 5 of fibrinogen were 1.10 (0.86 to 1.41), 1.30 (1.03 to 1.65), 1.46 (1.16 to 1.85), and 2.43 (1.95 to 3.02); for hs-CRP they were 1.48 (1.06 to 2.05), 1.70 (1.24 to 2.33), 2.20 (1.63 to 2.96), and 3.24 (2.43 to 4.31). After further adjustment for established risk factors, both biomarkers remained associated (P for trend ≤ 0.001) with incident CVD (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.71 for top fibrinogen quintile; and hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.29 for top hs-CRP quintile compared with the bottom quintiles). Further adjustment for the other biomarker resulted in hazard ratios of 1.23 and 1.56 (P for trend = 0.02 and 0.002), respectively. Although fibrinogen correlated positively with hs-CRP (rs = 0.41, P < 0.001), the highest CVD risk was associated with elevated levels of both fibrinogen and hs-CRP: age-adjusted hazard ratio of 3.45 (95% CI, 2.60 to 4.57) for women with fibrinogen > 393 mg/dL and hs-CRP > 3 mg/L compared with < 329 mg/dL and < 1 mg/L, respectively.

Conclusions

In this cohort of initially healthy women, baseline levels of fibrinogen measured with a high-quality immunoassay provided additive value to hs-CRP and traditional risk factors in predicting incident CVD.

Adding C-reactive protein (CRP) level to conventional cardiovascular risk models has been suggested to improve risk prediction for cardiovascular events.

### Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises [^115jPovp]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Several lines of evidence suggest that sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with a chronic inflammatory state. In this study of 70 children with SCD at steady state evaluated by a broad panel of biomarkers representing previously examined mechanisms of pathogenicity in SCD, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of low-grade, systemic inflammation, emerged as the most significant laboratory correlate of hospitalizations for pain or vaso-occlusive (VOC) events. While markers of increased haemolytic status, endothelial activation and coagulation activation all correlated positively with VOC events by univariate analysis, baseline hs-CRP levels provided the most significant contribution to the association in multiple regression models (22%), and, hs-CRP, along with age, provided the best fit in negative binomial models. These data highlight the clinical relevance of the role of inflammation in paediatric VOC, providing both a rationale for future therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation in microvessel occlusive complications of SCD, and the potential clinical use of hs-CRP as a biomarker in childhood SCD.

### Narrative review: assessment of C-reactive protein in risk prediction for cardiovascular disease [^111aP9yC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Some experts propose C-reactive protein (CRP) as a screening tool for prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many epidemiologic studies show positive associations between elevated CRP levels and incident CVD. Assessment of the value of new prognostic tests, however, must rely on understanding of test characteristics rather than on associations measured by relative risks. In the case of CRP, test characteristics must be judged in the context of currently available CVD risk prediction algorithms. In this review of literature published before January 2006, the authors describe what is known about the additional utility of CRP in risk prediction. They find no definitive evidence that, for most individuals, CRP adds substantial predictive value above that provided by risk estimation using traditional risk factors for CVD. Use of CRP may add to risk estimation in a limited subset of individuals who are at intermediate predicted risk according to the Framingham risk score. The authors propose that many questions still must be addressed before CRP is incorporated into risk prediction algorithms and before universal screening with CRP can be recommended.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein discordance with atherogenic lipid measures and incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in primary prevention: the ARIC study [^112tLWPu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications for JUPITER‐Like Population

The JUPITER trial increased the eligibility of adults for statin therapy in the United States and is the primary evidence behind the most recent guideline recommendations to use a hsCRP level of > 2 mg/L as a risk enhancer in intermediate risk patients. 32 However, Mora et al 33 showed that residual risk associated with elevated hsCRP in the JUPITER trial could be explained by a higher number of atherogenic particles other than LDL‐C. Given the well‐described discordance between LDL‐C and other, more robust atherogenic lipid measures (ie, non–HDL‐C or apolipoprotein B), 9 we further refined the JUPITER population by sequentially adding atherogenic lipid cut points of percentile equivalence to LDL‐C 130 mg/dL in order to fully assess the lipid‐independent risk attributed to hsCRP. We found that after ≈18 years of follow‐up (about 10‐fold longer than median JUPITER follow‐up), baseline hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L was associated with a 32% to 37% increased risk of ASCVD as compared with hsCRP < 2 mg/L among individuals with LDL‐C < 130 mg/dL and simultaneously more favorable levels of non–HDL‐C (< 160 mg/dL), apolipoprotein B (< 102 mg/dL), TC/HDL‐C ratio (< 4.4), and HDL‐C (≥ 50 mg/dL) combined. This increased independent risk was also independent of their global ASCVD risk assessed by the PCE score. We subsequently advanced these concepts by examining whether hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L was associated with an increased risk of ASCVD when atherogenic lipid levels were as low as LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL, as recommended by some guidelines for high‐risk patients, and percentile equivalent values of non–HDL‐C, apolipoprotein B, and TC/HDL‐C. The results were all consistent, suggesting that we ought to reemphasize the importance of using high‐intensity statin therapy, as recommended by JUPITER, in individuals with hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L regardless of their lipid levels or PCE risk score.

But is heightened inflammation, in primary prevention, also associated with other clinical outcomes over a long period of follow‐up? We were able to show that hsCRP is consistently associated with the risk of incident HF and all‐cause death, which suggests the possibility that inflammation reduction might have a broad favorable impact on several clinical outcomes, as proposed by other studies. 25, 34

### Association between fasting insulin and high-sensitivity C reactive protein in Korean adults [^1162SUhq]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

What are the new findings?

An analysis of Korean adults not taking medicines for diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension also without specific dietary advice showed that fasting insulin is positively associated with high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP).
The OR for high-risk hs-CRP in the subjects whose fasting insulin was > 15 µIU/mL compared with those whose fasting insulin < 5 µIU/mL was 4.59.
Triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein ratio was also associated with hs-CRP, but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not associated with hs-CRP.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Findings support an insulin-lowering lifestyle modification for preventing cardiovascular disease.

### Justification for the use of statins in primary prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) – can C-reactive protein be used to target statin therapy in primary prevention? [^1135K4wK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The most important action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) is their ability to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Statins have proved highly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary prevention studies. However, the magnitude of risk reduction associated with statins is greater than that predicted on the basis of LDL cholesterol lowering alone. A likely explanation for this effect is the anti-inflammatory action of statins. Following the observation that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular events, investigators in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) and Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) trials demonstrated that the magnitude of risk reduction associated with statin therapy was higher among those with elevated hs-CRP levels. In addition, there is accumulating evidence that statins lower plasma levels of hs-CRP in a manner largely independent of LDL cholesterol lowering. In contrast, little benefit has been demonstrated for statin therapy in the absence of both hyperlipidemia and inflammation. Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is a large multinational, long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial designed to assess directly whether statin therapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg/day) should be given to apparently healthy individuals with low LDL cholesterol levels but elevated hs-CRP levels — a critical issue for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Support for the concept behind the JUPITER trial is also now available from several recent trials comparing different intensities of statin therapy on disease progression as well as clinical end points. These studies indicate that the hs-CRP level achieved after initiation of statin therapy may be as important as the LDL cholesterol level achieved. All of these data raise the possibility that hs-CRP could be used to target high-risk patients who may benefit from early statin use. Ongoing work will determine whether hs-CRP reduction, independent of LDL cholesterol reduction, results in a net clinical benefit.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^115LGvfA]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Cumulative incidence of CV events according to study group. Significant relative risk reduction of the primary composite end point of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, revascularization, and CV death in JUPITER is shown. Hazard ratio for rosuvastatin compared with placebo group was 0.56 (95% CI 0.46–0.69, P < 0.00001). Adapted from Ridker et al.

JUPITER also provided further credence for the "dual target" hypothesis. In a prespecified analysis, a 65% reduction in major events was noted in patients who achieved LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dL and hs-CRP < 2 mg/L versus a 33% reduction in patients who realized only one or neither target (P < 0.0001 across treatment groups). Accordingly, JUPITER not only demonstrated that hs-CRP successfully identified a population with "hidden risk" for CV disease but also provided additional evidence for the potential utility of hs-CRP as a target for therapy in primary prevention of CV disease.

Is there any basic science rationale for hs-CRP as a target for therapy?

There is an accumulating body of literature demonstrating a role for CRP as a putative mediator of atherosclerosis, independently and in synergy with other traditional risk factors, such as LDL cholesterol. The mechanisms through which CRP is thought to potentiate atherosclerosis are numerous and diverse. Our understanding of atherosclerosis over the last 3 decades has undergone a paradigm shift from that of a lipid-centric disease to one that is centered on inflammation. Cumulative evidence indicates that inflammation is an active component in all phases of atherosclerosis, from early plaque initiation, to plaque development, rupture, and ultimately acute coronary occlusions (Fig. 2). The results of the hs-CRP blood test are thought to reflect the inflammatory process. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo models of CV disorders including hypertension and thrombosis support this contention and, consequently, there is much interest in CRP as a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. Under physiological conditions, the monolayer endothelium releases an array of substances that interact to promote overall vascular health. A disturbance in endothelial integrity triggers disturbances in the release and activity of these factors, resulting in endothelial dysfunction, a critical initial step in atherosclerosis that often occurs in the absence of angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease and is a common feature of hypertension- and thrombosis-associated complexities.

### Comparison of characteristics of future myocardial infarctions in women with baseline high versus baseline low levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [^117Ayv3c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has previously been shown to be an independent predictor for the development of cardiovascular disease. However, little is known about the association between hs-CRP and the severity of cardiovascular events that occur. This study compared characteristics of incident myocardial infarctions (MIs) in 40 initially healthy women with very high baseline hs-CRP levels (> 7.5 mg/L) with infarctions in 40 women with very low hs-CRP levels (≤ 1 mg/L). At baseline, very high hs-CRP was associated with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension, higher body mass index, lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher triglycerides. Our analysis found that the 2 study groups had similar proportions of ST-segment elevations on electrocardiograms, peak cardiac enzyme levels, postinfarct left ventricular function, and burden of coronary atherosclerosis seen on angiography. However, subjects with very high hs-CRP levels developed infarctions significantly sooner than those with very low hs-CRP levels (median time to event 4.45 vs 6.64 years, respectively, p < 0.0001). In addition, higher baseline levels of hs-CRP were associated with significantly more fatal MIs (0% vs 4.6% vs 9.6% in subjects with hs-CRP levels < 1, 1 to < 3, and ≥ 3 mg/L, respectively, p for trend = 0.02). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that in initially healthy women high levels of hs-CRP predict earlier occurrence of MIs and a greater likelihood that infarctions will be fatal.

### Effects of statin therapy according to plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration in the controlled rosuvastatin multinational trial in heart failure (CORONA): a retrospective analysis [^113zuaHQ]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We examined whether the antiinflammatory action of statins may be of benefit in heart failure, a state characterized by inflammation in which low cholesterol is associated with worse outcomes.

Methods and Results

We compared 10 mg rosuvastatin daily with placebo in patients with ischemic systolic heart failure according to baseline high sensitivity-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) < 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 779; rosuvastatin, n = 777) or ≥ 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 1694; rosuvastatin, n = 1711). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Baseline low-density lipoprotein was the same, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein by 47% in both hs-CRP groups. Median hs-CRP was 1.10 mg/L in the lower and 5.60 mg/L in the higher hs-CRP group, with higher hs-CRP associated with worse outcomes. The change in hs-CRP with rosuvastatin from baseline to 3 months was -6% in the low hs-CRP group (27% with placebo) and -33.3% in the high hs-CRP group (-11.1% with placebo). In the high hs-CRP group, 548 placebo-treated (14.0 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 498 rosuvastatin-treated (12.2 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients had a primary end point (hazard ratio of placebo to rosuvastatin, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.98; P = 0.024). In the low hs-CRP group, 175 placebo-treated (8.9 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 188 rosuvastatin-treated (9.8 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients experienced this outcome (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.34; P > 0.2; P for interaction = 0.062). The numbers of deaths were as follows: 581 placebo-treated (14.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 532 rosuvastatin-treated (12.6 per 100 patient-years) patients in the high hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.00; P = 0.050) and 170 placebo-treated (8.3 per 100 patient-years) and 192 rosuvastatin-treated (9.7 per 100 patient-years) patients in the low hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.43; P = 0.14; P for interaction = 0.026).

Conclusions

In this retrospective hypothesis-generating study, we found a significant interaction between hs-CRP and the effect of rosuvastatin for most end points whereby rosuvastatin treatment was associated with better outcomes in patients with hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/L.

The proportion of patients with hs-CRP levels in the highest quartile increased markedly from mild to moderate to severe stroke. The cumulative risk of a recurrent stroke among individuals in the highest quartile of hs-CRP was 17. 9% compared with a risk of
20. 4% among those in the lowest quartile. In separate models adjusting for risk factors and stroke severity, a well-recognized predictor of mortality after stroke, individuals in the highest quartile of hs-CRP had twice the risk of death but no increase in risk of stroke, MI, or vascular death. There was little change after further adjusting for Lp-PLA2 level. Other studies have suggested that hs-CRP is associated with prognosis in patients with established coronary artery disease. An hs-CRP level greater than 10.

1 mg/L measured within 72 hours of stroke predicted increased mortality during follow-up of up to 4 years. 33 Other researchers34 found that the measurement of CRP at 24 or 48 hours, but not at hospital admission, predicted outcome. An hs-CRP level greater than 15 mg/L at hospital discharge was significantly associated with the occurrence of a new vascular event or death at 1 year in another study, 35 with an HR of 9.
4. Other investigators36 measured hs-CRP levels at least 3 months after a first ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and found that patients in the highest quintile had significantly increased risk of subsequent stroke or MI. Relatively few studies have examined hs-CRP in relation to recurrent stroke independent of an effect on mortality, and those have been limited to specific subtypes of stroke and hospitalized recurrences. 37, 38 Further limitations in these studies include a hospital-based design and post hoc determination of threshold levels.

The present data provide evidence that hs-CRP predicts mortality but not recurrent stroke.

### The cost-effectiveness of C-reactive protein testing and rosuvastatin treatment for patients with normal cholesterol levels [^112qQJMN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of applying the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial results into clinical practice.

Background

The JUPITER trial found that rosuvastatin reduces vascular events in apparently healthy subjects with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) but normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. The implications of expanding treatment recommendations based on these results have not been evaluated.

Methods

We constructed a cost-effectiveness model of men ≥ 50 years and women ≥ 60 years with LDL cholesterol levels of < 130 mg/dl and no known cardiovascular disease. We compared: 1) hs-CRP testing followed by rosuvastatin treatment for patients with hs-CRP levels ≥ 2.0 mg/l; and 2) usual care (i.e., no testing and no treatment). Estimates of treatment effectiveness were based on the JUPITER trial and were varied in sensitivity analyses.

Results

Among patients with LDL < 130 mg/dl and hs-CRP levels ≥ 2.0 mg/l, rosuvastatin had an incremental cost-effectiveness of $25,198 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to usual care. If the effectiveness of rosuvastatin were 50% of that observed in JUPITER, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would increase to $50,871 per QALY. Implementing this strategy only in patients with a Framingham risk score ≥ 10% yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness of $14,205 per QALY. Among such intermediate-risk patients, a JUPITER-based strategy becomes cost-saving at a rosuvastatin price of < $0.86 per day.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin treatment for JUPITER-eligible patients appears to be cost-effective, particularly among those with a Framingham risk score ≥ 10%.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein are independent predictors of cardiovascular events [^111ZNHsv]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many epidemiological studies and pathophysiological findings link hyperlipidaemia to atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, there is also evidence that hyperlipidaemia may interact with inflammation to further increase this risk.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, including lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], are directly associated with atherosclerosis. Atherogenesis is initiated by the retention and accumulation of these lipoproteins in the arterial intima and triggers an inflammatory response that drives plaque progression and may lead to plaque disruption.

Lp(a) is synthesized in the liver and represents a low-density lipoprotein-like particle where the apoB-100 is covalently bound to an additional apolipoprotein, namely apolipoprotein(a). In addition to being cholesterol-rich, Lp(a) is pro-inflammatory through the oxidized phospholipid load carried by apolipoprotein(a); furthermore, due to the homology of the latter with plasminogen, it may also exert pro-thrombotic effects.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) is not a direct cause of cardiovascular disease but serves as a biomarker of systemic low-grade inflammation mediated by cytokines like interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β. These cytokines contribute to the atherosclerotic process by promoting pro-coagulant activity, enhancing monocyte and leucocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, and stimulating the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Elevated LDL-C and Lp(a) levels initiate atherosclerosis, promote, gene expression, modulate cytokines and chemoattractants, and facilitate monocyte migration. This suggests a synergistic effect with low-grade inflammation in atherosclerosis.

Several studies, have analysed the association of LDL-C with Lp(a), LDL-C with Hs-CRP, or Lp(a) with Hs-CRP in participants with or without lipid-lowering therapy on cardiovascular risk, but a recent analysis, including only women examined the overall combined effect of these three biomarkers on the risk for future atherothrombotic events.

We aimed to assess the associations of LDL-C, Lp(a), and the inflammation biomarker Hs-CRP — individually, in pairs, and together — with the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in men and women, using data from the UK Biobank, stratified by the use of cholesterol-lowering medication.

### Prognostic impact of admission high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in acute myocardial infarction patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^1148m3wB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Inflammation and DM in AMI

The involvement of inflammation in atherosclerosis and, consequently, in AMI is well established, as well as the prognostic usefulness of biomarker surrogates, such as hs-CRP, for predicting the risk of mortality and recurrent events. Moreover, observational and randomized studies indicated that cardiovascular benefits are more apparent when systemic inflammation is reduced. In particular, the Aggrastat-to-Zocor (A to Z) trial demonstrated that the clinical outcome of patients with acute coronary syndromes significantly improves when the hs-CRP levels are lowered below 2 mg/L. Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial metabolic disease and growing evidence shows that it is characterized by a state of sub-clinical inflammation, as reflected by chronic high levels of hs-CRP. In AMI, patients with DM show a more severe inflammatory condition than those without DM, and this may, at least in part, explain their higher short-term and long-term mortality risk. However, whether hs-CRP during AMI carries a different prognostic relevance in DM and non-DM patients is still a controversial issue. Indeed, on the one hand, previous studies showed that CRP is an independent predictor of mortality after AMI in both DM and non-DM patients. On the other hand, Meisinger et al. found no association between CRP and long-term mortality (median 4 years) after AMI in DM patients. However, these studies were retrospective analyses of registries including old study populations (enrolled between 1998 and 2004), they considered patients with an outdated DM definition, and, in one study, traditional CRP was assessed. More recently, Xia et al. found that CRP predicts three-year mortality in both DM and non-DM patients with AMI. Yet, in this study, the prognostic relevance of CRP was analyzed according to the CRP median value (8.9 mg/L), a cutoff that may encompass patients with the highest degree of inflammation. Thus, the possible different prognostic impact of hs-CRP in AMI patients with and without DM remains unclear.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to hs-CRP screening in secondary prevention, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider increasing the dosage of statin therapy to a higher intensity range in patients with hs-CRP levels > 2 mg/L, regardless of LDL-C levels.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PzX7q]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The relationship between Lp(a) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the context of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels remains controversial due to conflicting results from previous studies.

Objectives

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the association between Lp(a) and risk of MACE across different hs-CRP levels in both primary and secondary prevention settings.

Methods

We performed a systematic review by searching MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL (Wiley), and Web of Science (Clarivate) from their inception to February 2024. Eligible studies reported the association of Lp(a) with MACE stratified by hs-CRP level. Data extraction and quality assessment were systematically conducted. Meta-analyses used random-effects models to compute pooled HRs for individuals with low (< 2 mg/L) and high (≥ 2 mg/L) hs-CRP levels. Subgroup analyses were performed in primary and secondary prevention populations.

Results

Nine publications encompassing 11 studies that involved 562,301 participants met the inclusion criteria. The mean proportion of females was 39.9% and the weighted mean age for the entire cohort was 61.2 years. Elevated Lp(a) was significantly associated with MACE risk in both low and high hs-CRP groups, with pooled HR of 1.26 (95% CI: 1.11–1.42) and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20–1.47), respectively. In the primary prevention group, the pooled HR for low and high hs-CRP groups was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.06–1.66) and 1.43 (95% CI: 1.13–1.82), respectively (subgroup difference, P = 0.65). The corresponding HRs for the secondary prevention population were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.00–1.27) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.12–1.52), respectively (subgroup difference P = 0.13).

Conclusion

Elevated Lp(a) is associated with an increased risk of MACE independent of hs-CRP levels in both primary and secondary prevention populations.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nVNcA]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been increasingly recognized as an independent causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Lp(a) is proinflammatory and a potent atherogenic lipoprotein present in elevated levels in approximately 20% of individuals. Since its discovery nearly 6 decades ago, the focus of research has expanded to elucidate its role in atherosclerosis, particularly its complex relationship with systemic inflammation, a key factor in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is suggested to upregulate the LPA gene by binding to the promoter region, influencing apolipoprotein(a) synthesis, and ultimately circulating Lp(a) concentration. Oxidized phospholipids, known to bind preferentially to Lp(a) in the plasma, are central to its pathogenicity and promote inflammation and exacerbate endothelial damage.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a widely recognized biomarker of systemic inflammation, often used in clinical settings to assess inflammatory status as well as inflammation-related ASCVD risk. Multiple recent studies have evaluated the association of Lp(a) with the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the context of hs-CRP levels. These studies have been conducted in both primary and secondary prevention populations, have dichotomized hs-CRP levels using the cut-off of 2 mg/L, and have yielded conflicting results. Evidence from large primary prevention studies such as the UK Biobank, BiomaCARE, and Copenhagen General Population Studysuggests that elevated Lp(a) levels correlate with increased ASCVD risk, seemingly independent of hs-CRP levels. Similar findings have been reported in secondary prevention populations from the FOURIER-TIMI 59 (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk - Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 59) and SAVOR-TIMI 53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53) trials. Conversely, data from the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosisprimary prevention cohort and multiple secondary prevention cohorts, including studies from BiomaCARE, the ACCELERATE trial, and Chinese cohorts from Fuwai Hospital, report no significant association between Lp(a) and ASCVD risk in individuals with low hs-CRP (< 2 mg/L).

### Children with type 1 diabetes have elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein compared with a control group [^112W466T]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been traditionally linked to type 2 diabetes, it is also the most important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with type 1 diabetes. Data from large epidemiologic studies worldwide indicate that the incidence of type 1 diabetes has been increasing by 2%–5% worldwide, and coronary disease is 2–10 times more prevalent among patients with type 1 diabetes compared with non-diabetic subjects.

Some reports conclude that glycemic control measures obtained using glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) could point to a primary risk factor for atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes. However, even though the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial found that higher levels of HbA1c were associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications, hyperglycemia does not fully explain the elevated risk of CVD. Data on the relationship between HbA1c and cardiovascular complications are weak, as large clinical trials and epidemiological cohort studies in adults have had conflicting results. In addition, long-term studies in children are lacking. As a result, the study of additional markers that could play a role in the elevated cardiovascular risk and in the inflammatory process and endothelial dysfunction observed in early childhood merits further investigation. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between acute hypoglycemia and indexes of systemic inflammation. These studies suggest that hyperglycemia as well as acute hypoglycemia produces complex vascular effects involved in the activation of proinflammatory mechanisms in type 1 diabetes.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is a well-known independent inflammation marker involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This protein is increased in patients with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, because of its precision, accuracy, and standardization, hsCRP is considered one of the best inflammation markers in clinical practice.

Changes in weight can modify hsCRP concentrations in children with type 1 diabetes, and these changes have important implications for clinical practice.hsCRP is considered an important link between atherosclerosis, CVD, and insulin resistance. Several studies have identified higher levels of hsCRP as a risk factor for cardiovascular events in children with obesity, adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and for the progression of diabetes complications.

Despite this evidence, hsCRP has been poorly studied in children with type 1 diabetes. In addition, most studies in adults have included patients with potentially confounding factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking, and diabetes complications, and as a result the extent to which hsCRP is associated with CVD risk factors in children and adolescents has yet to be elucidated.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112xA2hm]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize findings on the association between Lp(a) and MACE risk in the context of hs-CRP levels. Our study provides compelling evidence that elevated Lp(a) is significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE across varying levels of hs-CRP. Specifically, we observed that the association persists both in contexts of low (< 2 mg/L) and high (≥ 2 mg/L) hs-CRP, with pooled HRs of 1.24 and 1.33, respectively. These results were consistent across primary and secondary prevention populations, underscoring the robustness of Lp(a) as an independent risk factor for MACE, regardless of inflammatory status as indexed by hs-CRP (Central Illustration).

The pooled HRs for the association between elevated Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) stratified by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels are illustrated. Data were pooled from 562,301 individuals participating in eleven large studies including primary and secondary prevention cohorts. The figure shows that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of MACE across both low (< 2 mg/L) and high (≥ 2 mg/L) hs-CRP levels. Subgroup analyses in primary and secondary prevention populations further detail the consistent risk elevation across different hs-CRP strata. Studies: UK Biobank, MESA(Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), Copenhagen General Population Study, FOURIER-TIMI 59 (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk), SAVOR-TIMI 53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus), ACCELERATE (Assessment of Clinical Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibition with Evacetrapib in Patients at a High Risk for Vascular Outcomes), BiomaCARE (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe), REGARDS (REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke), CRIC (The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) and 2 cohorts from Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China.

### C-reactive protein comes of age [^114CtaH3]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death throughout the world despite advances in its detection and treatment. Commonly used risk algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score fail to identify all affected individuals. Novel cardiovascular risk factors that identify these missed individuals would greatly improve overall care of patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory biomarker, has emerged as a leading candidate to fulfill this role. Based on the results of several prospective epidemiologic studies, CRP has emerged as one of the most powerful predictors of cardiovascular disease. This marker provides valuable information to clinicians in various clinical settings, ranging from overt cardiovascular disease, stable angina, presenting acute coronary syndromes and peripheral vascular disease, to the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, CRP has been demonstrated to actively contribute to all stages of atherogenesis, participating in endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic-plaque formation, plaque maturation, plaque destabilization and eventual rupture. Thus, it might also serve as a therapeutic target. It is our contention that the future will see much wider use of CRP and CRP-driven therapies in clinical medicine, improving our ability to identify and manage cardiovascular disease.

Forest plots illustrating the pooled HRs for the association between elevated Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in both low hs-CRP (< 2 mg/L) and high hs-CRP (≥ 2 mg/L) groups. This meta-analysis includes data from eleven studies with various populations, reflecting significant heterogeneity (I² = 88% for low hs-CRP and I² = 86% for high hs-CRP). The HRs are stratified by hs-CRP levels to demonstrate the differential impact of inflammation on the cardiovascular risk posed by elevated Lp(a) levels. Elevated Lp(a) was significantly associated with MACE risk across low and high hs-CRP groups, with pooled HR of 1.26 (95% CI: 1.11–1.42) and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20–1.47), respectively. hs-CRP = high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; IV = inverse variance; Lp(a) = lipoprotein(a); MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events; SE = standard error.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level in stable-state bronchiectasis predicts exacerbation risk [^114ck4D6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Elevation of systemic inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and total white cell count, has been found to correlate with the extent of the disease and poor lung function in bronchiectasis. The CRP value was associated with a greater risk of future severe exacerbations but not with mild or moderate exacerbations in patients with steady-state bronchiectasis from the Spanish Registry of Bronchiectasis (RIBRON).

High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is a simple blood test that is readily available in many healthcare facilities. It is also repeatable and serial measurements are feasible. Hs-CRP also has the advantage over CRP that it can detect low-grade inflammation, which may be present in chronic inflammatory conditions such as bronchiectasis. As an inflammatory marker, hs-CRP has been extensively studied in cardiovascular diseases. There is little data on the level of hs-CRP and its relationship with the prognosis in bronchiectasis. One study suggested that circulating hs-CRP levels were significantly correlated with HRCT scores and resting oxygen saturation in patients with stable non-CF bronchiectasis. However, there is a lack of data on the role of hs-CRP in predicting bronchiectasis exacerbation, which is associated with negative impact on morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and health care costs. In this study, we aim to assess the association between hs-CRP level and the risks of bronchiectasis exacerbation.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115F2KVX]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that elevated Lp(a) level is associated with MACE risk across hs-CRP categories in both primary and secondary prevention populations. This underscores the importance of Lp(a) as an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular events across different populations. The findings advocate for a more inclusive approach to cardiovascular risk assessment, one that considers Lp(a) levels alongside traditional markers such as hs-CRP. They also highlight the need for broader clinical recognition and targeted management strategies that could potentially include novel Lp(a)-lowering therapies.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: This systematic review and meta-analysis clarifies that elevated Lp(a) level is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) independent of hs-CRP levels in both primary and secondary prevention populations.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: This study underscores the translational potential of integrating Lp(a) measurement into clinical practice for cardiovascular risk stratification and management of ASCVD, including the potential use of Lp(a) targeting therapies in clinical practice.

### Cumulative exposure to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease [^115Ni2UW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, making it important to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, as well as the preventive strategies. Inflammation is essential to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, 1, 2 the basic pathological process of most CVD. 3, 4, 5 Owing to fact that changes in vascular inflammation can be hard to evaluate by current cardiac imaging methods, the role of circulating inflammatory biomarkers is increasing. Among the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers, hs‐CRP (high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein) has been the most profoundly studied and received much more attention for its prospect as a cost‐effective and stable predictor for CVD screening and risk reclassification. 6 Multiple prospective cohort studies, including the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) Study, have reported that increased CRP (C‐reactive protein) levels were significantly associated with increased CVD event risk. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Data from a stroke‐free, multiethnic, and community‐based cohort study, NOMAS (the Northern Manhattan Study), have suggested that participants with hs‐CRP > 3 mg/L were at significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–2.77), but the ability of hs‐CRP to predict cerebrovascular events was not confirmed. 12 It is noteworthy that previous analyses to investigate whether hs‐CRP really predicts future cardiovascular events were based on a single hs‐CRP measurement, and variability in hs‐CRP concentration remains unaccounted for. 13, 14, 15 However, a single measurement of high hs‐CRP does not mean that the body state has sustained a high hs‐CRP for a long time. In addition, metabolic dysregulation, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, dietary patterns, environmental pollutant burden, and potential inflammation, may lead to incidental high hs‐CRP concentration. Thus, a single high hs‐CRP may lead to incorrect classification of the risk assessment for CVD events.

### Enhanced trained immunity in peripheral monocytes in unstable angina with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [^115bt94h]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) leads as a cause of death globally. As highlighted by the Annual Report of Cardiovascular Health and Diseases, the mortality rate of ASCVD is still on the rise in China. Despite current practice in the guideline-based optimal treatment strategies including lipid-lowering and other medications, revascularization, and lifestyle intervention, many with coronary artery disease (CAD) experience recurrent cardiovascular events. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory treatments can further reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular events in CAD patients.

Numerous studies have confirmed the prognostic significance of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) for cardiovascular events in relation to cardiovascular inflammation. The CANTOS trial (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study), which enrolled CAD patients with elevated hsCRP (≥ 2 mg/L), demonstrated reduced recurrent events after anti-interleukin (IL)-1β treatment. This finding also underscores hsCRP as a robust and clinically useful marker for distinguishing those patients with increased inflammation who may benefit most from targeted anti-inflammatory interventions.

### Increasing high-sensitive C-reactive protein level predicts peritonitis risk in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients [^113LK6gx]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic inflammation remains an important adverse effect in patients undergoing dialysis. Several markers of inflammation have been used in clinical practice, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor. The CRP level is the most common indicator of inflammatory status. CRP is a nonglycated protein produced by human hepatocytes in response to infection, inflammation, or tissue damage. It is composed of 5 identical noncovalently linked subunits that form a symmetrical pentagonal structure with a molecular weight of 105 kDa. CRP is present at very low levels in the normal population. Levels < 1 mg/dL are considered insignificant, levels from 1 to 10 mg/dl are considered moderately elevated, and levels > 10 mg/dl are markedly elevated. Several methods are currently available commercially for use in clinical laboratories to measure CRP. The most commonly used are immunonephelometric and immunoturbidimetric assays. Recent studies have used newly developed high-sensitivity tests for CRP. These ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are capable of measuring CRP at a concentration of 0.007 mg/L.

An elevated CRP level, which is a marker of malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (the MIA syndrome), is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Although a statistically significant association between the CRP level and cardiovascular disease has been observed in various studies, the relative contributions of CRP as a marker, causative agent, or consequence of the MIA syndrome are unclear in the dialysis population. In recent literature, a strong emphasis has been placed on an elevated CRP level as an important predictor of clinically apparent inflammatory infectious disorders based on cross-sectional analyses. However, the relationship between a single CRP measurement or variability in CRP levels and the risk of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remains uncertain. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have published data on the prognostic value of dynamic high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) changes for peritonitis risk in PD patients.

### High-sensitive C-reactive protein as a marker for inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome [^113f99Qr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies demonstrated low-grade inflammation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, these studies have been relatively small and do not enable examination of this factor in different subtypes of IBS and the possibility of confounding effects of comorbidities that may be associated with inflammatory responses.

Goals

To investigate the association between high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and the diagnosis of IBS, IBS subtypes, symptoms' severity, and IBS-associated comorbidities.

Study

This cross-sectional study uses data from a large matched case-control study of IBS subjects and healthy controls (HC). hs-CRP levels were measured in all subjects. IBS diagnosis was determined by Rome III criteria, negative screening blood tests, and normal colonoscopy. Subjects were evaluated for IBS severity and associated pain and psychological comorbidities.

Results

A total of 242 IBS patients and 244 HC were studied. Median hs-CRP levels in the IBS group were significantly higher than in HC (1.80; interquartile range, 0.7 to 4.04 mg/L vs. 1.20, interquartile range, 0.5 to 2.97 mg/L respectively, P < 0.006). Levels were highest in IBS-D patients with greater disease severity. Hs-CRP levels mildly correlated with symptoms severity (r = 0.169, P = 0.009); this correlation was stronger for the IBS-D patients (r = 0.27, P = 0.006). IBS was a significant independent predictor (P = 0.025) for higher hs-CRP levels, whereas other pain and psychological comorbidities were not.

Conclusions

Given these observations of cross-sectional differences in hs-CRP between IBS subtypes and severity, independent of pain and comorbidities, more research is needed to explore a possible role of low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis and/or clinical presentation of IBS.

### C-reactive protein predicts outcome in COVID-19: is it also a therapeutic target? [^113UQF6d]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Following our original report of the predictive significance of CRP and serum amyloid A protein measurement in acute coronary syndrome, there was intense cardiological interest in CRP, producing much controversial, confusing, and misleading literature. The early observational epidemiology studies, based on a limited number of events despite large population sizes, exaggerated the significance of the association between increased baseline CRP values and cardiovascular disease risk. The conflation of association with causality popularized the idea that CRP was a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, not just a possible risk marker, and this misconception became widespread despite the general agreement that, for example, the cock crowing before dawn is not actually what causes the sun to rise. The misapprehension was strengthened by poorly conducted and uncontrolled experimental work purporting, falsely, to show that CRP is an inherently proinflammatory mediator of atherosclerosis; see, for example, Pepys.

In fact, the predictive association between baseline CRP and cardiovascular disease risk in general populations is modest. It is shared equally by other markers of inflammation such as fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, and white cell count, and reflects the fact that most of the proven causal risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, smoking, lack of exercise, low socioeconomic status, and chronic low grade inflammatory conditions, are all associated with low grade systemic inflammation and modestly increased baseline CRP values. Even the very limited clinical utility of CRP measurement for cardiovascular disease risk is likely to be outweighed if increased CRP values are used by cardiologists exclusively for this purpose and not considered in the whole-patient context. This risks missing serious underlying diseases. On the other hand, full investigation before CRP testing has been repeated, to ensure that a raised value is persistent, will often reveal nothing but will incur large costs and provoke much spurious anxiety. Clinical CRP testing must be done and interpreted properly.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level in stable-state bronchiectasis predicts exacerbation risk [^116boszj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Baseline serum hs-CRP level at stable-state can predict bronchiectasis exacerbation in the subsequent year. This is in support of the role of chronic low-grade inflammation in bronchiectasis, which is reflected by hs-CRP level, in association with bronchiectasis exacerbation risk.

### Inflammation and cardiovascular disease: 2025 ACC scientific statement: a report of the American college of cardiology [^113qYdfU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to hs-CRP screening in secondary prevention, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that several novel anti-inflammatory agents, including IL-6 inhibitors, are currently being evaluated in ongoing randomized trials in the contexts of CKD, dialysis, HFpEF, and acute coronary syndrome.

### Baseline characteristics of participants in the JUPITER trial, a randomized placebo-controlled primary prevention trial of statin therapy among individuals with low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [^112av839]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial of statin therapy among persons with average to low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol who are at increased cardiovascular risk due to elevated plasma concentrations of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). A total of 17,802 persons with LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dl (3.36 mmol/L) and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L were recruited from 26 countries and randomly allocated to 20 mg/day rosuvastatin or placebo. In contrast to previous studies of statin therapy in primary prevention, JUPITER is evaluating a group with modest plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol (median 108 mg/dl, interquartile range 94 to 119). Further, the trial includes 6,801 women (38.2%) and 5,577 participants with metabolic syndrome (32.1%). Thus, in addition to broadening our understanding of statin therapy and inflammation, the JUPITER trial will provide important and clinically relevant information on primary prevention among patients who do not currently qualify for lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, as 20 mg of rosuvastatin can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 50%, JUPITER will also provide crucial safety data for several thousand patients who should achieve LDL cholesterol levels < 50 mg/dl on a long-term basis.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pQTcH]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

These discrepancies highlight the variability in outcomes and the complexity of the interactions between Lp(a), systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular risk. Given these conflicting results, a systematic review and meta-analysis is essential to synthesize these diverse findings and evaluate the role of Lp(a) in cardiovascular risk across different hs-CRP levels. This approach leverages the increased statistical power of pooled data to provide a more definitive understanding of how Lp(a)-related cardiovascular risk varies with systemic inflammation, thereby addressing a critical knowledge gap.

### C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and cardiovascular disease prediction [^113Rmhst]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

There is debate about the value of assessing levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other biomarkers of inflammation for the prediction of first cardiovascular events.

Methods

We analyzed data from 52 prospective studies that included 246,669 participants without a history of cardiovascular disease to investigate the value of adding CRP or fibrinogen levels to conventional risk factors for the prediction of cardiovascular risk. We calculated measures of discrimination and reclassification during follow-up and modeled the clinical implications of initiation of statin therapy after the assessment of CRP or fibrinogen.

Results

The addition of information on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a prognostic model for cardiovascular disease that included age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol level increased the C-index, a measure of risk discrimination, by 0.0050. The further addition to this model of information on CRP or fibrinogen increased the C-index by 0.0039 and 0.0027, respectively (P < 0.001), and yielded a net reclassification improvement of 1.52% and 0.83%, respectively, for the predicted 10-year risk categories of "low" (< 10%), "intermediate" (10% to < 20%), and "high" (≥ 20%) (P < 0.02 for both comparisons). We estimated that among 100,000 adults 40 years of age or older, 15,025 persons would initially be classified as being at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event if conventional risk factors alone were used to calculate risk. Assuming that statin therapy would be initiated in accordance with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (i.e., for persons with a predicted risk of ≥ 20% and for those with certain other risk factors, such as diabetes, irrespective of their 10-year predicted risk), additional targeted assessment of CRP or fibrinogen levels in the 13,199 remaining participants at intermediate risk could help prevent approximately 30 additional cardiovascular events over the course of 10 years.

Conclusions

In a study of people without known cardiovascular disease, we estimated that under current treatment guidelines, assessment of the CRP or fibrinogen level in people at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event could help prevent one additional event over a period of 10 years for every 400 to 500 people screened.

### Hs-CRP and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality risk: a meta-analysis [^116p4fwU]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Inconsistent findings have been reported on the association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and mortality risk. The objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association of elevated baseline hs-CRP levels with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality risk in the general population.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for studies published from inception to October 2016. Prospective observational studies were eligible if they reported the effects of elevated baseline hs-CRP levels on cancer-related, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in the general population. The pooled adjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) comparing the highest to the lowest category of hs-CRP levels was used as association measures.

Results

A total of 83,995 participants from 14 studies were identified. When comparing the highest to the lowest category of hs-CRP levels, the pooled RR was 1.25 (95% CI 1.13–1.38) for cancer-related mortality, 2.03 (95% CI 1.65–2.50) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.75 (1.55–1.98) for all-cause mortality, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that the effect of elevated hs-CRP levels on cancer-related mortality was observed in men (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.11–1.43) but not in women (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.83–1.27).

Conclusions

Elevated hs-CRP levels can independently predict risk of all-cause, cardiovascular mortality in the general population. However, the gender differences in the predictive role of hs-CRP on cancer mortality should to be further investigated.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1123rLBE]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study benefits from the large sample size, a rigorous methodological approach, including a comprehensive search strategy and robust statistical analysis, lending confidence to our findings. However, our findings should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, Lp(a) was measured using different assays across studies and there was variability in the cutoff values used for defining elevated Lp(a), in addition, the definition of MACE varied across studies, these limit direct comparisons across studies. Second, in 4 cohorts, where HRs were reported for Lp(a) as a continuous variable, we converted them to dichotomized values, which could have biased our estimates towards the null. Third, we could not assess the impact of race/ethnicity on the differential association of Lp(a) risk across hs-CRP levels. It is well established that individuals of African ancestry typically exhibit higher levels of Lp(a) compared to other racial groups. However, the papers included in the meta-analysis lacked racial diversity, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Fourth, while there was consistency in defining hs-CRP categories, some studies did not indicate if individuals with extremely high hs-CRP levels were excluded, which often indicates acute illnesses or an active rheumatologic condition. Also, the distribution of Lp(a) is rightly skewed, hence the majority of participants in the studies included in our meta-analysis have low Lp(a) levels. Consequently, the analysis of pooled HRs may obscure any potential effects in the clinically significant high Lp(a) subgroup. This limitation suggests that a potential modification of Lp(a) function by an inflammatory milieu might not be adequately captured in our pooled analysis. Furthermore, IL-1β, IL-6, and oxidized phospholipids, which are closely linked to Lp(a) in the inflammatory cascade, were not assessed in these studies. Fifth, the use of study-level data rather than individual-level data limits our ability to perform subgroup analysis and may introduce potential bias. Sixth, although RCTs provide superior internal validity, their interventions may confound the association between Lp(a) and MACE, potentially reducing the generalizability of our findings. To address this, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding RCT's and the results remained consistent with the primary analysis. Seventh, the high heterogeneity of studies indicates substantial variability, which potentially reduces the reliability in the pooled estimates.

### Physical activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and total and cardiovascular disease mortality in type 2 diabetes [^111vJbPo]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A role for inflammation has become well established in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Several cytokines and acute-phase reactants have been examined as predictors of atherosclerotic disease, but the best studied is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). hs-CRP also has been shown to predict, independently of conventional risk factors, coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general population and also in patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, CHD mortality risk is from two- to fourfold in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison with nondiabetic subjects, and > 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes die from CHD. Therefore, it has been contemplated that anti-inflammatory therapies might reduce excess mortality in type 2 diabetic patients.

Physical activity is known to reduce inflammation and hs-CRP levels. However, no study has investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of physical activity on CVD mortality. Therefore, we investigated the association of physical activity with CVD and total mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes with and without elevated levels of hs-CRP in a large, population–based, 18-year follow-up study.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein: a novel cardiovascular risk predictor in type 2 diabetics with normal lipid profile [^111W7DUg]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2011). Low credibility.

Background

India is the diabetic capital of the world. Coronary heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis are complex diseases sharing common antecedents like inflammation. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), an acute phase reactant protein, is a proinflammatory atherogenic circulating marker which can prove to be an independent cardiac risk predictor.

Aim

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of hs-CRP as an independent cardiovascular risk marker among Indians with type 2 diabetes with normal lipid profile.

Settings and Design

This was a case control study including 60 type 2 diabetics with normal lipid profile and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

Materials and Methods

Twelve-hour fasting blood samples were collected from all the participants. Serum was assayed for hs-CRP and lipid profile.

Statistical Analysis

Results were analyzed by unpaired t test.

Results

We found elevated hs-CRP levels (4.8 ± 0.2, P < .0001) among cases compared to controls (0.9 ± 0.1). According to hs-CRP levels, seven cases were in the low-risk (< 1 mg/l), 32 in the moderate-risk (1–3 mg/l), and 21 in the high-risk (3–10 mg/l) group with mean values of hs-CRP of 0.7 ± 0.2, 1.75 ± 0.7, and 5.8 ± 1.4, respectively. Relative risk was 4.75 with odds ratio of 10.23 (95% confidence interval 8.8–11.23).

Conclusion

The study suggests that hs-CRP is an independent cardiac risk predictor even with normal lipid profile and can help measure additional risk. The American Heart Association stated that patients in the intermediate- and high-risk group may benefit from therapeutic lifestyle change and that cardiovascular event may be prevented.

### A 1-year lifestyle intervention for weight loss in individuals with type 2 diabetes reduces high C-reactive protein levels and identifies metabolic predictors of change: from the look AHEAD (action for health in diabetes) study [^114mbaue]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We examined whether a 1-year intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) for weight loss reduced elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in obese individuals with diabetes and identified metabolic and fitness predictors of hs-CRP change.

Research Design and Methods

Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is an ongoing multicenter clinical trial examining the effects of weight loss achieved through ILI on cardiovascular events and overall mortality in obese/overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. We report on 1,759 Look AHEAD participants who had hs-CRP and fitness data at baseline and 1 year. Subjects were randomly assigned to ILI or to usual care (diabetes support and education [DSE]). ILI involved frequent counseling to increase moderate-intensity exercise to 175 min/week, reduce caloric and saturated fat intake, and change macronutrient composition to improve glycemic control.

Results

ILI reduced median hs-CRP by 43.6% from baseline to 1 year, compared with a 16.7% reduction with DSE (P < 0.001). ILI decreased weight (8.8%), A1C (0.7%), and triglycerides (17%) and increased fitness (19%) and HDL cholesterol (7.5%) (P < 0.0001 vs. changes with DSE). Changes in adiposity and glucose control with ILI remained independent predictors of hs-CRP change at 1 year (P < 0.0001 for each) after adjustment for demographics, smoking, cardiovascular history, statin and thiazolidinedione use, and changes in fitness and lipid control. Neither statin nor insulin therapy modified the association between ILI and hs-CRP.

Conclusions

A 1-year lifestyle intervention for weight loss in obese individuals with diabetes was associated with substantial reductions in hs-CRP. Improved glycemic control and reduced adiposity had comparable effects on hs-CRP change.

Finally, there is a potential for publication bias, as suggested by the asymmetry in the funnel plot for the high hs-CRP group. This may potentially lead to overestimation of the true effect size due to the disproportionate influence of published studies.

### Statin therapy and risk of fracture: results from the JUPITER randomized clinical trial [^117BXSc4]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease may share common biological pathways, with inflammation playing a role in the development of both. Although observational studies have suggested that statin use is associated with a lower risk of fractures, randomized trial data addressing this issue are scant.

Objective

To determine whether statin therapy reduces the risk of fracture and, in a secondary analysis, whether baseline levels of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with the risk of fracture.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 17,802 men older than 50 years and women older than 60 years with hs-CRP level of at least 2 mg/L. Participants were screened from 2003 to 2006 and observed prospectively for up to 5 years (median follow-up, 1.9 years).

Intervention

Rosuvastatin calcium, 20 mg daily, or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident fracture was a prespecified secondary end point of JUPITER. Fractures were confirmed by radiographs, computed tomography, bone scan, or other methods. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals for the risk of fracture according to randomized treatment assignment, as well as increasing tertiles of hs-CRP, controlling for potential confounders.

Results

During the study, 431 incident fractures were reported and confirmed. Among participants allocated to rosuvastatin, 221 fractures were confirmed, compared with 210 among those allocated to placebo, such that the incidence of fracture in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups was 1.20 and 1.14 per 100 person-years, respectively (adjusted HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.88–1.28]; P = 0.53). Overall, increasing baseline hs-CRP level was not associated with an increased risk of fractures (adjusted HR for each unit increase in hs-CRP tertile, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.94–1.20]; P for trend, .34).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among men and women with elevated hs-CRP level enrolled in a large trial of rosuvastatin therapy for cardiovascular disease, statin therapy did not reduce the risk of fracture. Higher baseline hs-CRP level was not associated with an increased risk of incident fracture.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111SpaeW]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — risk-enhancing factors for intermediate risk indicates that knowledge of risk-enhancing factors is useful for all individuals but particularly for those at intermediate risk (ASCVD risk of 7.5% to ≤ 20%). An example cited is that a family history of premature ASCVD identified women ≥ 60 years of age with elevated hs-CRP and without ASCVD who benefited from high-intensity statin therapy, and those with primary LDL-C elevations of ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L) have elevated lifetime ASCVD risk.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^116mw7YP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure. Blood levels of the prototypic acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is hepatically synthesized and released in response to interleukin-6 stimulation, is markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Markedly high CRP levels correlate with poor prognosis for survival. Insights into CRP structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 pathologies and prognoses. Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of CRP blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in COVID-19 patients.

### C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms, C-reactive protein blood levels, and cardiovascular disease risk [^114YSW8A]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of inflammation and a hallmark of the acute-phase response, has been shown to be a powerful and specific predictor of cardiovascular event risk in populations of otherwise healthy persons. Here we review what is known about CRP gene polymorphisms, discuss how these might affect the epidemiology of CRP and our understanding of CRP's contribution to cardiovascular disease, and examine their potential clinical usefulness. Evidence shows that certain subtle variations in the CRP gene sequence, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms, predictably and strongly influence the blood level of CRP. Some of these variations are associated with clinical correlates of cardiovascular disease. If future studies can establish with certainty that CRP influences cardiovascular biology, then CRP gene profiling could have clinical utility.

### Serum interleukin-6 level is reflected in elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level in patients with systemic sclerosis [^111GeQ8y]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic connective tissue disease of unknown etiology which presents immunological, vascular and connective tissue abnormalities. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 has been reported to be elevated in patients with SSc. Clinical and laboratory findings affecting the elevated level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were studied in patients with SSc. Clinical and laboratory findings also included serum IL-6 level. Thirty-nine SSc patients (male: female = 7:32, age 19–84 years, mean 62.6 years) were studied. hs-CRP was measured with a nephelometric assay. Serum IL-6 level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The distributions of hs-CRP showed that 18 cases (46.2%) were not elevated (< 0.07 mg/dL), but 21 cases (53.8%) were (≥ 0.07 mg/dL). Alkaline phosphatase and IL-6 in SSc patients with elevated hs-CRP (291 ± 95 U/L, 3.23 ± 2.74 pg/mL) were significantly more elevated than those in not elevated patients (221 ± 75 U/L, 1.53 ± 1.12 pg/mL) (P < 0.02, P < 0.01). The correlation between hs-CRP level and IL-6 level in SSc patients was 0.687 (P < 0.001). In conclusion, elevated serum IL-6 levels are reflected in elevated hs-CRP levels in SSc patients.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nfHHQ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis

In the primary prevention population, the pooled HR for the low and high hs-CRP groups were 1.33 (95% CI: 1.06–1.66) and 1.43 (95% CI: 1.13–1.82), respectively, with a nonsignificant subgroup difference (P = 0.65). The corresponding HR for the secondary prevention population was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.00–1.27) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.12–1.52), respectively, with a nonsignificant subgroup difference (P = 0.13) (Figure 3).

Pooled HRs for the Association Between Lipoprotein(a) and MACE Stratified by hs-CRP Levels in Primary and Secondary Prevention Populations

The pooled HRs demonstrating the association of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) across different hs-CRP levels, categorized into primary and secondary prevention groups. The forest plots show HRs for low (< 2 mg/L) and high (≥ 2 mg/L) hs-CRP conditions in primary and secondary prevention settings. In the primary prevention group, the pooled HR for low and high hs-CRP groups was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.06–1.66) and 1.43 (95% CI: 1.13–1.82), respectively (subgroup difference, p = 0.65). The corresponding HRs for the secondary prevention population was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.00–1.27) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.12–1.52), respectively (subgroup difference p = 0.13). There was no significant difference between primary and secondary prevention populations, indicating a consistent influence of Lp(a) across various clinical contexts. hs-CRP = high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; IV = inverse variance; Lp(a) = lipoprotein(a); MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events.
