## Question

Nasal polyp history taking

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to take a history for suspected nasal polyps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core symptom cluster and duration that distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps from other sinonasal diseases. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent evaluation. Next, I will review comorbidities and risk factors that change management, including asthma, AERD, allergy, and immunodeficiency. After that, I need to check prior treatments and surgeries to gauge severity and refractoriness. Finally, I will consider quality-of-life impact, medication and social history, and how to integrate this into a concise, prioritized summary that guides testing and therapy decisions.

> Let me first confirm the cardinal symptoms and chronicity. CRSwNP typically presents with nasal obstruction, hyposmia or anosmia, thick nasal drainage, and facial pressure or fullness persisting for at least 12 weeks, which helps distinguish it from acute rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis, and I should explicitly ask about smell loss because it is a hallmark feature and often the most bothersome symptom for patients [^112kPfno] [^116UjouH] [^117DQGbA].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that require expedited workup. Unilateral symptoms, bloody discharge, focal pain, epistaxis, or a unilateral mass should raise concern for neoplasm and warrant prompt endoscopy and imaging rather than attributing symptoms to routine polyps, and I should not forget that pediatric nasal polyps are uncommon and should trigger evaluation for cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia, which changes the diagnostic pathway substantially [^115inXbe] [^112Qd7Yc] [^1111AvTU].

> I need to check for comorbid asthma and AERD next, because these are common and materially alter management. I should ask about wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, nocturnal symptoms, and any history of respiratory reactions to aspirin or NSAIDs, and if AERD is suspected, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically when the triad is present and consider aspirin desensitization in appropriate candidates, noting that desensitization without daily aspirin is ineffective and that missing doses after desensitization risks loss of tolerance [^1129oBr4] [^111yUFJq] [^114spnnC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about allergy being causal. I should ask about seasonal or perennial symptoms, ocular itch, sneezing, and atopic history, but I must remember that while allergic rhinitis is common and may coexist, it is not the primary driver of most CRSwNP, so I should document allergy but avoid overattributing causality without testing or phenotype support [^112CBRBR] [^114EAxv6].

> Next, I should review prior medical and surgical therapy to gauge disease severity and refractoriness. I need to quantify intranasal steroid adherence and technique, count oral steroid bursts or courses in the past year, and document any prior endoscopic sinus surgery, because frequent systemic steroids and prior surgery are key criteria for considering biologics and also correlate with worse baseline disease burden in registries [^1179i7sm] [^113jEYFT].

> I will now examine quality-of-life impact using a validated tool. SNOT-22 is recommended to quantify disease burden and track response, with a minimally important difference of about 8.9 to 12 points, and I should also ask about sleep disturbance, fatigue, cognitive effects, and missed work or school, since these patient-centered outcomes drive shared decision-making and are emphasized in contemporary guidelines [^112UUTPQ] [^116sXZnK].

> But wait, what if the patient reports frequent "sinus infections" or "winter colds"? I should clarify the frequency, duration, and character of episodes to distinguish recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from chronic disease, and I should ask about purulence, fever, and response to antibiotics, because recurrent acute disease suggests different risk factors and may require culture-directed strategies or evaluation for immunodeficiency rather than assuming CRSwNP alone [^1168HSaS] [^116cr4bM].

> I need to ensure I capture medication and social history that modify risk and adherence. I should document tobacco or vaping exposure, intranasal drug use, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, and any bleeding diathesis, and I should screen for depression, anxiety, and health literacy, since these factors influence both perioperative risk and long-term control with topical therapy and biologics [^1164papw] [^1116JEYj].

> Let me consider how to synthesize this into a concise, prioritized summary. I should confirm the presence of bilateral nasal polyps by endoscopy or CT when needed, document type 2 inflammatory features if considering biologics, and align management with guideline-based steps: saline irrigation, optimized intranasal corticosteroids, a short oral steroid course for flares, evaluation for AERD and asthma, and consideration of biologics for refractory disease with type 2 inflammation and impaired quality of life, while avoiding empiric antibiotics or antifungals that do not help CRSwNP [^112kZRdz] [^1179i7sm] [^113y5Z1o].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include a strict symptom duration threshold of 12 weeks as a diagnostic criterion, but I should correct that nuance: 12 weeks is the chronicity threshold for CRS, whereas the presence of polyps is confirmed by endoscopic or CT visualization, so I should state that symptoms must be chronic and then separately confirm polyp presence rather than conflating the two [^116gx88Y] [^112kPfno].

A focused nasal polyp history should document **chronic nasal obstruction, hyposmia/anosmia, and persistent posterior nasal drainage** for at least 12 weeks [^112kPfno], and screen for **asthma, aspirin/NSAID sensitivity, and allergic rhinitis** as key comorbidities [^11313CbX] [^111yUFJq]. Ask about prior sinus surgery, recurrent infections, and systemic steroid use to gauge severity and recurrence risk [^113jEYFT] [^116xoKv1]. Use SNOT-22 to quantify symptom burden and quality-of-life impact [^112UUTPQ]. Red flags (unilateral symptoms, bloody discharge, focal pain, weight loss) warrant urgent evaluation for neoplasm or atypical disease [^115inXbe].

---

## Core symptom assessment

- **Nasal obstruction**: Chronic, bilateral, and persistent; often severe enough to cause mouth breathing and sleep disturbance [^115a6bxm].

- **Hyposmia/anosmia**: A hallmark feature, often profound and persistent [^112kPfno].

- **Posterior nasal drainage**: Thick, mucoid discharge with frequent throat clearing [^115a6bxm].

- **Facial pressure/fullness**: Common but typically less prominent than obstruction or smell loss [^112kPfno].

- **Duration**: Symptoms must persist for at least 12 weeks to meet chronic rhinosinusitis criteria [^116gx88Y].

---

## Comorbidities and associated conditions

- **Asthma**: Present in ~40–50% of patients; assess control and severity [^notfound].

- **Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD)**: Classic triad of asthma, nasal polyps, and NSAID sensitivity; confirm history of respiratory reactions to aspirin/NSAIDs [^111yUFJq].

- **Allergic rhinitis**: Common but not universal; document seasonal/perennial symptoms and triggers [^112CBRBR].

- **Cystic fibrosis**: Consider in children with polyps or recurrent infections [^112Qd7Yc].

- **Primary immunodeficiency**: Consider in recurrent or severe disease [^115owKdo].

---

## Disease severity and recurrence risk

Document **prior sinus surgery** — number, dates, and indications — and note **recurrence** with rapid regrowth, which signals aggressive disease [^113jEYFT]. Quantify **systemic steroid use** (courses per year, total dose) to reflect severity and guide biologic candidacy [^1179i7sm]. Record **infection frequency** (acute exacerbations/year) and any hospitalizations for sinusitis or asthma [^116xoKv1].

---

## Patient-reported outcome measures

Use **SNOT-22** to quantify symptom burden and quality-of-life impact; a change ≥ 8.9 points is clinically meaningful [^112UUTPQ]. Also assess **smell testing** (e.g. UPSIT) when feasible to objectify olfactory dysfunction [^112UUTPQ].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- **Unilateral symptoms**: Unilateral obstruction, discharge, or pain raises concern for neoplasm [^115inXbe].

- **Bloody discharge**: Hemoptysis or persistent blood-tinged discharge warrants urgent evaluation [^115inXbe].

- **Focal pain or swelling**: Suggests invasive disease or neoplasm [^notfound].

- **Weight loss or systemic symptoms**: Evaluate for malignancy or granulomatous disease [^notfound].

---

## Sample history-taking framework

| **Category** | **Key questions** |
|-|-|
| Core symptoms | - Nasal obstruction <br/> - Hyposmia/anosmia <br/> - Posterior drainage <br/> - Facial pressure <br/> - Duration ≥ 12 weeks [^112kPfno] |
| Comorbidities | - Asthma <br/> - AERD/NSAID sensitivity <br/> - Allergic rhinitis <br/> - CF/immunodeficiency [^11313CbX] [^115owKdo] |
| Severity/recurrence | - Prior surgery <br/> - Systemic steroids <br/> - Infection frequency <br/> - Hospitalizations [^113jEYFT] [^116xoKv1] |
| Red flags | - Unilateral symptoms <br/> - Bloody discharge <br/> - Focal pain/swelling <br/> - Weight loss [^115inXbe] |
| Patient-reported outcomes | - SNOT-22 <br/> - Smell testing (UPSIT) [^112UUTPQ] |

---

A focused nasal polyp history should prioritize **chronic obstruction, smell loss, and drainage** for ≥ 12 weeks, screen for asthma/AERD/allergy, quantify prior surgery and steroids, and flag red flags; integrating SNOT-22 and objective smell testing improves assessment and guides therapy.

CRSwNP with AERD — ATAD remarks and implementation considerations emphasize safety, eligibility, and monitoring. The main factor driving recommendation type is the close balance of patient-important benefits and harms. Aspirin desensitization alone (without subsequent daily aspirin therapy) is thought to be ineffective for patients with AERD, and this applies only to patients with CRSwNP who have AERD and does not apply to patients with CRSwNP with aspirin-sensitivity that is not AERD. In all cases, the diagnosis of CRSwNP must be confirmed by using appropriate diagnostic tools including direct visualization of nasal polyps with nasal endoscopy. To consider ATAD, patients should have a diagnosis of AERD, defined by a convincing history of a respiratory reaction to aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or by development of respiratory symptoms during an aspirin challenge. Conducting an aspirin desensitization requires training of staff and a setting where reactions can be managed, and patients and families require specific education including what to do if a procedure requires temporary cessation of aspirin. When choosing to prescribe ATAD, clinicians should discuss both desensitization and long-term aspirin risks, monitor clinical symptoms and medication adherence, provide ongoing advice about aspirin dosing, and monitor for adverse effects of long-term aspirin use.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113oH42v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps — key action statement and management: The clinician should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS. Recommendation based on observational studies with preponderance of benefit over harm, and policy level: Recommendation. The exact prevalence of nasal polyps in rhinosinusitis is unknown, but about 4% of patients with CRS have concurrent polyps. Smaller nasal polyps in the middle meatus or in the posterior nasal cavity, however, may only be detected by nasal endoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the sinuses is often useful in evaluating CRS with nasal polyps, especially for unilateral polyps, concern for polyps extending outside of the nasal cavity, or other atypical presentations. For unilateral processes, tissue biopsy and imaging are often required to differentiate unilateral polyps from other pathologies; scraping of nasal polyps is not recommended. Topical nasal steroid sprays are indicated for long-term treatment of nasal polyps in the setting of CRS. If no response is seen within 3 months, a short course of oral corticosteroids can be considered. Off-label topical corticosteroids in the nasal cavity such as budesonide, may also be beneficial.

### The role of biologics in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^112Sswsb]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple questions remain unanswered. The role of biologics in relation to the timing of surgical interventions and combination approaches needs to be investigated. Determining tissue endotype and developing biomarkers are important for patient selection and determining response to biologic therapy. Recommendations by a National Institutes of Health–sponsored workshop and the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Disease (EUFOREA) have provided recommendations on incorporating biologic therapy into care pathways. The EUFOREA recommendations provide guidance on patient selection for biologics based on the history of sinonasal surgery already performed or not. If a patient has had no history of surgery, then the patient should meet 4 of the following criteria (or 3 criteria if there is a history of surgery): (1) evidence of T2 inflammation, (2) 2 or more courses of corticosteroids in the past 1 year, (3) significantly impaired quality of life, (4) significant loss of smell, and (5) diagnosis of comorbid asthma. Although based on expert opinion, these guidelines are helpful for physicians when deciding if biologic treatment is appropriate for their patients. Ultimately, physicians should engage in shared decision-making conversations with their patients with a focus on patient preferences and goals. These criteria can be helpful in discussing the utility of biologics for individual patients.

In summary, the role of emerging biologics in the treatment algorithm of CRSwNP is still being developed. Based on available data, biologic agents may be beneficial in patients with persistent polyps despite maximal medical therapy, have recurrence despite surgery, or have T2 comorbid allergic diseases including moderate to severe asthma or AERD. Future studies and real-world evidence will determine how biologics fare in the long run. As new evidence develops regarding biologics for CRSwNP, it will continue to inform patient selection and practice management.

### Diagnostic algorithm for evaluating nasal airway obstruction [^115NW9nW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Nasal obstruction is a common symptom and can have a large impact on patient quality of life. There are numerous causes, including anatomic, congenital, inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, toxic, and systemic. An algorithmic approach can aid in ensuring all pertinent patient information is incorporated into the final diagnosis and treatment plan. Key components include a thorough history, physical examination including modified Cottle and Cottle maneuver, patient-reported outcome measures and/or quality of life questionnaires, examination with and without decongestion, and nasal endoscopy. The resultant information can then be effectively used to narrow the differential and guide the next steps in management.

Rhinosinusitis is a spectrum of diseases with varied causes, presentations, and diagnostic approaches-from viral and bacterial acute rhinosinusitis to chronic inflammatory or fungal etiologies. This article reviews the diagnosis of acute, chronic, recurrent, and fungal rhinosinusitis, highlighting key clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic features that distinguish these entities. It provides practical guidance on differentiating viral from bacterial causes, assessing chronic inflammation with and without polyps, and recognizing rare but serious fungal infections. It also explores emerging diagnostic tools such as biomarkers and artificial intelligence that are reshaping personalized care in sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^113XSAjx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) patient history and physical examination — Action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to promote a consistent and systematic approach to initial evaluation of the patient with AR, an aggregate evidence quality of Grade C based on observational studies, and a high level of confidence in the evidence. Benefits include avoiding unnecessary treatment or testing, timing referrals appropriately, instituting a specific therapy, improving quality of life and productivity, and improving accurate diagnosis, while risks, harms, and costs include inappropriate treatment and potential misdiagnosis from using history and physical alone; the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments state that although a conclusive diagnosis of AR is difficult without diagnostic testing, making a presumptive diagnosis of AR based on history and physical examination alone is reasonable, and intentional vagueness clarifies that the words "clinical diagnosis" acknowledge a presumptive diagnosis not confirmed with testing.

### Consensus from European experts on severe eosinophilic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: results from the overSEA Delphi study [^1144evT4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the OverSEA study provides insights into current clinical practices and indicates that patients with SEA should also be assessed for comorbid upper airways diseases, such as CRSwNP. Opinions on the use of multidisciplinary approaches in the management of SEA and CRSwNP have been previously described in qualitative discussions, but no structured Delphi across-Europe study has been conducted until now. Any patient with CRSwNP should be screened for comorbid asthma. The initial evaluation of a patient with SEA should include current asthma symptom control (via ACT), evaluation of loss of smell, nasal endoscopy, history of AERD/NERD, adherence to inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids, and receipt of SCS therapy. The existence of a pathophysiologic continuum of type 2 inflammation between the lower and upper airways, often referred to as united airway disease, suggests potential benefits of a collaborative or multidisciplinary team approach to disease management. Forming multidisciplinary groups could lead to the development of guidelines or checklists, and other resources for national and international implementation. This could encompass the endorsement of common symptom tests and/or PROs for evaluating SEA and CRSwNP, particularly during the initial assessment, during follow-up, and in relation to biologics.

This Delphi survey also highlights areas that require attention, including potential referral challenges, defining a biomarker matrix for screening, benefits and potential risks of surgical interventions, and encouraging timely intervention with biologic therapy in patients with SEA and comorbid CRSwNP.

Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) — algorithm highlights: Chronic rhinosinusitis consists of signs and symptoms compatible with rhinosinusitis persisting at least 12 weeks, and evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan to clarify the extent of disease and specific location or locations of obstruction. The CT scan ideally should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management; and consider evaluation by otolaryngologist.

Covariates of interest

Consistent with a previous analysis on the heterogeneity in the burden of exacerbations in eosinophilic asthma, this analysis focused on 15 commonly recorded patient characteristics, including age, sex (male or female), ethnicity (Hispanic or other), body mass index (BMI), history of smoking (yes or no), duration of asthma, pre-bronchodilator value of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV₁), FEV₁ bronchodilator responsiveness (in %), the ratio of post-bronchodilator FEV₁/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), a history of nasal polyps, BEC, serum IgE level, long-term OCS use, ACQ5 score, and number of previous severe exacerbations, all measured at baseline or the 12 months preceding study enrolment. Of note, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was not included because it was measured only in DREAM but not in MENSA.

### The sinonasal outcome test-22 or European position paper: which is more indicative of imaging results? [^1153Gdxd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Amid the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) practice environment, - otolaryngologists have faced the challenge of making diagnoses without the typical reliance on concurrent fiberoptic exam. During telehealth encounters, we often need to proceed with medical decisions based on described symptoms and histories. With this in mind, we have experienced a renewed interest in the ability of isolated subjective symptom reports to predict objective findings such as imaging results. These symptoms are also often importantly used to determine whether a patient should be seen in person for further evaluation (eg, imaging) and/or surgical consideration, as well as to what degree and timing such follow-up should occur. It has thus become incumbent upon us to discern which symptom components and combinations are most useful when diagnosing conditions that would have readily relied on potentially aerosol-generating procedures such as nasal endoscopy for assessment in the past.

When taking a history, we have traditionally asked patients and families to report symptoms in a gestalt or dichotomous way (eg, How have your sinuses been? or Do you have facial pain?). This approach is often sufficient to determine whether patients meet the symptom component of diagnostic criteria such as those used in EPOS, which defines key symptoms according to their presence or absence, further qualified by a specified duration. Over time, incorporation of validated instruments such as SNOT-22 into daily practice has become more commonplace, such that patients may routinely receive more in-depth assessments of severity across a broader set of symptoms. These data suggest that SNOT-22 nasal domain scores and EPOS-defined symptoms have similar discriminatory capacity for Lund-Mackay results when assessed via ROC-AUC, while SNOT-22 nasal domain scores have a significant association with Lund-Mackay scores when assessed via ordinal regression models. These data suggest that SNOT-22 nasal domain scores could provide added diagnostic value. These results are particularly relevant in the current practice setting in which we first need to assess based on symptoms alone, as physical exam and imaging more frequently cannot be simultaneously obtained relative to concern for risks and/or patient deferral of in-person visits to health care facilities amid the current pandemic. -

### EPOS / EUFOREA update on indication and evaluation of biologics in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 2023 [^1179i7sm]. Rhinology (2023). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "2023 EPOS/EUFOREA criteria for biologic therapy in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps" for chronic rhinosinusitis.

The 2023 EPOS/EUFOREA criteria for biologic therapy in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a clinical calculator developed by the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) and the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA). This calculator is specifically designed for patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), a chronic inflammatory condition of the nasal and sinus mucosa.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to guide clinicians in determining the appropriateness of biologic therapy for patients with CRSwNP. It takes into account various factors such as the severity of the disease, the patient's response to previous treatments, and the presence of comorbidities like asthma or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.

The EPOS/EUFOREA criteria should not be used in patients without CRSwNP, or in those with contraindications to biologic therapy. It is also not intended to replace clinical judgment or individualized patient care.

This tool helps evaluate whether patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are eligible for biologic therapy by checking specific clinical criteria. It requires three main inputs: entry criteria, evidence of type 2 inflammation, and clinical status.

Entry criteria involve having bilateral nasal polyps and a history of endoscopic sinus surgery, unless surgery isn't advisable (denoted as A).

Evidence of type 2 inflammation can be shown through:

- Tissue eosinophils of 10 or more per high power field (B)
- Blood eosinophils of 150 or more per microliter (C)
- Total immunoglobulin E of 100 UI/mL or more (D)

For clinical status, one or more of these conditions should be considered:

- Frequent need for systemic corticosteroids (at least two courses per year or a low-dose regimen for over three months), or situations where such corticosteroids can't be used (E)
- Significantly reduced quality of life, indicated by a Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 score of 40 or more (F)
- Notable loss of smell, determined by anosmia on a smell test (G)
- Coexistent asthma that requires regular inhaled corticosteroids (H)

The criteria are met if the entry requirement (A) is satisfied and at least one type of evidence of type 2 inflammation (B, C, or D) is present alongside any two clinical status conditions (E, F, G, or H). Alternatively, if any three of the clinical status conditions are observed, or when all four are present, it also fulfills the requirement.

By evaluating these combinations, the tool helps determine eligibility for biologic therapy based on defined clinical benchmarks. The presence of these conditions supports the conclusion that the criteria have been met, indicating a patient may be considered for biologic therapy. When not enough criteria combination fits, it suggests the criteria have not been met.

Nasal polyps (NPs) represent a common clinical end point for a myriad of inflammatory disease processes involving the paranasal sinuses. Chronic rhinosinusitis is the most common cause for NPs, but not all NPs are created equally. This article outlines the current understanding of pathogenesis in nasal polyposis and discusses the implications on therapy.

### Consultation for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and asthma: clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and treatment options [^1129oBr4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa, affects over 12% of the US population, and costs over $20 billion annually. CRS can be divided into 2 major phenotypes based on whether nasal polyps are present (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [CRSwNP]) or absent (chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps). This grand rounds review will discuss the clinical approach to patients with CRSwNP, including typical presentations, workup, and currently available treatment options. Tools that physicians can use to assess subjective sinonasal symptoms, as well as objective measures of disease, will be reviewed. Additional focus will be on recognizing clinical comorbidities commonly associated with CRSwNP, including asthma, bronchiectasis, allergic rhinitis, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease. Clinical outcomes can be improved by providing a comprehensive approach to evaluating (and managing) patients with CRSwNP.

### Biomarkers in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^11137Xka]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is a complex disease that exists along the inflammatory spectrum between types 1 and 2 inflammation. The classic phenotypic differentiation of chronic rhinosinusitis based on the presence or absence of inflammatory polyps remains one of the best differentiators of response to therapy. Development of biologics for the treatment of atopic disease and asthma and topical therapies for sinusitis have placed renewed emphasis on understanding the pathophysiology of polyp disease. Identification of key markers of polyposis will allow for better stratification of inflammatory polyp disease endotypes to objectively identify medical therapies and track response to treatment.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — examination focus and comorbidities are outlined: "Physical examination and nasal endoscopy may help distinguish patients with CRSsNP from those with CRSwNP". In pediatrics, "the presence of polyps should raise concerns about CF". Because of asthma overlap, "these patients should be evaluated with a directed history and physical examination focusing on the lower respiratory tract", and "The absence of audible wheezing does not exclude the possibility of asthma; subtle abnormalities might only be apparent on spirometry". For unilateral disease, "A tumor should be ruled out in a patient with unilateral CRS".

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^117D9UDE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations — GRADE meanings — states that the strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends"), or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests") and has the following interpretations. For a strong recommendation, for patients most fully informed people in this situation would want to follow the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; for clinicians most individuals should receive the intervention or test and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences; and for policy makers the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. For a conditional recommendation, for patients the majority of fully informed people in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and a discussion between them and their health care professional may help reach a decision (ie, shared decision making); for clinicians recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences and decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences; and for policy makers policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders and performance measures about the suggested course of action should focus on documentation of appropriate decision-making processes.

### Contemporary classification of chronic rhinosinusitis beyond polyps vs No polyps: a review [^116E1Srt]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a broadly defined process that has previously been used to describe many different sinonasal pathologic conditions from odontogenic sinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis to the more contemporary definition of broad inflammatory airway conditions. Previous classification systems have dichotomized these conditions into CRS with nasal polyps and CRS without nasal polyps. However, clinicians are learning more about the inflammatory subtypes of CRS, which can lead to improved delivery and effectiveness of treatment.

Observations

In clinical practice, treatment decisions are often based on observable findings, clinical history, presumed disease, and molecular pathophysiologic characteristics. A proposed classification system is simple and practical. It proposes that the functional anatomical compartments involved create the first level of separation into local and diffuse CRS, which are usually unilateral or bilateral in distribution. Diffuse does not imply "pansinusitis" but simply that the disease is not confined to a known functional anatomical unit. This classification takes into account whether local anatomical factors are associated with pathogenesis. Then the inflammatory endotype dominance is separated into a type 2 skewed inflammation, as this has both causal and treatment implications. The non-type 2 CRS encompasses everything else that is not yet known about inflammation and may change over time. The phenotypes or clinical examples are CRS entities that have been described and how they align with this system.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although research continues to further define the subtypes of CRS into phenotypes and endotypes, the proposed classification system of primary CRS by anatomical distribution and endotype dominance allows for a pathway forward.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^112GTCNc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations — For patients, a strong recommendation means "Most fully informed people in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", whereas for a conditional recommendation "The majority of fully informed people in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and it may need more discussion between them and their health care professional first". For clinicians, strong recommendations state "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional recommendations specify "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients; clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with that patient's values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations "can be adopted as policy in most situations" and "could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional recommendations note "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision-making is appropriate". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments" though sometimes based on "low or very low certainty of the evidence", while conditional recommendations are "likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research" and that evaluating the underlying judgments "will help identify possible research gaps".

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115z8wbG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — examination methods and differential diagnosis emphasize that both history and physical examination are essential to increase diagnostic accuracy, and the greatest benefit of completing the physical exam is to exclude the rare, but potentially life-threatening intranasal tumor that may co-exist with allergic rhinitis (AR). The nasal-pharyngeal exam can usually be accomplished with a nasal speculum and appropriate lighting or an otoscope with a nasal adapter, although these provide a more limited view than a nasopharyngolaryngoscope; when mucosal edema limits the exam, a topical nasal decongestant may reduce edema to improve visualization. Assessment tools can include pneumatic otoscopy to evaluate tympanic membrane mobility and transudative fluid and, at times, an impedance tympanometer; a nasopharyngolaryngoscope exam should be completed when a more extensive nasal/pharyngeal/laryngeal evaluation is required because of suspected structural or functional abnormalities, inadequate therapeutic response, or suspected complications. The differential diagnosis of chronic rhinitis symptoms includes AR, nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), mixed rhinitis, common mimics such as rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps and nasal septal deviation, and more uncommon conditions.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnostic approach and distinguishing features are outlined as follows: History elements include "Recurrent rhinosinusitis, otitis, sinus surgeries, diagnosis of rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, atopic asthma, bronchiectasis", and examination may show "Findings compatible with CRS with or CRS without nasal polyps". Diagnostic studies listed are "Nasal nitric oxide; nasal brush biopsy and electron microscopy exam are definitive tests; consider genetic testing; consider chest x-ray". The text notes there is no definitive single test, stating "there is no "gold standard" for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia", and that older screening methods "are no longer recommended". An algorithmic sequence is described in which "the first step… is to obtain nasal nitric oxide and a nasal mucosal brushing for high-speed videomicroscopy analysis", followed, if equivocal or normal, by "transmission electron microscopy and for cell culture and repeat high-speed videomicroscopy analysis", and, if still equivocal, "genetic testing for known primary ciliary dyskinesia variants". Availability is limited as "Many of the tests described are only available in specialty centers", and some modalities are investigational, with "inhalation of colloid albumin–tagged technetium Tc 99… available only as a research tool".

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^111BXhts]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Bleeding disorders in prospective rhinoplasty patients — history-taking, risk assessment, and testing — should be addressed by asking about coagulation disorders that may increase the risk of perioperative blood loss or a hypercoagulable state that may result in thrombotic events, and preoperative assessments should include discussion of excessive bruising, bleeding after small injuries, epistaxis, family history of bleeding disorders, bleeding after previous surgery, current anticoagulation medications, prior need for transfusion, platelet dysfunction/thrombocytopenia, and supplements that may affect bleeding, as well as previous deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and risk factors for increased thrombosis. Coordination of care with the patient's primary care physician or hematologist should be considered to manage bleeding disorders prior to choosing elective rhinoplasty, and routine preoperative laboratory screening (eg, coagulation testing) is not supported for elective surgery without additional risk factors.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^116xoKv1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) with symptoms more than 12 weeks is evaluated and managed using an algorithm that begins with evaluation (sinus CT and/or nasal endoscopy, consider culture, consider evaluation for aeroallergens — especially perennial aeroallergens — and other environmental triggers, and consider evaluation for immunodeficiency), followed by initial treatment with topical steroids, nasal saline irrigation, and an oral steroid, with consideration of an oral antibiotic (culture-based, if possible). After the decision point "Treatment successful?", the Yes branch leads to follow up to consider further evaluation of underlying risk factors and to continue individualized medical therapy; the No branch leads to additional treatment and evaluation including sinus CT if not done before (MRI for special cases), consideration of an alternate oral antibiotic, culture if not done before, consideration of immunodeficiency if not done before, consultation by an otolaryngologist for surgery, consideration of aspirin desensitization for aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), consideration of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), continuation of topical steroid and nasal saline irrigation, and management of comorbid asthma if present. Additional notes state that nasal examination may show mucosal erythema, edema, and purulent secretions in addition to polyps; evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan, and the CT scan should ideally be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; nasal polyps are relatively uncommon in children, and their presence should prompt evaluation for possible CF; and patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management.

### Assessing nasal air flow: options and utility [^117RNcQK]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

This article focuses on the tools that are available to assess nasal airflow, their utility in clinical practice, and comparison between them. Assessment of the nasal airway traditionally relied on history and physical examination only. Recently, tools have been developed that aid the physician in completing an assessment by measurement of parameters that are directly or indirectly related to airflow. Many physiologic and pathologic conditions can influence the amount of airflow or nasal airway resistance. These conditions can include normal changes, such as the nasal cycle, or pathology, such as septal deviations, turbinate hypertrophy, tumors, synechiae, nasal congestion or obstruction, allergies, nonallergic rhinitis, and sinonasal polyposis. Objective measures can be used to assist the clinician to diagnose and treat nasal complaints and also for objective quantification for research.

### The sinonasal outcome test-22 or European position paper: which is more indicative of imaging results? [^114JnGUk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is a highly prevalent medical condition, affecting 11.6% of American adults. This condition underlies more than 4.1 million visits to physiciansand an estimated $60 billion in health care expenditures each year. Visits for affected patients each begin with a staple of the clinical encounter: an inquiry into individuals' symptoms and relevant history. Prior studies of patient-reported symptoms and diagnostic impressions related to chronic rhinosinusitis have had mixed results, with some data suggesting useful specificity and sensitivity, while others suggest poor discrimination across reports. -

Chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms have been conceptualized in multiple ways in clinical practice, whether through proposed diagnostic criteria or research tools. For example, the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) is a validated measure of patient symptom severity increasingly used in routine practice. While originally developed for research, this instrument has demonstrated properties that provide information for clinical decision making and monitoring treatment response. - Nasal-specific items within SNOT-22 comprise their own domain, based on mathematical analyses and understanding of typical patient presentations. At the same time, the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) has provided widely used diagnostic criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis, which incorporates a clearly defined means of cataloguing specific aspects of sinonasal symptomatology.

Particularly in the current clime of telehealth and cost considerations, understanding how specific patterns and details of symptom assessments can predict radiological imaging findings provides important information to support clinical decision making. Previous studies of the relationship between SNOT-22 overall score and imaging scores have documented no relationship,- although nasal domain scores may have correlation with computed tomography (CT) findings. - Data assessing EPOS-defined symptoms related to imaging findings have been more limited. - To our knowledge, the predictive ability of EPOS-defined nasal categorization has not been previously studied in comparison to SNOT-22 assessments. Given the current practice environment, it becomes of interest to assess how we can optimally assess patients' symptom descriptions to best discern those who would have objective imaging findings. Our objective was therefore to determine whether SNOT-22 nasal domain scores or EPOS-defined symptom sets were more indicative of imaging results. The null hypothesis was that SNOT-22 nasal scores and EPOS-defined symptoms would have no difference in their associations with Lund-Mackay CT scores.

Asthma occurs frequently as a comorbid condition in many patients presenting with common otolaryngology conditions, such as allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. The classic presentation of asthma includes symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness but can include other symptoms such as cough. The diagnosis is made mainly through history, although pulmonary function testing, spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and impulse oscillometry may also prove helpful.

### Aspirin intolerance: does desensitization alter the course of the disease? [^111Gkj5w]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid and to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was first described in 1922. The clinical picture reveals a classic triad of symptoms: aspirin-induced bronchial asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In many cases, nasal polyps reveal as the first symptom of ASA sensitivity, indicating that the upper airways are predominantly involved in the pathogenetic process. The emphasis of this article is on the upper airways of ASA-intolerant patients. Imbalance of the eicosanoids leukotrienes and prostaglandins might be the pathophysiologic key to the disease. The patient's history and challenge tests with lysine-aspirin are the diagnostic tools of choice. Apart from surgical or pharmacologic therapy, ASA-desensitization therapy is the treatment of choice. Various desensitization protocols and routes of administration are discussed.

### Lack of efficacy of symptoms and medical history in distinguishing the degree of eosinophilia in nasal polyps [^114fVFvT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Distinguishing eosinophilic nasal polyps (NP) from noneosinophilic NP will impact prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness.

Objective

To investigate the ability of clinical history and biomarkers to distinguish these conditions.

Methods

A total of 74 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for NP were enrolled. Clinical presentations were evaluated using the 22-item sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22). Biomarkers included absolute eosinophil count, IgE, and extent of tissue hyperplasia on sinus computed tomography scan. Tissue eosinophilia was quantified in 10 random hpf and data analyzed addressing both peak and average results.

Results

No component of the SNOT-22 was predictive of tissue eosinophilia. Similarly, a medical history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease was not predictive. An absolute eosinophil count of more than 300 was associated with NP tissue eosinophilia. In contrast, neither IgE nor extent of sinus computed tomography hyperplasia was predictive.

Conclusions

The ability to individualize therapies for NP is dependent on identifying clinical features or biomarkers of eosinophilia. However, with the exception of circulating eosinophilia, we could not identify a clinical feature or biomarker that robustly predicted the presence of tissue eosinophilia. Even more problematic, even the seeming "criterion standard" determination of tissue pathology was of limited value, as our cohort displayed a continuous spectrum of tissue eosinophil expression, making arbitrary any definitive cutoff distinguishing these conditions.

Asthma remission on treatment — In patients with severe asthma receiving biological therapy and medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), remission rates will vary by baseline population characteristics and by how remission is defined and assessed; baseline predictors of remission on treatment include better short-term asthma symptom control scores (ACT or ACQ), better lung function, fewer comorbidities, earlier asthma onset, and no or lower maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS), while in adult-onset asthma studied off treatment the only baseline predictors of clinical persistence were moderate-to-severe airway hyperresponsiveness and nasal polyps; although most data are from adults with severe asthma treated with biologics, the concept is relevant to patients with asthma of any severity and any treatment (including ICS-containing therapy, oral pharmacotherapies, allergen immunotherapy and non‑pharmacological interventions), and when discussing 'remission' with patients the medical meaning for asthma should be explained and patients should not stop taking any of their asthma medications except on medical advice; research needs include linking clinical criteria with biomarkers/imaging/pathology and investigating predictors of long-term remission or recurrence, and clinical and qualitative research is needed to know whether aiming for remission improves long-term outcomes.

### Diagnostic evaluation in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^112HfK8H]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a distinct clinical condition characterized by chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and hypersensitivity reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Distinguishing AERD from other forms of chronic sinusitis, asthma, and NSAID reactivity has important clinical implications for management. The clinical history is helpful, but not adequate for confirming the diagnosis of AERD, in most cases. Diagnostic provocation challenge remains the only way to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of AERD. This article discusses the utility of the clinical history and the current evidence regarding measures that optimize the safety of performing diagnostic NSAID provocation challenges.

### Tezepelumab in adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^113W5RDn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment with tezepelumab has been effective for sinonasal symptoms in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and a history of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, but its efficacy and safety in adults with severe, uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults with physician-diagnosed, symptomatic, severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps to receive standard care and either tezepelumab (at a dose of 210 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The coprimary end points were the changes from baseline in the total nasal-polyp score (range, 0 to 4 [for each nostril]; higher scores indicate greater severity) and the mean nasal-congestion score (range, 0 to 3; higher scores indicate greater severity) at week 52. Key secondary end points assessed in the overall population were the loss-of-smell score, the total score on the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22; range, 0 to 110; higher scores indicate greater severity), the Lund-Mackay score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), the total symptom score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), and the first decision to treat with nasal-polyp surgery or use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, or both, assessed in time-to-event analyses (individual and composite).

Results

In total, 203 patients were assigned to receive tezepelumab and 205 to receive placebo. At week 52, the patients who received tezepelumab had significant improvements in the total nasal-polyp score (mean difference vs. placebo, -2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.39 to -1.74) and the mean nasal-congestion score (-1.03; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.86) (P < 0.001 for both scores). Tezepelumab significantly improved the loss-of-smell score (mean difference vs. placebo, -1.00; 95% CI, -1.18 to -0.83), SNOT-22 total score (-27.26; 95% CI, -32.32 to -22.21), Lund-Mackay score (-5.72; 95% CI, -6.39 to -5.06), and total symptom score (-6.89; 95% CI, -8.02 to -5.76) (P < 0.001 for all scores). Surgery for nasal polyps was indicated in significantly fewer patients in the tezepelumab group (0.5%) than in the placebo group (22.1%) (hazard ratio, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.09); there was significantly less use of systemic glucocorticoids with tezepelumab (5.2%) than with placebo (18.3%) (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27) (P < 0.001 for both time-to-event analyses).

Conclusions

Tezepelumab therapy led to significantly greater reductions in the size of nasal polyps, the severity of nasal congestion and sinonasal symptoms, and the use of nasal-polyp surgery and systemic glucocorticoids than placebo in adults with severe, uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

### Clinical phenotypes of nasal polyps and comorbid asthma based on cluster analysis of disease history [^116gpuon]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal polyps and comorbid asthma (NPcA) is a common united airway disease and is highly heterogeneous with respect to clinical, physiologic, and pathologic parameters. The clinical phenotypes of NPcA are poorly understood.

Objective

We sought to explore clinical phenotypes in patients with NPcA.

Methods

Patients first diagnosed with NPcA were recruited from Rhinological Clinics and Respiratory Clinics. We clustered patients with NPcA based on parameters regarding natural courses and demographic characteristics. Patients were also evaluated with respect to clinical, functional, and inflammatory parameters in both upper and lower airways.

Results

Clustering of 110 cases resulted in 3 clusters: cluster 1 (n = 16, 14.55%, atopic NPcA) was predominantly atopic patients with child-onset airway symptoms, intermediate disease duration, history of family asthma, better lung function, and less severe asthma; cluster 2 (n = 32, 29.09%, smoking NPcA) was characterized by more smokers, short disease duration, adult-onset airway symptoms, less atopy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sensitivity, prior sinus surgery history, eosinophilic airway phenotypes, worse lung function, and severe computed tomography appearance; and cluster 3 (n = 62, 56.36%, older NPcA) consisted mostly of older patients with long disease duration, adult-onset airway symptoms, less atopy, more noneosinophilic airway phenotypes, and prior sinus surgery history.

Conclusions

Patients with NPcA with 3 distinct natural courses had different inflammatory status and disease severity. Determining the natural course of a patient might help clinicians predict the clinical aspects of NPcA and contribute to phenotype-guided management approaches in the future.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypes [^114EAxv6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current knowledge surrounding different chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) presentations and the relative roles of nasal polyps, eosinophilia, and allergies in discerning phenotypes.

Data Sources

PubMed literature review.

Study Selections

Articles discussing the various phenotypes of CRS with emphasis on pathologic and immune mechanistic studies that distinguish disease.

Results

Current guidelines primarily separate CRS based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps. This is largely driven by the tendency of eosinophilic disease to present with nasal polyps (NPs) in contrast to noneosinophilic presentations, which less often lead to the development NPs. Further separations have been proposed based on expression of aeroallergen sensitization.

Conclusion

The presence of NPs may only poorly predict the presence of an underlying eosinophilic process and as such may have poor utility in forming the basis for recommending eosinophil-target therapies. Similarly, there is little evidence to support a significant role for aeroallergen exposure in contributing to the presence, severity, or natural history of CRS. Appropriate separation of CRS into specific phenotypes will allow therapeutic approaches to be individualized to each distinct presentation.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^116VEv16]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Guideline scope and target population — this clinical guideline is focused around 3 medical management questions, 1 specific to people with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and the other 2 pertinent to all people who have CRSwNP; the target population is people with CRSwNP aged 18 years and older, noting CRSwNP is less common in people younger than 18 years old, and the work group focused guidance on 3 interventions (INCS, biologics, and ATAD), with patients with AERD the focus of the third management question about ATAD, whereas those without AERD are not considered for ATAD but could be candidates for INCS or biologics.

### Clinical characteristics of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^113A4sdY]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a significant endotype of both asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The disease demonstrates what seems to be a unified inflammatory mechanism culminating in highly eosinophilic nasal polyp disease and asthma. The rate of polyp recurrence and morbidity from asthma exacerbations are significant and warrant separating this group diagnostically from aspirin-tolerant peers. Given the unique anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin and the evolving landscape of new, targeted biologic treatments, it is even more incumbent to consider this diagnosis and offer patients treatment specific for the disease.

### Rhinogenic and sinus headache-literature review [^112bmBgQ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Headache is a common, yet challenging symptom to evaluate given its wide range of clinical presentations and different etiologies. For centuries, conceptual understanding of headache causation has been attributed to anatomic abnormalities of the nose and paranasal sinuses.

Methods

Structured literature review.

Results

The number of cases, categorized as migraines or other primary headaches, misdiagnosed as a "sinus headache" is high in the literature, ranging from 50 to 80%. The potential mechanisms for rhinogenic headaches were classically described as pain secondary to prolonged mucosal contact points, hypoxia in the paranasal sinuses secondary to poor ventilation, or pressure caused by the growth of nasal polyps. Additionally, other mechanisms were described and are still being studied. Corrective surgery for mucosal contact points in the nasal cavity is deemed necessary for relieving the headache, although patient outcomes are variable.

Conclusion

Delay in proper diagnosis and treatment negatively impact patient quality of life. Most cases of "sinus headache" or "rhinogenic headache" seen in clinical practice are in fact misdiagnosed as either primary headaches or migraines. Because of increased misdiagnoses, Otolaryngologists should establish a direct and precise diagnosis congruent with a chief complaint being a headache. Vital information such as a good clinical history, well-performed nasal endoscopy, and occasional CT scan may decrease misdiagnosis probability.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115a6bxm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Nasal polyps and sinusitis… [^111TP5eH]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Despite the prevalence and long history of nasal polyps, many questions still exist with respect to incidence and pathogenesis. Although allergy has been commonly thought to be a major cause, much compelling evidence argues against this. Medical therapy consists of a short course of systemic steroids fol lowed by intranasal steroids. Sinusitis is the most commonly reported chronic disease in the United States. Decrease in ostial size, retention of secretions, and decrease in mucociliary action all contribute to the pathogenesis of sinusitis. The clinical presentation of chronic sinusitis is generally subtle and the clinical index of suspicion must be high. Limited coronal computed tomography is regarded as the most definitive and cost-effective imaging technique for the diagnosis of sinusitis. Appropriate antibiotics must be administered for a sufficient period. In medically resistant sinusitis, functional endoscopic sinus surgery has emerged as the procedure of choice. Slavin RG.

### The role of biologics in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^114QnCFo]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

These current studies on biologic agents in CRSwNP are encouraging, especially with having 1 already FDA-approved. Biologics appear to be favorable options in patients with severe polyp disease who have failed medical management and/or surgical intervention. The initial management of CRSwNP is the use of local corticosteroids given its efficacy in suppressing T2 inflammation. Depending on the severity of the disease, topical corticosteroids can reduce nasal polyp size, improve symptoms, and reduce polyp recurrence after surgery once the polyp burden is removed. The effect size is greater in CRSwNP compared to CRS without NP, and long-term use of topical corticosteroids is effective and safe. However, a considerable shortcoming of topical corticosteroids is inconsistent and inadequate delivery to sinuses, which is more challenging when there is a substantial polyp burden. Improved delivery methods including off-label large-volume corticosteroid nasal irrigations and the breath-assisted device can improve distribution and penetration.- Systemic corticosteroids are often effective in addition to topical corticosteroids for uncontrolled or partially controlled symptoms, but benefits do not last once discontinued, and there are significant adverse effects. -

Patients with severe or refractory disease may be good candidates for biologic therapy. Based on the risk-benefit evaluation, the adverse effects of long-term systemic corticosteroid use outweigh advantages, so should only be considered for short-term use. Based on the updated 2020 European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Chronic rhinosinusitis, ≥ 2 corticosteroid courses per year or long-term use (> 3 months) is considered a criterion (multiple need to be met) for considering a biologic for CRSwNP. Thus, patients requiring repeat systemic corticosteroids may be a subset of recalcitrant polyps that deserve consideration of a biologic agent.

Patients with severe disease who fail maximal medical therapy alone are recommended to do functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Up to 50% of patients with CRSwNP have a history of sinonasal surgery. The rate of polyp recurrence is not insignificant, with studies showing a recurrence rate between 40% and 60%. The recurrence is likely because underlying causes of the inflammation driving polyp formation are not adequately addressed during surgical intervention. Thus, patients who have recurrence despite surgery may benefit from a biologic agent. Additionally, patients who want to avoid surgery or are not eligible for surgery should be considered for a biologic agent.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps (CRSwNP and CRSsNP) — diagnosis and assessment: Nasendoscopy and/or computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses can identify changes suggestive of chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps, and in severe asthma, presence of nasal polyps may help with choice of biologic therapy.

### Clinical assessment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116nY1bj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease that affects > 10% of the adult population in Europe and the United States. It has been delineated phenotypically into CRS without nasal polyps and CRS with nasal polyps. Both have a high disease burden and an overlapping spectrum of symptoms such as nasal obstruction, olfactory dysfunction, facial pain, pressure, and nasal discharge. Primary assessment includes evaluation of patient symptoms and impact on quality of life, nasal endoscopic examination, and imaging. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of CRS pathophysiology. There is a move toward describing CRS in terms of the predominant endotype or inflammatory pattern pathomechanism rather than the traditional classification of patients with and without nasal polyps. An increased elucidation of the disease endotypes, as characterized by their inflammatory pathways and mediators, is leading to a tailored more personalized treatment approach to the different disease subtypes.

### EUFOREA expert board meeting on uncontrolled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and biologics: definitions and management [^115yBh3f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Uncontrolled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is the most bothersome phenotype of chronic rhinosinusitis; it is typically characterized by a type 2 inflammatory reaction and by comorbidities, including asthma, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease, and allergies. Here, the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases proposes structured definitions to enable communication between clinicians and provides a practical algorithm to define type 2 inflammation in CRSwNP in daily clinical practice. A rational approach for the treatment of uncontrolled severe CRSwNP is discussed; it consists of evaluating the perspective and risks of surgery and efficacy and adverse events of biologics on the basis of currently available data. Further, possible combinations of surgery and biologics are discussed, and a rationale is provided. Here, it is of importance to adequately counsel the patient about both approaches to enable a decision-making process with an informed patient. Criteria for the selection of a biologic drug are provided, as several biologics for uncontrolled severe CRSwNP will be available in many countries within a short time. Further, suggestions for monitoring of the drug effects that support recognition of responders to the therapy and, subsequently, the decision regarding continuation or discontinuation of the biologic are proposed.

### Allergy and asthma prevalence and management across nasal polyp subtypes [^112Ga3eB]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Allergy and asthma prevalence vary across different subsets of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In this article, the authors investigate the management of allergy and asthma within populations of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, and central compartment atopic disease. Topical steroids, nasal rinses, and endoscopic sinus surgery are frequently employed in the management of nasal polyposis. Further, other causes of upper and lower airway inflammation like allergy and asthma should be considered in the overall treatment plan in order to optimize outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116XGjnp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Action statement 13a — chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe biologics (including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies such as dupilumab, mepolizumab, or omalizumab) for the treatment of adults with CRS without polyps. Recommendation (against therapy) is based on lack of randomized controlled trials in this population with a preponderance of benefit over harm for not treating. Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid biologic use in patients with CRS without polyps for whom benefits would be uncertain as this patients population was not evaluated in the published randomized trials to date. Aggregate Evidence Quality: A, with exclusion of patients without polyps from clinical trials; Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate; Benefit-Harm Assessment: Preponderance of Benefit; Policy level: Recommendation. Intentional Vagueness is specified: the word "routinely" is included to avoid a legal standard; Exceptions are a distinct indication for biologics other than CRS; Role Of Patient Preferences: Limited role in shared decision making. Supporting text specifies the evidence base: In the 10 studies on biologics in CRS synthesized in a 2021 Cochrane Review, 1260 of 1262 patients (99.8%) had polyps, and all were using topical nasal steroids for their CRS symptoms.

Review response to an initial trial of add-on Type 2-targeted therapy — at present, there are no well-defined criteria for a good response; assess exacerbations, symptom control, lung function, side-effects, treatment intensity (including OCS dose), and patient satisfaction. If the response is unclear, consider extending the trial to 6–12 months. If there is no response, stop the biologic therapy and consider switching to a trial of a different Type 2-targeted therapy, if available and the patient is eligible, and also consider the patient's biomarkers and the response of comorbid Type 2 conditions such as atopic dermatitis or nasal polyps.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115Bv4Le]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Physical examination in rhinitis — For a patient with rhinitis symptoms, a physical exam should be completed that encompasses the upper and lower airway, eyes, ears, and skin to identify comorbid allergic or nonallergic conditions; these may include allergic conjunctivitis, otitis, eustachian tube dysfunction, CRS with and without nasal polyps, asthma, and/or atopic dermatitis. Documentation of normal findings is important prior to prescribing medications that might lead to adverse events. Although specific nasal and oropharyngeal findings may support allergic rhinitis (AR), there are no pathognomonic findings that distinguish allergic versus nonallergic versus infectious rhinitis, and patients who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at the time of exam may have minimal or no abnormal findings. While conducting a physical exam is recommended by all major rhinitis guidelines to make the diagnosis of AR, the available research evidence is very limited and low quality, with much lower sensitivity and specificity and high interrater variability.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111YLCGw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this specialty-specific clinical practice guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities and provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. The target audience includes otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons who manage adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, including candidacy and performance of endoscopic sinus surgery.

Methods

This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements (KASs), application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline group represented otolaryngologists, rhinologists, advanced practice nursing and physician assistants, and consumers who represented participating national professional organizations.

Action Statements

The Guideline Development Group made strong recommendations for the following KASs: Before considering surgery, the surgeon should verify an existing diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis to ensure established diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) from clinical practice guidelines are met, and the surgeon should assess candidacy for sinus surgery based on symptoms, disease characteristics, quality of life, and prior medical or surgical therapy (KASs 1A and 1B). The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination (KAS 3). The Guideline Development Group made recommendations for the following KASs: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy (eg, antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines) as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis (KAS 2). The surgeon should identify patients with chronic rhinosinusitis that would benefit most from surgery and are least likely to benefit from continued medical therapy alone, such as those with chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes that include, but are not limited to, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, polyps with bony erosion, eosinophilic mucin, or fungal balls (KAS 4). The surgeon or their designee should counsel patients before sinus surgery to establish realistic expectations, including the potential for chronicity or relapse, and the likelihood of long-term medical management, taking into account their chronic rhinosinusitis subtype (KAS 5). The surgeon should offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery (eg, which specific sinuses to operate on) solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11). There were no recommendations that were considered options from the Guideline Development Group.

AERD — We recommend against an oral aspirin challenge to confirm the diagnosis of AERD in cases of high diagnostic certainty based on clinical history; however, aspirin desensitization remains a therapeutic option when indicated. We suggest an oral aspirin challenge to confirm the diagnosis of AERD in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. We suggest that a challenge procedure be used to diagnose AERD when there is diagnostic uncertainty and that a desensitization protocol be used when the intention is to place a patient on a daily therapeutic aspirin dose for cardioprotection, pain relief, or to control nasal polyp regrowth.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and a clinical diagnosis of NSAID-ERD: results from two randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^114zHd9v]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52 were two multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, phase 3 studies of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled severe CRSwNP. The study design, randomization process, and methodology for SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52 have been reported previously. In both studies, randomization was stratified by asthma or NSAID‐ERD disease status at screening, previous surgery at screening, and country.

2.2 Participants

The eligibility criteria were identical for both studies and previously published (see Table S1). Briefly, adults with bilateral NPs and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis despite intranasal corticosteroid therapy, who had received SCS in the preceding 2 years (or had a medical contraindication or intolerance to SCS) or previous sinonasal surgery were included. A pre‐specified enrollment goal was to have at least 50% of patients with asthma, NSAID‐ERD, or both, and 50% of patients having had previous polyp surgery. Written informed consent was provided by all patients in the SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52 trials.

To ascertain a diagnosis of NSAID‐ERD, a two‐question survey based on a diagnostic algorithm endorsed by an expert panelwas administered during the medical/surgery history interview. The two questions were as follows: Have you ever had respiratory, nasal, and/or bronchial symptoms following the intake of aspirin or/and NSAID? and While having a positive clinical history of NSAID‐ERD, have you ever undergone an aspirin provocation test, either nasal, bronchial, or oral? An affirmative response to either question was considered to indicate a clinical diagnosis of NSAID‐ERD.

Details of study sites have been previously published.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps: the role of generic and specific questionnaires on assessing its impact on patient's quality of life [^1128Wyqx]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) including nasal polyps is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa that, despite differing hypotheses of its cause, remains poorly understood. Primary symptoms are nasal blockage, loss of smell, rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure. Chronic rhinosinusitis causes significant physical symptoms, has a negative impact on quality of life (QoL), and can substantially impair daily functioning. A global evaluation of patients must include, together with nasal symptoms, nasal endoscopy, and CT scan, the measurement of QoL. To assess QoL in CRS, specific and generic questionnaires may be used. Chronic rhinosinusitis has a considerable impact on a patient's QoL but comorbidities, such as asthma and atopy, have an accumulative negative effect. Both medical and surgical treatments lead to a similar improvement on the QoL of CRS and nasal polyp patients.

### Egyptian dynasties to biologics: a historical review of nasal polyposis [^111vezwD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The history of nasal polyposis originates even before Hippocrates described a nasal mass that he likened to a sea polyp. References to sinonasal disease and treatment can be found in ancient texts, such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Edwin Smith Papyrus of Ancient Egypt, as well as in the foundational texts of Ayurvedic medicine. Greek philosophers marked a significant shift away from the belief that illness was a result of divine intervention and embraced medical theory. Over the subsequent millennia, the understanding of nasal polyposis expanded, resulting in notable progress in surgical procedures and medical treatments. However, the complex pathophysiology of this condition remained enigmatic until breakthroughs in basic science and immunology. This historical journey takes us from the tomb of the first rhinologist in 2500 BC to the development of immune-modulating biologics.

### Different response criteria and response rates for biologic therapy in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Z8pJb]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Different criteria have been proposed for the response to biologic treatment to evaluate the efficacy of treatment among patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This review aimed to summarize current response criteria and evaluate response rates of patients with CRSwNP after biologic therapies.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from the inception to July 2024 to identify clinical studies exploring the response to biologic treatment in patients with CRSwNP.

Results

Twenty-nine studies were included, comprising 3735 patients in 25 studies suitable for meta-analysis. These were various comprehensive and single criteria for response to biologic therapy in patients with CRSwNP. The comprehensive evaluation measures of patient responsiveness included 5 key outcome measures: nasal polyp size, systemic corticosteroid need, disease-specific quality of life, sense of smell, and impact of comorbidities. The single evaluation measure of treatment response included nasal polyp size, disease-specific quality of life, and sense of smell. The minimum clinically important difference and the thresholds of these parameters are used to determine the clinical improvement or the severity of the disease after treatment. These existing treatment response instruments categorized patients as follows: 4 (excellent, moderate, poor, and no response), 3 (good-to-excellent, moderate-poor, and no response), and 2 (response and no response). The pooled moderate-to-excellent response rate after biologic therapy assessed by comprehensive criteria was from 39.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.231–0.670) to 87.7% (95% CI, 0.774–0.994). The pooled response rates evaluated by the single measures ranged from 62.9% (95% CI, 0.518–0.746) to 82.8% (95% CI, 0.801–0.857).

Conclusion

The critical components and parameters of the response criteria for CRSwNP patients receiving biologic treatment have yet to be reached, leading to significantly heterogeneous response rates to biologics. The development of consistent criteria for the response to biologic treatment is critical to help define treatment efficacy.

### Sinonasal malignancy: what to do with an unexpected pathology result? [^114EFEqb]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic sinus surgery has become the mainstay in surgical treatment of sinusitis and nasal polyps. While rare, diagnostic discrepancies or pathological contamination during routine specimen analysis has been described. Thus, an accurate diagnosis and indication for surgery are mandatory before proceeding with surgical intervention.

Methods

We present the case of a 40-year-old female patient who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic sinusitis without nasal polyposis and fragments of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were found in the pathology specimen.

Results

We propose an algorithm to help guide physicians presented with a tissue diagnosis that does not match the clinical scenario. Moreover, we discuss strategies to help prevent medical errors and the importance of DNA genetic analysis in this situation.

Conclusion

When an unexpected diagnosis occurs, the pathology slides should be reviewed for a second opinion. If the unexpected diagnosis is confirmed, the tissue should undergo STR genetic analysis to ensure against tissue contamination.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^117Ws9n8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis — management of incomplete response and escalation: For resolved uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, no further evaluation is needed, but for partial response clinicians should continue antibiotic treatment for another 10 to 14 days or consider a different antibiotic. For poor response, which worsens after 3 to 5 days, consider broadening microbial coverage or switch to a different antimicrobial that covers resistant bacteria, and rhinosinusitis that fails to improve after 21 to 28 days of initial antibiotic treatment might be due to pathogens not adequately covered by prior antibiotics, nasal polyps, tumor, or noncompliance. Reinforce comfort and prevention measures, consider a sinus CT scan if not already done with more detailed evaluation of underlying risk factors, and consider consultation with an allergist‑immunologist or an otolaryngologist for immunodeficiency, unusual pathogens, allergic factors, or structural abnormalities.

### The role of aspirin desensitization followed by oral aspirin therapy in managing patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: a Work group report from the rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and ocular allergy committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^111yUFJq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — indications and diagnostic confirmation for aspirin desensitization followed by oral aspirin therapy are specified as follows: Indications "include rapidly recurring nasal polyps following sinus surgery, uncontrolled rhinosinusitis despite use of standard medical therapies, and the need for frequent bursts of systemic corticosteroids to control respiratory or sinus symptoms", and "this therapy should only be recommended for patients with AERD because no clinical benefit has been described for aspirin-tolerant patients with CRSwNP and/or asthma". Because diagnosis matters for eligibility, "it is essential to confirm the diagnosis of AERD before desensitization", and "although the criterion standard for diagnosing AERD is a formal aspirin challenge, the diagnosis is more commonly made clinically", such that "for patients with known physician-diagnosed asthma, documented nasal polyps, and a clearly-reported history of a respiratory reaction after ingestion of an NSAID, the diagnosis of AERD does not need to be confirmed by a formal aspirin challenge". Patient report can be unreliable: "Up to 15% of patients with AERD are not able to identify whether or not they are intolerant to NSAIDs", and some "do not become aware of their hypersensitivity until a physician-administered provocative oral challenge induces a reaction", so "a provocative aspirin challenge is required" in selected groups that "fall into 1 of 4 categories": "Patients who have not used NSAIDs recently"; "Patients who are on a leukotriene-modifying drug"; "Patients who are less perceptive to their reactions"; and "Patients already on daily low-dose aspirin", including those "already taking 81 mg aspirin" who may only react "after stopping low-dose aspirin for at least 10 days" during a "provocative oral aspirin challenge".

### Epidemiology and treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in Germany – A claims data study [^114d8eY9]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, patients were required to be at least 18 years old at the time of the first observed diagnosis in above inclusion period.

Based upon the above‐specified base cohort of CRSwNP patients, an additional cohort of incident CRSwNP patients was observed. To be included in this cohort, patients must have had a period of at least 12 months without prior CRSwNP diagnoses to the first observed (incident) CRSwNP diagnosis, which was defined as the index date (= wash‐out period).
Finally, a cohort of patients with severe CRSwNP and inadequate disease control was defined for 2019. For the purpose of this study, 'inadequately controlled' refers to patients with severe CRSwNP for whom previous therapy with SCS and/or FESS did not provide sufficient control. Accordingly, those patients have a continued need for secondary therapy. The definition is therefore not equivalent to the criteria of 'uncontrolled' therapy listed in EPOS 2020. Therefore, as a proxy, a stepwise patient selection was implemented based on the assumption that a history of FESS or SCS in conjunction with current INCS consumption is associated with inadequately controlled severe CRSwNP if these patients are still in need for subsequent FESS or SCS. Step 1: Patients who fulfil the base cohort and were alive on 1 January 2019
Step 2: Patients received ≥ 3 INCS prescriptions in 2019 and visited an ENT specialist within the same quarter of prescriptions
Step 3: Patients had a prior treatment experience, defined as either (a) at least one SCS prescription in the same quarter of a CRSwNP diagnosis by an Ear–Nose–Throat (ENT) specialist within 24 months before the first INCS prescription in 2019; or (b) at least one FESS any time before the first INCS prescription in 2019
Step 4: Patients received ≥ 1 additional SCS prescription in the same quarter of a CRSwNP diagnosis by an Ear–Nose–Throat (ENT) specialist and/or FESS

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^1172H5kQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — diagnostic symptoms and phenotypes indicates that the diagnosis of rhinitis is suggested by the presence of 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (anterior and posterior), sneezing, and itching; rhinitis can be classified by pathogenic mechanisms as allergic or nonallergic, some forms of nonallergic rhinitis such as vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) or atrophic rhinitis may not be associated with inflammation of the nasal mucosa, and recognition of whether a patient has AR or NAR or another mimicking condition is important because management will differ; conditions with overlapping symptoms include rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, ciliary dyskinesia syndrome, and structural/mechanical factors such as congenital anomalies, deviated septum, and pharyngeal reflux.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^111fVNKm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Evidence certainty — assessment domains and levels — was determined using GRADE, considering specific domains and categorizing certainty into four levels. Assessed domains included risk of bias; imprecision; inconsistency and publication bias; presence of large effects; dose-effect relationship; and plausible residual and opposing confounding, and GRADE guidance specific to NMA was also considered. Certainty was categorized at 4 levels: very low; low; moderate; or high.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^112UUTPQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) outcome measures and minimally important differences (MIDs) are specified for key endpoints: The SinoNasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) uses a 0 to 110 total score with higher scores indicating worse disease-specific quality of life; an MID of 8.9 to 12 points improvement is reported and the work group selected 8.9 as the a priori MID, with an increase of more than 9 to 12 points likely reflecting patient-important worsening and a decrease of 9 to 12 points likely reflecting patient-important improvement. For nasal symptom scores lacking established MIDs, the work group set an MID of 0.3 for the 0 to 3 scale and 1.0 for the 0 to 10 scale. Sense of smell outcomes were normalized to the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), which is on a scale of 0 to 40 where higher scores indicate better function, and an MID of 4.0 for the 0 to 40 scale was set. Additional MID thresholds were established for rescue surgery (5% risk difference), any adverse event (5% risk difference), serious adverse events (1% risk difference), nasal polyp score (0.3 on 0–3 scale or 1.0 on 0–8 scale), nasal endoscopy score (3 on 0–12 modified Lund-Kennedy scale), and computed tomography imaging (4 on 0–24 Lund-Mackay imaging scale).

### Baseline disease characteristics by surgery history among patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in the global AROMA registry [^113jEYFT]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The global Assessing long-teRm Outcomes in dupiluMAb (AROMA) registry study aims to characterize the long-term, real-world use of dupilumab in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This paper reports interim analysis of the baseline characteristics for the first 303 patients enrolled in AROMA.

Methods and Materials

AROMA is currently ongoing in adult patients with CRSwNP who initiated dupilumab for up to 36 months. This interim analysis describes baseline demographics; systemic/oral corticosteroid (SCS/OCS) and antibiotic use; disease burden; healthcare resource utilization; and medical history. All outcomes are summarized descriptively.

Results

As of February 2023, AROMA had enrolled 303 patients; 61.7% had ≥ 1 prior surgery and 38.3% were surgery naive. Disease burden at baseline was greatest among patients with prior surgery vs the surgery-naive group: 72.2% vs 62.9% had used SCS/OCS, mean University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test scores were 10.9 vs 19.2, 31.0% vs 27.6% of patients reported severe symptoms, and 47.6%/16.6% vs 39.7%/16.4% of patients were classified as having severe/very severe disease according to global physician assessment scores. Otolaryngologist/ear, nose, throat and allergist/immunologist were the most common specialties seen regularly by CRSwNP patients (52.8% and 48.2%, respectively) and surgery-naive patients were more likely to have visited an allergist than those with prior surgery (66.4% vs 36.9%).

Conclusions

Patients with CRSwNP in AROMA show considerable disease burden at baseline prior to treatment. Those with prior surgery had worse olfaction and an overall worse burden of disease.

Plain Language Summary

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a condition characterized by at least 12 weeks of symptoms such as nasal congestion and loss of smell, along with the presence of nasal polyps. Treatment for CRSwNP includes intranasal steroids, but if these cannot control disease, systemic steroids or sinus surgery may be required. Systemic steroids have known side effects and only provide temporary symptom improvement. Following surgery, patients may experience both symptom and polyp recurrence. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that is approved for the treatment of inadequately controlled CRSwNP and can improve disease symptoms such as nasal congestion and loss of smell. This article presents the initial findings from a large global study called AROMA, which observes patients in real-world medical practice for 3 years after initiating dupilumab for CRSwNP. This analysis compares the characteristics of those in the registry who had and had not undergone prior sinonasal surgery for CRSwNP. In this analysis, patients who had previously undergone surgery to remove nasal polyps were more likely to have used steroids for CRSwNP treatment and were in worse health because of their CRSwNP condition despite having similar severity of symptoms at baseline.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112tPv9g]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps (CRSwNP and CRSsNP) — definition, subtypes, prevalence, and asthma association: Rhinosinusitis is characterized by more than two symptoms including nasal blockage/obstruction and/or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip), and is acute when symptoms last < 12 weeks with complete resolution, while chronic when symptoms occur on most days for at least 12 weeks without complete resolution. It encompasses chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), with general population prevalence ranging from 1% to 10% without polyps and 4% with polyps, and is associated with more severe asthma, especially in patients with nasal polyps; sinusitis rarely occurs in the absence of rhinitis.

### Accuracy of self-reported diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117RTr2y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Large cohort studies of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) prevalence often include patients who have been inappropriately diagnosed with the disease. In this investigation, new patients presenting to a tertiary rhinology practice completed a screening questionnaire that included questions about self-reported CRS status, demographic information, and symptomatology. Treating rhinologists evaluated patients according to clinical practice guideline criteria for CRS; 91 patients were ultimately diagnosed with CRS. The sensitivity of self-report for CRS was 84%; the specificity was 82%; and the estimated negative predictive value ranged from 97% to 99%. Prior sinus surgery or oral steroid use correlated with CRS self-report, and a concurrent self-report of nasal polyps or nasal steroid use improved the positive predictive value of CRS self-report. Self-report of CRS status may represent an effective and relatively inexpensive screening mechanism for CRS in large cohort studies, particularly when combined with other associated diagnostic features that improve performance parameters of self-report.

### Case studies in the surgical management of nasal airway obstruction [^1138F6qp]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Nasal obstruction is one of the most common complaints evaluated by the otolaryngologist. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from benign reversible causes to life-threatening diseases. In addition, patients may suffer from a combination of etiologies, further confusing the diagnosis. Surgical management is directed at the underlying origin of obstruction. The clinician therefore must use a careful history and physical examination as well as appropriate sinonasal imaging in accurately identifying the causes of nasal obstruction. To further illustrate these principles, we present two interesting cases of patients presenting with nasal obstruction.

Aspirin therapy after desensitization (ATAD) for AERD — process and dosing specify that ATAD is a 2-part process in which patients are first desensitized to aspirin and then continued on daily aspirin therapy; during desensitization patients are gradually exposed to larger doses of aspirin (≤ 325 mg) over a period of 1 to 3 days depending on protocol, and while there is no global consensus on the treatment dose, available randomized controlled trials most commonly used doses between 650 mg and 1300 mg per day; importantly, aspirin must be taken every day after desensitization, and if a patient misses a dose for ≥ 2 days they must be evaluated by their allergist and may have to redo desensitization, and desensitization itself does not provide clinical benefit but enables daily aspirin use.

### Unified airway disease: medical management [^114ASadN]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Concurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in the upper airway, and asthma in the lower airway, often have a shared underlying pathophysiology, namely type 2 inflammation; hence, the term "unified airway disease". The combination of CRSwNP and asthma is associated with uncontrolled disease. The range of treatment of CRSwNP includes intranasal corticosteroids, nasal saline irrigation, oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, and biologics. A combined clinical algorithm for the management of the upper and lower airways in type 2 inflammation will be beneficial, especially for patients with uncontrolled disease who may benefit from biologics.

### The role of aspirin desensitization followed by oral aspirin therapy in managing patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: a Work group report from the rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and ocular allergy committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^111368PR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — indications and contraindications are summarized as follows: Indication is persistent sinonasal and asthma symptoms in a patient with AERD despite conventional medical and surgical therapy. Contraindications include poorly controlled asthma, significant nasal polyp burden at time of desensitization, pregnancy, history of eosinophilic esophagitis, history of gastric and/or peptic ulcer disease, history of a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy, and history of medication nonadherence. A relative contraindication is a history of anaphylaxis to aspirin or other NSAID; patients with such a history may undergo an aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy, but this decision merits careful discussion with the patient and physician.
