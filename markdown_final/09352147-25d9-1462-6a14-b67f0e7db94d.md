## Question

Does daily soy from tofu cause hormonal issues

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether daily consumption of soy from tofu causes hormonal issues. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "hormonal issues" typically means in clinical contexts. Then, I should verify the hormonal activity of soy isoflavones and how they differ from endogenous estrogens. Next, I will review human data on reproductive hormones in women and men, followed by outcomes like menopausal symptoms, breast and endometrial cancer, and thyroid interactions. After that, I should consider dose, timing, and individual variability, including equol production. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified conclusion and highlight any exceptions or precautions that would change counseling.

> Let me first confirm what "hormonal issues" encompasses here. In practice, that usually includes clinically meaningful changes in sex steroid levels or gonadotropins, menstrual or fertility effects, feminization in men, altered menopausal symptom trajectories, hormone-sensitive cancer risk, and thyroid hormone absorption or action, so I will keep these domains in mind as I appraise the evidence [^d10d336f] [^3df3aeff].

> I need to check the pharmacology next. Soy isoflavones are phytoestrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulator activity, binding ERβ more than ERα, and they are orders of magnitude less potent than estradiol; this profile predicts tissue- and context-dependent effects rather than global estrogenic stimulation, which is a key reason many observational and clinical studies show neutral or beneficial outcomes at typical dietary intakes [^d10d336f] [^b16f9440].

> Now, let me review direct human data on reproductive hormones. In premenopausal women, most well-controlled studies show no consistent changes in estradiol, progesterone, LH, or FSH with modest soy intake; for example, a metabolic ward study using low-isoflavone soy found reductions in estradiol and progesterone that tracked with lower protein and higher fiber rather than isoflavones, and a randomized trial with about 36 mg/day isoflavones showed no thyroid hormone changes, reinforcing that effects are small and context-dependent [^6c1026e3] [^7ac284f5]. In men, multiple clinical studies and a meta-analysis show no feminizing effects on testosterone, free testosterone, or estrogen at intake levels comparable to or higher than typical Asian diets, which directly addresses the concern about "hormonal issues" in males [^95352267].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about menopausal symptoms. I initially thought the evidence was uniformly negative, but wait, let me verify the randomized trials and guidelines. Some trials and meta-analyses suggest modest reductions in hot flashes with isoflavone supplements, particularly in equol producers, yet major guidelines like NAMS rate the evidence as mixed and insufficient to recommend soy foods or extracts routinely for vasomotor symptoms, so any benefit appears modest and inconsistent across populations and formulations [^78747a5d] [^beb860e4] [^422a4d7d].

> Next, I should review hormone-sensitive cancer outcomes, since that is where theoretical estrogenic concerns are most salient. In breast cancer, large prospective cohorts and meta-analyses in Asian populations show inverse associations between soy intake and risk, with about a 10–30% reduction at intakes around 10–20 mg/day isoflavones, and no evidence that soy increases recurrence or mortality; in fact, higher postdiagnosis soy intake is associated with improved survival, and clinical studies do not show proliferative effects in breast tissue, which reassures me that daily tofu intake is unlikely to cause harmful hormonal stimulation in this context [^f235d05c] [^aba120a7] [^d10d336f]. For endometrial cancer, higher isoflavone intake is associated with lower risk in postmenopausal women, again arguing against clinically meaningful estrogenic harm at dietary levels [^3ce3dd80].

> I should confirm thyroid considerations because this is a common point of confusion. Soy can impair levothyroxine absorption if taken too close together, but this is a drug–nutrient interaction rather than a direct hormonal effect of soy; separating doses by several hours usually resolves it, and a randomized crossover study did not show impaired absorption when soy isoflavones were given with L-T4, suggesting the clinical impact is modest and manageable with timing adjustments [^b72754b5] [^22e5c762] [^59420cc9].

> Let me consider dose, timing, and individual variability, because these modify risk. Typical Asian intakes of isoflavones are roughly 25–50 mg/day, and many beneficial associations are observed around 10–20 mg/day; Western intakes are often less than 1–3 mg/day, which may explain null findings in some Western studies and underscores that modest daily tofu intake sits in a range with supportive epidemiologic signals and no consistent adverse hormonal effects [^ea31eed7] [^f97271fe]. Equol producer status may influence symptom response, but tests are not clinically available and cannot be used to tailor advice reliably, so I should avoid overpromising individualized benefits based on equol status [^beb860e4].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant, lactating, or has a hormone-sensitive cancer history. I should double-check guideline positions. Professional guidance advises caution with high-dose isoflavone supplements in pregnancy and lactation and in women with hormone-sensitive cancers, whereas whole-food soy at typical dietary levels is generally not contraindicated; this aligns with the mechanistic rationale that supplements deliver higher aglycone loads and bypass the food matrix effects that modulate absorption and biologic activity [^8124bede] [^902cf369] [^c28abadc].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In infants with congenital hypothyroidism, soy formula can impair L-T4 absorption and delay biochemical control, so separating soy from dosing is important; in adults on L-T4, separating soy by several hours and monitoring TSH is prudent if intake is high or control is erratic, even though contemporary data suggest limited clinical impact with proper timing [^b72754b5] [^22e5c762]. In men, despite persistent myths, clinical data do not show feminization or testosterone suppression with dietary soy intake, which I should emphasize to counter misinformation [^95352267].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not overstating. Daily tofu intake providing roughly 10–20 mg isoflavones does not cause clinically meaningful hormonal issues in most adults; potential effects are small, context-dependent, and generally neutral or beneficial for reproductive hormone levels, menopausal symptom burden, and hormone-sensitive cancer outcomes, with the main caveat being thyroid medication timing rather than intrinsic hormonal toxicity [^d10d336f] [^f235d05c] [^b72754b5]. Exceptions include pregnancy and lactation where high-dose isoflavone supplements should be avoided, and individuals with hormone-sensitive cancers where supplements are discouraged, while whole-food soy can be considered case-by-case; for everyone on thyroid hormone, separate soy from L-T4 to avoid absorption interference [^8124bede] [^902cf369] [^b72754b5].

> Bottom line, after verifying the mechanistic, clinical, and epidemiologic data, daily tofu consumption at typical dietary levels is not associated with adverse hormonal effects in healthy adults, and may confer cardiometabolic and cancer risk benefits; the key precautions are to avoid high-dose isoflavone supplements in sensitive populations and to manage thyroid medication timing if soy intake is substantial [^d10d336f] [^d1bf3be5] [^b72754b5].

Daily tofu consumption does not cause hormonal problems in most people. Isoflavones in tofu are **weak estrogens** [^b16f9440] that do not meaningfully alter sex hormone levels in men or women at typical dietary intakes [^95352267] [^6c1026e3]. Large studies show **no increase in breast cancer risk** [^f235d05c] and no feminizing effects in men [^95352267]. The main concern is a **modest reduction in thyroid hormone absorption** [^3df3aeff] if tofu is taken within 1–2 hours of levothyroxine, which is managed by timing doses apart [^b72754b5]. People with hormone-sensitive conditions should consult a clinician, but for most, 1–2 servings of tofu daily is safe and may lower breast cancer risk [^f235d05c] and improve menopausal symptoms [^78747a5d].

---

## Hormonal effects of tofu consumption

### Isoflavones and estrogen receptors

Isoflavones (genistein, daidzein) are **phytoestrogens** that bind estrogen receptors but are 100–1000-fold weaker than estradiol [^b16f9440]; they act as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with mixed agonist/antagonist effects, depending on tissue and hormonal context [^d10d336f].

---

### Effects in women

- **Menstrual cycle**: Studies show no consistent changes in cycle length or ovulation with moderate soy intake [^6c1026e3].
- **Breast cancer**: High soy intake is linked to a lower breast cancer risk, especially in Asian populations [^f235d05c] [^830c26f1]; no evidence shows increased risk or recurrence [^aba120a7].
- **Menopausal symptoms**: Soy may modestly reduce hot flashes, with variable effects across studies [^78747a5d] [^3be9a697].

---

### Effects in men

- **Testosterone**: Clinical studies show no significant changes in testosterone or estrogen with soy intake [^95352267] [^2973448a].
- **Feminization**: No evidence of gynecomastia or feminization at typical intakes [^95352267].

## Clinical evidence on hormonal disturbances

| **Study** | **Population** | **Intervention** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Wu et al. (2008) | 35,303 Singapore Chinese women | Soy intake and breast cancer risk | Inverse association; no hormonal harm [^f235d05c] |
| Messina et al. (2010) | Men | Soy isoflavones and testosterone | No feminizing effects [^95352267] |
| Anderson et al. (1999) | Postmenopausal women | Soy protein and isoflavones | No adverse hormonal effects [^notfound] |

---

## Potential concerns and considerations

### Thyroid function

Soy may **reduce levothyroxine absorption** if taken within 1–2 hours; separate dosing mitigates this [^b72754b5] [^22e5c762]. Routine thyroid monitoring is advised for those on replacement therapy [^b72754b5].

---

### Individual variability

Equol producers (20–30%) may have **greater isoflavone effects**, but clinical relevance is unclear [^422f878c] [^beb860e4]. People with hormone-sensitive conditions (e.g. ER-positive breast cancer) should consult a clinician [^902cf369].

---

## Recommended intake and safety guidelines

- **Typical intake**: 1–2 servings/day (about 15–30 g soy protein) is safe for most adults [^notfound].
- **Supplements**: Avoid high-dose isoflavone pills (> 100 mg/day) without medical supervision [^c28abadc].
- **Special populations**: Pregnant/lactating women and those on thyroid therapy should consult a clinician [^8124bede] [^b72754b5].

---

## Conclusion

Daily tofu intake is **unlikely to cause hormonal problems** in most people. Isoflavones have weak estrogenic activity and do not meaningfully alter sex hormones at dietary levels [^b16f9440]. Evidence shows no increase in breast cancer risk, no feminizing effects in men, and potential benefits for menopausal symptoms [^f235d05c] [^95352267] [^78747a5d]. The main precaution is to separate soy from levothyroxine dosing [^b72754b5]. Individuals with hormone-sensitive conditions should seek personalized advice.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^c28abadc]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society guideline — Soy and soy products: Soy foods are an excellent source of protein and can provide a healthier alternative to meat; soy contains isoflavones with a structure similar to that of estrogens and capable of binding to estrogen receptors. There is some evidence that traditional soy foods such as tofu may decrease risk of cancers of the breast and prostate, but overall, the evidence remains too limited to draw a firm conclusion. There are no data to support the use of supplements containing isolated soy phytochemicals or soy protein powders used in some food products for reducing cancer risk, and a recent study found increased risk among users of soy supplements for estrogen receptor– negative breast cancer and for women with a family history of breast cancer. Therefore, although soy from food sources appears to be safe and may even have multiple beneficial health effects, soy supplements should be used with caution, if at all.

### Association of soy and fermented soy product intake with total and cause specific mortality: prospective cohort study [^3a5d1e5e]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Variables

Exposures were intake of total soy products, fermented soy products (including natto and miso), and non-fermented soy products (including tofu). The main outcomes were all cause and cause specific mortality from five main causes of death in Japan: cancer, total cardiovascular diseas (including heart disease and cerebrovascular disease), respiratory disease, and injury. Other variables included body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol intake, leisure time physical exercise or sport, self reported history of diabetes or use of drugs for diabetes, use of antihypertensives, consumption of coffee and green tea, health check-ups, menopause status in women, exogenous female hormone use in women, and dietary intakes such as total energy intake and intake of vegetables, fruit, fish, and meat.

### Soy intake and breast cancer risk in Singapore Chinese health study [^58ff30b3]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Three studies, including a case–control study that we conducted among Asian American women in Los Angeles County, found that the timing of soy exposure is an important codeterminant of risk, with stronger effects from exposures at earlier ages. This study lends further support to soy exposures occurring during the earlier stages of carcinogenesis and would result in a greater degree of reduction in a woman's subsequent risk for breast cancer. We noted that the magnitude of risk reduction among women with 10 or more years between exposure assessment and cancer diagnosis was twice than that among their counterparts with shorter time intervals. Interestingly, this model may explain the seemingly contradictory findings from recent soy intervention studies with generally null findings.

This prospective study has several important strengths. First, information on soy intake and other risk factors was obtained in-person before cancer diagnosis and thus the recall bias is not a concern. This is particularly important as seven of the eight studies in our meta-analysis on soy and breast cancer were case–control studies. Second, we used a validated FFQ, our assessment of soy intake was relatively complete, and dietary intake of soy was statistically significantly correlated with urine isoflavone levels. Third, our study is larger than previous cohort studies on this topic (two of the previous studies had less than 200 breast cancer cases. The larger sample size, particularly of postmenopausal women, has allowed us to investigate the potential modifying effect of body size on the soy–breast cancer association in postmenopausal women. Finally, we were able to examine the risk pattern by hormone receptor status, apparently the first such from a prospective study.

In summary, among 34 028 women in the SCHS, high soy intake (⩾10.6 mg isoflavones per 1000 Kcal) was associated with a significant 18% reduction in breast cancer risk. Our results adds to the compelling results obtained from case–control studies on soy and breast cancer and suggest that the soy isoflavones may have lasting beneficial effects against breast cancer development. The level of soy isoflavones implicated to have benefit (∼10 mg isoflavones per day or one standard serving of tofu) is achievable even in populations that do not typically eat soy foods.

### Isoflavone intake and the risk of coronary heart disease in US men and women: results from 3 prospective cohort studies [^d1bf3be5]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether soy products confer health benefits related to coronary heart disease (CHD) remains controversial because of inconsistent evidence.

Methods

A total of 74241 women from the NHS (Nurses' Health Study; 1984–2012), 94233 women from the NHSII (Nurses' Health Study II; 1991–2013), and 42226 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986–2012), who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline, were included in the present analysis. Dietary data were updated every 2 to 4 years using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD deaths were adjudicated through reviewing medical records, death certificates, and other medical documents.

Results

In these cohorts, 8359 incident CHD cases were documented during 4826 122 person-years of follow-up. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, isoflavone intake was inversely associated with CHD (pooled hazard ratio [HR] comparing the extreme quintiles: 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81–0.94]; P = 0.008). Consumption of tofu, but not soy milk, was inversely associated with the risk of CHD, with pooled HRs (95% CIs) of 0.82 (0.70–0.95; P = 0.005) and 0.87 (0.69–1.10; P = 0.41), respectively, comparing ≥ 1 serving/week with < 1 serving/month. Further analyses showed that, in women, the favorable association of tofu was primarily driven by stronger inverse association of tofu intake observed in younger women before menopause and postmenopausal women without hormone use (P interaction = 0.002).

Conclusions

Higher intake of isoflavones and tofu was associated with a moderately lower risk of developing CHD, and in women the favorable association of tofu were more pronounced in young women or postmenopausal women without hormone use.

### Soy as an endocrine disruptor: cause for caution? [^6ee6923a]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) alter the function of the endocrine system and consequently cause adverse health effects. Phytoestrogens, natural plant compounds abundantly found in soy and soy products, behave as weak estrogen mimics or as antiestrogens. They are considered to be EDCs, and have some beneficial effects on health, including reducing the risk of breast cancer and improving metabolic parameters. However, the supporting evidence that consumption of phytoestrogens is beneficial is indirect and inconsistent. Lifetime exposure to estrogenic substances, especially during critical periods of development, has been associated with formation of malignancies and several anomalies of the reproductive systems. Phytoestrogen consumption in infants, through soy-based formulas, is of particular concern. Prospective epidemiological studies for the evaluation of the effect of phytoestrogens alone, and in combination with other estrogenic chemicals, are lacking, yet possible adverse effects should not be taken lightly.

RISK ASSOCIATION STUDIES IN LOW-SOY- CONSUMING WESTERN POPULATIONS

In studies conducted in Western populations (including one study of South Asians in the United Kingdom, daily soy isoflavone intake was estimated based on intake of certain traditional Asian soy foods and other food items for which values of isoflavones are available and have been compiled into various databases. Average intake of soy isoflavones was low (median was approximately 0.3 mg day −1) in these Western populations. Traditional Asian soy foods contributed little to the total intake of soy isoflavones in these studies: it was 3% in Norfolk-United Kingdom, 7% in Ultrecht, the Netherlands, 24% in Germany and 35% in the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. Instead a considerable (25–60%) proportion of soy isoflavones in these populations was from soy components added to typical Western foods including bakery and canned products.

Table 2 presents the meta-analysis results of these 11 studies in Western populations, showing no association between adult soy intake and breast cancer risk; the summary OR was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.97–1.11) between the highest (median was 0.8 mg or more per day) vs lowest (median was 0.15 mg or less per day) soy isoflavone intake. Results of the individual studies are shown in Figure 2. There was no significant heterogeneity among the study results (P = 0.42). The summary ORs and corresponding 95% CIs obtained from the four cohort/nested case–control studies and the seven case–control studies are overlapping.

In a few of these studies conducted in Western populations, risk patterns in relation to Asian soy foods (i.e. tofu and others) were presented. Results on these soy foods, at the relatively low levels consumed in the West, are compatible with those at corresponding consumption levels in Asian women.

### Epidemiology of soy exposures and breast cancer risk [^dc8e2b98]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

To overcome the difficulties and imprecision associated with estimating low dietary soy intake from questionnaires, baseline, prediagnostic blood/urine isoflavone levels collected from participants of three cohorts were examined in relation to breast cancer risk; two of these studies also had information on dietary soy isoflavone intake. The combined OR (summary OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.84–1.23) from these three nested case–control studies is consistent with the finding of no association based on dietary soy isoflavones and breast cancer risk in Western populations. There were no differences in results by menopausal status. One study examined the soy–breast cancer association by body size and reported no differences in results.

Soy intake during adolescence and breast cancer risk was investigated in one large Canadian case–control study. The authors reported a significant, inverse association with a score representing intake of foods considered rich in isoflavones. In this study population, few subjects (< 5%) reported intake of any soy foods (tofu, soybeans, soy milk and soy powder drinks) and the most likely sources of soy isoflavones were pancakes (mix), canned tuna and processed meats. The authors did not perform separate analyses by type of soy consumed (as food additives vs as soy foods). Due to the possible differential effects of the two sources of dietary soy exposures on breast cancer risk, it is unclear if these findings truly reflect a beneficial effect of early life soy intake on breast cancer development.

### Soy intake and breast cancer risk in Singapore Chinese health study [^f235d05c]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

We investigated the effects of soy isoflavone intake on breast cancer in a prospective study of 35 303 Singapore Chinese women enrolled during April 1993 to December 1998 in the Singapore Chinese Health Study. At recruitment, each subject was personally administered a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire covering 165 food and beverage items. As of December 31 2005, 629 had developed breast cancer following an accumulation of 338 242 person-years. Using Cox regression and adjusting for age at interview, year of interview, dialect group, education, family history of breast cancer, age when periods became regular, parity, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), n-3 fatty acid, and other covariates, we found breast cancer risk was reduced significantly in association with high soy intake. Relative to women with lower (below median) soy intake (< 10.6 mg isoflavone per 1000 Kcal), women with higher (above median) intake showed a significant 18% risk reduction (relative risk (RR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70–0.97). This inverse association was apparent mainly in postmenopausal women (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61–0.90), and was not observed in premenopausal women (RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.77–1. 40). Among postmenopausal women, the soy–breast cancer association was stronger in those above median BMI (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.51–0.88) than in leaner women (RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.62–1.11). Duration of follow-up modified the soy–breast cancer association, the effect being twice as large among women with 10+ vs fewer years of follow-up. Neither oestrogen nor progesterone receptor status of the tumours materially influenced the association. These prospective findings suggest that approximately 10 mg of isoflavones per day, obtained in a standard serving of tofu, may have lasting beneficial effects against breast cancer development.

### Effect of whole soy and isoflavones daidzein on bone turnover and inflammatory markers: a 6-month double-blind, randomized controlled trial in Chinese postmenopausal women who are equol producers [^d2ecac0f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Bone remodeling involves a series of highly regulated steps that depend on the interaction of two cell lineages, that is, the formation of new bone by osteoblasts and resorption of old bone by osteoclasts. The activities of both kinds of cells are triggered by hormonal and non-hormonal stimulations. Bone densitometry cannot be used to detect early or small treatment effects. Quantitative changes in skeletal turnover can be assessed easily and non-invasively by the measurement of biochemical markers, although limitations still exist in using BTMs alone, in assessing therapies or predicting bone loss because no standardized assays nor optimal thresholds are available for evaluating the efficacy of several BTMs. Although human studies reported that equol producers could obtain more health benefits than non-producersand whole soy foods (less processed soy products, that is, soy nuts, soy flour, soy milk, and tofu, etc.) exert more favorable effect than isolated soy components, the enhanced effects were primarily observed on cardiovascular and lipid parameters. To date, limited research has compared the effects of whole soy with purified isoflavones on bone health in the context of the equol-producing status of participants. In the present study, we have observed a significant decrease in inflammatory marker [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] and lipid levels by whole soy consumption. Inflammation is a primary mediator of the accelerated bone loss at menopause, and cardiovascular health strongly affects skeletal health. Thus, whole soy or purified daidzein may feature a potential beneficial effect on bone metabolism, especially in equol producers.

Thus, on the basis of our established RCT, we proposed to test the effects of whole soy and isoflavone daidzein on bone turnover and inflammatory markers among equol-producing postmenopausal women. We hypothesized that whole soy or isocaloric-purified daidzein may reduce bone resorption or increase bone formation in equol-producing postmenopausal women, and the effect might be mediated by the interactions with inflammatory markers.

RISK ASSOCIATION STUDIES IN HIGH-SOY-CONSUMING ASIANS

In Asia, soy food is consumed traditionally as nonfermented soy foods (tofu, sometimes known as bean curd, soybeans and soy milk), fermented soy foods (miso and natto) or other soy products (fried, dried and pressed soy products), and the average intake is between 25 and 50 mg of isoflavones per day. In contrast, intake of soy isoflavones in Western populations is usually less than 1.0 mg of isoflavones per day and Asian soy foods are rarely consumed. Their sources of soy isoflavones come from some legumes, sprouts and vegetables containing small amounts of isoflavones, and from soy flour and soy protein that are commonly added as extenders and fillers in different bakery and canned goods.

Eight of the 14 studies conducted in Asia or in Asian Americans captured the main sources of soy intake and carefully adjusted for relevant dietary and non-dietary potential confounders. We excluded the remaining six (two cohort, four case–control) studies from the meta-analysis due to incomplete assessment of soy intake in those studies. Specifically, two studies examined only about intake of tofu. Four other studies asked about intake of several soy foods that captured between 40 and 60% of total soy intake in those populations.

In the eight (one cohort, seven case–control) studies with relatively complete assessment of total soy intake, dietary soy exposure was expressed in varying units, including grams of soy foods per day, grams of soy protein per day, and milligrams of soy isoflavones per day. To facilitate comparison between individual studies, all dietary soy exposures were converted to units of milligram of isoflavones assuming that 1 g of soy protein or 10 g of soy food contain 3 mg of isoflavones.

### Cumulative meta-analysis of the soy effect over time [^27be0e85]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The soy health claims may be particularly important at a time when government agencies worldwide are suggesting more plant foods, 71, 72, 73, 74 and especially plant protein foods, 75 should be consumed. Soy provides an important plant protein source.

The weakness of this study is that it is not a systematic review (followed by a meta‐analysis) because no systematic review of the literature was undertaken, but rather the 46 studies identified by the FDA for their determination were used without prior selection and comprehensive review of the literature by the authors. It may also be questioned how easy it is to consume 25 g of soy protein daily. A total of 7 g of soy protein can be obtained by a cup of most soy milks (some, such as Eden Soy, provide 12 g soy protein/cup), soy yogurts contain up to 9 g/cup and Greek‐style soy yogurts even more, the average soy burger provides ≈12 g soy protein/patty, and extrafirm tofu has just > 14 g soy protein in 3 oz, so the daily dose could be obtained from a cup of soy milk, half a cup of yogurt, and 3 oz of extrafirm tofu as a meat replacement.

The strength of this study is that it used the exact data on which the FDA is basing its judgment. Furthermore, a cumulative meta‐analysis was undertaken to determine when, or if, the TC or LDL‐C reductions lost significance.

We conclude that soy continues to have a significant, if modest, effect in reducing serum LDL‐C as a cardiovascular disease risk factor. The effect of soy alone is modest, but it may produce a clinically meaningful reduction when combined in the diet with other FDA‐approved cholesterol‐lowering foods. Furthermore, at a time when plant protein sources are required, soy protein provides a useful plant protein source for the food industry, with a range of applications and with the production of heart healthy foods being one of them.

### Urinary isoflavone excretion as a compliance measure in a soy intervention among young girls: a pilot study [^90ba7368]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the compliance of young girls with a soy intervention.

Design

An 8-week dietary intervention and urine sample collection.

Setting

Free-living girls.

Subjects

A convenience sample of 8- to 14-y-old girls (20 started and 17 finished the study) recruited through flyers distributed to staff members and previous study participants.

Intervention

The girls consumed one daily serving of soymilk, soy nuts, or tofu, completed 3-day food records, kept daily soy intake logs, and collected weekly urine samples.

Main Outcome Measures

Compliance with the intervention was evaluated by daily soy intake logs, 3-day food records analyzed by the center's Food Composition and Food Groups Servings Databases, and weekly urinary isoflavone excretion using high-pressure liquid chromatography. The statistical analysis included paired t-tests, analysis of variance, and Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients.

Results

Daily soy intake logs indicated a mean intake of 6.28 servings out of a maximum of 7.0 servings per week. The food records revealed a six-fold increase in isoflavone intake during the study period (P < 0.01) which was confirmed by an increase in urinary isoflavone excretion of similar magnitude (23.3–142.1 nmol/mg creatinine, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the ability of young girls to consume one daily soy serving and the usefulness of urinary isoflavones as a primary compliance measure. The high urinary isoflavone excretion levels detected in girls as compared to adult women suggest less intestinal degradation and/or greater absorption of isoflavones in nonadult populations. This finding requires further investigations into the pharmacokinetics of isoflavones.

Soy and some of its constituents, such as isoflavones, have been shown to have cancer-inhibitory activities in experimental studies. Data from epidemiologic studies linking usual soy food intake with colorectal cancer are limited and inconsistent.

Objective

The objective was to investigate whether soy food intake is associated with colorectal cancer risk.

Design

We prospectively examined 68,412 women aged 40–70 y and free of cancer and diabetes at enrollment. Usual soy food intake was assessed at baseline (1997–2000) and reassessed during the first follow-up (2000–2002) through in-person interviews with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We excluded the first year of observation to minimize lifestyle changes related to preclinical disease.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 6.4 y, 321 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, total soy food intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. Each 5-g/d increment in intake of soy foods as assessed by dry weight [equivalent to approximately 1 oz (28.35 g) tofu/d] was associated with an 8% reduction in risk (95% CI: 3%, 14%). Women in the highest tertile of intake had a multivariate relative risk of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.90) compared with those in the lowest tertile (P for trend = 0.008). This inverse association was primarily confined to postmenopausal women. Similar results were also found for intakes of soy protein and isoflavones.

Conclusion

This prospective study suggests that consumption of soy foods may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women.

### A dietary intervention for vasomotor symptoms of menopause: a randomized, controlled trial [^ee91a79f]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Participants were recruited in two cohorts (fall and spring) for a parallel-design, 12-week study beginning in September 2020 and February 2021. The Advarra Institutional Review Board approved the study on September 2, 2020 (Pro00045315).

Postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years reporting at least two moderate-to-severe hot flashes per day were recruited via social media notices. Criteria for inclusion were cessation of menstruation > 1 and < 10 years prior and willingness to consume a low-fat, vegan diet with daily soybeans. Criteria for exclusion were any cause of vasomotor symptoms other than natural menopause; current use of a low-fat, vegan diet including daily soy products; soy allergy; use of hormonal medications in the preceding 2 months; smoking; substance abuse; eating disorder history; weight-reducing medication use during the last 6 months; a current effort at weight loss; and body mass index < 18.5 kg/m 2.

Within each cohort, volunteers meeting the aforementioned criteria who provided a practice dietary record and gave informed consent were assigned, using a random-number table, to an intervention or control group.

Outcome measures

Before and after the 12-week intervention period, the following outcomes were assessed, except as noted.

Health status

Participants were asked about any health issues and medications.

Height

Self-reported height was collected at baseline.

Body weight

Weight was measured with self-calibrating digital scales (Renpho Model ES-CS20M, Anaheim, CA).

Dietary intake

Dietary intake for two weekdays and one weekend day was recorded by participants and analyzed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, using Nutrition Data System for Research software version 2020.

Recent physical activity

Using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, metabolic equivalents for given activity levels were multiplied by the time (in minutes) and frequency (in days) of these activities.

Hot flashes

For 7 days, the onset, cessation, and intensity of hot flashes were recorded upon occurrence with a mobile application (My Luna; Blue Trail Software Holding, San Francisco, CA). Nighttime hot flashes were to be registered the following morning. In cases where hot flash frequency changed markedly, participants were contacted by telephone for confirmation.

Quality of life

The effect of menopausal symptoms on quality of life was reported using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire for four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual.

### Validation of a soy food-frequency questionnaire and evaluation of correlates of plasma isoflavone concentrations in postmenopausal women [^94134635]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Soy foods may have various health benefits, but little is known about the patterns and correlates of soy consumption among postmenopausal women in the United States.

Objective

We assessed the reliability and validity of a soy food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and examined demographic, lifestyle, and dietary correlates of plasma isoflavone concentrations in postmenopausal women.

Design

In this cross-sectional study, soy isoflavone intake and plasma isoflavone concentration were analyzed in 96 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 y; the data were obtained at 2 visits that were 1 wk apart. Intake was determined with a 20-item soy FFQ and a comprehensive FFQ that included questions about tofu and soymilk. Fasting plasma daidzein and genistein concentrations were determined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Results

Intraclass correlations between week 1 and week 2 values were > 0.98 for both the soy and comprehensive FFQs. Median reported isoflavone intake was < 2 mg/d. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients relating isoflavone intakes with plasma isoflavone concentrations ranged from 0.35 to 0.43. Plasma isoflavone concentrations were positively associated with age, fiber consumption, servings of fruit and vegetables, and dietary supplement use and were inversely associated with caffeine consumption; no associations with body mass index, education, dietary beliefs, activity level, alcohol intake, or fat intake were observed.

Conclusions

Within a population with low soy consumption, the soy FFQ and comprehensive FFQ showed good reliability and moderate validity. Associations of plasma isoflavone concentrations with other dietary behaviors suggest that these compounds may serve as biomarkers of health behaviors in populations with low soy consumption.

### Soy intake and breast cancer risk in Singapore Chinese health study [^f34ecded]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

We investigated the effects of soy isoflavone intake on breast cancer in a prospective study of 35,303 Singapore Chinese women enrolled during April 1993 to December 1998 in the Singapore Chinese Health Study. At recruitment, each subject was personally administered a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire covering 165 food and beverage items. As of December 31,2005, 629 had developed breast cancer following an accumulation of 338,242 person-years. Using Cox regression and adjusting for age at interview, year of interview, dialect group, education, family history of breast cancer, age when periods became regular, parity, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), n-3 fatty acid, and other covariates, we found breast cancer risk was reduced significantly in association with high soy intake. Relative to women with lower (below median) soy intake (< 10.6 mg isoflavone per 1000 Kcal), women with higher (above median) intake showed a significant 18% risk reduction (relative risk (RR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70–0.97). This inverse association was apparent mainly in postmenopausal women (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61–0.90), and was not observed in premenopausal women (RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.77–1. 40). Among postmenopausal women, the soy-breast cancer association was stronger in those above median BMI (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.51–0.88) than in leaner women (RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.62–1.11). Duration of follow-up modified the soy-breast cancer association, the effect being twice as large among women with 10+ vs fewer years of follow-up. Neither oestrogen nor progesterone receptor status of the tumours materially influenced the association. These prospective findings suggest that approximately 10 mg of isoflavones per day, obtained in a standard serving of tofu, may have lasting beneficial effects against breast cancer development.

### Factors related to age at natural menopause in China: results from the China kadoorie biobank [^052c156a]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study found that women with higher consumption of meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy and soybean products had lower odds of having PM and/or EM, which to some extent, confirms the possible delaying effect of protein intake on ANM. Specifically, the consistently observed positive association between meat and ANM in our cohort and previous studies supported the hypothesis that meat protein may increase episodic releases of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and the length of the menstrual cycle. In addition, concurring with prior evidence, the relationship of higher dairy product intake with later ANM observed here may also support the association of dairy product intake with reduction of decline of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level, a direct marker of ovarian reserve and menopausal age. A similar mechanism may also play a role in our finding that women with higher intake of fresh fruits were less likely to have PM and EM. In addition, fruits are rich in antioxidants and thought to ameliorate oxidative stress on ovarian follicles and thus affect menopausal age. The lower odds of EM associated with soybean product intake found in the present study differed from previous studies. An association of soy product intake with earlier menopause was found in a cross-sectional Japanese studybut not in the subsequent follow-up study. In the Nurses' Health Study II cohort study of 85,682 premenopausal US women, neither soy nor tofu intake was related to EM over twenty years of follow-up. The present study also indicated a positive relationship of vitamin intake with LM and women with daily spicy food intake were more likely to have EM. Further studies on observational associations and potential mechanisms are warranted.

### Soy intake and breast cancer risk in Singapore Chinese health study [^4f0d46df]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study found a significant 18% reduction in breast cancer risk in association with the above median soy isoflavone intake (⩾10.6 mg 1000 Kcal −1), a degree of risk reduction compatible with the results that we found in a combined analysis of eight studies in Asian populations with soy intake. The amount of soy isoflavones (∼10 mg per day) implicated to have benefit in cancer prevention can be obtained in one standard serving of tofu. The inverse association with soy intake in this Singapore cohort was statistically significant in postmenopausal but not in premenopausal women (Table 1), but we were limited in studying such women by the lower age limit of this cohort study being 45 years, and only 26% of participants were aged 45–50 years at enrollment. There is a suggestion that heavier postmenopausal women showed a stronger association than leaner women, although the two sets of RRs are not statistically different from each other (Table 2). The risk reduction with soy intake was found in both ER+ and ER− tumours as well as in PR+ and PR− tumours (Table 3). A stronger soy–breast cancer association was found among women with longer (10+ years) duration of follow-up (Table 4).

### Soybean products and reduction of breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Japan [^e5cce10c]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Isoflavone intake by Japanese is much higher than that by Western populations. Tofu, miso and natto were main foods containing rich isoflavones. Attributable rate of genistein were tofu (49.6%), miso (20.9%), natto (14.7%) among Japanese. In the present study, tofu was protective in premenopausal women, while atsuage and aburage, deep fried tofu containing much oil, was associated with elevated risk among postmenopausal women. This may be due to fat intake, which can exert an influence on the development of breast cancer among postmenopausal women. Some studies have suggested that high intake of soybean products in premenopausal women may reduce serum oestradiol concentrations, suppress the mid-cycle surge of gonadotropins, and perhaps increase the length of the menstrual cycle.

There is increasing evidence that dietary factors may play a role in the production, metabolism, and bioavailability of sex hormones. Soy-containing diets have long been known to be typical of some ethnic groups who experience low breast cancer risk. Soybeans contain a significant amount of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein, which may exert antioestrogenic effects and protect epithelial tissue from stimulation by endogenous oestrogens. There are several possible mechanisms by which soy isoflavones specifically may modulate the risk of breast carcinoma: (1) increase of serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG); (2) downregulation of enzymes involved in oestrogen biosynthesis, such as aromatase; (3) inhibition of 17 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I; (4) suppression of the gonadotorpins follicule stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH); (5) change in intestinal flora, which affect reabsorption of E2 and lower circulating oestrogen levels. Studies examining the effect of a soy protein diet on the menstrual cycle have demonstrated a significant increase in follicular phase length and delay in menstruation, including suppression of midcycle surges of LH and FSH, which potentially may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Isoflavones have in fact received a great deal of attention due to their antiproliferative properties and these would support the protective effect against breast cancer in premenopausal women observed in the present study. However, clarification of effects in postmenopausal women is still required. In this context it is of interest that isoflavones may exert both oestrogenic and antioestrogenic properties after modification by intestinal bacteria.

### The women's study for the alleviation of vasomotor symptoms (WAVS): a randomized, controlled trial of a plant-based diet and whole soybeans for postmenopausal women [^3b4c0cd7]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The study was approved by the Advarra Institutional Review Board on September 2, 2020 (Pro00045315). Women with postmenopausal hot flashes were recruited through social media and screened by telephone (Fig. 1). Inclusion criteria were postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years, moderate-to-severe hot flashes at least twice daily, last period within the preceding 10 years, no menses in the preceding 12 months, and willingness to follow a low-fat vegan diet, including soybeans. Exclusion criteria were use of hormonal medications in the preceding 2 months, an explanation for hot flashes other than natural menopause, smoking, substance abuse, history of an eating disorder, use of weight-loss medications in the preceding 6 months, a current attempt to lose weight, a body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m 2, soy allergy, and current consumption of a low-fat vegan diet with daily soy intake. Volunteers who met the eligibility criteria, provided consent, and completed a practice dietary record were assigned to an intervention group or control group using a computer-generated random-number table. Because assignment was done simultaneously, allocation concealment was unnecessary.

### Soybean products and reduction of breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Japan [^7e7233c5]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The present study found a statistically inverse association between risk of breast cancer and soybean products (tofu) or isoflavones intake in Japanese premenopausal women while there was no statistically significant link among their postmenopausal counterparts.

Soybean foods are rich in precursors of the isoflavone daidzein and genistein, which are heterocyclic phenols similar in structure to oestrogens, and it has been hypothesised that a high dietary intake of soybean products might reduce breast cancer risk by interfering with the action of endogenous oestradiol. The results are in line with the inverse association between intake of soybean products and breast cancer risk suggested from ecological/cross-sectional studies, and also from analytical investigations. Thus, case–control studies have found that soybean food intake was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal Singapore women, and both pre- and postmenopausal Asian-American women, although a Chinese case–control study failed to detect any protective effects of soybean food. Cohort studies among Japanese, Japanese-American and Caucasian-American women have also provided some evidence that soybean products may reduce the risk of breast cancer. A prospective study conducted in Japan, however, found no link between soya consumption and breast cancer risk, but in this case the subjects were city residents in Hiroshima or Nagasaki exposed to high doses of ionising radiation and therefore the cohort was unusual. A recent cohort study based on public health center in Japan found frequent miso soup and isoflavone consumption to be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer and the protective effect was stronger in postmenopausal women. However, the FFQ applied included only two items for soybean-ingredient foods (i.e. miso soup and soyfoods), making it impossible to investigate differences in effects among types of soybean-ingredient foods.

### Consumption of soy foods and isoflavones and risk of type 2 diabetes: a pooled analysis of three US cohorts [^cc6f7be0]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Evidence regarding the consumption of soy foods and isoflavones in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is scarce. Our study was to evaluate the association between soy food and isoflavone consumption and risk of T2D in US men and women.

Subjects/Methods

We followed 63115 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1998–2012), 79061 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (1999–2013) and 21281 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (2002–2010). Diet was assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire and was updated every 4 years. Self-reports of incident T2D were confirmed by a validated supplementary questionnaire.

Results

During 1966321 person-years of follow-up, 9185 incident T2D cases were documented. After multivariate adjustment for covariates, consumption of soy foods (tofu and soy milk) was not associated with a lower T2D risk. Compared with non-consumers of soy foods, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 1.07) for < 1 serving/week and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.03) for ⩾1 serving/week of soy foods (P for trend = 0.14). In contrast, intake of total isoflavones was inversely associated with T2D risk. Comparing extreme quintiles of isoflavones, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.96; P for trend = 0.009). Inverse associations were also found for consumption of major individual isoflavones, including daidzein and genistein, with risk of T2D.

Conclusions

Intake of isoflavones was associated with a modestly lower T2D risk in US men and women who typically consumed low-to-moderate amounts of soy foods. These findings warrant replications in other populations with similar soy intake levels.

### Legume, soy, tofu, and isoflavone intake and endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal women in the multiethnic cohort study [^3ce3dd80]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Phytochemicals found in soy and other legumes have been speculated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer; however, inconsistent findings have been reported in the few epidemiological studies conducted to date.

Methods

We conducted a prospective analysis of 46027 nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women who were recruited into the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study between August 1993 and August 1996 and provided detailed baseline information on diet and other endometrial cancer risk factors. A total of 489 women diagnosed with incident endometrial cancer were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results tumor registry linkages during a median follow-up period of 13.6 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for endometrial cancer associated with dietary intake of legumes, soy, and tofu, and for total isoflavones and specific isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, or glycitein). Truncated (age 50–89 years) age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated by applying age-specific rates within isoflavone quintiles to the overall MEC population eligible for endometrial cancer. To estimate the percentage of endometrial cancers that may have been prevented by consuming the highest quintile of total isoflavones, the partial population attributable risk percent was calculated.

Results

A reduced risk of endometrial cancer was associated with total isoflavone intake (highest vs lowest quintile, ≥ 7.82 vs < 1.59 mg per 1000 kcal/d, RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.91), daidzein intake (highest vs lowest quintile, ≥ 3.54 vs < 0.70 mg per 1000 kcal/d, RR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.90), and genistein intake (highest vs lowest quintile, ≥ 3.40 vs < 0.69 mg per 1000 kcal/d, RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.91). No statistically significant association with endometrial cancer risk was observed for increasing intake of legumes, soy, tofu, or glycitein. Truncated age-adjusted incidence rates of endometrial cancer for the highest vs lowest quintile of total isoflavone intake were 55 vs 107 per 100000 women per year, respectively. The partial population attributable risk percent for total isoflavone intake lower than the highest quintile was 26.7% (95% CI = 5.3% to 45.8%).

Conclusion

This study suggests that greater consumption of isoflavone-containing foods is associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer in this population of nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women.

### Endogenous and exogenous hormone exposure and the risk of meningioma in men [^de48afbf]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Meningioma is a disease with considerable morbidity and is more commonly diagnosed in females than in males. Hormonally related risk factors have long been postulated to be associated with meningioma risk, but no examination of these factors has been undertaken in males.

Methods

Subjects were male patients with intracranial meningioma (n = 456), ranging in age from 20 to 79 years, who were diagnosed among residents of the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area, and 8 counties in Texas and matched controls (n = 452). Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between hormonal factors and meningioma risk in men.

Results

Use of soy and tofu products was inversely associated with meningioma risk (OR 0.50 [95% CI 0.37–0.68]). Increased body mass index (BMI) appears to be associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of developing meningioma in men. No other single hormone-related exposure was found to be associated with meningioma risk, although the prevalence of exposure to factors such as orchiectomy and vasectomy was very low.

Conclusions

Estrogen-like exogenous exposures, such as soy and tofu, may be associated with reduced risk of meningioma in men. Endogenous estrogen-associated factors such as high BMI may increase risk. Examination of other exposures related to these factors may lead to better understanding of mechanisms and potentially to intervention.

### Soybean products and reduction of breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Japan [^0cd22148]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Despite a marked increase in recent years, the incidence rates for female breast cancer in most Asian countries are much lower than those in the Western world. Much of the international variation is due to differences in established reproductive risk factors, such as age at menarche, parity and age at first birth, but dietary habits might also contribute. Dietary studies of breast cancer have typically focused on the hypothesis that there is a positive link with intake of fat. While ecological studies have suggested associations in terms of incidence and mortality, leading prospective studies of breast cancer, including the Nurse's Health Study and studies of large cohorts from New York and Norway have shown no relation. Recently, there has been more interest in other dietary factors, such as soybean products, which may protect against breast cancer and provide an explanation for some of the international differences in incidence rates.

Soybeans provide a unique concentrated source of isoflavones and soybeans or isoflavones have been shown to exert anticarcinogenic effects on hormone-related cancers in a large number of experimental studies. Despite the growing interest in the protective effects, there are relatively few epidemiological data available since soybean products are consumed mainly by Asian populations. In Japan, intake is in various forms, including tofu (soybean curd), okara (tofu lees), moyashi (soybean sprouts), tonyu (soymilk), yuba (soy milk skin), kinako (soy flour), miso (fermented soybean paste), atsuage (deep fried tofu), aburage (thinly sliced deep fried tofu), natto (fermented soybeans), koyadofu (freeze dried tofu) and shoyu (soy sauce), so that the diet is likely to be much richer in isoflavones than in the Western world, where the diet usually does not include soybeans. We here evaluated the association between risk of breast cancer and consumption of soybean products and isoflavones using data from the hospital-based epidemiologic research program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC).

### Proanthocyanidins and other flavonoids in relation to endometrial cancer risk: a case-control study in Italy [^120d0dc6]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The low intake of soya or soya products – and consequently of isoflavones – in the Italian population makes results difficult to compare with other populations, especially the Asian ones. In those populations, the effects of isoflavone-rich foods on endometrial cancer have also been examined. In a case–control study conducted on a multiethnic population in the Hawaii, including 332 cases and 511 controls, a high consumption of tofu and other soy products was associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.46 for the highest vs the lowest quartile category, 95% CI = 0.26–0.83, P for trend = 0.01;). In a previously mentioned study from China, the OR for the highest vs the lowest quartile of soya protein intake was 0.67, with a significant trend in risk (P for trend 0.01;). Isoflavones and isoflavone-rich foods have also been linked to other hormone-related cancers including breast and ovarian cancers.

### Soybean products and reduction of breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Japan [^0ef4cd8b]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Components of the Japanese diet, which might contribute to the relatively low breast cancer incidence rates in Japan, have not been clarified in detail. Since soybean products are widely consumed in Japan, a case–control study taking account of the menopausal status was conducted using data from the hospital-based epidemiologic research program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC). In total, 167 breast cancer cases were included and 854 women confirmed as free of cancer were recruited as the control group. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. There were reductions in risk of breast cancer associated with high intake of soybean products among premenopausal women. Compared with women in the lowest tertile, the adjusted ORs for top tertile intake of tofu (soybean curd) was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25–0.95). A significant decrease in premenopausal breast cancer risk was also observed for increasing consumption of isoflavones (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22–0.89 for highest vs lowest tertile; P for trend = 0.02). The present study found a statistically inverse association between tofu or isoflavone intake and risk of breast cancer in Japanese premenopausal women, while no statistically significant association was evident with the risk among postmenopausal women.

### Continuous high-soy protein soymilk intake affects ordinary walking speed in the Japanese pre-frail and frail elderly: a randomized controlled trial [^506122ed]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, in addition to soy protein, soymilk contains isoflavones, which are known to possess physiological functions for muscle. The extent to which the individual effects and synergistic effects of soy protein and isoflavones influenced the results of this study remains unclear. Nevertheless, in the present RCT using different soy protein contents, it is improbable that there was any significant isoflavone-derived effect, which was similarly present in the control beverage.

From these results, although there was no increase in exercise or step count between the two groups, the subgroups with a higher walking speed (≥ 1.0 m/s) or higher step count (≥ 5,000 steps/day) exercised or played sports as part of their daily physical activities, which may be one of the reasons for the improvement in walking speed. However, referring to the result of J-CHS questionnaire items (especially fatigue and physical activity), no significant difference was seen between the high-soy protein group and the control group through the intervention, strongly suggesting that there were no drastic changes in exercise habits. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis of the efficacy outcome items related to energy consumption prior to the intervention revealed no significant change in exercise function independent of energy consumption.

These results indicate that the influence of individual differences in daily exercise habits and activity levels was low. Additionally, the BDHQ confirmed no significant differences in the intake of major nutrients or soy foods, except soymilk (tofu and fried tofu), between the two groups before or after the intervention. Notably, the estimated protein intake based on urine analysis was higher in the high-soy protein group than in the control group after 12 weeks of intervention. Therefore, the effect of nutrient intake from dietary habits other than nutritional intervention was considered to be small.

### Meta-analysis of soy intake and breast cancer risk [^830c26f1]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2006). Low credibility.

Background

High intake of soy foods has been proposed to contribute to the low breast cancer risk in Asian countries. However, results of epidemiologic studies of this association are highly variable, and experimental data suggest that soy constituents can be estrogenic and potentially risk enhancing. Thus, rigorous evaluation of available epidemiologic data is necessary before appropriate recommendations can be made, especially for women at high risk of breast cancer or those who have survived the disease.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of 18 epidemiologic studies (12 case-control and six cohort or nested case-control) published from 1978 through 2004 that examined soy exposure and breast cancer risk. Pooled relative risk estimates were based on either the original soy exposure measure defined in each study or on an estimate of daily soy protein intake.

Results

Risk estimates, levels and measures of soy exposure, and control for confounding factors varied considerably across studies. In a pooled analysis, among all women, high soy intake was modestly associated with reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 0.99); the association was not statistically significant among women in Asian countries (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.12). Among the 10 studies that stratified by menopausal status the inverse association between soy exposure and breast cancer risk was somewhat stronger in premenopausal women (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.85) than in postmenopausal women (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.98); however, eight studies did not provide menopause-specific results, six of which did not support an association. When exposure was analyzed by soy protein intake in grams per day, a statistically significant association with breast cancer risk was seen only among premenopausal women (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.92 to 0.97).

Conclusions

Soy intake may be associated with a small reduction in breast cancer risk. However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to potential exposure misclassification, confounding, and lack of a dose response. Given these caveats and results of some experimental studies that suggest adverse effects from soy constituents, recommendations for high-dose isoflavone supplementation to prevent breast cancer or prevent its recurrence are premature.

### Soybean products and reduction of breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Japan [^bfd1b3b7]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Components of the Japanese diet, which might contribute to the relatively low breast cancer incidence rates in Japan, have not been clarified in detail. Since soybean products are widely consumed in Japan, a case-control study taking account of the menopausal status was conducted using data from the hospital-based epidemiologic research program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC). In total, 167 breast cancer cases were included and 854 women confirmed as free of cancer were recruited as the control group. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. There were reductions in risk of breast cancer associated with high intake of soybean products among premenopausal women. Compared with women in the lowest tertile, the adjusted ORs for top tertile intake of tofu (soybean curd) was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25–0.95). A significant decrease in premenopausal breast cancer risk was also observed for increasing consumption of isoflavones (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22–0.89 for highest vs lowest tertile; P for trend = 0.02). The present study found a statistically inverse association between tofu or isoflavone intake and risk of breast cancer in Japanese premenopausal women, while no statistically significant association was evident with the risk among postmenopausal women.

### Soy consumption and risk of COPD and respiratory symptoms: a case-control study in Japan [^86e88d8e]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To investigate the relationship between soy consumption, COPD risk and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, a case-control study was conducted in Japan.

Methods

A total of 278 eligible patients (244 men and 34 women), aged 50–75 years with COPD diagnosed within the past four years, were referred by respiratory physicians, while 340 controls (272 men and 68 women) were recruited from the community. All participants underwent spirometric measurements of respiratory function. Information on demographics, lifestyle characteristics and habitual food consumption was obtained using a structured questionnaire.

Results

Total soy consumption was positively correlated with observed lung function measures. The mean soy intake was significantly higher among controls (59.98, SD 50.23 g/day) than cases (44.84, SD 28.5 g/day). A significant reduction in COPD risk was evident for highest versus lowest quartile of daily intake of total soybean products, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.392, 95% CI 0.194–0.793, p for trend 0.001. Similar decreases in COPD risk were associated with frequent and higher intake of soy foods such as tofu and bean sprouts, whereas respiratory symptoms were inversely associated with high consumption of soy foods, especially for breathlessness (OR 0.989, 95% CI 0.982–0.996).

Conclusion

Increasing soy consumption was associated with a decreased risk of COPD and breathlessness.

### Soy intake and breast cancer: elucidation of an unanswered question [^cfb58acf]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The review by Wu et al also highlights other understudied soy–breast cancer issues. In particular, the authors note that few investigators have formally evaluated the effects of soy intake on survival among women diagnosed with breast cancer. For example, one study conducted among a cohort of women with breast cancer in Shanghai observed no association between consumption of isoflavones at diagnosis and subsequent mortality. In contrast, in a recent publication by our own group a reduction in all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality was observed among a cohort of breast cancer survivors in the United States, who reported consuming higher levels of total flavonoids, and particularly flavones. To the best of our knowledge, no other reports on this subject have been published to date.

In sum, the meta-analysis by Wu et al notably demonstrate that relatively high intake of 10–20 mg per day of isoflavones, a consumption level frequently found among Asian populations, is inversely associated with a 10–30% reduction in risk of breast cancer. Lower isoflavone intake of < 1 mg, a level more commonly consumed by Western populations, does not appear to have any beneficial effects on breast cancer risk. Additional research is needed to assess whether soy consumption that begins during the adult years is sufficient to decrease risk, or whether only intake patterns that were initiated during childhood affect the subsequent risk of developing breast cancer. In addition, clarification is needed on whether intake of other flavonoid classes, particularly those in foods such as fruits and vegetables more frequently consumed by Western populations, are associated with breast cancer risk reductions as has been shown for flavones in three recently published studies. Lastly, whether consumption of isoflavones or other flavonoid classes affects mortality among breast cancer survivors has been evaluated in only two previous reports, with conflicting results, and thus this issue also deserves to be more extensively evaluated.

### Dietary phytoestrogens and total and cause-specific mortality: results from 2 prospective cohort studies [^f2d16d17]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding dietary phytoestrogens in relation to mortality remains limited.

Objectives

The objective of the study is to examine the associations of intake of isoflavones, lignans, and coumarins with total and cause-specific mortality in US males and females.

Methods

We followed 75,981 females in the Nurses' Health Study (1984–2018) and 44,001 males in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986–2018), who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, or cancer at baseline. Their diet was repeatedly assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires every 2–4 y. Associations with mortality were assessed using time-dependent Cox models with adjustments for demographics, dietary and lifestyle factors, and medical history.

Results

During 3,427,156 person-years of follow-up, we documented 50,734 deaths, including 12,492 CVD deaths, 13,726 cancer deaths, and 24,516 other non-CVD and noncancer deaths. After multivariable adjustment, the higher total phytoestrogen intake was associated with lower risk of total CVD and other non-CVD and noncancer mortality: comparing extreme quintiles, the pooled HRs (95% CIs) were 0.89 (0.87, 0.92), 0.90 (0.85, 0.96), and 0.86 (0.82, 0.90), respectively. We did not find a significant association with cancer mortality [0.97 (0.92, 1.03)]. For individual phytoestrogens in relation to total mortality, the pooled HRs (95% CIs) comparing extreme quintiles were 0.90 (0.87, 0.92) for isoflavones, 0.93 (0.90, 0.96) for lignans, and 0.93 (0.90, 0.95) for coumarins. Individual phytoestrogens were also significantly associated with lower risk of CVD mortality and other types of mortality. Primary food sources of phytoestrogens, including tofu, soy milk, whole grains, tea, and flaxseed, were also inversely associated with total mortality.

Conclusions

A higher intake of total phytoestrogens, including isoflavones, lignans, and coumarins, and foods rich in these compounds was associated with lower risk of total and certain cause-specific mortality in generally healthy US adults. These data suggest that these phytochemicals and their dietary sources may be integrated into an overall healthy diet to achieve a longer life span.

### Soy intake and breast cancer: elucidation of an unanswered question [^50e8ff39]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in many Western populations, although in Asian countries this disease is comparatively less frequent. For example, breast cancer incidence rates historically have been four to seven times higher among women in the United States than those in China or Japan, yet the underlying reasons for this disparity are not entirely clear. The geographic variation in risk does not appear to be due to large genetic differences between ethnicities, because breast cancer incidence rates among Asian-American women shifts substantially toward those of white American women within a few generations after migration.

These international variations in incidence rates coupled with the results from migration studies suggest breast cancer risk is influenced by environmental exposures, reproductive history, and lifestyle choices, including diet. Some researchers attribute the international heterogeneity in risk to the higher consumption of soy products in Asian countries. Since Americans and other Western populations tend to consume less flavonoid-rich foods compared to Asians and Asian-Americans, it is possible that compounds in these products with known biologic anti-cancer activity may decrease breast cancer risk and improve survival after diagnosis.

Flavonoids, of which soy-based isoflavones are the most intensely studied, lower endogenous hormone levels in pre- and post-menopausal women, and inhibit transcriptional factors involved in cancer metastasis, including vascular endothelial growth factor, which is strongly associated with tumour angiogenesis. These findings provide support for a biologically plausible association between dietary intake of flavonoids, particularly isoflavones, on breast cancer risk and prognosis.

Unfortunately, the multiple investigations conducted to date among human populations to evaluate a possible soy–breast cancer link appear to be inconsistent and interpretation is not straightforward. The meta-analysis presented by Wu et al in this issue of BMJ was undertaken to obtain a summary effect estimate of the association in epidemiologic studies. Their approach brings clarity to the heated debate on this controversial issue.

### The association between soy intake and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a prospective cohort study [^1c6201e0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

This study found that more than half (55.8%) of pregnant women consumed soy less than the recommended amount, indicating the situation of Chinese pregnant women's soy intake was not optimistic. Our previous study revealed that the daily soy intake of urban pregnant women in the early, middle, and late trimesters was 19.10 g, 19.42 g, and 21.50 g, respectively, less than half of the recommended value. This situation was even worse in rural pregnant women living in the poverty-stricken area, which revealed only 8.98% of pregnant women eat soy or soy products every day, 19.18% of pregnant women never eat soy or soy products during pregnancy. A survey conducted by Huang in Guangzhou showed that 9.9% of women consumed soy and soy products every day during pregnancy, and only 6.50 g/day of soy was consumed in the third trimester. These findings were also supported by studies in other areas in China, such as Urumqi, Xiamen, Lanzhou, and Anhui. Although health care providers inform pregnant women of the need to consume sufficient soy during pregnancy, pregnant women are not following the guidance well. This may be because pregnant women are not aware of the importance of soy intake for healthy outcomes, such as improving metabolic profiles and decreasing the risk of preterm birth and maternal anemia in late gestation. In addition, there may be external barriers such as difficulty in obtaining soy, poor taste of soy, bloating, and other uncomfortable reactions after ingesting soy, etc. Therefore, health care providers should make pregnant women be aware of the importance and benefits of soy intake, and introduced soy alternatives such as tofu and soy milk. The intake amount of soy products varies according to different processing methods and levels because different soy products have different amounts of protein and other components. For example, 100 g of soybeans contains 35.1 g of protein, 100 g of soybean milk and soybean milk powder contain 1.8 and 19.7 g of protein, respectively and 100 g of tofu related products, such as lactone tofu, dried tofu and shredded tofu, contain between 5 and 57.8 g of protein. More importantly, health care providers should also recommend soy intake for pregnant women following local dietary guidelines and advise them not to exceed the maximal intake limit recommendation. Soy should not be recommended for pregnant women who are allergic to it. Additionally, soy consumption should be cautiously recommended for pregnant women with kidney disease, severe stomach ulcers, gout, and cardiovascular disease.

### Gender-specific effects of soybean consumption on cardiovascular events in elderly individuals from rural northeast China-a prospective cohort study [^043c5ce3]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have highlighted the crucial role of diet in the progression of chronic diseases. In Asian countries, soybeans and their products, like Tofu, soybean milk, and Tofu jelly, are widely consumed, especially in China. Soybeans and their products have demonstrated numerous beneficial effects on chronic diseases, partly attributed to their ability to lower serum lipid profiles. Non-nutritive substances, such as soy isoflavones, have been associated with preventing and treating different chronic diseases. Moreover, soy dietary fiber has been recognized for its health-promoting properties. Furthermore, soybeans and soy foods improve vascular health, preserve bone mineral density, benefit renal function, and reduce menopausal symptoms. Based on meta-analyzes and recent clinical trials, soy isoflavones have been found to effectively reduce hot flashes, improve the quality of life, and lower the cardiovascular risk in women. Therefore, in recent years, nutritionists have suggested replacing animal-based foods with soybean foods to harness their nutritional benefits.

In recent years, China has been facing the impact of an "aging tsunami", which has emerged as a significant concern due to the increasing proportion of older individuals in the general population. According to the data from the Seventh National Population Census in 2020, the proportion of individuals aged > 60 and > 65 years has increased by 5.44% (from 13.26% to 2010 to 18.70% in 2020) and 4.6% (from 8.9 to 13.5%) over the past decade, respectively. In rural China, the proportion of individuals aged ≥ 60 and ≥ 65 years is 23.8% and 17.7%; these are 7.99% and 6.61% higher than those in urban areas, respectively. Data from the Seventh National Population Census highlights the need to address the challenges of aging in rural areas. Chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), are significantly frequent among the aging population, necessitating effective strategies to reduce the incidence and mortality of CVDs in this demographic.

### A prospective cohort study of soy product intake and stomach cancer death [^e90de448]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The subjects were cohort members from the Takayama Study. The methology of the Takayama Study has been described previously. Briefly, the cohort included a total of 14 427 men and 17 125 women from Takayama City, Gifu, Japan, who were 35 years of age or older. Each participant completed a self-administered questionnaire in 1992 that was used to collect demographic and general information about smoking, alcohol, diet, exercise and medical and reproductive histories. The response rate was about 90%. Those who had smoked a total of 20 or more packs of cigarettes in their lifetime were defined as smokers.

Dietary history was assessed using a 169-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Participants were asked to report the average frequency with which food was consumed in the previous year and the usual serving size of each food item. Nine food items for specific soy products and some others with soy products as ingredients were accounted for in order to estimate the total intake of soy products. Thus, total soy product intake was the sum of the intakes of tofu, miso, soybeans, natto, soymilk, okara, dried-tofu, deep-fried tofu, fried-tofu, fried tofu and minced vegetables/seaweed. The intake of foods and nutrients was estimated from the frequency of ingestion and portion size using the Japanese Standard Tables of Food Composition, 4th revised edition, published by the Science and Technology Agency of Japan. We also estimated the amounts for two main categories of soy products: fermented and non-fermented soy products. The fermented category included miso and natto. The other soy foods measured were non-fermented soy products. Isoflavone (daidzein plus genistein) contents are higher in fermented soy products; according to data summarised by, isoflavone concentration per 100 g were 76.6 mg for miso and 67.4 mg for natto, while 24.1 mg for tofu and 36.2 mg for boiled soy beans. Salt is rich in miso, around 10 g per 100 g. The other soy products contain less than 1 g of salt per 100 g. Detailed information on the questionnaire concerning validity and reproducibility tests has been provided elsewhere. For example, the Spearman correlation coefficients comparing estimates from this questionnaire and 12 daily diet records over 1 year were 0.75, 0.77 and 0.74 for soy intake in terms of the total amount (g) of soy products, daidzein, and genistein, respectively, in men. Corresponding values for women were 0.68, 0.63, and 0.65, respectively.

### Long-term consumption of isoflavone-enriched foods does not affect bone mineral density, bone metabolism, or hormonal status in early postmenopausal women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study [^69af954d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a major health problem. It was hypothesized that isoflavone-containing products may be a potential alternative to hormone replacement therapy for preventing bone loss during the menopausal transition.

Objective

The objective was to investigate whether the consumption of isoflavone-enriched foods for 1 y affects bone mineral density, bone metabolism, and hormonal status in early postmenopausal women.

Design

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter trial. Two hundred thirty-seven healthy early postmenopausal women [mean (± SD) age of 53 ± 3 y and time since last menses of 33 ± 15 mo] consumed isoflavone-enriched foods providing a mean daily intake of 110 mg isoflavone aglycones or control products for 1 y while continuing their habitual diet and lifestyle. Outcome measures included bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and total body, markers of bone formation and bone resorption, hormones, isoflavones in plasma and urine, safety variables, and adverse events.

Results

Consumption of isoflavone-enriched products did not alter bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and total body or markers of bone formation and bone resorption. Hormone concentrations did not differ between the isoflavone and control groups. Consumption of isoflavone-enriched products resulted in increased isoflavone concentrations in plasma and urine, whereas control products did not. This finding indicated good compliance with treatment. Subgroup analysis did not support an effect of equol phenotype on bone density. The intervention had no effect on a range of safety variables and reported adverse events.

Conclusion

Consumption of foods containing 110 mg/d of soy isoflavone aglycone equivalents for 1 y did not prevent postmenopausal bone loss and did not affect bone turnover in apparently healthy early postmenopausal white women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00301353.

### Soy consumption and risk of COPD and respiratory symptoms: a case-control study in Japan [^2e42ca6a]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Information on habitual food consumption was obtained using a 138-item interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire taken from the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study on cancer and cardiovascular disease. Its validity and reproducibility had been established for the Japanese population. The reference recall period for dietary variables was set at 5 years before interview. Therefore, the recall period was shorter among cases (before their diagnoses of COPD) and different from case to case depending on their date of diagnosis. Soy food consumption encompassed tofu (boiled or cold, in miso soup, freeze-dried, deep-fried), natto, bean sprouts, and soy milk which are soybean products. The frequency of intake of tofu, natto and bean sprouts was classified by nine categories: 'almost never', 'once to three times per month', 'once to twice per week', 'three to four times per week', 'five to six times per week', 'once per day', 'twice to three times per day', 'four to six times per day', and '7 or more times per day'. Those participants who answered "monthly" to "daily" were asked their usual amount consumed per meal in terms of standard portion size (tofu, 75 g; tofu in soup, 25 g; dried tofu, 60 g; deep-fried tofu, 2 g; natto, 75 g; bean sprouts, 25 g). The frequency of soy milk drinking was categorized into 'almost never', '1 to 2 times per week', '3 to 4 times per week', '5 to 6 times per week', 'one cup per day', '2 to 3 cups per day', '7 to 9 cups per day', and '10 or more cups per day'.

### Epidemiology of soy exposures and breast cancer risk [^b16f9440]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Soybeans and its products have been a staple in the Asian diet for centuries. Soybeans are the predominant source of isoflavones, one of the three main classes of phytoestrogens or plant oestrogens. Genistein and daidzein are the two major isoflavones; glycitein is a minor component. These soy isoflavone compounds are structurally similar to 17- β estradiol but possess weaker oestrogenic potencies. Given the recognised aetiologic association between oestrogen and breast cancer risk, there is biological plausibility that dietary soy intake may have anti-carcinogenic effect on the breast. A favoured mechanism by which soy isoflavones may influence breast cancer development is via their affinity and competition with endogenous oestrogens and other substrates in binding with oestrogen receptors (ERs). It has also been suggested that soy isoflavones may influence breast cancer risk via their anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.

first reported a reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal Singapore Chinese women who were high consumers of soy. Since then, there has been tremendous interest in the possible role of soy in the prevention of breast cancer. However, there is also the concern that soy may have stimulatory effects on the breast. Dietary genistein and highly processed soy agents have been found to stimulate growth in the MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and to promote breast cancer in ovaraectomised athymic mice models (for a review, see). In a short term soy-feeding trial, women randomised to the soy arm exhibited significantly higher indices of increased DNA synthesis relative to women in the control arm, although this apparent association failed to persist following the inclusion of 33 additional subjects.

The questions we would like to address in this review are as follows: (1) What is the epidemiologic evidence on soy and breast cancer? Is there a dose–response relationship? (2) Does the endogenous oestrogen environment, as reflected by menopausal status and body weight, affect this association? (3) Does timing of soy exposure affect this association? (4) Does the type of soy ingested affect this association, given that it can be consumed in the form of soy products that are common in a typical Asian diet or as fillers/extenders in processed foods?

### Soybean products and reduction of breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Japan [^9fb5a22c]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Furthermore, the following soybean products were included: (a) tofu (soybean curd); (b) miso (fermented soybean paste); (c) atsuage (deep fried tofu); (d) aburage (thinly sliced deep fried tofu); (e) natto (fermented soybeans); (f) koyadofu (freeze dried tofu). We evaluated validity of intakes based on the questionnaire against those according to 28-day (four-season consecutive 7-day) weighted diet records among 79 Japanese female dietitians. In the validation study, the Spearman's correlation coefficients between the estimate intake of soybean products and isoflavone from the questionnaire and that from dietary records were 0.51, 0.53, respectively. For reproducibility of estimation from the questionnaire, the Spearman's correlation coefficients for the consumption of soybean products and isoflavone intake between two questionnaires administered 1 year apart were 0.57 and 0.47, respectively.

All subjects in the present study were asked for average frequency and portion size of consumption, during the period of 1 year before onset of the present disease or before the interview. There were eight categories of possible responses, ranging from'rarely or never' to 'three or more times per day'. For each food, a commonly used unit or portion size was specified and the interviewers asked the subjects using sampling models of full-scale photographs. We ascertained average amount of daily consumption of each food and nutrients by multiplying the food intake (in grams) or serving size and the nutrient content per 100 grams of food as listed in the Standard Tables of Food Composition, Version 5 and the Follow-up of Standard Tables of Food Composition. Isoflavone intakes were separately calculated from USDA-Iowa State University Database on the Isoflavone Content of Foods, Release 1.3–2002. Isoflavone intake was calculated using consumption of six items of soybean products, green soybean, peanuts, Japanese green tea, and vegetables other than green-yellow vegetables such as cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, bean sprouts, onion, Chinese cabbage.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^22f37f21]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Soy protein — lipid effects and FDA health claim requirements: Compared to a milk protein control, soy protein produced significant reductions in non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) of 6.9%, triglycerides (TG) of 13.7%, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) of 7.3%, with a near-significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction of 5.0% (P = 0.08). The existing FDA-approved health claim for soy and heart disease requires that each food with the health claim contain at least 6.25 g of soy protein, based on the need for 25 g of soy protein to show significant lowering of serum total cholesterol (total-C) and LDL-C; examples meeting 6.25 g include 4 oz. whole soybeans, 8 oz. soy milk, 3.5 oz. soy flour, 8 oz. textured soy protein, 4 oz. tofu, and 4 oz. tempeh. In summary, soy protein lowers LDL-C via intrinsic and extrinsic effects and, when incorporated in a cardioprotective diet as a substitute for foods high in saturated fat, has an LDL-C–lowering effect due to both decreasing saturated fat and increasing soy protein.

### A dietary intervention for vasomotor symptoms of menopause: a randomized, controlled trial [^f59db045]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms cause recurrent discomfort, disrupt sleep, and reduce quality of life. A role for nutritional factors in vasomotor symptoms was suggested by their low prevalence in areas (notably Japan, China, and rural Mexico) where traditional dietary staples included grains, legumes, vegetables, and other plant-derived foods. - As the Japanese diet Westernized between the 1980s and the early 2000s, reports of hot flashes increased from approximately 15% to more than 40% of menopausal women.

A dietary intervention increasing whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and reducing dietary fat proved modestly effective in a randomized trial including 17,473 Women's Health Initiative participants. The odds of becoming free of hot flashes at 1 year were increased by 14% (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.28) for those adhering to the intervention regardless of any weight change and by 23% (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.46) among those who lost ≥ 10% of body weight. In addition, soy isoflavones, particularly daidzein and genistein, have proven modestly effective in controlled trials. - They have estrogen-agonist and estrogen-antagonist actions, with selective affinity for estrogen receptor-β.

The possibility that a low-fat, plant-based diet with daily soybeans might be more potent against vasomotor symptoms comes from the fact that such diets are typically high in fiber and low in fat, favor weight loss, and seem to foster the growth of gut bacteria capable of converting daidzein to equol. The ability to produce equol is detected more frequently in individuals following vegetarian diets than in omnivores and seems to have been more prevalent in Japan before Westernization of the diet. It has been proposed as a factor in soy's apparent health benefits.

In an initial cohort of a controlled trial of a plant-based diet including soybeans, moderate-to-severe postmenopausal hot flashes fell by 84% in 12 weeks. For 59% of participants, moderate-to-severe hot flashes ended altogether. There were also improvements in body weight and in psychosocial, physical, and sexual domains.

The autumn timing of the study, however, raised the question as to whether this symptomatic improvement might have been attributable to cooler temperatures. Also, the study did not assess equol production. These questions were addressed in a replication. The results of the full study, including both cohorts, are reported here.

### Epidemiology of soy exposures and breast cancer risk [^42bc7336]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall data based on Asian women, mainly derived from case–control studies, show a dose-dependent, statistically significant association between soy food intake and breast cancer risk reduction. There was an approximately 16% risk reduction per 10 mg of isoflavones intake per day. Age at exposure may be a co-determinant of risk; adolescent intake shows a stronger effect on risk than intake during adulthood. Soy intake was unrelated to breast cancer risk in studies conducted in Western populations in which the average intake of soy isoflavones was low (< 1 mg day −1) and exposure is mainly in the form of soy components added as fillers/extenders to typical Western foods. There is little evidence of a modifying effect by menopausal status or body weight on the soy–breast cancer association. It is inconclusive whether habitual soy intake or short-term soy supplementation influences circulating hormone levels or mammographic density. If the beneficial effect of Asian soy foods on breast cancer risk noted above is real, their mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated.

### A vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern protects against breast cancer among postmenopausal Singapore Chinese women [^d28ed762]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Prospective epidemiologic studies in Asian populations consistently show that soy is protective against breast cancer.

Objective

The objective was to prospectively evaluate whether the protective effect of soy is due to soy isoflavones alone or to their combination with other beneficial dietary factors in an Asian population.

Design

Using principal components analysis, we previously identified a "meat-dim sum" pattern characterized by meat, starch, and dim sum items and a "vegetable-fruit-soy" pattern characterized by cruciferous vegetables, fruit, and tofu items in a population-based cohort of Singapore Chinese initiated between 1993 and 1998. Component scores representing intakes of each pattern were used in multivariable Cox regression models to analyze the relation between diet at baseline and breast cancer incidence.

Results

As of 31 December 2005, 629 incident breast cancer cases had been diagnosed among the 34,028 women. With greater intake of the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern, we observed a dose-dependent trend (P < 0.01) for decreasing breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women [hazard ratio (HR): 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.95 for the fourth compared with first quartile]. A stronger association for the vegetable-fruit-soy pattern was observed among postmenopausal women with ≥ 5 y of follow-up (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.88; P for trend < 0.01). No trend was observed for a greater intake of the meat-dim sum dietary pattern and increased breast cancer risk.

Conclusion

Our findings support the hypothesis that a diet characterized by vegetables, fruit, and soy has an early-acting protective effect on breast carcinogenesis.

### Addressing the soy and breast cancer relationship: review, commentary, and workshop proceedings [^16f1f99d]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2006). Low credibility.

The impact of soyfood intake on breast cancer risk has been investigated extensively. Much of this focus can be attributed to the soybean being a dietary source that is uniquely rich in isoflavones. The chemical structure of isoflavones is similar to that of estrogen, and isoflavones bind to both estrogen receptors (ER alpha and ER beta) (although they preferentially bind to and activate ER beta) and exert estrogen-like effects under some experimental conditions. Isoflavones also possess nonhormonal properties that are associated with the inhibition of cancer cell growth. Thus, there are several possible mechanisms by which soy may reduce the risk of breast cancer. However, the role of isoflavones in breast cancer has become controversial because, in contrast to the possible beneficial effects, some data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that isoflavones, especially genistein, the aglycone of the main soybean isoflavone genistin, may stimulate the growth of estrogen-sensitive tumors. Limited human data directly address the tumor-promoting effects of isoflavones and soy. Because the use of soyfoods and isoflavone supplements is increasing, it is important from a public health perspective to understand the impact of these products on breast cancer risk in women at high risk of the disease and on the survival of breast cancer patients. To this end, a workshop was held in November 2005 to review the existing literature and to make research recommendations. This paper summarizes the workshop findings and recommendations. The primary research recommendation is that the impact of isoflavones on breast tissue needs to be evaluated at the cellular level in women at high risk for breast cancer.

### Soy consumption and risk of COPD and respiratory symptoms: a case-control study in Japan [^49fad24a]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Table 3
Frequency of soy foods intake by participants

* missing data present

The relationship with lung function was next examined [see Figure S1, Additional file 1] presents the scatter plot of FEV 1% predicted against total soy intake. All observed lung function measures (FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC and FEV 1% predicted) were positively correlated with total soy consumption. Linear regression results in [Table S1, Additional file 1] further confirmed the significant positive association between lung function and soy intake even after adjusting for the effects of confounding factors.

Table 4 summarizes the results from logistic regression analyses with respect to soy foods consumption. A significant reduction in COPD risk was evident for the highest versus lowest quartile of daily total intake of soybean products, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.392, 95% CI 0.194–0.793. The corresponding test for trend was highly significant (p = 0.001). Similar decreases in COPD risk were associated with higher intakes of tofu and bean sprouts, but to a lesser extent for natto. As expected, the effect of soy milk did not attain statistical significance because of the small number of drinkers. To assess the sensitivity of the analysis, logistic regressions were rerun for the subset of 157 patients with COPD diagnosed within one year. The additional results [Table S2, see Additional file 1], were generally consistent with those of all 278 prevalent cases. Moreover, very few interaction terms were found to be significant, so that effect modifications in these models should be minimal. Finally, goodness-of-fit of the models in Table 4 was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, with corresponding p values 0.064, 0.168, 0.299, 0.813 and 0.052. The area under the ROC curve ranged between 0.881 and 0.887, further indicating adequacy of these fitted models.

### Soy intake and breast cancer: elucidation of an unanswered question [^f97271fe]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

One of the most important contributions of the meta-analysis undertaken by Wu et al is the separation of the epidemiologic studies conducted among Asian populations from those conducted among Western populations. This simple stratified approach elegantly demonstrates that a higher intake of isoflavones — about 20 mg per day or more as compared with a lower intake of about 5 mg per day — among Asian populations is associated with a consistent 29% reduction in the risk of developing breast cancer. Importantly, an inverse dose–response relation was evident; modest intake of about 10 mg per day of isoflavones was associated with a modest 12% decrease in breast cancer risk. Further, the risk reductions among Asian women were observed for both pre-and postmenopausal breast cancer. Moreover, the effect appeared to be stronger among those consuming soy during adolescence than among those who had only consumed soy as an adult, although research on early-life consumption patterns is sparse. In contrast, isoflavone intake of about 0.8 mg per day, which Wu et al reported as the higher level of consumption among Western populations (but which is obviously far below even the lower levels of intake for Asian populations), was not associated with breast cancer risk. In all, these exciting findings by Wu et al underscore the importance of considering exposure dose and timing when evaluating the effects of soy intake on breast cancer risk.

Other concerns have also contributed to the difficulty in interpreting the numerous population studies on the soy–breast cancer association, and again the thoughtful methodologic approach of Wu et al sheds light on these issues. For example, many of the investigations conducted to date have used the case–control study design, which may yield biased effect estimates due to possible differential recall of exposure based on the subjects' case–control status. However, as shown by Wu et al, results among Asian populations from both cohort and case–control studies yielded nearly identical summary effect estimates. Further, if recall bias was the underlying reason for the inverse association noted in the meta-analysis presented by Wu et al, then the risk reduction associated with isoflavone intake should have been evident among case–control studies conducted among Asian and Western populations, which was not the case. Thus, recall bias does not appear to be the reason for the observed risk reductions associated with soy intake among Asian populations.

### Epidemiology of soy exposures and breast cancer risk [^f46587f9]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

We identified a total of 28 epidemiologic studies in English language with sufficiently detailed information on soy and breast cancer risk. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis by. Of the remaining 14 studies, 6 were conducted in Asia while the rest were conducted in various Western populations. Given that Asians differ from Western populations in terms of types and amounts of soy consumed, and possess distinct characteristics linked to breast cancer risk, we conducted separate meta-analysis on epidemiologic data derived from Asians and Western populations, respectively.

### Phytoestrogens: a review of recent findings [^dde7dbf9]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Phytoestrogens have been investigated at the epidemiological, clinical and molecular levels to determine their potential health benefits. The two major groups of phytoestrogens, isoflavones and lignans, are abundant in soy products and flax respectively, but are also present in a variety of other foods. It is thought that these estrogen-like compounds may protect against chronic diseases, such as hormone-dependent cancers, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Furthermore, phytoestrogens are used as a natural alternative to hormone replacement therapy and to reduce menopausal symptoms. Phytoestrogens have been shown to induce both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects but their biological relevance and potency have not been well characterized. In children, consumption of soy-based formulas and soy milk can lead to high levels of exposure to phytoestrogens with only limited data available concerning potential benefits or adverse effects. Phytoestrogens are considered good candidates for use in natural therapies and as chemopreventive agents in adults. Safe and efficacious levels have yet to be established.

### Soy foods, isoflavones, and the health of postmenopausal women [^d10d336f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, soy foods have been the subject of a vast amount of research, primarily because they are uniquely rich sources of isoflavones. Isoflavones are classified as both phytoestrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators. The phytoestrogenic effects of isoflavones have led some to view soy foods and isoflavone supplements as alternatives to conventional hormone therapy. However, clinical research shows that isoflavones and estrogen exert differing effects on a variety of health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that soy foods have the potential to address several conditions and diseases associated with the menopausal transition. For example, data suggest that soy foods can potentially reduce ischemic heart disease through multiple mechanisms. Soy protein directly lowers blood low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations, and the soybean is low in saturated fat and a source of both essential fatty acids, the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid and the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid. In addition, soflavones improve endothelial function and possibly slow the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Isoflavone supplements also consistently alleviate menopausal hot flashes provided they contain sufficient amounts of the predominant soybean isoflavone genistein. In contrast, the evidence that isoflavones reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women is unimpressive. Whether adult soy food intake reduces breast cancer risk is unclear. Considerable evidence suggests that for soy to reduce risk, consumption during childhood and/or adolescence is required. Although concerns have been raised that soy food consumption may be harmful to breast cancer patients, an analysis in 9514 breast cancer survivors who were followed for 7.4 y found that higher postdiagnosis soy intake was associated with a significant 25% reduction in tumor recurrence. In summary, the clinical and epidemiologic data indicate that adding soy foods to the diet can contribute to the health of postmenopausal women.

### A prospective cohort study of soy product intake and stomach cancer death [^db48bcd5]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We observed a significantly reduced rate of death from stomach cancer in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of total soy product intake in men. In particular, a strong inverse association was observed for non-fermented soy products in terms of both the amount (g) and isoflavone intake (mg). A small number of deaths from stomach cancer in women resulted in a lack of statistical power to detect a significant association between soy intake and death from stomach cancer, but the magnitude of HR estimates for the intake of total soy products were similar to that observed for men. These data support the hypothesis that a high intake of soy is associated with decreased risk of stomach cancer.

To our knowledge, this is the first analytic epidemiologic study on stomach cancer to estimate soy and isoflavone intake using a validated questionnaire with a broad range of categories for soy products. Among previous prospective studies on diet and stomach cancer, six included one or two soy food items. In a Japanese study, reported a significantly reduced risk of stomach cancer death associated with the daily intake of miso-soup (relative risk (RR) = 0.74) compared to those who answered 'never/rare'. No significant association between drinking miso soup and the risk of stomach cancer was reported in other four studies. Another soy product, tofu, was included in two studies. In a study of Japanese-American men reported by, the RR of stomach cancer was 0.7 (95% CI 0.2–2.3) for those who ate tofu five times per week or more compared to those who ate it one time or less each week. Another study conducted in Korea showed a RR of 0.6 (95% CI 0.40–1.10) for the highest quartile of tofu intake. Most of previous case–control studies included at most only two soy products (miso/soy bean paste or tofu/bean curd).

Soy Food Intake and Breast Cancer Survival

What was known?.

Soy foods are rich in isoflavones, which have both estrogen and anti-estrogen effects. Controversy exists regarding the effects of soy consumption on breast cancer risk.

What this study adds.

This large, prospective cohort study, involving 5,042 breast cancer survivors in Shanghai, assessed the association between soy food intake and total mortality, breast cancer mortality, and breast cancer recurrence. Soy food and isoflavone intake were measured 18 months, 36 months, and 60 months after breast cancer diagnosis and were grouped by quartiles. When comparing the lowest intake quartile to the highest, increasing soy protein intake was associated with a decreased risk for total mortality (adjusted HR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.54–0.94) and breast cancer recurrence and mortality (adjusted HR = 0.68, 95%CI 0.54–0.87). Similar effects were noted in women with ER-positive breast cancer, although all confidence intervals crossed 1.0. In addition, tamoxifen use seemed to improve survival only among women with low-moderate soy food intake, although this result was not statistically significant.

How should I change my practice?.

There is no need to counsel breast cancer patients to avoid soy-containing foods and beverages. The average amount of soy protein consumed by participants in this study was 47 mg/day, which far exceeds the average 1–6 mg/day consumed by American women. The study resulted in new cancer screening guidelines (Table 1).

### Associations of estrogen with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for dementia: a narrative review [^1ab291c8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The phytoestrogen isoflavone seems to impact the menstrual cycle and hormone levels of premenopausal women, with one study finding an extension in premenopausal women's follicular phase after consuming soybeans with 45 mg of isoflavones. Consumption of soybean isoflavones can also be shown to decrease the blood follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in premenopausal women. The review does note that effects of soy‐protein consumption on hormone consumption is conflicting due to variances in methodology (isoflavone type and dosage, length of the diet, etc.). A recent review highlights sex differences in the hormonal effects of dietary phytoestrogens. In postmenopausal women, studies have shown positive outcomes, including lower LDL cholesterol and better insulin sensitivity, thought to arise from the estrogen‐like effects of one type of phytoestrogen (isoflavones). These plant compounds may help partially replace the role of natural estrogen, leading to improvements in metabolic and cardiovascular health. The review also notes that evidence on phytoestrogens from other reproductive stages (i.e. pregnancy and childbirth) is limited and inconsistent. There is also inconsistent evidence highlighted in a review of phytoestrogen effects on postmenopausal health concerns, including vasomotor symptoms, cancer, cognition, cardiovascular disease, and bone health.

Consistent and high‐quality evidence for the impact of diet and estrogen across the life course is lacking. There is a significant need to understand more about these associations.

### Perspectives on the soy-breast cancer relation [^56df8840]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

There has been considerable investigation of the potential for soy foods to reduce risk of breast cancer. Initial enthusiasm for this research was partially based on the historically low incidence rates of breast cancer and high soy food intake in Japan. There are several putative soybean chemopreventive agents, but most cancer research has focused on isoflavones. Isoflavones possess both hormonal and nonhormonal properties relevant to carcinogenesis. Recent epidemiologic analyses indicate that among Asians high soy intake is associated with an approximate one-third reduction in the risk of both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer. However, several lines of evidence suggest that to derive maximum protection against breast cancer, soy must be consumed early in life. This evidence is consistent with the lack of significant effects noted in clinical studies that have evaluated the effects of isoflavone-containing products on breast cancer risk markers. Isoflavones may exert their putative protective effects by stimulating breast cell differentiation in a manner similar to that which is thought to occur during early pregnancy. Finally, the ability of the isoflavone genistein to stimulate the growth of mammary tumors in ovariectomized athymic nude mice implanted with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells has raised concern that soy foods, and especially isoflavone supplements, are contraindicated for patients with breast cancer and women at high risk of breast cancer. However, findings from clinical studies, in which breast biopsies have been taken or breast tissue density measured after isoflavone exposure, are reassuring and contrast with the proliferative effects of conventional combined hormone therapy, although understanding of the effect of soy and isoflavones on breast tissues remains imprecise.

Table 16 — phytoestrogens describe plant-derived compounds with potential estrogenic activity that may support minor weight reduction when replacing higher-calorie foods, with hormonal cautionary notes and gastrointestinal side effects. Mechanistically they are "Plant-derived substances with potential estrogenic effects (isoflavones, flavones, and coumestans) found in soy products". Effects include "If soy-based foods are substituted for higher fat, higher calorie foods, this may promote minor weight reduction. Animal studies suggest some phytoestrogens are associated with decreased lipogenesis", and noted adverse effects include "Mild nausea, bloating, constipation". Hormonal cautions specify that "In women, phytoestrogens may disrupt endogenous hormone levels and ovulation cycle. In men, typical doses are unlikely to cause feminization. Should be used with caution in women who are pregnant, nursing, or attempting to become pregnant".

### Diet, vegetarian food and prostate carcinoma among men in Taiwan [^950deefa]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The protective effect of the vegetarian meals against the development of prostate carcinoma in this study is consistent with findings in some other studies on the consumption of selected vegetables. Those studies suggest that increased consumption of green leafy vegetables, soybean products, lentils and peas, and tomatoes are associated with decreased prostate carcinoma risk. These foods are also components served in the Taiwanese folk vegetarian meals. A prospective study of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii suggested that consumption of rice and tofu decreased the risk of prostate carcinoma. This type of Japanese-American meal is also light, somewhat similar to the Taiwanese folk vegetarian meals.has indicated that lignins and the isoflavonoids in soybeans, whole-grain products, various seeds and other similar food components may have an influence on sex hormone metabolism and biological activity. These food items also have an influence on intracellular enzymes, protein synthesis, growth factor action, malignant cell proliferation and angiogenesis, making them protective against carcinoma. It has also been found that vegetarians with high dietary fibre intake excrete large amounts of sex steroids in the faeces, thereby lowering the levels of sex hormones in the plasma. One of the sex steroids, testosterone, is essential for the normal growth of prostate epithelium, and early stage prostate carcinoma has been shown to be endocrine dependent.

Some limitations to the present study should be considered. First, recall bias is a drawback in case–control studies. The use of hospital-based controls could decrease differences in health consciousness between cases and controls although using hospital-based controls may also minimise the effect of risk factors. Second, the use of semiquantitative food frequency to quantify diet may not reveal the precise effect of risk factors such as meat and fat consumption. However, its use is very convenient for the elderly with little or no education who must recall the contents of their diet. On the other hand, the folk vegetarian food termed as 'Zhai' or 'Sue' food in Taiwan is easily recalled and counted by lay people regardless of educational levels. Third, due to the use of a binary analysis regarding all risk factors, we might have missed potentially important information such as a dose response. The use of semiquantified data restricts our ability to stratify data into multiple levels. It is also likely that subjects may have under-reported their exposure status, but such bias would likely be similar in both cases and controls.

### Effect of dietary soy intake on breast cancer risk according to menopause and hormone receptor status [^83254c98]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although high soy consumption may be associated with lower breast cancer risk in Asian populations, findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent.

Objective

We investigated the effects of soy intake on breast cancer risk among Korean women according to their menopausal and hormone receptor status.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study with 358 incident breast cancer patients and 360 age-matched controls with no history of malignant neoplasm. Dietary consumption of soy products was examined using a 103-item food frequency questionnaire.

Results

The estimated mean intakes of total soy and isoflavones from this study population were 76.5 g per day and 15.0 mg per day, respectively. Using a multivariate logistic regression model, we found a significant inverse association between soy intake and breast cancer risk, with a dose-response relationship (odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for the highest vs the lowest intake quartile: 0.36 (0.20–0.64)). When the data were stratified by menopausal status, the protective effect was observed only among postmenopausal women (OR (95% CI) for the highest vs the lowest intake quartile: 0.08 (0.03–0.22)). The association between soy and breast cancer risk did not differ according to estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) status, but the estimated intake of soy isoflavones showed an inverse association only among postmenopausal women with ER+/PR+ tumors.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that high consumption of soy might be related to lower risk of breast cancer and that the effect of soy intake could vary depending on several factors.

### Use of soy ineffective for menopausal symptoms… [^3265d59e]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Although hormone therapy still is approved for relief of moderate to severe menopausal vasomotor symptoms in eligible women, its association with breast cancer, stroke, and heart disease in recent studies has led to greater interest in nonhormonal treatments. More than 60 percent of women 45 to 65 years of age are reported to believe that "natural" therapies are superior to hormone medications, and at least 22 percent of menopausal women, one study found, have used "alternative" therapies for symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. The authors identified 40 clinical trials from MEDLINE searches, bibliographies of trials and reviews, and searches of relevant journals and conference abstracts. These trials were then reviewed for quality in design and conduct, specifically reporting of inclusion criteria, type and dose of phytoestrogen used, outcome measures, adverse effects, reasons for discontinuation or loss to follow-up, and trial sponsorship.

Ten studies with a combined total of 995 participants and one abstract with 99 participants investigated soy products. The daily isoflavone intake was between 34 and 134 mg per day. Seven of the eight trials that documented frequency of hot flashes showed no improvement in the study group compared with the control group. Only two studies reported any favorable results, and these were in subscales of subjective symptom questionnaires. The seven trials and two abstracts involving soy extracts all used different products and had mixed results, even when the same outcomes, such as the Kupperman index, were assessed. Five trials with a total of 400 participants studied the effects of red clover on menopausal symptoms. The frequency of hot flashes was reduced among women taking red clover in two of these trials, but no overall improvement in symptoms was documented. Two studies of flaxseed did not report statistical comparisons between the groups.

Information about adverse effects was reported in 12 trials. In two of the trials involving soy products, adverse gastrointestinal effects were reported by women taking soy products; and in one of these trials, one fourth of patients taking soy discontinued the study because of the taste of the product. Estrogenic side effects such as breast tenderness and vaginal bleeding were rare with soy products or extracts. The authors conclude that phytoestrogen products are no more effective than placebo in relieving menopausal symptoms, regardless of the type or dose of phytoestrogen used.

### Soybean products and reduction of breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Japan [^6cc1aad6]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Among premenopausal women, breast cancer risk was inversely associated with consumption of soybean products (Table 3). The ORs was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.27–1.04) for the top tertile of soybean product intake compared with the lowest tertile of intake (trend test, P = 0.06). Among postmenopausal women, on the other hand, consumptions of soybean products, meat and meat products, fish and fish products, vegetables, fruits, dairy products were not associated with the risk of breast cancer.

The ORs for breast cancer according to type of soybean product are presented in Table 4. A statistically significant inverse relation was observed between tofu consumption and breast cancer in premenopausal women. ORs were 0.44 (95% CI, 0.22–0.90), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25–0.95) for the second to the top tertiles of intake compared with the lowest tertile of intake of tofu (trend test, P = 0.03). Compared with those in the lowest tertile of atsuage (deep fried tofu) consumption, the adjusted OR for breast cancer in top tertile was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.35–1.38) among premenopausal women. On the other hand, a significantly increased risk of breast cancer with consumption of atsuage was observed in postmenopausal women. The adjusted OR for top tertile of atsuage consumption was 2.28 (95% CI, 1.15–4.51, trend test P = 0.02). Also, consumption of aburage (thinly sliced deep fried tofu) showed a similar positive association with the risk of breast cancer. There were no associations with intake of tofu, miso and natto intake among postmenopausal women. With intake of koyadofu (freeze dried tofu) divided into tertiles, there was no apparent modification of the breast cancer risk among either pre- or postmenopausal women.

We next determined the association between total intake of isoflavone and risk of breast cancer and found a statistically significant inverse association among premenopausal women. Compared with women in the lowest tertile of isoflavone consumption, the top tertile had an adjusted OR of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.22–0.89; trend test P = 0.02). Among postmenopausal women the similar trend was also observed; however, there was no statistically significant association between consumption of isoflavone and breast cancer risk (Table 5).

### Soy germ extract alleviates menopausal hot flushes: placebo-controlled double-blind trial [^422a4d7d]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The health-related effects of soy preparations are mostly attributed to the fraction of isoflavones, with genistein, daidzein and, as a relatively minor compound, glycitein as the most prominent representatives. Isoflavones have been considered safe by the European Food Safety Authority with respect to effects at hormone-sensitive tissues such as breast or uterus with daily doses up to at least 150 mg. This conclusion on safety is backed by epidemiological observations of an association of reduced breast cancer risk with increasing dietary intake of isoflavones.

One of the earliest health-related observations associated with isoflavone exposure is the inverse relation between soy exposure in Asian societies and the incidence of menopausal hot flushes. There is still some debate with respect to the effect size and its applicability to Western women with no life-long exposure to soy, and to the effect size in clinical trials. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) concluded that soy-derived isoflavones are modestly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms. The NAMS did, however, also point to a poor inter-study comparability, especially with respect to natural food and supplements containing isoflavones. Pharmacokinetic aspects may play a crucial role, as do the sample size in the studies and the number of daily hot flushes. The review by NAMS calculated a decrease of daily hot flushes frequency by 24–60% with isoflavone doses of 40–160 mg per day. The US Food and Drug Organisation recommends a minimum of seven hot flushes daily for the performance of studies of menopausal vasomotor complaints. It has been maintained that the beneficial effect of isoflavone supplementation on menopausal vasomotor complaints was consistently demonstrated in all clinical trials with an adequate design. The effect could be verified in meta-analyses and reviews. A relatively recent meta-analysis of 10 studies reporting hot flush frequencies indicated that isoflavone exposure results in a significantly greater reduction in hot flush frequency compared with placebo (pooled mean difference 0.89, p < 0.005). Soy isoflavones have been proposed as a first approach in the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms, especially in women who cannot or do not want to be treated by hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

### Isoflavone supplements stimulated the production of serum equol and decreased the serum dihydrotestosterone levels in healthy male volunteers [^8833c297]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidences of malignancies, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer, are commonly high in the Western Europe and United States of America, but low in the Asian populations who consume large amounts of soy bean foods. Soy bean products are rich in isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein. Isoflavones have been suggested as the principal chemical constituents responsible for the potential preventive effect of soy bean against prostate cancer. Possible mechanisms have been proposed for the anti-tumor activity of soy isoflavones against prostate cancer, including estrogen-like effects, prevention of oxidative DNA damage, reduction in cancer cell proliferationand inhibition of angiogenesis.

It has been argued for long whether the lower incidences of prostate cancer among the Asian people are because of the inhibitory effects of isoflavones (contained abundantly in soy beans) and equol (directly metabolized from daidzein by the intestinal bacterial microflora) against prostatic carcinogenesis. Equol has a weak phytoestrogen activity. Especially, equol and isoflavones have a binding affinity to estrogen receptor β. In addition, equol can bind to the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and inhibit the growth of prostate cells in vitro. Therefore, equol can act as an anti-androgen and inhibit the development of sex hormone-dependent tumors, such as mammary gland cancer and prostate cancer. Earlier, we reported that some people can metabolize daidzein into equol, whereas others cannot, and showed that the intake quantity of isoflavones and the proportions of equol producers differed significantly among the races and age stratifications.

In this intervention study, to elucidate the biological impact of isoflavones on equol-producing ability and sex hormonal variation in association with prostate carcinogenesis, we investigated whether the constant daily consumption of isoflavone supplements influenced the serum levels of isoflavones, equol and sex hormonal biomarkers in healthy Japanese men.

### Use of soy protein supplement and resultant need for increased dose of levothyroxine [^59420cc9]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of difficulty in achieving suppressive serum levels of thyroid hormone because of malabsorption of exogenous levothyroxine attributable to daily ingestion in close temporal relationship to the intake of a soy protein-containing food supplement.

Methods

We present the relevant history and laboratory data of the current case and provide supportive documentation from the literature.

Results

A 45-year-old woman who had hypothyroidism after a near-total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablative therapy for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid required unusually high oral doses of levothyroxine to achieve suppressive serum levels of free thyroxine (T(4)) and thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH). She had routinely been taking a "soy cocktail" protein supplement immediately after her levothyroxine. Temporal separation of the intake of the soy protein cocktail from the administration of the levothyroxine resulted in attainment of suppressive serum levels of free T(4) and TSH with use of lower doses of levothyroxine.

Conclusion

Administration of levothyroxine concurrently with a soy protein dietary supplement results in decreased absorption of levothyroxine and the need for higher oral doses of levothyroxine to attain therapeutic serum thyroid hormone levels.

### The endocrine and reproductive system: adverse effects of hormonally active substances? [^2eb3dd52]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Chemicals that have the intrinsic property to modulate or even disrupt the endocrine system are present in the human environment. Because it is the potency of such chemicals that determines the toxicologic relevance, assessment of the risk to human health must consider both the endocrine disrupting potential and the potency. Usually in vitro assays are applied to detect the potential of a hormone-like effect, and such data are considered useful to set priorities for additional testing and for mechanistic studies. However, such data allow only determination of relative potency of a chemical as compared with other xenobiotics, natural compounds, or endogenous hormones. Relevant information on the endocrine-disrupting potency can be taken only from in vivo assays, eg, the Hershberger (male reproductive organs) and uterotrophic (female reproductive organs) assays, the updated versions of the 28- and 90-day toxicity studies in rodents, and the 2-generation studies in rodents. With the use of this information and the concentration of these chemicals in humans, the potency of the effect as compared with endogenous hormone activity can be estimated. So far, the relative potencies of chemicals tested in in vitro systems as compared with estradiol are several orders of magnitude smaller, whereas potency of the phytoestrogen, eg, isoflavones such as genistein or daidzein, can even exceed that of estradiol, especially in infants who are fed soy-based formula as a sole source of nutrition. Although there are still open questions regarding in utero or early postnatal exposure, the low potencies and concentrations of manmade chemicals as compared with the endogenous hormones in humans make it unlikely that adverse effects occur at common exposure.

### Soyfood and isoflavone intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in Vietnamese adults [^73300c44]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Animal studies have demonstrated that soy isoflavones exert antidiabetic effects. However, evidence regarding the association between soyfood intake, a unique source of isoflavones, and type 2 diabetes remains inconclusive. This study assessed the relationship between habitual intakes of soyfoods and major isoflavones and risk of type 2 diabetes in Vietnamese adults.

Subjects/Methods

A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Vietnam during 2013–2015. A total of 599 newly diagnosed diabetic cases (age 40–65 years) and 599 hospital-based controls, frequency matched by age and sex, were recruited in Hanoi, capital city of Vietnam. Information on frequency and quantity of soyfood and isoflavone intake, together with demographics, habitual diet and lifestyle characteristics, was obtained from direct interviews using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between soy variables and type 2 diabetes risk.

Results

Higher intake of total soyfoods was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes; the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the highest versus the lowest intake was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21–0.46; P < 0.001). An inverse dose-response relationship of similar magnitude was also observed for total isoflavone intake (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.49; P < 0.001). In addition, inverse associations of specific soyfoods (soy milk, tofu and mung bean sprout) and major isoflavones (daidzein, genistein and glycitein) with the type 2 diabetes risk were evident.

Conclusions

Soyfood and isoflavone intake was associated with a lower type 2 diabetes risk in Vietnamese adults.

### Epidemiology of soy exposures and breast cancer risk [^7d4ec7f5]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

SOY AND BREAST CANCER SURVIVAL

Few studies have investigated the effects of soy intake in women with breast cancer. Among Chinese women in Shanghai, usual soy food intake before breast cancer diagnosis was unrelated to disease-free breast cancer survival after a median follow-up of 5.2 years, but information on tamoxifen use was not included. To address the concern that soy may negate the effect of tamoxifen, we investigated and found no relationship between serum levels of tamoxifen or its metabolites and self-reported intake of soy or serum levels of isoflavones among a population-based sample of Asian-American women with breast cancer. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of soy (before and after breast cancer diagnosis), in relation to tamoxifen use and breast cancer outcome.

### Soy, isoflavones, and prevalence of allergic rhinitis in Japanese women: the osaka maternal and child health study [^e9e2a441]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

It has been hypothesized that isoflavones reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, but there are no data on the effects of dietary soy and isoflavone consumption on allergic disorders.

Objective

This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between dietary soy products and isoflavone intake and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis.

Methods

Study subjects were 1002 Japanese pregnant women. Allergic rhinitis (including cedar pollinosis) was defined as present if subjects had received drug treatment at some point during the previous 12 months. Adjustment was made for age; gestation; parity; cigarette smoking; passive smoking at home and at work; indoor domestic pets; family history of asthma, atopic eczema, and allergic rhinitis; family income; education; mite allergen level in house dust; changes in diet in the previous month; season when data were collected; and body mass index.

Results

Compared with dietary intake of total soy product, soy protein, daidzein, and genistein in the first quartile, consumption of these substances in the fourth quartile was independently associated with a reduced prevalence of allergic rhinitis, although no significant dose-response relationships were observed. A clear inverse linear trend for miso intake across quartiles was found, whereas the adjusted odds ratio for comparison of the highest with the lowest quartile was not statistically significant. Consumption of tofu, tofu products, fermented soybeans, boiled soybeans, and miso soup was not related to the prevalence of allergic rhinitis.

Conclusion

A high intake of soy and isoflavones may be associated with a reduced prevalence of allergic rhinitis.

### Effects of an isoflavone-free soy diet on ovarian hormones in premenopausal women [^6c1026e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Soy intakes have been associated with reduced rates of breast cancer in some Asian populations. The isoflavones daidzein and genistein and other components of soybeans may modulate endocrine function and lead to beneficial health effects. This study determined the effects of a soy diet containing minimum amounts of isoflavones on circulating levels of ovarian hormones and gonadotropins. Nine healthy, regularly cycling women consumed a constant soya-containing diet on a metabolic unit starting on day 2 of a menstrual cycle until day 2 of the next cycle. The soy diet was calculated to maintain constant body weight and included a 36-oz portion of soymilk that provided 334 kilocalories and less than 5 mg/day of total isoflavones. The energy distribution of the soy diet was 35.9% fat, 14.0% protein, and 49.8% carbohydrate whereas the home diets averaged 39% fat, 16.6% protein, and 42.5% carbohydrate. For the group, the soya diet provided more carbohydrate (P = 0.002) and less protein (P = 0.005) than the home diets. Daily consumption of the soya diet reduced daily circulating levels of 17beta-estradiol over the entire menstrual cycle by 20% (P < 0.01, paired t test, two-tailed) and progesterone by 33% (P < 0.0001) compared with levels during the home diet period, but had no effect on LH, FSH, or sex hormone-binding globulin. The decreases in follicular phase 17beta-estradiol during the soy diet can be accounted for by changes in energy intakes, nutrient density, and fiber intake, whereas changes in luteal phase 17beta-estradiol were most strongly associated with differences in fiber intake. Changes in progesterone levels were most strongly associated with changes in protein intake and much less with other nutrients. Isoflavones were not detectable in plasma and urine during either the soy or home diet periods. These results suggest that at least under the conditions of this study, a soy diet with low levels of isoflavones and low energy intake from protein can reduce circulating ovarian steroids without altering gonadotropins. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing decreased ovarian hormone levels and decreased risk of breast cancer in populations consuming soya diets and an inverse relationship between animal protein intake and breast cancer risk and, therefore, may have implications for breast cancer prevention.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for menopause, more specifically with respect to alternative medicine, AACE 2011 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of phytoestrogens including soy-derived isoflavonoids. Do not offer soy-based therapies in patients with a personal or strong family history of hormone-dependent cancers (breast, uterine, or ovarian), thromboembolic events, or cardiovascular events because these compounds may have estrogenic effects.

### Phytoestrogens and breast cancer – promoters or protectors? [^fd3143a4]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

The majority of breast cancers are oestrogen dependent and in postmenopausal women the supply of oestrogens in breast tissue is derived from the peripheral conversion of circulating androgens. There is, however, a paradox concerning the epidemiology of breast cancer and the dietary intake of phytoestrogens that bind weakly to oestrogen receptors and initiate oestrogen-dependent transcription. In Eastern countries, such as Japan, the incidence of breast cancer is approximately one-third that of Western countries whilst their high dietary intake of phytoestrogens, mainly in the form of soy products, can produce circulating levels of phytoestrogens that are known experimentally to have oestrogenic effects. Indeed, their weak oestrogenicity has been used to advantage by herbalist medicine to promote soy products as a natural alternative to conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Such usage could increase in light of recent evidence that long-term HRT usage may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer with a consequent reduction in prescription rates. So, are phytoestrogens safe as a natural alternative to HRT and could they be promoters or protectors of breast cancer? If they are promoters, then we must assume that it is due to their oestrogenic effect. If they are protectors, then other actions of phytoestrogens, including their ability to inhibit enzymes that are responsible for converting androgens and weak oestrogens into oestradiol, must be considered. This paper addresses these questions by reviewing the actions of phytoestrogens on oestrogen receptors and key enzymes that convert androgens to oestrogens in relation to the growth of breast cancer cells. In addition, it compares the experimental and epidemiological evidence pertinent to the potential beneficial or harmful effects of phytoestrogens in relation to the incidence/progression of breast cancer and their efficacy as natural alternatives to conventional HRT.

### Epidemiology of soy exposures and breast cancer risk [^0a8e5544]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Most of the early studies published on soy and breast cancer were not designed to test the effect of soy; the assessment of soy intake was usually crude and few potential confounders were considered in the analysis. In this review, we focused on studies with relatively complete assessment of dietary soy exposure in the targeted populations and appropriate consideration for potential confounders in the statistical analysis of study data. Meta-analysis of the 8 (1 cohort, 7 case–control) studies conducted in high-soy-consuming Asians show a significant trend of decreasing risk with increasing soy food intake. Compared to the lowest level of soy food intake (≤ 5 mg isoflavones per day), risk was intermediate (OR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.78–0.98) among those with modest (∼10 mg isoflavones per day) intake and lowest (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.60–0.85) among those with high intake (⩾20 mg isoflavones per day). In contrast, soy intake was unrelated to breast cancer risk in studies conducted in the 11 low-soy-consuming Western populations whose average highest and lowest soy isoflavone intake levels were around 0.8 and 0.15 mg per day, respectively. Thus, the evidence to date, based largely on case–control studies, suggest that soy food intake in the amount consumed in Asian populations may have protective effects against breast cancer.

### Interference or noninterference between soy and levothyroxine: that is the question. A narrative review of literature [^22e5c762]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of soy intake on levothyroxine (L-T4) absorption among different L-T4 formulations.

Methods

A PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus research was performed. Case reports, case series, and original studies written in English and published online up to November 30, 2022, were selected and reviewed. The final reference list was defined based on the relevance of each study to the scope of this review.

Results

Few data, mainly case reports, seemed to suggest a possible interference of soy products on L-T4 tablets absorption. However, the only prospective randomized cross-over study showed no differences in L-T4 absorption when L-T4 and soy isoflavones were assumed concomitantly. The very little data available on liquid L-T4 formulations did not allow for any conclusions to be made, even if a double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed no impaired L-T4 absorption.

Conclusion

The inference of soy products on L-T4 absorption, if present, seems to have little clinical impact. Considering this fact, the Hamlet-like question whether soy milk interferes with L-T4 absorption remains unanswered.

### Serum prostate-specific antigen but not testosterone levels decrease in a randomized soy intervention among men [^2973448a]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Low prostate cancer incidence and high soy intake in Asian countries suggest a possible protective effect of soy foods against prostate cancer. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized, crossover soy trial among men and to investigate the effects of daily soy intake on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone levels.

Methods

We randomized 24 men to a high or a low soy diet for 3 months. After a 1-month washout period, the men crossed over to the other treatment. During the high soy diet, the men consumed two daily soy servings; during the low soy diet, they maintained their usual diet. During the entire study each man donated four blood samples and five overnight urine samples. Dietary compliance was assessed by soy calendars, 24-h dietary recalls, and urinary isoflavone excretion measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Blood samples were analyzed for serum testosterone and PSA by radioimmunoassay. When necessary, variables were log transformed. Two sample t-tests compared the two groups before each study period. Mixed models incorporating the repeated measurements were used to evaluate the effect of the soy diet on urinary isoflavone excretion and serum analytes.

Results

Twenty-three men aged 58.7 ± 7.2 years completed the study. The compliance with the study regimen was high according to self-reported soy food intake and urinary isoflavone excretion. No significant between-group and within-group differences were detected. During the high soy diet, dietary isoflavone intake and urinary isoflavone excretion increased significantly as compared to the low soy diet. A 14% decline in serum PSA levels (P = 0.10), but no change in testosterone (P = 0.70), was observed during the high soy diet in contrast to the low soy diet.

Conclusion

The high adherence as shown by three measures of compliance in this pilot trial demonstrated the feasibility of an intervention based on soy foods among free-living men.

### Soybean isoflavone exposure does not have feminizing effects on men: a critical examination of the clinical evidence [^95352267]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically evaluate the clinical evidence, and when not available, the animal data, most relevant to concerns that isoflavone exposure in the form of supplements or soy foods has feminizing effects on men.

Design

Medline literature review and cross-reference of published data.

Result(S)

In contrast to the results of some rodent studies, findings from a recently published metaanalysis and subsequently published studies show that neither isoflavone supplements nor isoflavone-rich soy affect total or free testosterone (T) levels. Similarly, there is essentially no evidence from the nine identified clinical studies that isoflavone exposure affects circulating estrogen levels in men. Clinical evidence also indicates that isoflavones have no effect on sperm or semen parameters, although only three intervention studies were identified and none were longer than 3 months in duration. Finally, findings from animal studies suggesting that isoflavones increase the risk of erectile dysfunction are not applicable to men, because of differences in isoflavone metabolism between rodents and humans and the excessively high amount of isoflavones to which the animals were exposed.

Conclusion(S)

The intervention data indicate that isoflavones do not exert feminizing effects on men at intake levels equal to and even considerably higher than are typical for Asian males.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^beb860e4]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Dietary supplements for vasomotor symptoms — soy foods, soy extracts, and the soy metabolite equol show mixed and limited benefit with safety and metabolic considerations. Soy is among the eight most common food allergens, and reactions can range from mild (eg, bloating, flatulence, loose stools) to severe (eg, anaphylaxis). Soy trials published since 2015 are difficult to summarize because of the wide variation in interventions tested, and study limitations include short-term assessments; for example, most participants reported VMS after 12 weeks of treatment, most meta-analyses suggest more than 13 weeks are needed to demonstrate half of the expected maximal effects, and more than 16 weeks are needed for optimal effects. As a result of these study differences and limitations, the findings are mixed, with some studies showing soy to be beneficial for reducing VMS or severity, and others showing no benefit over placebo; some showing soy to be less beneficial than other treatments (Level II; not recommended). Only 35% of North American women can metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein to equol, tests to ascertain whether women are equol producers are not commercially available to the public or healthcare professionals, and a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis found positive effects of equol supplementation over placebo for reducing VMS frequency in three of five trials, although a limitation in most studies (4 of the 6) was inclusion of fewer than 50 participants per group. There is currently mixed evidence for soy foods, soy extracts, and the soy metabolite equol from widely diverse studies, with some significant limitations (Level II; not recommended).

### The role of early life genistein exposures in modifying breast cancer risk [^6b50c4a5]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

GENISTEIN AND BREAST CANCER

The assumption that high soy intake among Asian women explains their low breast cancer risk has led to numerous studies carried out in human populations and animal models. Human studies suggest that there indeed is a modest inverse association between high soy food consumption and reduced risk. However, several questions remain regarding a causative role of soy consumption in reducing breast cancer risk; the possibility that the association simply reflects other factors/'healthy' lifestyle affecting breast cancer risk cannot be excluded at the present time.

Many animal studies do not support an association between an exposure to this phytochemical during adulthood and reduced mammary tumorigenesis (Tables 1 and 2). The protective role of soy intake during adulthood is further questioned by the results obtained in an intervention study on premenopausal women showing that exposure to 100 mg isoflavone (IF) supplement per day for 1 year did not reduce mammographic density. Mammographic density is a biomarker of increased breast cancer risk; high density increases the risk by four- to six-fold. Further, the consumption of soy foods containing approximately 50 mg IF per day for 2 years did not affect circulating steroid hormones or sex hormone-binding protein, and thus the proposed reduction in breast cancer risk by soy cannot be explained through its effects on serum hormone levels in adults.

One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the protective role of soy found in two meta-analyses and the lack of effect on biomarkers of breast cancer risk or the results generated in animal studies during adult exposure to soy/genistein is that, to be protective, this bioactive food component may need to be consumed during early life. In support of this argument, epidemiological studies indicate that childhood/adolescence exposure to soy provides protection against breast cancer later in life. Animal studies are in agreement with the findings obtained in humans, and we will briefly review the data on the effects of genistein/soy exposure in utero and/or during prepuberty on mammary tumorigenesis in animals. Studies carried out in rats and mice are discussed separately because the tumorigenesis models used in the two species are different.

### Implications of phytoestrogen intake for breast cancer [^596593bb]. CA (2007). Low credibility.

Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived substances that are structurally or functionally similar to estradiol. Interest in phytoestrogens has been fueled by epidemiologic data that suggest a decreased risk of breast cancer in women from countries with high phytoestrogen consumption. Women with a history of breast cancer may seek out these "natural" hormones in the belief that they are safe or perhaps even protective against recurrence. Interpretation of research studies regarding phytoestrogen intake and breast cancer risk is hampered by differences in dietary measurement, lack of standardization of supplemental sources, differences in metabolism amongst individuals, and the retrospective nature of much of the research in this area. Data regarding the role of phytoestrogens in breast cancer prevention is conflicting, but suggest early exposure in childhood or early adolescence may be protective. In several placebo-controlled randomized trials among breast cancer survivors, soy has not been found to decrease menopausal symptoms. There is very little human data on the role of phytoestrogens in preventing breast cancer recurrence, but the few studies conducted do not support a protective role. There is in vivo animal data suggesting the phytoestrogen genistein may interfere with the inhibitive effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer cell growth.

### Association of soy and fermented soy product intake with total and cause specific mortality: prospective cohort study [^383b39ed]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the association between soy product intake and all cause and cause specific mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression models. We estimated P for trend values with regression models in which ordinal values for each category of soy products were used as continuous variables. Models were adjusted for potential confounding factors. Model 1 included age at the five year survey (continuous) and public health centre area. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for BMI at the five year survey (< 21, 21- ≤ 23, 23–25, and > 25 kg/m 2), smoking status (never, former, < 20 cigarettes/day, and ≥ 20 cigarettes/day), alcohol intake (never, occasional, < 150 g/week, and ≥ 150 g/week), leisure time physical exercise or sports (almost never, ≥ once/month, and ≥ 3 times/week), self reported history of diabetes or taking drugs for diabetes (yes or no), taking antihypertensives (yes or no), consumption of coffee and green tea (almost never, > 1 cup/week, > 1 cup/day, > 2 cups/day, and > 4 cups/day), undergoing health check-ups (yes or no), menopause status in women (premenopausal or postmenopausal), exogenous female hormone use in women (yes or no), total energy intake (fifths), and energy adjusted amount of vegetables, fruit, fish, and meat (fifths). We further adjusted for area deprivation index, developed previously — this indicator reflects neighbourhood, rather than individual, deprivation level. We conducted the same analyses after the exclusion of participants who died during the first three years. Overall, 278 (0.3%) study participants were lost to follow-up during the period. For them, we treated the last confirmed date as the censoring date. We calculated age adjusted and area adjusted cumulative mortality rate at 10 years in each fifth of soy product intake using the PROC PHREG BASELINE statement (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Multiple imputations of missing values were performed for covariates (BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, physical exercise, coffee intake, green tea intake, use of exogenous female hormones (women only), and menopausal status (women only)) using multivariate normal imputation. All covariates, follow-up durations, and mortality statuses were included in the model for imputation using the SAS PROC MI procedure. We conducted 10 rounds of multiple imputations, then combined them into final estimates according to Rubin's rule (SAS PROC MIANALYZE procedure).P values were two sided, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS software, version 9.4. (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Isoflavone supplements stimulated the production of serum equol and decreased the serum dihydrotestosterone levels in healthy male volunteers [^cd06ba91]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Isofla A tablets are commercially sold in Japan as a supplement, and the most dominant flavonoid was an isoflavone glycoside daidzin. The second dominant flavonoid glycitin is an isoflavone glycoside present in foods containing soybean. The metabolite of glycitin synthesized by intestinal microflora is glycitein, which scavenges the intracellular reactive oxygen species. The other ingredients are malonyl or acetyl glycosides and isoflavone aglycones. Diverse bacterial strains of human origin have specific β-glucosidase and β-glycuronidase activity in the metabolism of dietary isoflavones from glycosides to aglycones. Aglycone and sulfate of genistein and daidzein have estrogen-like activity and so does equol.

Genistein reportedly inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell linesand inhibits the development of prostate-related cancers in Wistar rats. The mechanism of action by which genistein exerts this anti-tumor angiogenesis is not well understood. Enough scientific data have accumulated to allow clinical intervention of soy protein in human trials as an adjuvant supplementation for the treatment of prostate cancer, but the optimal and effective doses of soy protein are not yet known. In this study, we also assessed the effects of the daily consumption of isoflavone supplements on the serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and measured the isoflavone concentrations in the blood and urine of healthy men. Importantly, our results, as well as those of an earlier study, supported the hypothesis that the continuous intake of isoflavones is likely to play a promising role in chemoprevention against cardiovascular disease.

### Unawareness of the effects of soy intake on the management of congenital hypothyroidism [^e4583419]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

It has been established that soy products can interfere with thyroid hormone absorption resulting in continued hypothyroidism in individuals receiving recommended levothyroxine replacement. It has also been reported that achievement of euthyroidism in hypothyroid patients using soy products requires increased doses of levothyroxine. We have observed 2 patients with congenital hypothyroidism who continued to manifest clinical hypothyroidism while receiving recommended doses of hormone and ingesting soy products. The first patient was diagnosed by newborn screening (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] = 169 µIU/mL) and treated with 50 µg of levothyroxine since 6 days of age while simultaneously starting soy formula. At 3 weeks of age, she was clinically and biochemically hypothyroid (thyroxine = 4.0 µg/dL, TSH = 216 µIU/mL). We stopped her soy formula and decreased her levothyroxine dose. Three weeks later signs of hypothyroidism were resolving, and, by 10 weeks of age, she was clinically and biochemically euthyroid. Another patient was diagnosed by newborn screening, received levothyroxine, and did well. She was lost to us for 2 years. During this interval she began consuming soy milk and became profoundly hypothyroid (free thyroxine < 0.4 ng/dL, TSH = 248 µIU/mL), even though the primary care physician had increased her levothyroxine dose to 112 µg/day. She was switched to cow milk, and her thyroid function slowly normalized with decreasing doses of levothyroxine. These 2 patients reinforce the importance of remembering that soy products interfere with levothyroxine absorption and can endanger infants and young children with congenital hypothyroidism who are at risk for developmental and growth delay.

### The impact of diet and nutrition on prostate cancer-food for thought? [^a80a41ba]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Plant-based Proteins

Soy and soy-based products are rich in protein and isoflavones. Due to their high estrogen activity, isoflavones are characterized as phytoestrogens and exhibit estrogenic effects in prostate tissue. Isoflavones accumulate in the prostate gland, where they exhibit a cytotoxic effect and block the cell cycle, induce apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis and inhibit 5-alpha-reductase. Genistein is the most abundant isoflavone component in soy and has been shown to inhibit both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth.

The high consumption of soy products is believed to be the reason for the lower incidence of prostate cancer in the Asian population.

In a meta-analysis of six case–control and two cohort studies, the consumption of dietary isoflavones showed a significant relationship between increased soybean consumption and reduced prostate cancer risk by 26%. In another meta-analysis of five cohort and eight case–control studies the consumption of non-fermented soybean products was significantly associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer by 25%. A more recent meta-analysis of fifteen case–control studies, eight cohort studies and seven nested case–control studies reported a lower risk of prostate cancer associated with the intake of daidzein and genistein.

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are the primary fuel for energy production. Depending on their size, carbohydrates are grouped into three classes, including monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides.

Monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are abundant in fruits, dairy products and sugar, are rapidly metabolized in the body. Overconsumption can lead to obesity and hyperinsulinemia, resulting in overproduction of IGF-1 and consequent inflammation, increasing the risk of prostate cancer development and growth. Since insulin is believed to be a growth factor for prostate cancer, it has been hypothesized that reducing carbohydrate intake would result in lower insulin levels, slowing the growth of cancer cells. It has been reported that reducing energy supply in diet modulates numerous processes in cells resulting in an inhibition of carcinogenesis through enhanced apoptosis and programmed cell death processes.

In an animal study, xenografted mice implanted with prostate cancer cells, were fed with a no-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. Compared to mice fed with Western diet they had a 15% reduction in weight, a 33% reduction in tumor size and an increase in overall survival. Moreover, it was noticed that mice fed with a no-carbohydrate ketogenic diet had lower IGF-1 levels.

### The effect of soy food intake on mineral status in premenopausal women [^7ac284f5]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Soy foods have been substituted for meat in recent years because of proposed health benefits. Research indicates, however, that soy protein and phytate in soy products inhibit the absorption of divalent cations.

Methods

Our study was primarily designed to determine the effect of consuming two to three servings per day of soy foods, providing ∼19g protein and ∼36mg isoflavones, on iron and zinc status in premenopausal women during a 10-weeks period. As secondary outcomes, we also tested the effect of soy foods on biochemical markers of bone and thyroid hormones. Nonsmoking women (18–28 years) without chronic disease, anemia, pregnancy, or irregular menstrual cycles were randomly assigned to either the soy food (SF, n = 31) or animal food (AF, n = 32) group. Blood and urine samples and 3-day dietary records were collected at baseline and postintervention.

Results

At baseline, iron and zinc status, bone markers, and thyroid hormones were not different between groups. After intervention, no significant changes were observed in hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, ferritin, or transferrin receptor (TFR) concentrations. Plasma zinc, but not serum alkaline phosphatase, significantly decreased in both groups (-0.8μmol/L). The change in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was significant between SF (1.5U/L) and AF (-0.7U/L) groups. No significant changes were observed in bone resorption, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), or free thyroxine after soy food intake.

Conclusions

Incorporating ∼19g soy protein from soy foods for 10 weeks had no significant effect on iron or zinc status, bone resorption or formation, or thyroid hormone status in premenopausal women.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^b72754b5]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".

### Soy consumption and phytoestrogens: effect on serum prostate specific antigen when blood lipids and oxidized low-density lipoprotein are reduced in hyperlipidemic men [^cd35f8f7]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Herbal remedies high in phytoestrogens have been shown to reduce serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and have been proposed as a treatment for prostate cancer. Soy proteins used to lower serum cholesterol are rich sources of phytoestrogens. Therefore, we assessed the effect of soy consumption on serum PSA in men who had participated in cholesterol lowering studies.

Materials and Methods

For 3 to 4 weeks 46 healthy middle-aged men with a range of starting PSA values took soy (mean 44 gm. soy protein daily, 116 mg. isoflavones daily) or control foods, and a subgroup of men took a lower level of soy supplements for 3 months. PSA was measured at the start and end of each treatment.

Results

Soy had no significant effect on serum total or free PSA, independent of PSA starting value or isoflavone intake. The lack of effect on PSA was seen, although soy intake was sufficient to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.8 ± 2.2%, p = 0.012), the estimated coronary heart disease risk (6.1 ± 2.8% for 10 years, p = 0.032) and the serum concentration of oxidized low-density lipoprotein measured as conjugated dienes (9.5 ± 3.4%, p = 0.008) in the 3 to 4-week study. In addition, the lack of effect of soy on PSA persisted for the 3 months of the extended study.

Conclusions

At levels of soy intake which reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol any potential benefits of soy consumption on prostate cancer are likely to occur for reasons other than alterations in hormone activity.

### Minimal effect of a low-fat / high soy diet for asymptomatic, hormonally naive prostate cancer patients [^2e55b5eb]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effects of a low-fat diet or a low-fat diet with the addition of a soy supplement were investigated in a pilot Phase II study for asymptomatic, hormonally naive prostate cancer patients with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

Experimental Design

A two-step intervention was implemented. During step 1 patients were begun on a low-fat diet with a goal to reduce fat intake to 15% of total daily calories. On PSA progression, a soy protein supplement was added to the diet (step 2). The primary end point was PSA reduction by 50%. Secondary end points were PSA doubling time and time to progression (TTP). Serum was analyzed for changes in the sex hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) axes.

Results

Among 18 evaluable patients, (median follow-up on study 10.5 months), no patient on either step had a PSA reduction by 50% at any time. There was a trend toward a longer PSA doubling time (P = 0.06) and a prolongation in estimated median TTP of approximately 3 months (P = 0.018) during step 2 compared with step 1 of the study. During step 1, free testosterone levels decreased by 5% (P < 0.01), and during step 2, IGF-I levels increased by 22% (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

A low-fat diet with the subsequent addition of a soy supplement did not result in a significant decline in PSA levels. The addition of soy protein had a modest effect on TTP. A potentially undesirable effect associated with the administration of soy was an increase in IGF-I serum levels.

### Phytoestrogen supplements for the treatment of hot… [^3be9a697]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study was conducted between November 1999 and March 2001 at 3 US medical centers and included women who were recently postmenopausal experiencing 8. 1 hot flashes per day. Women were exluded if they were vegetarians, consumed soy products more than once per. Replacement Study2, 3 demonstrating an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer among women randomized to hormone therapy are likely to reduce the use of hormones for relief of menopausal symptoms. Dietary supplements containing isoflavones derived from soy or red clover are heavily marketed as alternative treatments for menopausal symptoms. In Asia, only 10% to 20% of women experience hot. flashes compared with 70% to 80% of women in Western countries. 4–7 A popular hypothesis to explain this difference is that isoflavones found in soy, a staple in the traditional Asian diet, influence the body's response to the changing hormonal levels of menopause. 8 Isoflavones.

widely marketed for menopausal symptoms and are increasingly being used by women in the United States as an alternative to estrogen. 13–16 Most published studies of isoflavones for relief of menopausal symptoms have investigated the effectiveness of soy products. 17–28 Dietary supplements derived from red clover contain additional isoflavones (biochanin. since menopause. Among the 241 women with paired 24-hour urine results available, there was no statistically significant correlation of change in hot flash number. been smaller than the 77% reduction reported in a meta-analysis of clinical trials using hormone replacement therapy. 41 Furthermore, a randomized clinical trial of soy found that adding 0. 625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens after 6 weeks of soy therapy resulted in a statistically significant additional reduction in hot flashes. 24 As. Genistein is also present in higher concentrations than daidzein in soy, which is the basis of the traditional Asian diet.

45, 46 We examined several subgroups to explore whether certain populations might receive greater benefit from isoflavones derived from red clover. Heavier women appeared to receive more benefit from the isoflavone supplements while. some evidence for a biological effect of Promensil, neither supplement had a clinically significant effect on hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms when compared with placebo.

### Soy germ extract alleviates menopausal hot flushes: placebo-controlled double-blind trial [^de54f5e7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the potency of a soy germ preparation for the alleviation of menopausal hot flushes.

Subjects/Methods

Caucasian women with at least seven hot flushes daily were treated with soy germ extract (100mg isoflavone glycosides) daily or with placebo for 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of open treatment with soy. Outcome parameters were the number of hot flushes and the evaluation of the Greene Climacteric Scale.

Results

A total of 192 women were included. As the hot flush diaries from one study centre were lost, the assessment of hot flushes was based on 136 participants (soy: 54 women; placebo: 82 women). After 12 weeks, 180 women were available for the analysis of Greene Scale and safety (soy and placebo: each 90 women). Hot flushes were reduced by 43.3% (-3.5 hot flushes) with soy and by 30.8% with placebo (-2.6; p < 0.001). After the open treatment phase with soy, both original groups showed a reduction of 68% of hot flushes. A subgroup analysis showed better effects for soy when symptoms were classified as "severe" at baseline. After 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, there was an improvement from baseline values of 71 and 78% with soy with the items "hot flushes" and "sweating", compared with 24% for both items with placebo. Hormonal safety parameters remained uninfluenced.

Conclusions

Soy germ extract with 100mg of isoflavone glycosides was shown to modestly, but significantly reduce menopausal hot flushes.

Breast cancer and body weight

In patients who have undergone breast cancer (BC) surgery, there are indications linking a better long-term outcome to healthy body weight, and physical activity, a balanced diet heavy in fiber and soy, and lower intakes of total fat and saturated fat. Obesity and overweight are associated with poorer overall survival in pre- and post-menopausal BC, with both related to increased estrogen and insulin levels. A meta-analysis that included 12,108 women with invasive BC concluded that physical activity performed pre-diagnosis significantly reduced all-cause mortality by 18%, and post-diagnosis physical activity reduced BC mortality by 30% and decreased all-cause mortality by 41%.

In estrogenic receptor (ER)-positive tumors, physical activity was demonstrated to reduce all-cause mortality (64%) and BC mortality (50%) (potentially attributed to the beneficial effect of exercise on estrogenic levels). No benefit was demonstrated among women with ER-negative disease. Observational data suggest that high soy intake (such as that found in a traditional Japanese diet) may be protective against the development of BC disease, although future clinical studies are needed to confirm this relationship. Until there are more data supporting safety, caution is warranted regarding high doses of isoflavones.

### High soy food intake may improve breast cancer survival… [^aba120a7]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Estrogen is thought to play a major role in breast cancer growth; therefore, blocking estrogenic exposure or effects is widely used in breast cancer therapy. Soy foods are rich in isoflavones, which have both estrogen-like and antiestrogenic actions. Although American women eat significantly less soy than Chinese women, soy consumption is increasing in the United States and, with it, the concern that soy isoflavones may exert estrogenic effects and promote cancer recurrence. Reports also suggest that soy isoflavones may interact with tamoxifen. To date, there has not been a comprehensive study evaluating the effect of soy food consumption on breast cancer recurrence and survival. Shu and colleagues analyzed data from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a longitudinal cohort study, to assess the relationship between soy food consumption and breast cancer recurrence.

Specific dietary habits were assessed at baseline to review intake for the preceding six months, at 18 months for the preceding 12 months, and at 36 months for the preceding 18 months. The 60-month review is ongoing. The food frequency questionnaire measured consumption of commonly used soy foods, including tofu, soy milk, and fresh soybeans. The primary end points were all-cause mortality and cancer recurrence/metastasis or death related to breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the relationship between soy intake and the study outcomes. Soy protein and soy isoflavones were categorized by quartiles of intake amount. Women in the highest quartile of soy intake had significantly decreased four-year mortality and recurrence rates compared with those in the lowest quartile.

The survival benefit of soy followed a linear dose-response curve until soy protein intake reached 11 g per day. The benefit did not vary with the presence of estrogen receptors or menopausal status. Tamoxifen use in women who were estrogen receptor positive was not adversely affected by soy intake. Conclusion: The authors conclude that soy food intake is safe and is associated with improved survival in women with breast cancer, but no additional benefit occurs once soy protein intake exceeds 11 g per day.

### The dilemma with the soy protein health claim [^7f831431]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Dietary risk factors are attributable to ≈18% of deaths and 11% of disability‐adjusted life years in North America. 21 Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of diet‐related death and disability, and estimates suggest that improvements in diet quality from the current US diet to a healthy dietary pattern would reduce total deaths in the United States by ≈26% to 28%. 22 Sources of plant protein, including soy products, are an integral component of healthy dietary patterns and consumption should be promoted; however, ultraprocessed foods, for the most part, do not align with the principles of a healthy dietary pattern and, therefore, should not be encouraged.

In the FDA's evaluation of the evidence, of the 46 articles cited for soy protein and LDL‐cholesterol, only 8 evaluated soy foods; most evaluated soy protein isolate. 3 Thus, to be consistent with the intent of health claims, further research focused on the replacement of animal products with soy foods is needed to provide a more substantive evidence base on which to base a healthy soy protein food health claim. Such a health claim would better serve the consumer and promote public health.

### Large inter-individual variation in isoflavone plasma concentration limits use of isoflavone intake data for risk assessment [^422f878c]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Isoflavones, present in soy products, are suggested to relieve menopausal complaints, and to have a number of other beneficial health effects, such as prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. At higher doses, uncertainty exists regarding potentially detrimental effects on thyroid function and risk of breast and endometrium cancer, because long-term human trials are currently lacking.

The glucosides daidzin, genistin and glycitin are the main isoflavones in soy, whereas their malonyl and acetyl equivalents as well as the aglycones daidzein, genistein and glycitein occur in much lower quantities. The various isoflavones have specific pharmacokinetic characteristics, for example, isoflavone glucosides are more bioavailable than their aglycones; daidzein is rapidly excreted in urine, whereas genistein enters enterohepatic recycling. In addition, 20–30% of the Western population are so-called equol producers; they can convert daidzein into the more active metabolite equol by their gut bacteria. Furthermore, isoflavone plasma concentrations can be influenced by isoflavone source, food matrix, diet, frequency of ingestion, gender and age.

Mean isoflavone intake is low (0.5–0.8 mg/day) across the European population and remains well below the intake in Asian countries even for vegetarians and vegans (22.4 mg/day). Mean plasma concentrations were estimated to be < 0.01 μmol/l in the European population and 0.23 μmol/l for vegetarians and vegans. In Japan, mean intakes of daidzein and genistein are 18.3 and 31.4 mg/day, resulting in plasma concentrations of 0.12 and 0.48 μmol/l, respectively. On average, supplement users in Western countries consume 50 mg of isoflavones/day, but soy-based supplements can contain up to 107 mg aglycone equivalents of isoflavones. Two intervention studies demonstrated that an intake of 100 mg isoflavones/day resulted in total circulating isoflavones of 1.12 and 4.50 μmol/l. This illustrates that postmenopausal women taking isoflavone supplements, for example, to relieve their menopausal complaints can be exposed to higher isoflavone concentrations than Asians who regularly consume soy products.
