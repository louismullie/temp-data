## Question

What number of metabolic acidosis is bad

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what number defines "bad" metabolic acidosis and how to interpret severity thresholds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which laboratory parameter best quantifies severity. Then, I should verify evidence-based cutoffs that correlate with harm and outcomes. Next, I will distinguish acute critical illness from chronic kidney disease contexts. After that, I should review guideline-supported treatment thresholds and the strength of evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats about causality and etiology [^1117qBur] [^113XiPyq].

> Let me first confirm the primary parameter. Severity in metabolic acidosis is best captured by arterial pH, with bicarbonate and base excess as supportive measures; pH integrates both metabolic and respiratory components and is the most consistently linked to outcomes in critical illness, so I should anchor on pH while using HCO3− and base excess to characterize the metabolic process and compensation [^112Hb8H4] [^113XiPyq].

> Now, I need to check the acute care thresholds. Multiple ICU studies and trials converge on pH ≤ 7.20 as "severe" metabolic acidaemia, and this level is associated with high mortality and organ dysfunction; for example, BICAR-ICU enrolled patients with pH ≤ 7.20 and found no overall benefit but a signal of benefit in AKI, while large observational cohorts show ICU mortality around 43–57% in severe acidosis, underscoring the clinical gravity of pH ≤ 7.20 [^111Ergrr] [^112Hb8H4] [^111ZtAjd].

> Hold on, I should verify whether more extreme thresholds carry worse outcomes. Several series and reviews describe pH < 7.15–7.10 as a critical zone where hemodynamic compromise, vasopressor hyporesponsiveness, and arrhythmias are more likely; in shock states, mortality approaches or exceeds 50% and survival becomes uncertain below pH 7.0, reinforcing that pH ≤ 7.15 represents a particularly dangerous level in acute illness [^1133dUP1] [^115gPdzD] [^113BU5KQ].

> Next, I should review chronic kidney disease where the context differs. In CKD, practice points suggest intervening when serum bicarbonate is below about 18 mmol/L to prevent bone and muscle complications, while maintaining bicarbonate within the normal range and avoiding overshoot; observational data also suggest worse kidney outcomes with bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L, supporting this threshold as "clinically significant" in CKD rather than using pH alone [^1147SnGX] [^111WPijt] [^1128dyGX].

> Wait, let me verify treatment thresholds versus harm thresholds. For acute critical illness, guidelines suggest against bicarbonate to improve hemodynamics when pH ≥ 7.15, but allow consideration of bicarbonate when pH ≤ 7.20 with AKI (stage 2–3), reflecting a harm threshold around 7.15 and a potential treatment threshold around 7.20 in selected subgroups; this aligns with the BICAR-ICU subgroup signal and with RRT initiation criteria in trials that used pH < 7.15–7.20 as absolute indications [^114V1MMK] [^111Ergrr] [^113cxfeu].

> I should double-check that I'm not conflating causation with correlation. Acidosis often tracks illness severity, and some data suggest etiology and the rapidity of correction may be as or more predictive than the absolute pH; nonetheless, mechanistic and clinical data support that pH ≤ 7.20 is a pragmatic "bad" threshold in acute care, while acknowledging that treating the underlying cause remains paramount and that bicarbonate is not universally beneficial outside specific contexts [^113tm814] [^11396iuA] [^1117qBur].

> Putting this together, I will now synthesize the answer. In acute critical illness, pH ≤ 7.20 defines severe metabolic acidaemia and is "bad", with pH ≤ 7.15 representing a critical danger zone associated with hemodynamic collapse and very high mortality; in chronic kidney disease, serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L is the clinically meaningful threshold warranting intervention to prevent complications, even though pH may remain near-normal due to compensation [^111Ergrr] [^112Hb8H4] [^115gPdzD] [^1147SnGX] [^111WPijt].

---

Metabolic acidosis is "bad" when **pH < 7.20** or **bicarbonate < 12 mmol/L**, as these levels are linked to high mortality, hemodynamic instability, and organ dysfunction [^112Hb8H4] [^111Ergrr]. Severe acidosis (pH < 7.20) requires **urgent treatment** of the cause and consideration of bicarbonate or renal replacement therapy, especially with AKI or shock [^114V1MMK] [^113cxfeu]. In CKD, **bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L** is a threshold to treat to slow progression and reduce complications [^1147SnGX] [^111WPijt]. Mortality rises as pH falls, particularly when lactate is elevated, and rapid correction of acidosis improves outcomes [^114C26LV].

## Clinical thresholds for severity

| **Severity** | **Arterial ph** | **Serum bicarbonate (hco3-)** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | 7.30–7.35 | 18–22 mmol/L | Often compensated; monitor and treat underlying cause |
| Moderate | 7.20–7.29 | 12–18 mmol/L | Increased risk of complications; monitor closely |
| Severe | < 7.20 | < 12 mmol/L | High mortality, hemodynamic instability, organ dysfunction |

---

Severe metabolic acidosis (**pH < 7.20**) is associated with a **mortality rate of approximately 50% or higher**, particularly in critically ill patients [^112Hb8H4] [^111ZtAjd].

---

## Physiological consequences of severe metabolic acidosis

Severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.20) has **significant physiological consequences**, including:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Reduced myocardial contractility, vasodilation, hypotension, and increased risk of arrhythmias [^1117qBur] [^1117GoBF].

- **Respiratory effects**: Compensatory hyperventilation (Kussmaul respirations), respiratory muscle fatigue, and respiratory failure [^1117qBur].

- **Neurological effects**: Confusion, lethargy, and coma [^1124GNka].

- **Metabolic effects**: Impaired cellular metabolism, reduced ATP production, and insulin resistance [^1117qBur].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring urgent intervention

Certain clinical scenarios necessitate **urgent intervention** when metabolic acidosis is severe:

- **Sepsis and septic shock**: Severe lactic acidosis (pH < 7.20) is common and associated with high mortality [^114RPu15].

- **Cardiogenic shock**: Severe acidosis exacerbates hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction [^1133dUP1].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Severe acidosis in AKI patients may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) [^113cxfeu].

- **Drug intoxications**: Certain poisonings (e.g. methanol, ethylene glycol) require rapid correction of acidosis [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies for severe metabolic acidosis

Treatment of severe metabolic acidosis focuses on correcting the **underlying cause** and restoring acid-base balance:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address the primary cause of acidosis (e.g. sepsis, hypovolemia, diabetic ketoacidosis) [^114xe442].

- **Bicarbonate therapy**: Sodium bicarbonate may be considered in specific scenarios (e.g. severe acidosis with AKI), but its use remains controversial and should be individualized [^114V1MMK] [^111Ergrr].

- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: RRT is indicated for severe acidosis with AKI or when bicarbonate therapy is contraindicated or ineffective [^113cxfeu].

---

## Prognostic implications

The severity of metabolic acidosis **strongly correlates with prognosis**. Lower pH and higher lactate levels are associated with increased mortality, particularly in critically ill patients [^1122C8Ft]. Rapid correction of acidosis improves outcomes, whereas persistent severe acidosis portends poor prognosis [^111ZtAjd].

---

## Special considerations in chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In CKD, metabolic acidosis is common and associated with progression of kidney disease, bone demineralization, and muscle catabolism. Clinical guidelines recommend maintaining serum bicarbonate **≥ 22 mmol/L** [^111dGcTu] with oral alkali supplementation to prevent these complications [^116qSfvZ].

---

Metabolic acidosis is considered "bad" when **pH < 7.20** or **bicarbonate < 12 mmol/L**, as these levels are associated with high mortality, hemodynamic instability, and organ dysfunction. Severe acidosis requires urgent intervention, including treating the underlying cause, considering bicarbonate therapy, and initiating renal replacement therapy if necessary.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^11494PBZ]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have reviewed the recent clinical data on epidemiology and management of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is common in the ICU, and even moderate metabolic acidosis carries higher mortality than severe sepsis. Sodium bicarbonate or RRT is used occasionally to normalize acid–base imbalance due to metabolic acidosis in the ICU; however, high-quality evidence is still limited. Patients with severe metabolic acidosis and stage 2 or 3 AKI might be a possible target population for sodium bicarbonate administration. Further clinical trials are required to provide more robust information in a clinically relevant patient population.

### Metabolic acidosis of CKD: diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment [^1128dyGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is noted in the majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases to less than 20% to 25% of normal, although as many as 20% of individuals can have acid-base parameters close to or within the normal range. Acidosis generally is mild to moderate in degree, with plasma bicarbonate concentrations ranging from 12 to 22 mEq/L (mmol/L), and it is rare to see values less than 12 mEq/L (mmol/L) in the absence of an increased acid load. Degree of acidosis approximately correlates with severity of renal failure and usually is more severe at a lower GFR. The metabolic acidosis can be of the high-anion-gap variety, although anion gap can be normal or only moderately increased even with stage 4 to 5 CKD. Several adverse consequences have been associated with metabolic acidosis, including muscle wasting, bone disease, impaired growth, abnormalities in growth hormone and thyroid hormone secretion, impaired insulin sensitivity, progression of renal failure, and exacerbation of beta 2 -microglobulin accumulation. Administration of base aimed at normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentration might be associated with certain complications, such as volume overload, exacerbation of hypertension, and facilitation of vascular calcifications. Whether normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentrations in all patients is desirable therefore requires additional study. In the present review, we describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of metabolic acidosis, discuss potential adverse effects, and address benefits and complications of therapy.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1133nt6p]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of acidosis in critical illness are complex and depend on multiple factors, including the etiology of the acidosis (hypercapnic versus metabolic), the degree of acidosis and whether the acidosis accumulates acutely or more gradually, where compensatory or adaptive mechanisms may blunt its effects. While acidosis is traditionally associated with poor outcome in critical illness, it is not clear to what extent - if any - this is a causal relationship. In any case, simple avoidance of acidosis is generally not feasible in the critically ill. In fact, conventional protective ventilation strategies that minimize lung stretch increase the prevalence of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) in the critically ill, and have been clearly demonstrated to save lives in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is also a clear potential for harm with HCA or metabolic acidosis (MAC), whether due to acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), exposure for prolonged periods of time (for example, increased risk of infection) or high concentrations. These complexities are further underlined by the findings in multiple preclinical studies that acidosis may have direct effects which can protect cells and organs in the setting of acute organ injury. Thus, managing acidosis is an integral component of critical care, and efforts to deepen our understanding of its consequences are therefore welcome.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113tm814]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies evaluating the association of metabolic acidosis and outcome in the critically ill have focused on either a specific etiology (for example lactate) or a certain degree of acidosis (for example base excess). Most of these studies had small sample sizes and were, of course, observational in nature. Studies such as these have led to controversy as to whether acidosis is merely a marker for illness severity or whether it is itself in causal pathway of critical illness. Experimental evidence suggests that acidosis itself can influence hemodynamics and innate immunity. Studies also suggest that different acids are associated with different responses. Although no observational study can establish causation, we sought to determine whether different types of metabolic acidosis were associated with different hospital mortality rates. If pH or the degree of metabolic acidosis, as characterized by SBE, are themselves significant determinants of outcome, we would expect to see either a similar mortality across different subtypes of metabolic acidosis or independent associations as determined by multivariable regression. We saw neither. Indeed, the two major findings of our study are that different etiologies of metabolic acidosis are associated with different mortality rates, and that the severity of acidosis, measured by pH or SBE, was not independently associated with hospital mortality after controlling for the causative anion (lactate, chloride, or all others). The finding that pH and SBE were not in the final predictive model may be due to their strong correlation with all forms of metabolic acidoses.

Conclusion

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is a common phenomenon in the Western world. We have provided several ways for clinicians to test for metabolic acidosis and strategies to neutralise a high dietary acid load. A greater emphasis on low-grade metabolic acidosis should be provided during medical school so that clinicians are more aware of this condition and how to treat it.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^1133dUP1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is there any proven benefit of systemic alkalinization in severe metabolic (including lactic) acidosis?

Literature regarding the potential beneficial effect of alkalinization in correcting metabolic acidosis is controversial. As reported above, severe lactic acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15 appears to be experimentally detrimental for organ functions. Consequently, even if not formally demonstrated in clinical trials, it would appear reasonable to quickly correct the pH in order to restore cellular functions. In the absence of conclusive clinical studies, however, most of the following treatment options are consequently based on experimental data.

Sodium bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate has been removed from the treatment algorithm in advanced cardiac life support. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign also recommends against the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements in patients with severe lactic acidosis with pH > 7.15. Despite these strong guidelines, in the most recent survey on this topic, 67% of intensivists recommend administration of base to patients with metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. The blood pH at which base therapy should be initiated remains nonetheless controversial. Thirty-seven percent of these intensivists continue to begin symptomatic treatment of metabolic acidosis for a pH ≥ 7.1. Such discrepancy between the literature and bedside practice warrants further explanation.

Clinical studies investigating sodium bicarbonate therapy in situations of severe lactic acidosis have always reported an increase in extracellular pH whereas experimental data are more divergent. By contrast, intracellular pH always decreases after sodium bicarbonate administration (Table 1). The main explanation for this so-called paradoxical intracellular acidosis is based on the reaction of sodium bicarbonate with a proton to form water and carbon dioxide:

### Approach to metabolic acidosis in the emergency department [^116KTcQ8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders should be considered a process with the goal being to treat the patient and the underlying condition, not the numbers. A good understanding of the normal acid-base regulation in the body, as well as the most common derangements can prepare the emergency physician for this very common disorder that presents on every shift.

### Metabolic acidosis and the role of unmeasured anions in critical illness and injury [^112uVzdG]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders are frequently present in critically ill patients. Metabolic acidosis is associated with increased mortality, but it is unclear whether as a marker of the severity of the disease process or as a direct effector. The understanding of the metabolic component of acid-base derangements has evolved over time, and several theories and models for precise quantification and interpretation have been postulated during the last century. Unmeasured anions are the footprints of dissociated fixed acids and may be responsible for a significant component of metabolic acidosis. Their nature, origin, and prognostic value are incompletely understood. This review provides a historical overview of how the understanding of the metabolic component of acid-base disorders has evolved over time and describes the theoretical models and their corresponding tools applicable to clinical practice, with an emphasis on the role of unmeasured anions in general and several specific settings.

Agenda for future research

Recent clinical research, including large RCTs, has provided new evidence and advanced our understanding of the management of metabolic acidosis. However, high-quality data from rigorous clinical research to guide standard practice are still lacking. Research priorities include the following:
The benefits and harms of sodium bicarbonate on cardiovascular function
Sodium bicarbonate not only for severe metabolic acidosis but for moderate metabolic acidosis
Sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidosis with stage 2 or 3 AKI (BICARICU-2, identifier NCT04010630, in progress).

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1152N3eJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acidosis is associated with poor outcome in critical illness. However, acidosis - both hypercapnic and metabolic - has direct effects that can limit tissue injury induced by many causes. There is also a clear potential for off-target harm with acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), and with exposure for prolonged periods (for example, increased risk of infection) or at high doses. Ongoing comprehensive determination of molecular, cellular and physiologic impact across a range of representative pathologies will allow us to understand better the risks and benefits of hypercapnia and acidosis during critical illness.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

Key messages

- Given the same profound level of acidosis, prognosis of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is significantly better than that of lactic acidosis of other origin.

- It is important to consider MALA in any metformin-treated patient and to start therapy promptly.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^1137VtWp]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Bicarbonate therapy — randomized trial evidence in severe metabolic acidemia: In a multicenter RCT, 400 patients with severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20) were randomized to IV 4.2% sodium bicarbonate targeting arterial pH 7.3 or control, with no between-group difference in the composite of 28-day mortality and organ failure at day 7; hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic alkalosis were more frequent with bicarbonate. In the AKI subgroup (AKIN stage 2 or 3 at randomization; 182/389 [47%]), mortality was lower with bicarbonate versus control (42/92 [46%] vs 57/90 [63%]; absolute risk reduction −17% [−33.0 to −2.3]; p = 0.016), with significant heterogeneity versus AKIN 0–1 (p = 0.023). Sepsis was present in 61% (238/389) and no differential effect was observed by sepsis status.

### What should define optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease? [^113Byfax]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of metabolic acidosis is an important goal in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in this setting - various expert groups from around the world have set different goals for serum bicarbonate levels for patients with CKD. Accumulating evidence seems to indicate that achieving an arterial pH closer to the upper limit of the reference range may have even greater benefits than maintaining the arterial pH closer to the lower limit of the reference range. This benefit seems to be particularly relevant for patients with protein-energy wasting and we present a review of the evidence that supports this argument. Routine measurement of arterial pH, however, is not feasible in clinical practice; using the Henderson equation, a high-normal arterial pH is generally expected to be associated with a serum bicarbonate level of 24–30 mEq/l and should be the therapeutic goal for chronic kidney disease patients with protein-energy wasting.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115kCUEP]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis occurs in a number of diseases and even certain normal activities such as heavy exercise. It arises from increased endogenous acid production, exogenous acid (or acid-precursor) administration, base losses, and depression of renal acid secretion. Although the magnitude of acidosis is important, the ultimate pathophysiological impact of any metabolic acidosis is defined by the rate of change and the specific cause of the acidosis. This review discusses whole body, organ, and cellular effects of metabolic acidosis, its diagnosis by pathophysiologic categories, and treatment. The diagnosis is made by a synthesis of the clinical history, physical examination, other hematological values, serum and urinary chemistries, and arterial blood gases and electrolytes. Calculation of the anion and osmolal gaps can be effectively used to further narrow the diagnostic possibilities. Supportive care and therapy directed at the cause of the metabolic acidosis are the mainstays of treatment, since most acidotic states will spontaneously correct once the initiating cause is removed or reversed. Theoretical and clinical evidence are discussed for alkalinizing agents, whose use remains controversial except in the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with hyperkalemia and certain drug or toxin ingestions.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^115gPdzD]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Shock was recently redefined as a clinical state of acute circulatory failure with inadequate oxygen utilization and/or delivery by the cells resulting in cellular dysoxia/hypoxia. In this setting, shock-associated lactic acidosis is the principal but not exclusive cause of metabolic acidosis in the shock state. Current clinical practice considers a pH ≤ 7.35 and lactatemia > 2.0 mmol.l −1 with a PaCO 2 ≤ 42 mmHg as defining lactic acidosis. In contrast, the definition of severe lactic acidosis is unclear. Critical care physicians usually consider that metabolic acidosis with a pH < 7.2 has deleterious hemodynamic effects and requires symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, despite optimal management with adequate supportive and etiological therapy, shock and severe lactic acidosis (that is, with pH < 7.2) remain associated with an observed high mortality rate of about 50%, while no survival has been reported for severe lactic acidosis with shock under pH 7.0.

Numerous studies have assessed the cardiovascular consequences of severe metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. These experimental studies demonstrated that severe metabolic acidosis worsens cardiovascular function by exacerbating myocardial dysfunction and hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors. Nevertheless, such findings have yet to be formally observed in human studies.

Etiological treatment is essential while symptomatic lactic acidosis correction remains a contentious issue. It is unknown whether alkalinization is beneficial in severe lactic acidosis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against symptomatic treatment in lactic acidotic patients with a pH > 7.15 for the purpose of improving hemodynamic status. Alternatively, the effect of alkalinization on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at pH ≤ 7.15 is currently unknown. Nevertheless, despite the lack of relevant results on its efficacy, alkalinization is still largely prescribed in instances of severe acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15.

### A basic solution for a complex problem: does treatment of metabolic acidosis slow CKD progression? [^113UsHiE]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of This Review

Metabolic acidosis is frequently encountered in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with increasing prevalence as kidney function worsens. Treating electrolyte disturbances is the sine qua non of Nephrologists, and alkali therapy to normalize serum bicarbonate levels and slow progression of kidney disease has been embedded in clinical practice guidelines for decades on the basis of animal models and controversial clinical trials. This review will critically appraise the literature base for this recommendation and determine whether the available evidence supports this common practice, which is a timely endeavor considering the impending demotion of metabolic acidosis treatment from recommendation to practice point in forthcoming KDIGO guidelines.

Recent Findings

Earlier, open-label, studies supporting the utility of sodium bicarbonate therapy to slow progression of chronic kidney disease have been challenged by more recent, blinded, studies failing to show benefit on CKD progression. This was further demonstrated in the absence of concomitant sodium administration with the hydrochloric acid binder veverimer, which failed to demonstrate benefit on renal death, end stage kidney disease or 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in a large multicenter trial.

Summary

The current body of literature does not support the routine treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD and the authors agree with the forthcoming KDIGO guidelines to de-emphasize this common practice.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^113cxfeu]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal replacement therapy for metabolic acidosis

There has been no clear consensus of clinical indications for RRT; however, severe acidosis is a commonly accepted indication. In RCTs on the timing of RRT that have been published over the past 5 years, i.e. the AKIKI trial, the IDEAL-ICU trial, and the STARRT-AKI trial, metabolic acidosis with severe acidemia was used as one of the absolute indications.

The AKIKI trial was a multicenter RCT in France, enrolling patients with stage 3 AKI, in which 67% of the patients had septic shock. The trial compared early initiation of RRT in stage 3 AKI and delayed initiation with absolute indications. The absolute indications for RRT included severe acidemia with pH < 7.15, either metabolic acidosis or mixed acidosis. Of note, 21% of the trial participants in the control group received RRT for metabolic acidosis.

The IDEAL-ICU trial was another multicenter RCT conducted in France, enrolling patients with septic shock and stage 3 AKI. The absolute indications for RRT included metabolic acidosis with pH < 7.15 and base deficit > 5 mEq/l or HCO3 − < 18 mEq/l. Among the patients who received RRT for the absolute indication, 13.4% met the metabolic acidosis criteria.

The STARRT-AKI trial was the largest international RCT, including 3019 patients from 15 countries. The main aim of the trial was to assess whether an accelerated strategy to start RRT at stage 2 or 3 AKI would improve patient-centered outcomes compared with a delayed initiation with absolute indications. The absolute indications for RRT included severe acidemia and metabolic acidosis, defined as pH ≤ 7.2 or HCO₃⁻ < 12 mmol/l. Of the patients treated with RRT, 16.6% met the criteria for severe metabolic acidosis.

From the STARRT-AKI trial and the BICAR-ICU trial, patients with stage 2 or 3 AKI should avoid immediate intervention with RRT and may benefit from sodium bicarbonate if severe metabolic acidosis is present despite appropriate treatment for underlying conditions.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^115RbJd4]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO₂/HCO₃⁻ and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1147SnGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

### Metabolic acidosis is associated with increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes and mortality in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease: an observational cohort study [^111WPijt]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large longitudinal cohort study of more than 50,000 community-based individuals with non-dialysis-dependent stage 3‒5 CKD, we found that a higher baseline serum bicarbonate level was independently associated with a lower risk of CKD progression, kidney failure, and all-cause mortality, when considered alone or as a composite outcome.

Each 1-mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate was associated with a significant 7.4% reduction in the risk of the DD40 outcome over a median follow-up of almost 4 years as well as a significant 13% reduction in the odds of the DD40 outcome over a 2-year period. Previous studies examining the association between serum bicarbonate levels and CKD progression have found conflicting results, potentially due to differences in sample sizes, patient populations, baseline risks of end-stage kidney disease, and duration of follow-up as well as the definition and number of events, the prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis, and the degree of adjustment for covariates, all of which influence power and effect size. Our ability to detect an association between small incremental increases in serum bicarbonate level and clinical outcomes was enabled by the large sample size and the high frequency of events in our study.

The results of our study are supported by findings from several clinical trials in which treatment of metabolic acidosis using various interventions led to reductions in adverse renal outcomes. One of these studies was a multicenter, multinational, placebo-controlled trial. The other studies were open-label with standard-of-care controls, of which three were conducted at a single center and one was conducted at multiple centers in one country; interventions included a very low protein diet or sodium bicarbonate.

Despite clinical practice guideline recommendations by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) to treat metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD with oral bicarbonate supplementation, few patients with metabolic acidosis receive alkali treatment. For example, in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, only 2.7% of patients with serum bicarbonate levels ≤ 22 mEq/L were receiving alkali treatment at baseline, and in the phase 3 veverimer study, less than < 10% of patients with mean serum bicarbonate levels of 17.1 mEq/L were receiving sodium bicarbonate treatment at baseline. From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that metabolic acidosis should be treated more aggressively and patients should receive appropriate dietary counseling and pharmacological treatment when appropriate.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^114ic2Eu]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a chronic condition that many people in the Western world have but do not realise it. It occurs when there is retention of acid in the body, which leads to a depletion in the bicarbonate stores of the body. The term metabolic acidosis is typically used when referring to low blood pH or acidemia due to a metabolic abnormality. However, this is inappropriate as most cases of metabolic acidosis do not have acidemia. In fact, a low blood pH is typically one of the last surrogate markers to become abnormal in those with low-grade metabolic acidosis. This is because the body maintains a normal blood pH at the expense of bicarbonate reserves. Metabolic acidosis primarily occurs inside the cell and in the fluid that surrounds our tissues (interstitial fluid). When checking for metabolic acidosis the clinician should look at fasting serum bicarbonate, urinary pH (with a measurement at least 4 hours separated from the last ingested meal) and 24-hour urinary citrate levels. While there is not a universally accepted way to diagnose low-grade metabolic acidosis, this paper will help to give the clinician insights into checking for this condition in their patients.

### Metabolic acidosis may be as protective as hypercapnic acidosis in an ex-vivo model of severe ventilator-induced lung injury: a pilot study [^114psj7s]. BMC Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 2

It would be interesting to note that in regard to the effects of hypercapnic acidosis, the severity of injury might be important. The beneficial effects of hypercapnic acidosis are most pronounced in severe experimental VILI while they are not so impressive on more clinically relevant models. In addition, they appear to be absent in the setting of mild experimental VILI or atelectasis. Whether this is the case for metabolic acidosis is unknown, it is reasonable however to speculate that in light of these data a rather more severe model would be required to demonstrate the protective effects of metabolic acidosis.

It is now well documented that inflammatory changes occur in the lung subjected to injurious ventilation modes. These changes are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, detected both in the circulation and lung. Since this was a pilot study, elaborating on the possible physiologic effects of acidosis per se in VILI, inflammatory load was not initially addressed. However, in light of our results the latter constitutes a challenging future orientation.

### The continuum of acid stress [^113t7fRM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acid-related injury from chronic metabolic acidosis is recognized through growing evidence of its deleterious effects, including kidney and other organ injury. Progressive acid accumulation precedes the signature manifestation of chronic metabolic acidosis, decreased plasma bicarbonate concentration. Acid accumulation that is not enough to manifest as metabolic acidosis, known as eubicarbonatemic acidosis, also appears to cause kidney injury, with exacerbated progression of CKD. Chronic engagement of mechanisms to mitigate the acid challenge from Western-type diets also appears to cause kidney injury. Rather than considering chronic metabolic acidosis as the only acid-related condition requiring intervention to reduce kidney injury, this review supports consideration of acid-related injury as a continuum. This "acid stress" continuum has chronic metabolic acidosis at its most extreme end, and high-acid-producing diets at its less extreme, yet detrimental, end.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial [^111Ergrr]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Acute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness. Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial, as no studies to date have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. We included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who were admitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO₂ ≤ 45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration ≤ 20 mmol/L) and with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. We randomly assigned patients (1:1), by stratified randomisation with minimisation via a restricted web platform, to receive either no sodium bicarbonate (control group) or 4.2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) to maintain the arterial pH above 7.30. Our protocol recommended that the volume of each infusion should be within the range of 125–250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion. Randomisation criteria were stratified among three prespecified strata: age, sepsis status, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. All analyses were done on data from the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02476253.

Findings

Between May 5, 2015, and May 7, 2017, we enrolled 389 patients into the intention-to-treat analysis in the overall population (194 in the control group and 195 in the bicarbonate group). The primary outcome occurred in 138 (71%) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 (66%) of 195 in the bicarbonate group (absolute difference estimate -5.5%, 95% CI -15.2 to 4.2; p = 0.24). The Kaplan-Meier method estimate of the probability of survival at day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was not significant (46% [95% CI 40–54] vs 55% [49–63]; p = 0.09. In the prespecified AKIN stratum of patients with a score of 2 or 3, the Kaplan-Meier method estimate of survival by day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was significant (37% [95% CI 28–48] vs 54% [45–65]; p = 0.0283). Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, and hypocalcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group, with no life-threatening complications reported.

Interpretation

In patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary composite outcome. However, sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^1122C8Ft]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is associated with poor survival despite optimal contemporary therapy. CS exists on a spectrum of severity, with a greater degree of hemodynamic compromise correlating to worse outcomes. The degree of hemodynamic compromise during CS can be graded using the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) shock classification. Shock severity defined by the SCAI shock classification is associated with mortality in patients with CS and unselected patients treated in cardiac intensive care units. Despite the potential to improve hemodynamics, an array of increasingly sophisticated percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices have failed to improve survival in randomized trials. Selection of appropriate patients, that is, those in whom the restoration of cardiac output will reverse CS, seems paramount to improve outcomes with mechanical circulatory support.

Noncardiovascular factors influence both prognosis and response to treatment in patients with CS, affecting the observed efficacy of tested therapies independent of shock severity. During CS, tissue hypoperfusion and organ failure lead to metabolic deficiencies and a treatment‐resistant hemometabolic CS phenotype. Simple blood biomarkers can capture this, as lactic acidosis (defined as an elevated blood lactate level) is a well‐established predictor of mortality in patients with CS. Likewise, systemic acidemia (defined as a low blood pH) predicts mortality in patients with CS and may quantify the severity of the hemometabolic disturbance. To determine whether lactic acidosis (elevated lactate level) and systemic acidemia (low blood pH) reflect different aspects of hypoperfusion and metabolic compromise, or whether they are markers for similar biological processes, we analyzed associations between the severity of systemic acidemia and lactic acidosis on 30‐day mortality in 2 cohorts of patients with CS from mixed etiologies stratified on the basis of the SCAI shock severity scheme.

For severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) with acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by AKI Network (AKIN) score 2 or 3, we suggest using sodium bicarbonate therapy (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^1149dawA]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early metabolic acidosis was common in ICU patients, and sodium bicarbonate was preferentially given to more severely ill patients. However, sodium bicarbonate therapy was variable in speed and mode of delivery and not adjusted for the patient's body weight or the severity of metabolic acidosis. Despite such shortcomings in its dosage and delivery, sodium bicarbonate was independently associated with faster resolution of acid–base derangements and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Moreover, in vasopressor-dependent patients, it was independently associated with a significantly greater increase in mean arterial pressure at six hours and a non-significant but favorable association with decreased ICU mortality. In their aggregate, these observations support the conduct of further controlled trials of bicarbonate therapy in early metabolic acidosis of critical illness.

### Management of severe paediatric malaria in resource-limited settings [^1126cEQN]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress

Improved diagnostic capabilities have led to a better understanding of the importance of metabolic acidosis as a common complication of severe malaria, despite its clinical correlates (deep 'Kussmaul' breathing) being recognised for decades. Historically, respiratory distress in children with severe malaria has been considered synonymous with congestive cardiac failure, although recent work suggests that heart failure is rare, whereas deep breathing or metabolic acidosis is central to the pathophysiology. Moreover, clinical examination findings and chest radiographs are usually normal, providing further evidence that pulmonary oedema or 'acute respiratory distress syndrome' is rare in children, although common in adult severe malaria.

Despite being a common complication of severe malaria, the aetiology of malarial acidosis is not well understood. At a clinical level metabolic acidosis is more frequent in children with severe anaemia, hypovolaemia, altered rheological properties of non-parasitised red blood cells (npRBCs) and hepatic or renal dysfunction (due to decreased elimination). Both increased production and impaired metabolism of lactate and ketoacids have been implicated as causes; however, other unidentified organic acids also contribute. Use of sodium bicarbonate to correct acidosis has fallen out of favour, largely since it failed to address the underlying processes and conferred no clinical benefit. Treatment of acidosis with signs of hypovolaemic shock is covered later in the clinical trials section (see Fluid and vasopressin use for correction of acidosis and shock). Current management guidelines recommend prompt correction of hypoglycaemia, severe anaemia with a blood transfusion, intravenous fluids at 3 to 4 ml/kg/hour (maintenance) and careful monitoring.

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^112dxGf9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of the analysis are its inclusion of 2 independent, large, unselected cohorts of patients with CS. Independent validation in prospective cohorts is warranted. The thresholds for categorized analysis were taken from clinical experience rather than calculating optimal cutoff values. The fact that lactate level and blood pH were predictors of mortality when considered as continuous parameters validates their relevance. While it is tempting to speculate on the mechanisms leading to early death, the study merely describes associations. It remains entirely unclear whether interventions targeting blood pH or lactate levels can improve outcomes in CS. Ideal interventions would target upstream drivers of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise (ie, hypoperfusion) rather than their consequences, such as lactic acidosis and systemic acidemia. While the analysis of 2 large cohorts validates our findings, performing separate analyses within each cohort has some shortcomings, such as decreased statistical power compared with combining the cohorts. We did not have data on treatments for acidosis, nor did we have comprehensive data regarding all measurements reflecting acid‐base balance or serial measures of acidosis; we combined both arterial and venous lactate and pH measurements, leading to some variability.

In conclusion, severe lactic acidosis and systemic acidemia are important predictors of short‐term mortality in patients with CS independent of the severity of shock using the SCAI shock stages. Patients with CS and higher lactate level or lower blood pH are more likely to die across the spectrum of shock severity. As measured by the lactate level, the severity of hypoperfusion appears more important for predicting mortality than the extent of intrinsic compensation, as measured by the blood pH. Arterial pH and lactate levels should be routinely measured in patients with CS and reported in clinical studies. The presence of severe lactic acidosis or severe systemic acidemia should be considered risk modifiers that can identify high‐risk patients when added to the SCAI shock classification.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^114fqzVA]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a major acid–base derangement in critically ill patients. Metabolic acidosis may impair cardiovascular contractility, which may contribute to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, induce insulin resistance and may be associated with increased mortality. The treatment of metabolic acidosis is focused on addressing the underlying condition, i.e. shock. While the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate in vitro can correct acidosis, its use or effect in the clinical context is unclear. In this regard, some clinicians recommend the administration of sodium bicarbonate to patients with significant metabolic acidosis. These recommendations are based on the assumption that sodium bicarbonate might restore normal cardiovascular function and subsequently improve oxygen delivery and help correct a low pH. This effect of bicarbonate on pH is supported by a recently conducted systematic review. However, in a low pH environment, hemoglobin plays a role as a buffer, by binding hydrogen ion and unloading oxygen to peripheral tissue. Administration of sodium bicarbonate may interfere with this buffering effect. Whether the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis in vivo has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, i.e. vasopressor sparing effect, let alone patient-centered outcomes, i.e. mortality, remains controversial.

A recent multi-center, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial (n = 389) published in 2018 assessed the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy in critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidosis. This trial reported that targeting a pH above 7.3 with intravenous sodium bicarbonate did not significantly reduce overall 28-day mortality. However, it also reported a reduction in the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT), a secondary outcome, with such treatment. These findings have renewed interest in the role of bicarbonate therapy in patients with metabolic acidosis. However, it is unclear whether these findings are relevant and applicable to clinicians and patients in other clinical settings, because the current management of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients is unknown.

Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the incidence and current clinical management of metabolic acidosis and the use of intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy in the ICU in a multicenter, international setting and assess the association of such therapy with relevant biochemical and clinical outcomes.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115vbAsB]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Accumulating evidence identifies acidosis not only as a consequence of, but as a contributor to, kidney disease progression. Several mechanistic pathways have been identified in this regard. The dietary acid load, even in the absence of overt acidosis, may have deleterious effects. Several small trials now suggest that the treatment of acidosis with oral alkali can slow the progression of kidney disease.

### The serum anion gap in the evaluation of acid-base disorders: what are its limitations and can its effectiveness be improved? [^111MVjpb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap has been utilized to identify errors in the measurement of electrolytes, to detect paraproteins, and, most relevant to the nephrologist, to evaluate patients with suspected acid-base disorders. In regard to the latter purpose, traditionally an increased anion gap is identified when it exceeds the upper limit of normal for a particular clinical laboratory measurement. However, because there is a wide range of normal values (often 8–10 mEq/L), an increase in anion concentration can be present in the absence of an increased anion gap. In addition, the type of retained anion can affect the magnitude of the increase in anion gap relative to change in serum [HCO3(-)] being greater with lactic acidosis compared with ketoacidosis. This review examines the methods of calculation of the serum anion gap in textbooks and published literature, the effect of perturbations other than changes in acid-base balance, and its effectiveness in identifying mild and more severe disturbances in acid-base balance. Limitations of the present methods of determining the normal anion gap and change in the anion gap are highlighted. The possibility of identifying the baseline value for individuals to optimize the use of the calculation in the detection of metabolic acidosis is suggested.

Epidemiology of metabolic acidosis in the ICU

Acute metabolic acidosis is well-recognized in the ICU. However, epidemiological data are scarce, which has limited our understanding of the approach to metabolic acidosis until recently.

A retrospective observational study using a large bi-national ICU database in Australia and New Zealand examined the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of patients with various definitions of metabolic acidosis. Severe metabolic acidosis was defined as a pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO₂ ≤ 45 mmHg, HCO₃⁻ ≤ 20 mmol/l, and total sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 4 or lactate ≥ 2 mmol/l and occurred in 1.5% of the patients in the ICU. The ICU and hospital mortality rates of these patients were 43.5% and 48.3%, respectively. Moderate or severe metabolic acidosis was defined as pH < 7.30, base excess < −4 mmol/l and PaCO2 ≤ 45 mmHg, and occurred in 8.4% of ICU patients. The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 17.3% and 21.5%, respectively. The mortality of patients with moderate or severe metabolic acidosis was higher than that of patients with sepsis observed in the same database, suggesting the clinical relevance of improving care for patients with metabolic acidosis.

A French multicenter prospective study described the incidence of severe acidemia in five ICUs. Severe acidemia was defined as pH < 7.2, including respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, and mixed acidosis. This severe acidosis occurred in 8% (200/2550) of the patients within 24 h of ICU admission. After excluding patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is adjudicated to be an entity with a low risk of death, and patients with respiratory acidosis, ICU mortality of patients with metabolic or mixed severe acidosis was as high as 57% (89/155).

A recently published international observational study conducted in 18 ICUs in Australia, Japan, and Taiwan reported that 14% (1292/9437) of critically ill patients had moderate or severe metabolic acidosis. The median incidence of metabolic acidosis at a study ICU was 172.5 patients/year, suggesting that the management of metabolic acidosis is a relevant issue in patient care in the ICU.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^114LpaWz]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Acidemia" can be defined as the accumulation of protons in the plasma which results in a lower blood pH if secondary responses are overwhelmed. In critically ill patients, acidosis is often the result of a combination of single disorders occurring simultaneously that are commonly known collectively as "mixed acid-base disorders".

Although "severe acidemia" is not a universally accepted term, it usually indicates that plasma pH is lower than 7.20. Severe acidemia can be critical, especially when an extremely low pH develops quickly. Clinical manifestations of severe acidemia include cerebral edema, seizures, diaphragm dysfunction, decreased myocardial contractility, pulmonary vasoconstriction and systemic vasodilatation. Acidemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, and previous studies have described the incidence and mechanisms of acidosis occurring in the ICU. Surprisingly, however, these studies failed to focus specifically on severe acidemia. Furthermore, despite the fact that severe acidemia reflects a serious underlying disease that should be treated as soon as possible, the treatment of acidemia by itself with the administration of intravenous buffers remains controversial. Indeed, notwithstanding experts' opinions arguing against treatment with intravenous buffers except in dedicated situations (for example, massive digestive fluid loss during diarrhea or tubular acidosis), 86% of polled US nephrologists indicated that they would prescribe buffers to treat lactic acidosis in patients with a targeted pH above 7.20. Moreover, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests not treating lactic acidosis when the plasma pH level is above 7.15, but does not give any recommendations for cases where the plasma pH level is below this threshold. To date there have been only two small, prospective, randomized crossover studies assessing the impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment for lactic acidosis on hemodynamic, acid-base and electrolyte changes. Both studies included 24 patients and could not address any difference in terms of morbidity and mortality with regard to whether the patients had first been treated with sodium bicarbonate.

Therefore, we had two aims in our study. First, we sought to describe the incidence of severely metabolic or mixed acidemia patients admitted to the ICU. Second, we wanted to describe the outcomes of patients who had been treated at the onset of acidemia (within the first 24 hours of ICU admission) with intravenous sodium bicarbonate compared with those who had not. We hypothesized that severe acidosis within the 24 first hours after ICU admission is an infrequent phenomenon but that its correction rather than its initial severity is associated with prognosis.

### Metabolic acidosis and subclinical metabolic acidosis in CKD [^116qSfvZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is not uncommon in CKD and is linked with bone demineralization, muscle catabolism, and higher risks of CKD progression and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining serum total CO 2 at ≥ 22 mEq/L to help prevent these complications. Although a definitive trial testing whether correcting metabolic acidosis improves clinical outcomes has not been conducted, results from small, single-center studies support this notion. Furthermore, biologic plausibility supports the notion that a subset of patients with CKD have acid-mediated organ injury despite having a normal serum total CO 2 and might benefit from oral alkali before overt acidosis develops. Identifying these individuals with subclinical metabolic acidosis is challenging, but recent results suggest that urinary acid excretion measurements may be helpful. The dose of alkali to provide in this setting is unknown as well. The review discusses these topics and the prevalence and risk factors of metabolic acidosis, mechanisms of acid-mediated organ injury, results from interventional studies, and potential harms of alkali therapy in CKD.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, HCO₃⁻, and BE levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^1117GoBF]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Functional myocardial consequences of severe lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis has been known for over 50 years to impair cardiac function (Figure 2). In isolated rabbit hearts, Berger and colleagues elegantly demonstrated that lactic acidosis depressed ventricular elastance (LAM). In an in vivo model of severe lactic acidosis induced by hemorrhagic shock, inotropism assessed by a conductance catheter was also altered (LAM). However, human studies are lacking on this specific subject. A recent study on isolated human ventricular trabeculae showed that a mild metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis, reduced both contractility and beta-adrenergic response to isoproterenol (NOAM). Other experimental studies also confirm the metabolic/lactic acidosis-induced hyporesponsiveness to inotropic agents (NOAM). Despite sparse data, metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis, also appears to depress myocardial relaxation assessed in isolated heart or by echocardiography (NOAM).

The same mechanisms are involved in both cell types but with specific functional consequences. PFK, phospho-fructo-kinase; pHe, extracellular pH; pHi, intracellular pH.

Conversely, the literature is extensive on targeting of the pathophysiology of metabolic acidosis in cardiac arrhythmias, mainly in ischemia-reperfusion models. By increasing cellular calcium transient alternans, metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis, also promotes repolarization alternans susceptibility (NOAM). Indeed, repolarization wave alternans has been shown to be a prognostic marker for the occurrence of severe arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^111pXmqV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first international multicenter epidemiological study to describe the incidence and clinical management of early metabolic acidosis with early sodium bicarbonate in the ICU. Despite the seeming frequency of such clinical practice, the effect of sodium bicarbonate on blood pressure and other biochemical parameters have not been assessed adequately. This study, therefore, revealed a number of previously unknown aspects of both early metabolic acidosis and early sodium bicarbonate therapy that can be used to design double-blind, randomized controlled trials.

Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, due to the nature of the observational study design, the results of this analysis are prone to unmeasured confounding, and some assumptions required for the models used in the analysis. Second, we only treated early administration of sodium bicarbonate as being within 24 h of metabolic acidosis. This might increase the risk of failure to separate the two groups in assessing outcomes. Considering the evolution of metabolic acidosis in critical illness and the rapid/intense interventions provided in the ICU at the early phase of admission, we estimated 24 h would be sufficient for initial metabolic resuscitation. Furthermore, pH, BE, and HCO 3 levels between the two groups at 24 h were similar, suggesting that later administration of sodium bicarbonate, even if given, would not have had a significant impact on the outcome. Third, creatinine levels were not measured at 24 h after the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis in many patients; thus, we could not assess the progression of AKI stage over this period.

Fourth, as this is not a randomized trial, any adjusted association observed cannot be taken to indicate causation. Thus, all findings from this study should be taken as exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Fifth, the sample size was not calculated due to the lack of epidemiological data on current clinical practice, so that limited data were available in patients with vasopressor dependency or severe metabolic acidosis at the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis. In reference to the subgroup of severe metabolic acidosis, only 13% of the overall study population was included. The findings in such a small group are not sufficiently robust to be informative. Finally, the findings from the subgroups should be interpreted cautiously, as multiple testing was performed in the study, and the level of statistical significance was not corrected for multiplicity.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^112mUzxa]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key findings

Early metabolic acidosis was common in our study cohort, and early intravenous sodium bicarbonate was variably used in such patients across the study ICUs. Most patients who received sodium bicarbonate did so as a bolus dose. However, the prescription was not adjusted for body weight or the severity of metabolic acidosis. Patients who received sodium bicarbonate had a higher severity of critical illness and more severe metabolic acidosis. However, their biochemical parameters and PaO2/FiO2 ratios improved more rapidly than for patients who did not receive bicarbonate. Early sodium bicarbonate was not significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes overall. However, in patients with vasopressor dependency at diagnosis, sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher mean arterial pressures within six hours and a favorable, but not statistically significant, aOR for ICU mortality.

Relationship with prior studies

A recent systematic review reported that the biochemical and physiological effects of sodium bicarbonate had been poorly examined. Such a lack of data significantly limits our understanding of how much and how fast sodium bicarbonate should effectively be given to patients with metabolic acidosis. The current study confirms that the speed of administration, the mode (bolus or infusion or both), and the dose are highly variable and not related to any clinical or biochemical parameters. Moreover, despite the suggested rationale for administering sodium bicarbonate, there is a paucity of recent data exploring any effect on hemodynamic indices. Thus, our study is the first contemporary work to indicate that this therapy might increase mean arterial pressure early in patients on vasopressors at the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, a finding consistent with the putative effect on the cardiovascular system.

The effects of sodium bicarbonate on clinical outcomes have been rarely reported, except for a recent randomized clinical trial conducted in France. This trial reported that administration of sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidosis defined by pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO 2 ≤ 45 mm Hg, and bicarbonate concentration ≤ 20 mmol/L decreased the need for RRT by 16.7%. Moreover, in patients with AKI, sodium bicarbonate reduced mortality by 17.7%. The results suggest promising effects of sodium bicarbonate therapy for metabolic acidosis; however, the trial was not blinded, creating the possibility of performance bias and focused only on severe metabolic acidosis. Thus, the applicability and relevance of the findings are unclear for most patients in the ICU. The current study demonstrated that mild to moderate metabolic acidosis defined by pH < 7.3 and BE < -4 mEq/L were frequently observed in the ICU, and sodium bicarbonate was commonly used in such patients.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^11396iuA]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In our present study focused on severe metabolic and mixed acidemia, we report that, as opposed to the pH value upon ICU admission, the rapidity of pH recovery was associated with mortality (Table 3). Whether metabolic acidemia is an etiologic contributor to organ dysfunction or just a marker of illness has been debated. Recent findings demonstrate that severe metabolic acidemia is at least a contributory factor to organ dysfunction, favoring cardiac output decrease, arterial dilatation with hypotension, arrhythmia, altered oxygen delivery, respiratory muscle workload increase in spontaneously breathing patients, decreased ATP production and impairment of the immune response. Acidemia correction using the administration of a base, primarily in the form of sodium bicarbonate, has naturally become the mainstay of therapy, but its use continues to generate intense debate. In our study, we included patients with severe academia, and the prescription of sodium bicarbonate was heterogeneous between the participating ICUs and independent of the mechanism of academia, as shown by chloremia and corrected anion gap values upon ICU admission (Table 1). Lower PaCO 2, bicarbonatemia and base excess were associated with sodium bicarbonate prescription. Interestingly, our results are similar to those of a recent North American survey which reported that over 60% of intensivists and 80% of nephrologists would consider the use of buffer therapy for the treatment of lactic acidosis. To our knowledge, that survey and our present study are the only investigations that describe the pattern of sodium bicarbonate prescription for severe acidemia in critically ill patients.

When prescribing sodium bicarbonate in the critically ill, the potential side effects of severe acidemia must be balanced with complications related to sodium bicarbonate itself. Indeed, sodium bicarbonate may also be associated with complications such as a transient drop in blood pressure and cardiac output and a decrease in ionized calcium, thus sensitizing the heart to abnormal electrical activity and subsequent arrhythmia. Moreover, "paradoxical" intracellular acidosis may occur because generated CO 2 freely diffuses across the cell membrane. In addition, bicarbonate administration can be responsible for hypernatremia, volume overload, the release of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. In the present study, administration of sodium bicarbonate within the first 24 hours of acidemia was not associated with outcome (Tables 2 and 3).

In 2011, there is no human study that has reported any beneficial or detrimental effects of sodium bicarbonate administration when treating patients with severe mixed or metabolic acidemia. Therefore, attention should be first directed toward correcting the underlying basis for the acidemia.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^111xKRrH]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study reports for the first time that severe metabolic or mixed acidemia, defined by plasma pH lower than 7.20, occurs within the first 24 hours in the ICU in 6% of critically ill patients. In our study, severe acidemia was associated with a high mortality rate, and, rather than the initial pH value, the rapidity of acidemia correction appeared to be a determinant of outcome. Sodium bicarbonate therapy administration was very heterogeneous between participating ICUs. Further studies are necessary to better assess the role of buffers in this subgroup of critically ill patients.

### Identifying the components of acidosis in patients with severe plasmodium falciparum malaria using metabolomics [^116YJcu2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe malaria remains an important cause of premature death in malaria-endemic countries with 435 000 deaths ascribed to malaria infections in 2017, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. The vast burden of severe malaria is caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Early diagnosis and treatment with parenteral artesunate reduces mortality, but case fatality rates still range between 10% and 30% depending on the extent of vital organ dysfunction. Adjunctive therapies might close this case fatality gap if they target pivotal pathophysiological pathways, but this requires a further understanding of the pathophysiology of severe malaria. To date, the only adjunctive interventions shown to reduce severe malaria mortality are renal replacement therapies in acute renal failure. All others have failed.

Unrestrained asexual replication of P. falciparum during the blood stage of malaria infection leads to coma, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. The key pathogenic mechanism in severe falciparum malaria is sequestration of infected red blood cells in the microcirculation of vital organs. This is mediated by parasite-derived ligands, mainly Pf EMP1, and a range of host endothelial cell surface receptors, including CD36, EPCR, and ICAM1. Microvascular sequestration contributes to endothelial dysfunction, capillary and venular blockage, and subsequent organ failure. Histopathology studies have shown preferential sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the brain and intestines.

Metabolic acidosis is one of the strongest predictors of mortality in both pediatric and adult cases of severe malaria. Acidosis is harmful in itself as it dysregulates cellular metabolism. In severe malaria, acidosis is also a marker of tissue dysoxia, mainly caused by anaerobic production of L-lactate. Depending on the malaria parasite biomass, parasite-derived anaerobic metabolism of glucose to lactate also contributes but is thought to be a minor contributor to the total lactic acid load. L-lactate is the major known acid contributing to acidosis, but does not account fully for the degree of acidosis observed. The remaining unexplained acids in severe malaria are of independent prognostic importance, but they have not been well characterized and their source is not known.

In this study we used a metabolomics screening method to characterize the contributors to metabolic acidosis in patients with severe falciparum malaria and to identify their potential sources. Secondary objectives were to explore if acids found in the plasma of acidotic patients are produced by P. falciparum in vitro, and to investigate their clearance kinetics in patients with severe malaria.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as Na⁺ − (HCO₃⁻ + Cl⁻), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^1158Z3Vt]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is an acid–base imbalance that depletes the body's buffers, resulting in a decrease in serum bicarbonate (HCO3 −) concentration, which leads to a secondary reduction in carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) levels and a decrease in blood pH. Critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis, severe hypoxemia, and cardiogenic shock, are often susceptible to developing metabolic acidosis, which can cause hemodynamic instability, reduced myocardial contractility, impaired cellular oxygen supply and mitochondrial oxygen consumption, compromised catecholamine reactivity, and an increased risk of mortality. Moderate to severe metabolic acidosis affects around 8.4% of ICU patients, with ICU and hospital mortality rates of 17.3% and 21.5%, respectively.

To restore normal cardiovascular function and oxygen delivery to tissues, intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3, SB) solutions have been commonly administered over the past two decades, with the assumption that SB raises extracellular pH by delivering sodium ions and bicarbonate, consequently increasing extracellular strong ion difference (SID) with the sodium ion remaining in its monovalent form. Despite the commonality of this clinical practice, there is inadequate assessment of the effect of SB on biochemical parameters, with controversy remaining as to whether treating metabolic acidosis with SB results in improved clinical outcomes. Studies have found that treating adults and children with severe metabolic acidosis with SB does not improve mortality or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. However, SB treatment has demonstrated the potential to reduce organ damage and 28-day mortality rate in acute kidney injury patients with an Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score of 2 or 3, reducing the demand for renal replacement therapy and facilitating early weaning from mechanical ventilation and shortening ICU stays in hyperlactate sepsis patients. Although it does not improve hemodynamic parameters, some scholars have recommended SB infusion in patients with a pH of less than 7.15. Nevertheless, this treatment has not been proven to improve overall mortality.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^114C26LV]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and outcome of severe lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis is one of the most common biological concerns for intensivists. Nevertheless, clinical studies assessing the incidence and outcome of lactic acidosis are sparse and are mostly retrospective or prospective in nature with small sample sizes.

For this review, the most convincing prospective multi-center study, conducted in 2011 by Jung and colleagues, noted severe lactic acidosis in 6% of the studied population (200/2,550 patients); that is, with pH 7.09 ± 0.11 with high lactatemia values. Eighty-three percent of these patients were treated with vasopressors with a mortality rate of 57%. In this study, lactatemia and the swiftness of lactic acidosis correction were linked with survival. Interestingly, only 18% exhibited a slight coexistent respiratory acidosis at admission.

Clearly, a causal relationship between lactic acidosis and mortality has yet to be established. For example, in metformin-associated lactic acidosis, even with pH values most often around 7.0, the observed mortality rate was 25%. However, for the same pH values during shock, regardless of origin, no survival was reported. Consequently, severe lactic acidosis is much more of a precipitator than a direct causal factor of mortality. Lactic acidosis probably contributes to the decompensation of underlying comorbidities and, hence, to the mortality rate.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^112GAMQt]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This prospective, multiple-center study was conducted during a thirteen-month period in five ICUs. In accordance with French law, informed consent was not mandatory, given that this observational study did not modify diagnostic or therapeutic strategies. This study was approved by the Montpellier University Hospital Institutional Review Board and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology recommendations for reporting observational studies.

Definitions

"Severe acidemia" was defined as a pH below 7.20. Respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis and other mixed disorders were categorized using the classical method (namely, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation) with base excess and corrected anion gap (AG) (corrected AG = (measured AG + (40 g/dl - (albuminemia ÷ 10 g/dl))).

Therefore, we defined the following specific acidemia as follows. (1) "Severe metabolic acidemia" comprised pH less than 7.20, bicarbonatemia less than 22 mmol/L, base excess less than or equal to 5 mmol/L and expected partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) = bicarbonatemia × 1.5 + 8 ± 2 mmHg. (2) "Severe respiratory acidemia" was defined as pH less than 7.20, PaCO 2 greater than 45 mmHg and expected bicarbonatemia = (PaCO₂−40) ÷ 10 + 24). (3) "Severe mixed acidemia" was the classification for secondary response to the primary process outside the expected range.

Patients

All consecutive patients who experienced severe acidemia within the first 24 hours of their ICU admission were screened, and those who presented with either single metabolic acidemia or mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia were included. Patients admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis were excluded from the outcome analysis, as their mortality risk in the ICU is very low and may not represent the risk level among the whole population. Furthermore, because one of the aims of the present study was to describe the use of sodium bicarbonate to treat severe acidemia, patients admitted with a single severe respiratory acidemia were not analyzed in detail, because they were considered not to be candidates for that treatment. No guidelines, advice or documentation were given to the intensivists regarding acidemia, treatment or routine daily care.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^113BU5KQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Acidemia has been implicated in contributing to cardiovascular instability and decreased responsiveness to catecholamines and severe lactic acidosis is associated with increased mortality. This has led to the general belief and clinical practice that severe acidemia (usu- ally defined as a pH ≤ 7.10 to 7.20), should be corrected in the setting of lactic acidosis while awaiting definitive treatment of or response to treatment for the underlying cause. When surveyed, 86% of nephrologists and 67% of intensivists would initiate buffer treatment for patients with lactic acidosis, and 87% of nephrologists and 75% of intensivists would target a pH ≥ 7.2.

Despite widespread use, it is unknown whether treating extracellular acidosis with sodium bicarbonate affects clinical outcomes. Prior data have indicated that sodium bicarbonate administration does not improve hemodynamics in critically ill patients with lactic acidosis. Interestingly, there is no effect seen even in patients with severe acidemia (pH 6.90–7.20) and concurrent vasopressor use. Various studies, including the recent analysis of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, have found that sodium bicarbonate does not improve mortality in critically ill patients with severe acidemia (pH < 7.20) or in septic patients with metabolic acidosis, except in patients with concomitant acute kidney injury. Importantly, most publications evaluating the effect of supplemental bicarbonate therapy in patients with lactic acidosis have been observational or retrospective. The BICAR-ICU (Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy for Patients with Severe Metabolic Acidaemia in the Intensive Care Unit) trial is the only randomized trial published that randomized 394 adult patients with pH < 7.2, bicarbonate < 21 mmol/L, and arterial serum lactate 2 > mmol/L to receive supplemental bicarbonate therapy. The trial used a 4.2% sodium bicarbonate infusion to target a pH > 7.3 in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU — and did not include patients in the emergency department or those who had received a bicarbonate infusion in the 24 h prior to enrollment. The authors found no difference in 28-day mortality or presence of single-organ failure at day 7 (primary composite outcome) in patients randomized to receive bicarbonate infusion vs. the control group. However, the authors completed a prespecified subgroup analysis in which they found that patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2 did have a decrease in mortality at 28 days (63% vs. 46%; p = 0.017). The au- thors also found that renal replacement therapy need was decreased in those randomized to receive the bicarbon- ate infusion. Notable adverse events in the bicarbonate group included higher rates of hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

### Hemodynamic instability and abnormal vasopressor responsiveness in the setting of severe metabolic acidosis treated with adapted alkalinization and continuous renal replacement therapy in the emergency department [^114TJZfa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Whereas laboratory data and clinical experience suggest that metabolic acidosis deleteriously affects certain cardiovascular functions and may contribute to hemodynamic compromise, treatment of acidemia itself with alkalinization therapy, predominantly in the form of bolus dosing of intravenous sodium bicarbonate, has not been shown to improve hemodynamics or patient-oriented outcomes in clinical trials. Detailed examination of the biochemical effects of standard sodium bicarbonate administration reveals a possible explanation: ionized serum hypocalcemia, serum hypercarbia, and a paradoxical decrease in intracellular pH occur when bicarbonate is given alone and rapidly, without adjustment in minute ventilation or calcium supplementation. "Adapted alkalinization" treatment countering these side effects through hyperventilation, calcium supplementation, and slower sodium bicarbonate infusion has been studied in animals, but not yet described in humans.

Case Report

We report a case of successful treatment of severe hemodynamic instability and vasopressor hyporesponsiveness in the setting of profound metabolic acidosis with such an adapted alkalinization approach, plus short-term continuous renal replacement therapy, in a critically ill patient, all performed in the emergency department. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians encounter patients with severe metabolic acidosis, shock, and hemodynamic instability despite vasopressor agents. Adapted alkalinization therapy with sodium bicarbonate, hyperventilation, and calcium administration may promote hemodynamic stability in such patients and allow for successful treatment of the underlying disease process.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^113kQuf5]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, severe metabolic or mixed acidemia defined by a plasma pH level lower than 7.20 within the first 24 hours of ICU admission was observed in 6% of critically ill patients. Second, severe metabolic or mixed acidemia was associated with an ICU mortality rate of 57%. Third, as opposed to pH value, the rapidity of acidemia correction was associated with mortality. Fourth, sodium bicarbonate prescription within the first 24 hours of acidemia was heterogeneous, depending on the participating ICU, and was not associated with the patient's prognosis.

Several limitations of this study must be identified. First, we defined and classified severe acidemia on the basis of a pH value below 7.20, bicarbonate and base excess, and instead used the physiochemical classification developed by Stewart. We chose this strategy because of its widespread use and because it was the easiest way to screen patients. Moreover, our study could not demonstrate that acidemia per se rather than the underlying disease was the main independent predictive factor in patient outcome. Indeed, our study was an observational, multiple-center study which included all consecutive, heterogeneous patients according to their acid-base status and was not designed to specifically address the impact of sodium bicarbonate on outcome or to address the reasons for sodium bicarbonate prescription. We also could not assess whether very early sodium bicarbonate administration (within the first six hours of acidemia), a different load of buffer (high vs low dose) or administration modalities (slow vs rapid infusion and/or concentrated vs diluted bicarbonate) had any different effects on outcome. However, the present cohort may be used as a tool with which to design a future interventional, randomized study to examine the effects of buffers in severely acidotic critically ill patients.

### Metabolic acid-base disorders [^114xe442]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acid-base disturbances are frequently encountered in the emergency department, and many of these patients are critically ill. In the evaluation of patients with these maladies, it is important for the emergency clinician to determine the cause, which can usually be elicited from a thorough history and physical examination. There are several mnemonics that can be used to form an appropriate list of potential causes. Most of the time, the management of these patients requires no specific treatment of the acid-base status but, rather, requires treatment of the underlying disorder that is causing the acid-base disturbance.

### Ileal neobladder: an important cause of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis [^112pmYb7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis for a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is probably less well known than the differential diagnosis for an anion gap metabolic acidosis. One etiology of a non-anion gap acidosis is the consequence of ileal neobladder urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Case Report

We present a case of a patient with an ileal neobladder with a severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by a urinary tract infection and ureteroenterostomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Part of the ileal neobladder surgery includes ureteroenterostomy and predisposes patients to several clinically significant metabolic derangements, including a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These patients have an increased chronic acid load, bicarbonate deficit, and hypokalemia, which should be appreciated when resuscitating these patients.

### Severe metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia induced by the concomitant use of acetazolamide and aspirin in a patient with impaired renal function [^114YxZnj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acetazolamide is contraindicated in patients undergoing dialysis and should be used with caution in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we evaluate the effect of the concomitant use of aspirin by patient with CKD using acetazolamide.

Case Report

A 63-year-old man with CKD and multimorbidity presented at our Emergency Department (ED) with general weakness and dyspnea for 4 days. Work-up at the ED revealed severe metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia, which were initially considered signs of sepsis due to an elevated C-reactive protein level and pyuria. However, subsequent blood work indicated hyperchloremic acidosis with low lactate levels. After reviewing his medical history, we suspected the concomitant use of acetazolamide and aspirin as the etiology. Weakness, acidosis, and hyperammonemia were resolved after the patient discontinued acetazolamide. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Severe acidosis can be life threatening. Acetazolamide is known for causing mild metabolic acidosis, except in patients with severely impaired renal function. Here, we present a patient with mildly impaired renal function and concomitant aspirin use who developed severe metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia after being prescribed acetazolamide. Regardless of the severity of the disease, patients with CKD should avoid taking acetazolamide concomitantly with aspirin.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^113dN2gZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids, The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight- hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight - depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

### Current status of bicarbonate in CKD [^116Fu8XV]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis was one of the earliest complications to be recognized and explained pathologically in patients with CKD. Despite the accumulated evidence of deleterious effects of acidosis, treatment of acidosis has been tested very little, especially with respect to standard clinical outcomes. On the basis of fundamental research and small alkali supplementation trials, correcting metabolic acidosis has a strikingly broad array of potential benefits. This review summarizes the published evidence on the association between serum bicarbonate and clinical outcomes. We discuss the role of alkali supplementation in CKD as it relates to retarding kidney disease progression, improving metabolic and musculoskeletal complications.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^116kvqZe]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### The utility of recombinant factor VIIa as a last resort in trauma [^116ryhEE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa; Novoseven®, NiaStase®) is a hemostatic agent licensed for the management of hemorrhagic events and averting bleeding during invasive interventions in hemophilia A and B patients with FVIII and FIX inhibitors; acquired hemophilia; congenital deficiency of factor VII; and for the treatment of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. It has also been used off-label and studied in the treatment of coagulopathy in trauma patients.

The use of rFVIIa for non-approved indications has been formally evaluated in clinical trials (including two randomized controlled trials in trauma), and shown to be of no survival benefit; and with clear evidence of harm, particularly in the elderly. Despite the lack of supporting evidence, transfusion guidelines in either military or civilian settings currently suggest the use of rFVIIa as a last resort for the management of refractory coagulopathy in trauma. However, when the drug is used in these settings of massive hemorrhage, its efficacy as a pro-hemostatic agent may vary under different physiologic conditions, particularly in acidosis. In metabolic acidosis, when pH levels are under 7.2, the activity of rFVIIa is significantly stunted. In fact, an investigation conducted by Meng et al. indicated that the activity of rFVIIa decreased by over 90% at a pH level of 7.0. Furthermore, high expenditures are associated with off-label use of rFVIIa. Therefore, the use of rFVIIa as a last resort when there is severe metabolic acidosis during significant hemorrhage in trauma might be considered inappropriate.

We reviewed a cohort of massively transfused trauma patients to whom rFVIIa was administered to evaluate its utility as a last resort for the management of traumatic coagulopathy. The objective of this study was to identify critical degrees of acidosis and associated factors at which the use of rFVIIa might be considered of no utility.

### Assessing acid-base disorders [^113pxn1N]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Effective management of acid-base disorders depends on accurate diagnosis. Three distinct approaches are currently used in assessing acid-base disorders: the physiological approach, the base-excess approach, and the physicochemical approach. There are considerable differences among the three approaches. In this review, we first describe the conceptual framework of each approach, and comment on its attributes and drawbacks. We then highlight the application of each approach to patient care. We conclude with a brief synthesis and our recommendations for choosing an approach.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^115xA5Cg]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Common types of metabolic acidosis in the ICU

The causes of acute metabolic acidosis are diverse in critically ill patients. DKA, lactic acidosis, and hyperchloremic acidosis are responsible for most cases of severe metabolic acidosis cases due to a decreased SID.

DKA is a medical emergency in patients with diabetes mellitus as a result of insulin deficiency. The hepatic metabolism of fatty acids produces beta- hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, strong anions in the human body. As hyperglycemia induces osmotic diuresis, patients with DKA have a markedly reduced extracellular fluid volume. The available evidence was summarized in a review that revealed the paucity of sufficient data on clinical impact. To date, a comprehensive epidemiological study on DKA investigating its epidemiology and clinical outcomes is still lacking.

Lactate is a strong anion in the human body as more than 99% of lactate is ionized. Lactic acidosis is observed in cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock, severe heart failure, severe trauma, and sepsis, with high mortality rates, ranging from 30 to 88% depending on the definition used. The mortality of patients with lactic acidosis was reportedly the highest (56%) amongst patients with metabolic acidosis defined by a SBE (standard base excess) < -2 mEq/l.

Recently, hyperchloremic acidosis caused by intravenous fluid products has become widely known and is reported in 19% to 45% of patients in the ICU. Table 1 shows the electrolytes and SIDs of intravenous fluid products commonly used in the ICU. Theoretically, acidosis occurs when intravenous fluid products with a SID lower than that of the patient's plasma are administered. Balanced crystalloids, i.e. Ringer's acetate, Ringer's lactate, and Plasmalyte, contain acetate, lactate, or gluconate to replace chloride. Those strong anions do not contribute to SID as they are metabolized by the liver faster than renal chloride excretion.

### The relationship between anti-seizures medications and metabolic acidosis in craniotomy operations: is topiramate or zonisamide the cause of metabolic acidosis? [^1124GNka]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Metabolic acidosis, whether acute or chronic, can have significant clinical consequences. It has been linked to impaired brain metabolism and cerebral blood flow, which may be of particular concern in neurosurgical patients. Possible side effects of acute metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, delirium, and joint-muscle pain. Severe acute metabolic acidosis can lead to respiratory failure, reduced cardiac output, hypotension, arrhythmias, increased seizure activity, and coma.

Intraoperative and postoperative metabolic acidosis can be caused by topiramate and zonisamide. To stabilize intraoperative hemodynamics, it is important to inquire about the ASMs used in the preoperative evaluation in terms of mortality and morbidity. Prior to intracranial surgery, it is important to evaluate the interchangeability of these drugs with the guidance of an epileptologist and implement a treatment plan. It is also important to consider postoperative intensive care follow-up for patients using zonisamide and topiramate ASMs. It is evident that larger multicentre studies are required to gain further insight into this subject.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^114aKtKH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight – depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.13)]. A one-year, active-controlled study of pediatric patients treated with topiramate demonstrated that topiramate decreased lumbar spine bone mineral density and that this lumbar spine bone mineral density decrease was correlated (using change from baseline for lumbar spine Z score at final visit versus lowest post-treatment serum bicarbonate) with decreased serum bicarbonate, a reflection of metabolic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved. Long-term, open-label treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients with epilepsy are likely to have different growth rates than normal 1 to 24 month old pediatrics. Reductions in length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Topiramate treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients

Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during topiramate treatment is recommended. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing topiramate (using dose tapering). If the decision is made to continue patients on topiramate in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered.

### Treatment options for lactic acidosis and metabolic crisis in children with mitochondrial disease [^116Hw93a]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation route is a tightly regulated process, which is essential for aerobic cellular energy production. Disruption of this pathway may lead to severe neurometabolic disorders with onset in early childhood. A frequent finding in these patients is acute and chronic lactic acidemia, which is caused by increased conversion of pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Under stable clinical conditions, this process may remain well compensated and does not require specific therapy. However, especially in situations with altered energy demands, such as febrile infections or longer periods of fasting, children with mitochondrial disorders have a high risk of metabolic decompensation with exacerbation of hyperlactatemia and severe metabolic acidosis. Unfortunately, no controlled studies regarding therapy of this critical condition are available and clinical outcome is often unfavorable. Therefore, the aim of this review was to formulate expert-based suggestions for treatment of these patients, including dietary recommendations, buffering strategies and specific drug therapy. However, it is important to keep in mind that a specific therapy for the underlying metabolic cause in children with mitochondrial diseases is usually not available and symptomatic therapy especially of severe lactic acidosis has its ethical limitations.

### Do patients die with or from metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA)? Systematic review and meta-analysis of pH and lactate as predictors of mortality in MALA [^114fMnJo]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) may occur after acute metformin overdose, or from therapeutic use in patients with renal compromise. The mortality is high, historically 50% and more recently 25%. In many disease states, lactate concentration is strongly associated with mortality. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the utility of pH and lactate concentration in predicting mortality in patients with MALA.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from their inception to April 2019 for case reports, case series, prospective, and retrospective studies investigating mortality in patients with MALA. Cases and studies were reviewed by all authors and included if they reported data on pH, lactate, and outcome. Where necessary, authors of studies were contacted for patient-level data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for pH and lactate for predicting mortality in patients with MALA.

Results

Forty-four studies were included encompassing 170 cases of MALA with median age of 68.5 years old. Median pH and lactate were 7.02 mmol/L and 14.45 mmol/L, respectively. Overall mortality was 36.2% (95% CI 29.6–43.94). Neither lactate nor pH was a good predictor of mortality among patients with MALA. The area under the ROC curve for lactate and pH were 0.59 (0.51–0.68) and 0.43 (0.34–0.52), respectively.

Conclusion

Our review found higher mortality from MALA than seen in recent studies. This may be due to variation in standard medical practice both geographically and across the study interval, sample size, misidentification of MALA for another disease process and vice versa, confounding by selection and reporting biases, and treatment intensity (e.g., hemodialysis) influenced by degree of pH and lactate derangement. The ROC curves showed poor predictive power of either lactate or pH for mortality in MALA. With the exception of patients with acute metformin overdose, patients with MALA usually have coexisting precipitating illnesses such as sepsis or renal failure, though lactate from MALA is generally higher than would be considered survivable for those disease states on their own. It is possible that mortality is more related to that coexisting illness than MALA itself, and many patients die with MALA rather than from MALA. Additional work looking solely at MALA in healthy patients with acute metformin overdose may show a closer relationship between lactate, pH, and mortality.

### Very low and high predialysis serum bicarbonate levels are risk factors for mortality: what are the appropriate interventions? [^116BYQUM]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Adjustment of bath [HCO(3)(-)] to "normalize" predialysis serum [HCO(3)(-)] in patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis has been advocated to prevent the adverse effects of metabolic acidosis. However, when mortality risk has been evaluated in hemodialysis patients in relation to their nadir serum [HCO(3)(-)], an increase in risk is noted both with very low values (< 18 mmol/l) and very high values (> 27 mmol/l). If mortality risk is adjusted for comorbidity, age and effectiveness of dialysis, as well as for nutritional and inflammatory factors, very low predialysis values remain an independent risk factor, but the risk for high values virtually disappears. Patients with mild predialysis metabolic acidosis (serum [HCO(3)(-)] 18–23 mmol/l) have the lowest mortality risk. Metabolic acidosis has adverse effects on bone and muscle metabolism in patients receiving hemodialysis but, unless the acidosis is severe, these effects appear to be overshadowed by nutritional and inflammatory influences. This commentary reviews the principles of acid-base homeostasis in patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis and the studies that have addressed the adverse effects of metabolic acidosis in this patient population. It concludes that high predialysis serum [HCO(3)(-)] values are likely a marker for malnutrition and comorbidity, whereas very low values may be an indication for direct treatment. The latter should be addressed using strategies to increase predialysis values, whereas the former need attention directed to nutritional factors and comorbidity.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114qBo4m]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Not all metabolic acidoses are the same. In our cohort study, each type of metabolic acidosis had a different mortality associated with it. There was increased mortality associated with lactate and unidentified anions (SIG). Metabolic acidosis (both lactic and non-lactic) seems to be associated with high mortality and increased length of stay in hospital and in the ICU. Like that of lactate, monitoring of SIG seems warranted and this can be simplified by the use of an anion gap normalized to the patient's albumin and phosphate concentrations.

### Topiramate [^115YfctW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^115L5chX]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is a major complication of critical illness. However, its current epidemiology and its treatment with sodium bicarbonate given to correct metabolic acidosis in the ICU are poorly understood.

Method

This was an international retrospective observational study in 18 ICUs in Australia, Japan, and Taiwan. Adult patients were consecutively screened, and those with early metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3 and a Base Excess < -4 mEq/L, within 24-h of ICU admission) were included. Screening continued until 10 patients who received and 10 patients who did not receive sodium bicarbonate in the first 24 h (early bicarbonate therapy) were included at each site. The primary outcome was ICU mortality, and the association between sodium bicarbonate and the clinical outcomes were assessed using regression analysis with generalized linear mixed model.

Results

We screened 9437 patients. Of these, 1292 had early metabolic acidosis (14.0%). Early sodium bicarbonate was given to 18.0% (233/1292) of these patients. Dosing, physiological, and clinical outcome data were assessed in 360 patients. The median dose of sodium bicarbonate in the first 24 h was 110 mmol, which was not correlated with bodyweight or the severity of metabolic acidosis. Patients who received early sodium bicarbonate had higher APACHE III scores, lower pH, lower base excess, lower PaCO 2, and a higher lactate and received higher doses of vasopressors. After adjusting for confounders, the early administration of sodium bicarbonate was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.62) for ICU mortality. In patients with vasopressor dependency, early sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher mean arterial pressure at 6 h and an aOR of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.19) for ICU mortality.

Conclusions

Early metabolic acidosis is common in critically ill patients. Early sodium bicarbonate is administered by clinicians to more severely ill patients but without correction for weight or acidosis severity. Bicarbonate therapy in acidotic vasopressor-dependent patients may be beneficial and warrants further investigation.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^115v6kRS]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, a high proportion of patients with mild metabolic acidosis and a high proportion of patients with mild metabolic acidosis were given SB treatment. However, the clinical efficacy of SB treatment was found to potentially be associated with the patient's Cl − level, whether it was mild or moderate to severe. In patients with moderate to severe metabolic acidosis at lower Cl − level, the mortality was increased in SB treatment patients. It should be noted that the increased risk of death was not statistically significant, possibly due to the small sample size of this subgroup. A high proportion of patients with mild metabolic acidosis were given SB treatment, and we infer that this is because (1) in China, the guidelines for SB treatment are vague for patients with mild metabolic acidosis, and the concept that SB treatment is only appropriate for moderate to severe patients is not widely recognized; (2) when a patient experiences mild metabolic acidosis, but the condition may continue to deteriorate due to continuous loss of extracellular fluid, doctors may administer small doses of SB treatment as a preventative measure; and (3) the patient's base excess level is also a factor considered by doctors, as guided by SB China's medication package insert. For example, in cases of lactic acidemia, mild metabolic acidosis may occur, but if the patient's base excess is lower than the normal value, then the doctor may choose to give SB treatment.

In the overall sample analysis, our study did not find a significant correlation between SB treatment and the risk of death in patients with metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with the findings of other studies. This suggests that the patient samples used in this study are similar to those used in prior studies. Additionally, it supports the rationality of the results observed in this study; namely, the bidirectional effect offsets the increased and reduced risk of death brought about by SB treatment in the overall sample. Among the studies we reviewed, only Fujii et al. reported Cl − values in patients with metabolic acidosis and suggested that SB treatment had no association with mortality. The median value of Cl − in their study falls within the non-correlated interval identified in our study. In another retrospective study of SB treatment in patients with lactic acidosis, the results showed that the administration of sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher mortality rates. Interestingly, we found that the average AG value of patients included in that study was 19.76, which supports our finding that SB treatment increase mortality risk in patients with higher AG levels (corresponding to lower Cl − levels).

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^111ZtAjd]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

In this study, we sought describe the incidence and outcomes of severe metabolic or mixed acidemia in critically ill patients as well as the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy to treat these illnesses.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational, multiple-center study. Consecutive patients who presented with severe acidemia, defined herein as plasma pH below 7.20, were screened. The incidence, sodium bicarbonate prescription and outcomes of either metabolic or mixed severe acidemia were analyzed.

Results

Among 2, 550 critically ill patients, 200 (8%) presented with severe acidemia, and 155 (6% of the total admissions) met the inclusion criteria. Almost all patients needed mechanical ventilation and vasopressors during their ICU stay, and 20% of them required renal replacement therapy within the first 24 hours of their ICU stay. Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia was associated with a mortality rate of 57% in the ICU. Delay of acidemia recovery as opposed to initial pH value was associated with increased mortality in the ICU. The type of acidemia did not influence the decision to administer sodium bicarbonate.

Conclusions

The incidence of severe metabolic or mixed acidemia in critically ill patients was 6% in the present study, and it was associated with a 57% mortality rate in the ICU. In contradistinction with the initial acid-base parameters, the rapidity of acidemia recovery was an independent risk factor for mortality. Sodium bicarbonate prescription was very heterogeneous between ICUs. Further studies assessing specific treatments may be of interest in this population.

### Acid-base assessment of patients receiving hemodialysis. what are our management goals? [^11485S2x]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Acid-base assessment of patients receiving conventional hemodialysis (HD) has been based solely on predialysis serum [total CO 2], and treatment is currently driven by the KDOQI guideline from 2000. This guideline was directed solely at minimizing metabolic acidosis and thereby improving bone and muscle metabolism. In 2000, no data were available to assess the effects of acid-base status on morbidity and mortality. Since then, new data have emerged from several large cohort studies about the association between variations in predialysis serum [total CO 2], as well as blood pH, and morbidity and mortality risk. These studies have shown increased risk not only with very low predialysis [total CO 2] values, but also with predialysis alkaline pH and very high predialysis serum [total CO 2] values. At present, our major concern is not for patients with metabolic acidosis, but rather for the growing numbers of patients with metabolic alkalosis. This review discusses the controversies around assessing and treating acid-base status in HD patients, and recommends a practical approach based on the results of these recent studies. The new approach provides recommendations for patients both with very low and very high predialysis serum [total CO 2] values.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^112wKKwe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate.

Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis – e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2content is crucial – e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^114oiJJt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.13)]. A one-year, active-controlled study of pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX demonstrated that TOPAMAX decreased lumbar spine bone mineral density and that this lumbar spine bone mineral density decrease was correlated (using change from baseline for lumbar spine Z score at final visit versus lowest post-treatment serum bicarbonate) with decreased serum bicarbonate, a reflection of metabolic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved. Long-term, open-label treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients with epilepsy are likely to have different growth rates than normal 1 to 24 month old pediatrics. Reductions in length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. TOPAMAX treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients

Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during topiramate treatment is recommended. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing TOPAMAX (using dose tapering). If the decision is made to continue patients on TOPAMAX in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered.

### Approach to the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in CKD [^111dGcTu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic metabolic acidosis is not uncommon in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical practice guidelines suggest that clinicians administer alkali to maintain serum bicarbonate level at a minimum of 22 mEq/L to prevent the effects of acidosis on bone demineralization and protein catabolism. Small interventional studies support the notion that correcting acidosis slows CKD progression as well. Furthermore, alkaline therapy in persons with CKD and normal bicarbonate levels may also preserve kidney function. Observational studies suggest that targeting a serum bicarbonate level near 28 mEq/L may improve clinical outcomes above and beyond targeting a value ≥ 22 mEq/L, yet values > 26 mEq/L have been reported to be associated with incident heart failure and mortality in the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study. Furthermore, correcting acidosis may provoke vascular calcification. This teaching case discusses several uncertainties regarding the management of acidosis in CKD, such as when to initiate alkali treatment, potential side effects of alkali, and the optimum serum bicarbonate level based on current evidence in CKD. Suggestions regarding the maximum sodium bicarbonate dose to administer to patients with CKD to achieve the target serum bicarbonate concentration are offered.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials.

The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Neonatal morbidity associated with uterine rupture: what are the risk factors? [^111YhNzC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors associated with severe metabolic acidosis or death in a situation of uterine rupture.

Study Design

A retrospective study was performed with review of charts and electronic monitoring strips.

Results

Between November 1988 and November 2000, a total of 23 cases of complete uterine rupture were identified from among 2233 trials of labor after a previous low transverse cesarean delivery. Nine neonates (39.1%) had severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.0); among these, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was diagnosed in 3 neonates and another neonate died. Placental or fetal extrusion or both were associated with severe metabolic acidosis (P < .001) but not with the other factors (birth weight, induction of labor, use of oxytocin, use of epidural, and cervix dilatation). Two newborns with severe acidosis had impaired motor development even with an intervention time less than 18 minutes from the onset of prolonged deceleration to delivery.

Conclusion

When uterine rupture occurs, placental or fetal extrusion was the most important factor associated with severe metabolic acidosis. Prompt intervention did not always prevent severe metabolic acidosis and neonatal morbidity.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115TqLY2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The importance of normalizing serum HCO 3 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis is reflected in the leading treatment guidelines for CKD. The US-based National Kidney Foundation's KDOQI guidelines state that serum HCO 3 levels should be maintained at 22 mEq/l or greater and recommend the use of oral alkali supplements to attain this goal, whereas maintaining an awareness of the complications related to the use of such supplements. Similarly, guidelines from KDIGO suggest that in patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate less than 22 mEq/l treatment with oral bicarbonate supplementation can be given to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range unless contraindicated. Several large retrospective database analyses show that clinical outcomes for CKD patients with serum HCO 3 levels that are below normal (i.e. < 22 mEq/l) are significantly worse compared with patients with normal serum HCO 3 (i.e. 22–29 mEq/l). In addition, several single-center, prospective studies examining the effects of sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or dietary interventions have also elucidated the beneficial effects of treating chronic metabolic acidosis. In four of the seven key interventional studies discussed here, the provision of oral bicarbonate supplementation increased serum HCO 3 in enrolled CKD patients with baseline serum HCO 3 less than 22 mEq/l, often within 6 months of treatment initiation. Further, long-term treatment of metabolic acidosis (1–3 years) or treatment of hypertension-associated nephropathy patients with normal serum HCO 3 belying an increased acid load (5 years), showed direct benefit on reducing eGFR decline and improving kidney outcomes. Importantly, these improvements were accompanied by a reduction in the expression of urine biomarkers that reflect continued injury to kidneys exposed to chronic acid loading. A post hoc analysis of data from the Phisitkul et al. study showed that the provision of oral alkali to CKD patients with metabolic acidosis reduced the number of patients who experienced at least 40% decline in eGFR, an accepted surrogate endpoint of kidney disease progression to ESKD. Although 27.6% of control patients in this study showed at least 40% decline in eGFR over the 2-year treatment interval, no patients in the sodium citrate treatment group experienced eGFR declines of this magnitude (Table 3; Fig. 2). A limitation of the studies reviewed here is in the enrollment of patients who did not have severe comorbidities commonly found in CKD (e.g. edema, heart failure, poorly-controlled hypertension), as treatment with sodium-based oral alkali might aggravate fluid homeostasis in such patients. Based on these findings, it seems likely that nutritional and pharmacologic management of metabolic acidosis preserves kidney function, and larger scale, multicenter testing of this hypothesis is warranted.

### Metabolic acidosis in CKD: core curriculum 2019 [^111hy9Zi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Maintenance of normal acid-base homeostasis is one of the most important kidney functions. In chronic kidney disease, the capacity of the kidneys to excrete the daily acid load as ammonium and titratable acid is impaired, resulting in acid retention and metabolic acidosis. The prevalence of metabolic acidosis increases with declining glomerular filtration rate. Metabolic acidosis is associated with several clinically important complications, including chronic kidney disease progression, bone demineralization, skeletal muscle catabolism, and mortality. To mitigate these adverse consequences, clinical practice guidelines suggest treating metabolic acidosis with oral alkali in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, large clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of correcting metabolic acidosis with oral alkali in patients with chronic kidney disease have yet to be conducted. In this Core Curriculum article, established and emerging concepts regarding kidney acid-base regulation and the pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease are discussed.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^114RPu15]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^116dsiy3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.13)]. A one-year, active-controlled study of pediatric patients treated with topiramate demonstrated that topiramate decreased lumbar spine bone mineral density and that this lumbar spine bone mineral density decrease was correlated (using change from baseline for lumbar spine Z score at final visit versus lowest post-treatment serum bicarbonate) with decreased serum bicarbonate, a reflection of metabolic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved. Long-term, open-label treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients with epilepsy are likely to have different growth rates than normal 1 to 24 month old pediatric patients. Reductions in length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Topiramate treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients

Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during topiramate treatment is recommended. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing EPRONTIA (using dose tapering). If the decision is made to continue patients on EPRONTIA in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered.

### Timing of renal replacement therapy initiation by AKIN classification system [^111RzTh5]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Although the RIFLE criteria were developed and validated for AKI diagnosis and evaluation of severity, and not a parameter to guide RRT initiation, some observational studies have investigated whether initiating RRT in less severe renal injury (that is, RIFLE classification -0 or R) can be associated with a better survival rate. Although one study that analyzed AKI after major abdominal surgery demonstrated benefits, two others studies evaluating mainly patients with sepsis demonstrated similar outcomes with either early or late RRT. However, two problems can make the analysis of survival benefits in early dialysis difficult when using this definition: (1) patients at less severe AKI stages initiating RRT may have severe metabolic disorders (that is, metabolic acidosis, or hyperkalemia) in spite of limited renal injury, or even no AKI (RIFLE classification -0); (2) when using RIFLE/AKIN criteria, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) must have significant metabolic disorders to require RRT before classification with the maximum severity grade, as opposed to those with previous normal previous renal function. Moreover, no study has evaluated urinary output (UO), making the degree of AKI severity largely dependent on baseline serum creatinine (sCr), and there is no information on the timing of RRT initiation after diagnosis of severe AKI.

In the present study, a different approach using AKI severity classification was used. Our objective was to determine whether the timing of RRT earlier or later than 24 hours after classification as AKIN stage 3, is associated with hospital mortality in critically ill patients. Moreover, we excluded acute-on-chronic kidney injury (AKI-CKD) patients.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^1124dRg8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes

After adjusting for confounding factors and despite greater illness severity, the early administration of sodium bicarbonate was not significantly associated with ICU mortality (adjusted OR, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.44 to 1.62) or hospital mortality, vasopressor dose at 6 h or 24 h, or mean arterial pressure at 6 h or 24 h in the overall study population (Table 4).

Table 4
Association between administration of sodium bicarbonate and clinical outcomes

Delta mean arterial pressure per vasopressor dose = mean arterial pressure at 24 h/(vasopressor dose at 24 h + 1) – mean arterial pressure at 6 h/(vasopressor dose at 6 h + 1)

Subgroup analysis: Patients on vasopressors

Seventy-seven patients (42.8%) in the No SB group and 110 patients (61.1%) in the early SB group were on vasopressors at the time of the first demonstration of metabolic acidosis in ICU. Patients on vasopressors in the early SB group were younger and had a higher APACHE III score at ICU admission (Additional file 1: Suppl Table 1). These patients had lower pH, lower BE, lower SID, and higher lactate levels at the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis (Additional file 1: Suppl Table 2). They also received higher doses of vasopressors (Additional file 1: Suppl Table 3). The OR for ICU mortality among these patients was 0.52 (95%CI, 0.22 to 1.19) for those receiving sodium bicarbonate. Early sodium bicarbonate was also associated with higher mean arterial pressure and increased vasopressor responsiveness at 6 h in this subgroup (Table 4).

Subgroup analysis: Severe metabolic acidosis

Seven patients (3.9%) in the No SB group and 39 patients (21.7%) in the early SB group had severe metabolic acidosis (Additional file 1: Suppl Fig. 4). Patients with severe metabolic acidosis in the early SB group were less likely to have chronic kidney disease (Additional file 1: Suppl Table 4). They had lower BE or bicarbonate levels and higher PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio at the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis (Additional file 1: Suppl Table 5), although none of them reached statistical significance. They received higher doses of vasopressors (Additional file 1: Suppl Table 6). The aOR for ICU mortality was 0.86 (95%CI, 0.08 to 9.03) in those receiving sodium bicarbonate (Table 4).

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^111pRzMw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, severe systemic acidemia with a low blood pH in patients with CS likely reflects the inability of the respiratory system and endogenous buffering mechanisms to compensate for acid‐base derangements including lactic and nonlactic acidosis. Respiratory acidosis (hypercarbic respiratory failure) appeared to be a major contributor to low blood pH in our cohort, particularly for patients without elevated lactate levels. Potential contributors to hypercarbic respiratory failure in patients with CS may include increased physiologic dead space from chronic lung disease, acute lung injury, and pulmonary vascular disease in addition to compromised lung perfusion from CS itself. These noncardiovascular disease processes may confer an adverse prognosis in patients with CS, explaining in part the association between acidemia and mortality and highlighting the importance of inadequate compensation for metabolic acidosis attributable to respiratory failure as a determinant of poor prognosis in CS. Although lactate appeared to be a better overall predictor of mortality, patients with CS with a lower blood pH were more likely to die independent of their shock severity; this was less apparent in SCAI shock stage B, presumably caused by the presence of nonlactic metabolic and respiratory acidosis, which may be less harmful. The patients with the worst outcomes were those who simultaneously manifested both marked lactic acidosis and severe systemic acidemia, particularly in SCAI shock stage E. This suggests that the severity of lactic acidosis coupled with an impaired homeostatic response leading to severe systemic acidemia is particularly detrimental. Notably, the observed survival for patients in SCAI shock stage E appeared worse for those with low blood pH than those with high lactate levels. As we attempt to develop an evidence‐based definition of hemometabolic CS using laboratory variables, these data suggest that both high lactate levels and low blood pH should be incorporated into the definition to reflect both severe hypoperfusion and failing homeostatic mechanisms.

### Topiramate spinkle (Topiramate) [^113sE6HW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^115Tcgqg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate. Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis - e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total C02 content is crucial - e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^112naoeF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Metabolic acidosis arises from a fundamental disturbance of acid–base balance and is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Optimal cell, tissue and organ function requires the maintenance of hydrogen ion (H +) concentration within a physiologic range, which for serum is 35–45 nM (pH 7.46–7.35). The dynamic process leading to a net gain of H + in body fluids is called acidosis. When acidosis is due to a gain of 'fixed acid' H + (as opposed to the gain of 'volatile' H + because of accumulation of carbon dioxide gas, causing respiratory acidosis) and this H + gain decreases the metabolic component of the acid–base equilibrium, bicarbonate (HCO 3), it is called metabolic acidosis. If the amount or rate of added H + exceeds normal excretory capacity or if H + excretory capacity is reduced as in CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), metabolic acidosis becomes chronic. Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of metabolic acidosis is approximately 15–19% in CKD stage 3–5 patients, with metabolic acidosis affecting approximately 3 million patients with CKD in the United States.

### Clinical review: acid-base abnormalities in the intensive care unit – part II [^116qVSXn]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Acid-base abnormalities are common in the critically ill. The traditional classification of acid-base abnormalities and a modern physico-chemical method of categorizing them will be explored. Specific disorders relating to mortality prediction in the intensive care unit are examined in detail. Lactic acidosis, base excess, and a strong ion gap are highlighted as markers for increased risk of death.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: A 16-year-old girl who has no significant previous medical history presents to the emergency department with a 4-day history of nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea, leg cramps, abdominal pain, and headaches. She is finishing her menstrual period and arrives with a tampon in place, which she reports that she inserted yesterday. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 165 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, blood pressure 65/30 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 4 L/min of oxygen. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is toxic shock syndrome, which was later confirmed with a positive antibody test. The initial arterial blood gas values are: Such findings are suggestive of metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Further laboratory results are: The apparently normal AG is misleading. After correcting the AG for hypoalbuminemia, the adjusted AG is 17 mEq/L. Comments

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and venous blood gas values… [^114fZBmc]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis consists of elevated blood glucose, measurable ketone bodies and metabolic acidosis. Arterial blood gas determination is considered essential in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected diabetic ketoacidosis. Arterial blood sampling is painful, may be technically difficult and must be done in addition to venous sampling when testing for electrolytes and other values. The general correlation between arterial and venous pH measurements is well established, although this correlation has not been studied in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Brandenburg and Dire prospectively studied the relationship between arterial and venous blood gas values in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected diabetic ketoacidosis. Thirty-eight patients with 44 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis who presented to an emergency department with blood glucose levels greater than 250 mg per dL, urine dipstick results positive for ketones and clinical suspicion of diabetic ketoacidosis were included in the study. Arterial and venous samples were obtained as temporally close to each other as possible for blood gas analysis. The mean difference between arterial and venous pH values was 0.
03. Arterial and venous pH results, arterial and venous bicarbonate measurements and arterial bicarbonate and serum carbon dioxide results were also closely correlated. The authors conclude that the peripheral venous pH measurement is a valid and reliable substitute for arterial pH in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. A potential disadvantage of using venous determinations to determine the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis is that it may be more difficult to detect when mixed acid-base disturbances are present, since venous blood values may not reflect hypoxia in patients with respiratory depression.

In patients with suspected mixed acid–base disorders or evidence of respiratory depression or hypoxemia on pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis remains an appropriate means of testing for diabetic ketoacidosis. To ensure that venous sampling does not underestimate the degree of acidosis, a larger patient sample would be needed to examine more patients with severe acidosis. In addition, a study of final patient outcomes is necessary to determine whether the use of venous rather than arterial gas values affects outcome.

### A diagnostic approach to metabolic acidosis in children… [^113qqG9m]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate evaluation of extracellular fluid acid-base status used to be a rather formidable task. However, with the availability of automated clinical testing, this evaluation is now readily performed on any hospitalized child. The following discussion will be limited to various aspects of metabolic acidosis with a brief review of normal and abnormal physiology. A practical approach to the diagnostic work-up of an acidotic child will also be discussed. Several more detailed discussions of acid-base homeostatic mechanisms are available for the reader who is interested in pursuing this subject. 1–5 Acidosis, as used in this article, will refer to an abnormal increase in circulating acid with an accompanying decrease in the buffering capacity of the blood as manifest by a low serum bicarbonate level. Acidosis that ultimately exceeds the body's compensatory buffering mechanisms leads to an increase in extracellular fluid H + concentration such that pH is reduced below 7.
35.

This state is referred to as acidemia. NORMAL ACID-BASE PHYSIOLOGY The normal arterial blood pH is maintained at 7. 40 and ranges between
7. 35 and 7.
45. When this pH value drops below the normal range, acidemia is present. 6 Acidosis may or may not be accompanied by a fall in pH because the body can compensate for a drop in blood pH by combining some of the excess H + with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid and then CO 2, which is eliminated through the lungs by increased ventilation. Since this compensatory process is limited by the amount of bicarbonate available for the reaction with H +, only prolonged or severe acidosis may lead to acidemia. Comments.

### Metabolic acidosis-diabetic… [^114Kot3n]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC ACIDOSIS is a clinical state characterized by an excess of hydrogen ions, the source of which are acids other than carbonic. In diabetic acidosis, the source of the excessive hydrogen ion is ketoacids formed during the process of intermediary metabolism in the absence of insulin. The degree of acidemia, ie, lowering of arterial blood pH, will depend on the severity of the metabolic disturbance on the one hand and the efficiency of the compensating mechanisms on the other. Reductions in arterial blood acid-base parameters, pH, and Pco2, define the pattern of the metabolic acidosis. Reduction in Pco2 is a reflection of the compensatory hyperventilation occurring presumably in response to the lowered pH. If untreated, diabetic acidosis is fatal. History1 Stadelmann 2 in 1883 was the first to recognize that the symptom complex of diabetic coma was similar to the acid intoxication produced in rabbits by Walter. 3 NUTTALL FQ.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach… [^115sUhLS]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in patients who are critically ill. 1 A systematic approach to evaluating these disorders provides vital diagnostic information and guides timely treatment. 2–5 Acidosis leads to acidemia 6 and is typically due to one of three factors: accumulation of acids or loss of alkali; decreased renal excretion of acid; or accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body. Alkalosis is a process that leads to alkalemia and is primarily caused by excessive carbon dioxide exhalation, the accumulation of alkali, or loss of acid.
