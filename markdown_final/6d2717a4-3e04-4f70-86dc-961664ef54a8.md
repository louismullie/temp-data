## Question

low free testosterone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing low free testosterone in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the clinical syndrome and why free testosterone matters. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and thresholds, including when to measure free testosterone. Next, I will review the initial workup and confirmatory testing strategy. After that, I need to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism and identify reversible causes. Then, I will examine treatment indications, contraindications, and formulation selection. Finally, I should outline monitoring, stopping rules, and special populations, and close with a practical decision framework and key controversies, making sure I double-check areas where guidelines diverge and the evidence is limited.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: low free testosterone is clinically meaningful when it aligns with symptoms and signs of androgen deficiency, because only about 2–4% of circulating testosterone is free and biologically active, and SHBG alterations can leave total testosterone misleadingly normal while free testosterone is low, especially with aging, obesity, or diabetes [^113VMm27]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — symptoms alone are insufficient; I need to ensure biochemical confirmation on at least two separate fasting morning measurements before labeling someone as hypogonadal [^115q6JoB].

> I should confirm the diagnostic criteria and thresholds. The Endocrine Society recommends diagnosing hypogonadism only in men with consistent symptoms/signs and unequivocally low total and/or free testosterone on two separate fasting morning measurements, using reliable assays, and avoiding testing during acute illness or when medications suppress the axis [^115q6JoB] [^112oc1u4]. The AUA supports a practical total testosterone threshold around 300 ng/dL to support the diagnosis, but emphasizes that diagnosis requires both low testosterone and compatible symptoms/signs, and that free testosterone is most helpful when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^111bvkZt] [^111GBUFL]. Wait, let me verify the free testosterone piece — equilibrium dialysis or accurate calculation from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin is preferred; direct analog immunoassays for free testosterone are inaccurate and should be avoided [^115q6JoB] [^1138udww].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation and confirmatory testing. I need to check for symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased morning erections, fatigue, low energy, depressive symptoms, reduced muscle mass/strength, and anemia, while also screening for conditions that alter SHBG or suppress the HPT axis like obesity, diabetes, opioids, glucocorticoids, and chronic illness [^114Wyuxc] [^111EbdnM] [^1138udww]. I should double-check that two fasting morning total testosterone measurements are obtained on separate days, and if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, I should measure or calculate free testosterone using equilibrium dialysis or a validated equation rather than a direct immunoassay [^115q6JoB] [^1138udww].

> Hold on, I should verify how to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism. Measuring LH and FSH clarifies the level of dysfunction: elevated gonadotropins indicate primary testicular failure, whereas low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins suggest secondary hypogonadism due to hypothalamic or pituitary disease or functional suppression [^112oc1u4] [^114ATRq4]. I need to ensure I also look for reversible causes of secondary hypogonadism such as hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, sleep apnea, malnutrition, excessive alcohol, and medications like opioids or glucocorticoids, and I should image the sella if testosterone is very low, prolactin is elevated, LH is undetectable, or there are mass effect symptoms [^114ATRq4] [^111EbdnM].

> Now, I will examine treatment indications and contraindications. I should confirm that testosterone therapy is indicated for men with symptomatic hypogonadism and unequivocally low testosterone after shared decision-making that weighs benefits, risks, uncertainties, and patient goals, with the aim of restoring testosterone into the mid-normal range for healthy young men [^115q6JoB] [^111BQEis]. But wait, I must not overlook contraindications: active prostate or breast cancer, unevaluated prostate nodules or markedly elevated PSA, hematocrit above 54%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or stroke, and thrombophilia are reasons to defer or avoid therapy, and fertility plans require special caution because exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis [^11798Y7c] [^1131YaVb].

> Let me consider formulation selection and practicalities. Options include transdermal gels or patches, intramuscular injections, and subcutaneous pellets. Choice should reflect patient preference, pharmacokinetics, cost, and tolerability, with counseling on application sites, hygiene, and transfer risk for gels, and on injection intervals and peak/trough patterns for injectables [^111BQEis] [^1131YaVb]. I should confirm that benefits on sexual function may emerge within 3–6 months, whereas musculoskeletal and hematologic benefits may take 6–12 months, and that dose adjustments should target mid-normal testosterone while avoiding supraphysiologic levels [^115dU9ax] [^116F2R6D].

> Next, I should review monitoring and stopping rules. I need to ensure a standardized schedule: assess symptoms, adverse effects, and adherence at each visit. Check serum testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA at 3–6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter, with earlier PSA/DRE in men at higher prostate cancer risk. And monitor for erythrocytosis, acne, gynecomastia, and mood changes [^116F2R6D] [^115frEKF]. Hold on, I should verify the stopping criteria — if testosterone normalizes but symptoms do not improve by 3–6 months, discontinue and reconsider the diagnosis. Continuation may be reasonable if there is documented improvement in anemia or bone density despite lack of other symptom benefit, but this should be exceptional and goal-directed [^115Dqobn] [^115dU9ax].

> I will now examine special populations and controversies. In men ≥ 65 years with age-related low testosterone, I should avoid routine testosterone therapy and consider only an individualized trial after explicit discussion of uncertain long-term cardiovascular and prostate risks, modest expected benefits, and the need for close monitoring [^116RXjbF] [^116rDu5B]. For obesity-related functional hypogonadism, lifestyle modification can raise testosterone by 10–30% and may obviate therapy; a therapeutic trial is reasonable only after 6–12 months of weight loss and comorbidity optimization if symptoms persist and testosterone remains low [^113BAEvt] [^111EbdnM]. For men who desire fertility, I should avoid testosterone and instead use hCG with or without FSH or a SERM to preserve spermatogenesis while addressing the underlying cause [^116RNQSy] [^1131YaVb].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm symptoms and exclude acute illness or suppressive drugs. Second, obtain two fasting morning total testosterone measurements. Third, if borderline or SHBG altered, measure or calculate free testosterone accurately. Fourth, classify primary versus secondary with LH/FSH and evaluate reversible causes. Fifth, if symptomatic with unequivocally low testosterone and no contraindications, offer shared decision-making and a time-limited therapeutic trial with predefined goals. Sixth, monitor rigorously and stop if goals are not met or adverse effects occur [^115q6JoB] [^111bvkZt] [^116F2R6D]. I should double-check that this approach aligns with major guidelines and avoids overtreatment of nonspecific symptoms or borderline biochemistry [^113Mfw2L] [^112oc1u4].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and evidence gaps. The cardiovascular safety of long-term testosterone therapy remains unsettled, with observational signals and trial limitations. Prostate cancer risk appears not increased overall, but long-term oncologic outcomes are uncertain. And the clinical utility of free testosterone versus total testosterone remains debated, reinforcing the need for careful patient selection, accurate assays, and conservative monitoring [^1171mA8L] [^116p4z6a] [^117GN7s7]. Hold on, I should verify that my plan emphasizes stopping therapy when benefits are not realized and reassessing alternative diagnoses, which is a consistent theme across high-quality guidance [^115Dqobn] [^111vK56k].

Low free testosterone is defined as **free testosterone < 65 pg/mL** (225 pmol/L) in adult men, and diagnosis requires **two separate morning measurements** plus compatible symptoms [^115q6JoB] [^114G25rR]. It is most often due to **aging, obesity, diabetes, or SHBG abnormalities**, and can cause sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, and reduced bone density [^117GZtpu] [^113VMm27]. Management includes treating underlying causes, lifestyle changes, and testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with confirmed low levels, with monitoring for hematocrit, PSA, and cardiovascular risks [^114W9Cp4] [^116F2R6D].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

- **Definition**: Low free testosterone is typically defined as < 65 pg/mL (225 pmol/L) in adult men [^notfound].
- **Diagnosis**: Requires two separate morning measurements plus compatible symptoms/signs of androgen deficiency [^115q6JoB] [^113Mfw2L].
- **Measurement**: Use equilibrium dialysis or calculated free testosterone; avoid direct analog immunoassays due to inaccuracy [^115q6JoB] [^1138udww].

---

## Physiological role of free testosterone

Free testosterone is the **biologically active fraction** that binds androgen receptors and mediates anabolic, sexual, and metabolic effects [^113VMm27]. It supports sexual function, muscle mass/strength, bone density, mood, and cognition [^115P5up1].

---

## Causes of low free testosterone

Low free testosterone can result from **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Primary testicular failure | - Klinefelter syndrome <br/> - Testicular trauma <br/> - Radiation <br/> - Chemotherapy [^113Mfw2L] |
| Secondary hypogonadism | - Pituitary tumors <br/> - Hypothalamic disorders <br/> - Hyperprolactinemia <br/> - Chronic opioid use [^115q6JoB] |
| Functional hypogonadism | - Obesity <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Metabolic syndrome <br/> - Chronic illness [^113dj8vX] |
| SHBG abnormalities | - Aging <br/> - Liver disease <br/> - Thyroid disorders <br/> - Medications (e.g. anticonvulsants) [^1138udww] |

---

## Clinical symptoms and signs

Low free testosterone presents with **sexual and non-sexual symptoms**:

- **Sexual symptoms**: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced morning erections, infertility [^114Wyuxc].
- **Non-sexual symptoms**: Fatigue, decreased energy, depression, reduced muscle mass/strength, osteoporosis, anemia [^1171mA8L].
- **Specific signs**: Small testes, gynecomastia, decreased body hair, eunuchoidal proportions [^114Wyuxc].

---

## Health risks and complications

Untreated low free testosterone is associated with:

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Persistent low libido and erectile dysfunction [^114G25rR].
- **Muscle and bone loss**: Sarcopenia and osteoporosis [^114Sw16y].
- **Metabolic effects**: Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^116mBpod].
- **Psychological effects**: Depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life [^114Hq3p8].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Initial test**: Morning total testosterone; if borderline or SHBG altered, measure free testosterone [^115q6JoB] [^114mNUJU].
- **Confirmatory testing**: Repeat morning total/free testosterone on a separate day [^113Mfw2L].
- **Additional tests**: LH, FSH, prolactin, SHBG, hematocrit, PSA, bone density (DEXA) as indicated [^114ATRq4].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on cause, severity, and patient goals:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, exercise, dietary changes, management of comorbidities [^111EbdnM].
- **Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)**: Indicated for symptomatic men with confirmed low testosterone and no contraindications [^11798Y7c].
- **Alternative therapies**: Clomiphene citrate for secondary hypogonadism, especially if fertility is desired [^111BQEis].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure efficacy and safety:

- **Clinical monitoring**: Symptoms, adverse effects, compliance [^116F2R6D].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Testosterone, hematocrit, PSA at 3–6 months, then annually [^112aiqAm].
- **Discontinuation**: Stop therapy if no symptom improvement despite normalized testosterone [^115Dqobn].

---

## Controversies and uncertainties

Controversies include the **cardiovascular risk** of TRT, which remains debated with conflicting evidence [^112WY3H2], and the **prostate cancer risk**, which is likewise uncertain and requires individualized risk assessment [^116p4z6a]. Functional hypogonadism is common in older men, and treatment decisions should be individualized [^1136CcxY] [^113dj8vX].

---

Low free testosterone is a clinically significant condition requiring **careful diagnosis and management**. Accurate measurement, identification of underlying causes, and individualized treatment plans are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize risks.

### Clinical review: why is androgen replacement in males controversial? [^11757dfP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels are recognized frequently in clinical practice. Recent population-based epidemiological studies indicate that low testosterone levels in men are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The clinician must be able to counsel patients to help them determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate for them.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors have conducted a literature search in PubMed, and we have reviewed references in the multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have been published on this topic.

Evidence Synthesis

We have attempted to provide the reader with an appreciation of the evidence that can be used to support the diagnosis of androgen deficiency, the efficacy of treatment, the potential risks of treatment, the therapeutic options, and the recommendations for monitoring treatment.

Conclusions

We think that published clinical experience justifies testosterone replacement therapy in males who have not initiated puberty by age 14 and in males with low testosterone levels due to classical diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The benefit:risk ratio is less certain in older men and in those with chronic diseases associated with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat in this setting is much more controversial because there are few large clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy and no large clinical trials that have determined potential risks of increasing the incidence of clinical prostate cancers or cardiovascular events. We provide a critical review of the evidence that supports treatment and potential risks and ways to reduce the risks if the physician and patient elect testosterone replacement.

### Clinical practice update on testosterone therapy for male hypogonadism: contrasting perspectives to optimize care [^111WJUkJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

US Endocrine Society (ES) published a clinical practice guideline on testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism, and Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) a position statement on management of male hypogonadism. Both emphasize the importance of diagnosing men who are androgen deficient due to organic (classical or pathological) hypogonadism arising from disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary or testes, who assuredly benefit from testosterone therapy. Both recognize that men with an intact gonadal axis may have low testosterone concentrations, for instance older men or men with obesity or other medical comorbidities. ES guidelines classify such symptomatic men as having organic (advanced age) or functional (obesity, medical comorbidities) hypogonadism, giving an option for testosterone therapy as a shared decision between clinicians and individual patients. ESA did not recommend testosterone therapy in these men. ES offers a reference range for total testosterone established in young men, while ESA cites age-standardized reference ranges. ES recommends using free testosterone as well as total testosterone to identify men with hypogonadism in conditions where sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is altered, or when total testosterone is borderline. ESA recommends confirmatory biochemical testing with total testosterone, recognizing that this may be lower than expected if SHBG concentrations are low. Both emphasize the importance of identifying pre-existing prostate and cardiovascular disease prior to initiating testosterone therapy, with ES providing specific recommendations for PSA measurement, deferring testosterone therapy after major cardiovascular events and indications for pituitary imaging. These contrasting approaches highlight gaps in the evidence base where individualized patient management is required.

### Commentary: who is a candidate for testosterone therapy? A synthesis of international expert opinions [^115ydEZp]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite increasing use of testosterone therapy (TTh) for men with testosterone deficiency (TD), there remains uncertainty determining who is a candidate for treatment.

Aim

The aim if this study was to report the opinions of international experts on TTh, as initially presented at the meeting of the World Meeting on Sexual Medicine in Chicago, United States in August 2012.

Methods

Expert responses to questions regarding the diagnosis of TD based on their own clinical and research experience.

Results

All experts emphasized the primacy of symptoms for the diagnosis of TD. Total testosterone (T) thresholds used to identify TD ranged from 350ng/dL to 400ng/dL (12–14nmol/L); however, experts emphasized the diagnostic limitations of this test. Free T was obtained by all, with some valuing this test more than total T for clinical decision making. Only one expert routinely used a screening questionnaire. None used age-adjusted values. Bioavailable T and the free androgen index were not used. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone-binding globulin levels were routinely obtained at evaluation. Additional supportive evidence for TD diagnosis included small testicular volume, high androgen receptor CAG repeats, elevated LH, and presence of diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Two T tests were generally obtained but not always required. Some experts did not require morning testing in men 50 years and older. All monitored prostate-specific antigen and hematocrit after initiation of TTh. All but one expert would consider a trial of TTh to a symptomatic man with total T within the normal range. Recent studies suggesting increased cardiovascular risk with T therapy were not found to be credible.

Conclusions

Determining who is a candidate for TTh requires clinical assessment based on symptoms and signs, with confirmatory laboratory evaluation. These expert opinions differed from some published guidelines by the emphasis on symptoms as paramount, recognition of the limitations of total T as a diagnostic test, and the potential utility of a therapeutic trial in symptomatic cases with normal total T concentrations.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

Endocrine Society guideline — serum total testosterone (TT) definition, binding, and clinical implications: Serum TT concentration represents the sum of unbound and protein-bound T in circulation, most T is bound to SHBG and albumin and only 2.0% to 4.0% is unbound or free; "bioavailable T" refers to unbound T plus albumin-bound T, and the free hormone hypothesis states that biologic activity depends on free hormone concentrations. Analysis of European Male Ageing Study data showed that men with low FT concentrations had sexual and physical symptoms consistent with T deficiency regardless of their TT, whereas men with low TT but normal FT were more obese and did not have associated sexual or physical symptoms.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1139NQV1]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

There has been a marked increase in testosterone prescriptions in the past decade resulting in a growing need to give practicing clinicians proper guidance on the evaluation and management of the testosterone deficient patient.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review utilized research from the Mayo Clinic Evidence Based Practice Center and additional supplementation by the authors. Evidence-based statements were based on body of evidence strength Grade A, B, or C and were designated as Strong, Moderate, and Conditional Recommendations with additional statements presented in the form of Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/).

Results

This guideline was developed by a multi-disciplinary panel to inform clinicians on the proper assessment of patients with testosterone deficiency and the safe and effective management of men on testosterone therapy. Additional statements were developed to guide the clinician on the appropriate care of patients who are at risk for or have cardiovascular disease or prostate cancer as well as patients who are interested in preserving fertility.

Conclusions

The care of testosterone deficient patients should focus on accurate assessment of total testosterone levels, symptoms, and signs as well as proper on-treatment monitoring to ensure therapeutic testosterone levels are reached and symptoms are ameliorated. Future longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials of significant duration in this space will improve diagnostic techniques and treatment of men with testosterone deficiency as well as provide more data on the adverse events that may be associated with testosterone therapy.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^116PrpL2]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — clinical diagnosis criteria and symptom considerations — The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs.(Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) Total testosterone < 300 ng/dL alone does not define testosterone deficiency, and clinicians should refrain from measuring testosterone levels in patients who are not experiencing symptoms or do not have signs related to low testosterone, or do not have any comorbid conditions that are associated with low testosterone. A meta-analysis of 4 observational studies involving 4,426 men showed that men with low testosterone levels had a higher prevalence of fatigue than men with normal testosterone levels (OR = 1.46; CI 1.16, 1.98), and those that used < 350ng/dL as a cut-off to define low testosterone did not detect a significant association.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115dQsiH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — diagnosis, testing, and initial treatment for male hypogonadism states that we recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test, and we recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone–binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula, and in men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism.

### Low free testosterone concentration as a potentially treatable cause of depressive symptoms in older men… [^117R2fro]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

CI, 0. 91–2. 63) and
2. 71 times more likely to have total and free testosterone concentrations, respectively, in the lowest quintile. Conclusions A free testosterone concentration in the lowest quintile is associated with a higher prevalence of depression, and this association cannot be adequately explained by physical comorbidity. A randomized controlled trial is required to determine whether the link between low free testosterone level and depression is causal because older men with depression may benefit from systematic screening of free testosterone concentration and testosterone supplementation. There was a weak inverse correlation between free testosterone concentration and GDS-15 score and the weighted Charlson index of comorbidity. Free testosterone concentration was directly correlated with PCS scores.

Men in the lowest quintile of free testosterone had increased odds of depression in relation to men in the highest quintile. This association remained significant after the analysis was adjusted for confounding for age, educational level, smoking, BMI, presence of cognitive impairment, current or previous treatment for depression, Charlson index, and PCS score. Finally, we excluded 548 men with Mini-Mental State Examination scores less than 24 to minimize possible confounding due to the overlap between cognitive impairment and depression. Logistic regression confirmed that the lowest quintile of total testosterone was associated with depression, as was the lowest quintile of free testosterone. The results of this study show that total and free testosterone concentrations are only weakly associated with depressive symptoms.

In conclusion, we found that men with a free testosterone concentration lower than 6 ng/dL have a substantially higher prevalence of depression and that this association cannot be adequately explained by sociodemographic factors or concurrent physical comorbidity. Alternatively, these results could be interpreted as indicating that free testosterone concentrations greater than 10 ng/dL reduce the risk of depression.

Regarding specific circumstances for osteoporosis in men, more specifically with respect to patients with hypogonadism, testosterone therapy, ES 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating testosterone therapy in patients at borderline high risk for fracture having serum testosterone levels < 200 ng/dL on > 1 determination if accompanied by signs or symptoms of androgen deficiency (such as low libido, unexplained chronic fatigue, loss of body hair, and hot flushes) or organic hypogonadism (such as due to hypothalamic, pituitary, or specific testicular disorder). Discontinue testosterone therapy and consider switching to another treatment if testosterone therapy does not alleviate symptoms of androgen deficiency after 3–6 months. Consider initiating testosterone therapy in patients at high risk for fracture with testosterone levels < 200 ng/dL lacking standard indications for testosterone therapy but having contraindications to approved pharmacological agents for osteoporosis.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns. Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by current evidence, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

Final Comments About the Initiation of Testosterone Therapy in Men ≥ 50

The decision to treat medical conditions always involves an analysis of the benefits and risks; that analysis is particularly important in the decision to initiate testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years. Although testosterone replacement for men with organic hypogonadism is uncontroversial irrespective of age, men ≥ 50 years old with nonspecific symptoms, reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations, normal serum gonadotropins, and no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease often have improved health and well-being and normalization of serum testosterone concentrations with optimization of weight and comorbidities and stopping or reducing the dosage of medications that affect the HPT axis. In addition, therapies other than testosterone should be considered for symptoms and signs that might be attributed to hypogonadism: PDE5-inhibitors (for erectile dysfunction); treatment of sleep apnea, depression, obesity, and diabetes mellitus with proven effective therapies; and medications that reduce fracture (for osteoporosis). It is reasonable to add testosterone treatment to men ≥ 50 years with persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone (measured fasted in the morning when the man is at baseline health) and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations despite lifestyle measures for 6–12 months to lose weight (if BMI > 25 kg/m²) and optimization of management of comorbidities. This decision must be individualized and is not algorithmic, and there should be no contraindications to testosterone therapy. Men ≥ 50 years with symptoms of hypogonadism and primary hypogonadism (low serum testosterone and elevated serum gonadotropin concentrations) should generally be offered testosterone replacement therapy. If testosterone therapy is being considered, we highlight the importance of discussing the unknown effects of testosterone therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer with the patient and documenting that discussion. It is also vital to determine the patient's expectations and goals and to provide information to the patient about the most likely benefits of testosterone therapy and the typical course for these benefits. The clinician and patient should identify patient-specific treatment goals with a timeline for assessment of effectiveness and consideration of whether to continue therapy. The therapeutic plan should include monitoring to ensure serum testosterone concentrations are above the lower limit of normal and to minimize and manage adverse effects including erythrocytosis. If a trial of testosterone therapy of sufficient duration does not meet patient-specific treatment goals in men with low serum testosterone and without identifiable pathology of the HPT axis, testosterone treatment should be stopped.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115QEYwb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit had increased 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. He had lost another 4.3 kg (and now weighs 93.0 kg) with diet and exercise. He had lost a total of 6.3 kg (∼6% of body weight since his initial evaluation). At 12 months of follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L), and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after discontinuation of testosterone therapy. He enquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

Thus, in addition to providing general health benefits, there is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30% that might normalize testosterone concentrations in our patient and might improve many of his symptoms that overlap with hypogonadism. However, the data stem mostly from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions, and these studies had small numbers of participants that were typically younger (30–50 years of age), relatively short follow-up (< 1–2 years), and variable methodologies in the assessment of serum testosterone concentrations. Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older, frailer men. The degree to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for the improvement seen with androgen deficiency-like features (eg, erectile function, physical performance) is not certain. Whether concomitant testosterone treatment improves the efficacy of lifestyle interventions requires further study, but preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the single most important intervention for our patient and many older men with a high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration might be lifestyle changes (increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet) to reduce weight.

### Testosterone deficiency… [^1149xne2]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Testosterone is important for muscle mass, bone strength, hair growth, and sexual function. Low testosterone can cause symptoms such as low energy, poor concentration, depression, low libido, and erectile dysfunction. Testosterone deficiency is the condition of having low testosterone and 1 or more of these symptoms. Testosterone deficiency is common, affecting approximately 7% of men in their 50s, and increases with age. In some cases, the testes are not able to make enough testosterone. In other cases, the brain is not making enough luteinizing hormone, which signals the testes to make testosterone. Both can result from infection, trauma, exposure to toxins such as chemotherapy, or genetic conditions. Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, obesity, anemia, and HIV infection are also linked to low testosterone. Certain medications such as opioids, corticosteroids, and anabolic steroids can lead to low testosterone.

When testosterone deficiency is suspected, a man should undergo a medical history and physical examination by either his primary care physician or a specialist. Blood tests to check the morning total testosterone level are typically performed twice to confirm the diagnosis. Other blood or imaging tests may also be necessary. The standard treatment for testosterone deficiency is testosterone therapy, which comes in formulations such as topical gels, self-injection, and pellets under the skin. These medications should be avoided in men interested in having children, as they can decrease sperm production and fertility. Men taking TT should be seen regularly by their physician. Side effects of TT can include changes in mood, headache, hair growth, male pattern baldness, breast tenderness, acne, and decreased testicular size. Regular blood tests are necessary to check testosterone levels and blood counts, which can become abnormally high.

There is no strong evidence that TT increases risk of blood clots. The relationship between testosterone and cardiovascular disease is complex. Early studies found that TT may be linked to stroke and heart attack, which led to a warning from the US Food and Drug Administration. However, additional studies showed no link between TT and these events, so it is not known if TT increases risk of stroke or heart attack. Men with low testosterone are at increased risk of CVD. It is not known whether this risk is due to low testosterone or because men with low testosterone are more likely to have other medical conditions linked to CVD, such as high blood pressure, obesity, and high cholesterol. Further research is needed on the risks and benefits of TT for cardiovascular health.

### Hypogonadism and androgen replacement therapy in elderly men [^113r6Dfe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The decrease in testosterone levels with age is both central (pituitary) and peripheral (testicular) origin. Because serum levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin increase with aging, the decrease in free testosterone is of even greater magnitude. Recent long-term studies of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal elderly men have shown beneficial effects on bone density, body composition, and muscle strength without any substantial adverse effects on lipids and the prostate. Total testosterone level is the test of choice for initial screening of elderly men who present with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. If the level is below 300 ng/dL, replacement therapy should be initiated. If the level is normal in a symptomatic patient, free or bioavailable testosterone should be determined. The pros and cons of testosterone therapy should be discussed in depth with every patient, and decisions should be made on an individual basis. This review summarizes the trials of testosterone replacement therapy in elderly men and outlines a diagnostic approach to these patients.

### Testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men [^1131YaVb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

All approved testosterone replacement methods, when used according to recommendations, can restore normal serum testosterone concentrations, and relieve symptoms in most hypogonadal men. Selection of the method depends on the patient's preference with advice from the physician. Dose adjustment is possible with most delivery methods but may not be necessary in all hypogonadal men. The use of hepatotoxic androgens must be avoided. Testosterone treatment induces reversible suppression of spermatogenesis; if fertility is desired in the near future, human chronic gonadotropin, selective estrogen receptor modulator, estrogen antagonist, or an aromatase inhibitor that stimulates endogenous testosterone production may be used.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypogonadism [^1124vnU2]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

A systematic approach to diagnose hypogonadism initially establishes the presence of symptoms/signs of testosterone deficiency, considers other potential causes of manifestations, and excludes conditions that transiently suppress testosterone. Hypogonadism is confirmed by measuring fasting serum total testosterone in the morning on at least 2 separate days, or free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or calculated free testosterone in men with conditions that alter sex hormone-binding globulin or serum total testosterone near lower limit of normal. To guide management, further evaluation is performed to identify the specific cause of hypogonadism and whether it is potentially reversible or an irreversible pathologic disorder.

### The clinical management of testosterone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder: a review [^113EbLzR]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Calculating free testosterone as well as obtaining SHBG can be helpful in patients that have total testosterone levels in the upper range of physiologic levels without symptomatic improvement in HSDD symptoms. There are several free bioavailable testosterone online calculators utilizing total testosterone and SHBG values. Measurement of 5α-reductase should be considered in patients without clinical improvement in symptoms found to have normal total testosterone and free testosterone. In the scenarios of low free testosterone or decreased 5αreductase, experts have supported total testosterone levels higher than physiologic testosterone.

Once levels are stable, testosterone concentrations should be monitored every 4–6 months. If testosterone therapy results in improvement of HSDD, a drug holiday should be considered after 6–12 months of treatment to see if treatment is still required. If there is a decline in symptoms after cessation of testosterone, therapy should then be resumed long-term to maintain the improvement in HSDD. Testosterone treatment should be discontinued if there is no clinical improvement noted by the patient after 6 months.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171UtFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Testosterone assessment and related remarks — age effects, binding, and testing considerations: Testosterone levels demonstrate an age-related decline, with healthy men reaching the highest serum T levels around the age of 30 years and thereafter showing a gradual decline at a rate of 1–2% annually, and the level below which symptoms occur has not been clearly established; about 2% of circulating T is free, 44% is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 54% is bound to albumin and other proteins. For borderline low T values, two measurements performed with the same assay are preferred. When assessing fertility is required, clinicians should perform semen analysis before starting T replacement, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces circulating gonadotropins with reductions of up to 60% for FSH and 50% for LH.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label such that women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification, or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus Position Statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This Position Statement was developed, by consensus between the participating organizations, to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance as to which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### Comprehensive medical evaluation and assessment of comorbidities: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112qXPnF]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — Low testosterone in men: Recommendation 4.18 states, in men with diabetes or prediabetes, to inquire about sexual health and, if symptoms and/or signs of hypogonadism are detected, to screen with a morning serum total testosterone level (B). In men with diabetes who have symptoms or signs of low testosterone, a morning total testosterone level should be measured using an accurate and reliable assay, and if total testosterone levels are close to the lower limit it is reasonable to determine free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations using total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and albumin; further tests such as luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels may be needed. Testosterone replacement in men with symptomatic hypogonadism may have benefits, including improved sexual function, well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone density, but in older men with hypogonadism it has been associated with increased coronary artery plaque volume, with no conclusive evidence that testosterone supplementation is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in all men with hypogonadism.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^117KbkG9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome that can be defined as persistently low serum testosterone levels in the setting of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

### Declining testicular function in aging men [^114Sw16y]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Age-related decline in male sex hormones, particularly testosterone, is referred to as andropause. Like menopause, andropause is associated with physical and emotional changes that may be alleviated by hormone replacement therapy. Hypogonadism in aging men, as defined by a low free testosterone index, is due to declining testosterone production and increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels. About 30% of men in their 60s and more than 80% of men over 80 y may have a low free testosterone index. Diagnosis of hypogonadism is based on clinical symptoms (eg, decreased muscle mass, fractures, loss of libido) and laboratory determinations of serum testosterone-usually total testosterone levels. Measuring bioavailable testosterone, or free testosterone, is expensive and time-consuming, but may more accurately detect hypogonadism. Testosterone replacement therapy is generally safe in aging men and may improve libido, cognition, bone mineral density, body mass composition, and serum lipoproteins. Although contraindicated in men with prostate or breast cancer, testosterone replacement therapy in aging men warrants examination. Any of the available testosterone formulations can be used, but injectable forms have certain advantages, including excellent dose adjustability, lack of skin irritation, and low cost.

### Statin therapy is associated with lower total but not bioavailable or free testosterone in men with type 2 diabetes [^116whKS4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

International guidelines have suggested that symptomatic men with total testosterone levels < 8 nmol/l (231 ng/dl) are hypogonadal, that men with total testosterone levels > 12 nmol/l (346 ng/dl) do not have hypogonadism, and that men with levels between 8 and 12 nmol/l need consideration for treatment depending on their clinical picture. An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline suggested a diagnostic cutoff value of testosterone of < 10.4 nmol/l (300 ng/dl) for hypogonadism. Our findings are important in this context because statin treatment was associated with lower total testosterone levels of 11.9 nmol/l (340 ng/dl) (versus 13.4 nmol/l [384 ng/dl]). Men treated with ≥ 20 mg/day atorvastatin had an average total testosterone level of only 9.6 nmol/l (275 ng/dl), which is 3.8 nmol/l (109 ng/dl) lower than that of men not treated with statins. Thus, statin treatment may lead to reductions in total testosterone levels to < 12 or 10.4 nmol/l in many men but will not significantly alter bioavailable or free testosterone levels or hypogonadal symptoms. We recommend a low threshold for measuring or calculating bioavailable or free testosterone in men receiving statin therapy.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115q6JoB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of men with suspected hypogonadism — Endocrine Society guideline: 1.1 We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone concentrations (when indicated). Testosterone concentrations exhibit significant diurnal and day-to-day variations and may be suppressed by food intake or glucose. Therefore, clinicians should measure total testosterone concentrations on two separate mornings when the patient is fasting. Clinicians should use an accurate and reliable method, optimally, an assay that has been certified by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program [e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hormone Standardization Program for Testosterone]. In men who have conditions that alter sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) (Table 2), or whose initial total testosterone concentrations are at or near the lower limit of the normal range (Fig. 1), clinicians should determine free testosterone concentrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations that use total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin concentrations. Clinicians should not use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays, as they are inaccurate. Clinicians should not test men for testosterone deficiency who have or are recovering from an acute illness or are engaged in short-term use of medications (e.g., opioids) that suppress testosterone concentrations.

### Testosterone: a hormone preventing cardiovascular disease or a therapy increasing cardiovascular events? [^112WY3H2]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Decreasing testosterone levels with ageing is a well-known condition in older men named 'low T', 'manopause', or hypogonadism. Observational studies suggested an association between low endogenous testosterone levels and a high cardio-metabolic profile (increased blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, thrombosis), as well as a modest increase in total and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Controversies persist regarding the need for screening 'low T' in older men, as well as what precisely should be the indication(s) for testosterone replacement therapy. So far, no data have shown that normalization of testosterone levels reduce CV events. Although testosterone replacement therapy seems to have beneficial effects on male quality of life or physical condition, some data suggest serious adverse events, such as CV events. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on the threshold for treatment indication in men with non-specific symptoms or borderline levels of testosterone. Available data from clinical practice setting suggest an increase in testosterone prescription over time and possible overtreatment. In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have promoted 'low T' as a treatable disease, suggesting that testosterone replacement may help restore energy, positive mood and sexuality, and despite ageing. Currently, well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the impact of testosterone replacement therapy on CV clinically relevant CV outcomes within age-specific ranges to strengthen the evidence for clinical practice guidelines.

### Are declining testosterone levels a major risk factor for ill-health in aging men? [^116mBpod]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

As men grow older, testosterone levels fall, with a steeper decline in unbound or free testosterone compared with total testosterone concentrations. Lower testosterone levels have been associated with poorer cognitive function, and with impaired general and sexual health in aging men. Recently, lower testosterone levels have been linked with metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes, both conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, and shown to predict higher overall and cardiovascular-related mortality in middle-aged and older men. However, reverse causation has to be considered, as systemic illness may result in reduced testosterone levels. Thus, the strength of these associations and the likely direction of causation need to be carefully considered. Furthermore, these conditions may overlap, for example aging, lower testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are interrelated. Cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies may be informative. However, ultimately randomized controlled trials of testosterone therapy are needed to clarify its role in the maintenance of general and sexual health in aging men. Testosterone therapy should be considered in hypogonadal men who meet rigorous criteria for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency. Additional consideration should be given to designing and testing interventions that may prevent or ameliorate the age-related decline in testosterone levels in men.

### Optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions in men with testosterone deficiency [^112VkCBb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This narrative review offers a guideline-based approach for optimizing diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision making in men being evaluated for testosterone deficiency.

Methods

A narrative review.

Results

Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that results from the inability of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs associated with consistently low testosterone concentrations. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is made by the ascertainment of symptoms and signs; the measurement of total and, if indicated, free testosterone levels in early-morning fasting samples on ≥ 2 days; the measurement of luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism; and an additional evaluation to ascertain the cause of testosterone deficiency. Nonspecificity of symptoms and signs, variations in testosterone levels over time, inaccuracy in the measurement of total and free testosterone levels, variations in binding protein concentrations, and suboptimal reference ranges contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy. Testosterone treatment is indicated for men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency. Testosterone treatment should be avoided in men with prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis, thrombophilia, increased risk of prostate cancer or severe lower urinary tract symptoms without prior urologic evaluation, a recent major adverse cardiovascular event, uncontrolled heart failure, or severe untreated sleep apnea. Testosterone replacement therapy should be accompanied by a standardized monitoring plan.

Conclusion

A shared decision of the patient and physician to treat should be guided by the consideration of the burden of symptoms, potential benefits and risks, patient's values, and the cost and burden of long-term treatment and monitoring.

Adult-onset hypogonadism — consensus statement: Adult-onset hypogonadism is a measurable syndrome characterized by low testosterone, associated symptoms, and low or normal gonadotropin levels. Men with adult-onset hypogonadism who are candidates for treatment with testosterone should be counseled regarding the benefits and risks of treatment. Patients who are treated should be monitored regularly.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone deficiency — epidemiology and diagnosis research priorities emphasize unanswered questions about age-specific reference ranges for both total and free testosterone that "should likely be focused on two assays, LCMS for total testosterone and equilibrium dialysis for free testosterone", the impact of life‑span changes including whether a drop within the normal range confers risk, thresholds linking testosterone levels to specific symptoms or signs (e.g., erectile dysfunction and major adverse cardiovascular events), genotype predictors, biomarkers for MACE, and chemotherapy‑related risk; diagnostically, "Further research is needed to understand the role of free testosterone level", the role of "androgen receptor sensitivity (CAG repeat analysis)", and "There is a great need for the development of robust and reliable patient-reported outcome tools… in the screening and follow-up of response to therapy".

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (ie, 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above, and these experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism are needed. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases) (Table 2). Marked SHBG elevations leading to misleadingly normal or even high total testosterone are relatively uncommon, whereas pseudohypogonadism in men with diabetes and/or obesity is very common.

### Comparison of American Urological Association and endocrine society guidelines on testosterone replacement [^112vmiZp]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Low testosterone affects an increasing number of patients each year resulting in a steady increase in prescriptions for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). In 2018, the American Urological Association (AUA) and the Endocrine Society (ES) published their guidelines for treating patients with low testosterone. While the two guidelines are similar, significant differences exist. In this review, we compare and analyze the AUA and ES guidelines in terms of diagnosis and definition, workup, monitoring of side effects, treatment outcomes for TRT, and how these guidelines are applied in our practice.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hypogonadism in adult male patients – 2002 update [^116RNQSy]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

In these clinical practice guidelines, specific recommendations are made for determining the most effective methods of diagnosing and treating hypogonadism in adult male patients. The target populations for these guidelines include the following: (1) men with primary testicular failure requiring testosterone replacement (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); (2) male patients with gonadotropin deficiency or dysfunction who may have received testosterone replacement therapy or treatment for infertility (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); and (3) aging men with symptoms relating to testosterone deficiency who could benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Initial hormonal evaluation generally consists of a testosterone determination, in conjunction with a free testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin level, inpatients with clear symptoms and signs but normal-range total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels. Other possible tests include semen analysis, pituitary imaging studies, genetic studies, bone densitometry, testicular ultrasonography, testicular biopsy, and specialized hormonal dynamic testing. Therapeutic options generally consist of testosterone replacement by injections, patches, or topically applied gel in hypergonadotropic patients and in hypogonadotropic patients not interested in fertility. In hypogonadotropic patients interested in fertility, gonadal stimulation option scan be considered, including human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation therapy with or without human menopausal gonadotropin (or follicle-stimulating hormone) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone pump therapy. These therapies may be combined with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which may allow pregnancy to occur with very low numbers of sperm.

### Male late-onset hypogonadism: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^114DHNsa]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Some aging men develop a condition of suppressed serum testosterone levels, which is associated with diffuse sexual, physical and psychological symptoms. Several terms are used for this syndrome, but late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is preferred. The diagnosis of LOH is often uncertain because symptoms (occurring in 20–40% of men) and low circulating testosterone (found in 20% of men > 70 years of age) seldom occur together. The strict diagnostic criteria for LOH include reproducibly low serum testosterone levels and sexual symptoms, including erectile dysfunction and reduced frequency of sexual thoughts and morning erections. Using these diagnostic criteria, only 2% of 40–80-year-old men have LOH. Obesity and impaired general health (including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frailty) are more common reasons for low testosterone than advanced age per se. It seems logical, therefore, to begin by treating these conditions before testosterone replacement therapy is initiated. Even then, testosterone should only be used if there are no contraindications, such as unstable cardiac disease, serious prostate symptoms and high hemoglobin level. The long-term benefit of testosterone replacement therapy is uncertain, and the experimental nature of the treatment, and its associated risks, must be fully explained to the patient before treatment begins.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Benefits and risks of testosterone treatment of older men with hypogonadism [^115P5up1]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Total and free testosterone levels decline in men with advancing age due to defects at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels is associated with improvements in sexual activity, sexual desire, and erectile function; lean body mass, muscle strength, and stair climbing power, and self-reported mobility; areal and volumetric bone mineral density, and estimated bone strength; depressive symptoms; and anemia. Long-term risks of cardiovascular events and prostate cancer during testosterone treatment remain unknown. Testosterone treatment may be offered on an individualized basis to older men with unequivocally low testosterone levels and symptoms or conditions associated with testosterone deficiency after consideration of potential benefits and risks, burden of symptoms, and patient's values.

### Diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency: recommendations from the fourth international consultation for sexual medicine (ICSM 2015) [^115ZjqfJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone deficiency (TD), also known as hypogonadism, is a condition affecting a substantial proportion of men as they age. The diagnosis and management of TD can be challenging and clinicians should be aware of the current literature on this condition.

Aim

To review the available literature concerning the diagnosis and management of TD and to provide clinically relevant recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM) meeting.

Methods

A literature search was performed using the PubMed database for English-language original and review articles published or e-published up to January 2016.

Main Outcome Measures

Levels of evidence (LoEs) and grades of recommendations are provided based on a thorough analysis of the literature and committee consensus.

Results

Recommendations were given for 12 categories of TD: definition, clinical diagnosis, routine measurement, screening questionnaires, laboratory diagnosis, threshold levels for the biochemical diagnosis of TD, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, fertility, testosterone (T) formulations, alternatives to T therapy, and adverse events and monitoring. A total of 42 recommendations were made: of these, 16 were unchanged from the Third ICSM and 26 new recommendations were made during this Fourth ICSM. Most of these recommendations were supported by LoEs 2 and 3. Several key new recommendations include the following: (i) the clinical manifestations of TD occur as a result of decreased serum androgen concentrations or activity, regardless of whether there is an identified underlying etiology [LoE = 1, Grade = A]; (ii) symptomatic men with total T levels lower than 12 nmol/L or 350 ng/dL should be treated with T therapy [LoE = 1, Grade = C]; (iii) a trial of T therapy in symptomatic men with total T levels higher than 12 nmol/L or 350 ng/dL can be considered based on clinical presentation [LoE = 3, Grade = C]; (iv) there is no compelling evidence that T treatment increases the risk of developing prostate cancer or that its use is associated with prostate cancer progression [LoE = 1, Grade = C]; and (v) the weight of evidence indicates that T therapy is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk [LoE = 2, Grade = B].

Conclusion

TD is an important condition that can profoundly affect the sexual health of men. We provide guidance regarding its diagnosis and management. Men with TD who receive treatment often experience resolution or improvement in their sexual symptoms and non-sexual health benefits.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^115TWE1i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary and Key Messages

The international panel concluded the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of HSDD, with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no approved female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

Figure 1.
Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years. 1 Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia; osteoporosis (see Table 1). 2 Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting. 3 Measure TT when patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 Am. 4 Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected (see Table 2). Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone given the limitations discussed in the manuscript and focus instead on interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum free testosterone with an accurate method. 5 Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging also indicated if there are symptoms of a sellar mass, serum LH is undetectable, or serum total testosterone is < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). 6 This includes optimization of management of chronic disease, stopping medications that can suppress the HPT axis if possible (eg, opioids, glucocorticoids), evaluation and treatment of depression and sleep apnea. 7 Consider karyotype for assessment for Klinefelter syndrome; offer testosterone treatment if there is no contraindication (including desire to conceive in the next 1–2 years). 8 The decision to offer testosterone therapy should take into consideration the likelihood of benefit and the potential risk. The benefits are highest in men with lower testosterone concentrations and men with concordantly low total and free testosterone concentrations. A trial of testosterone therapy may be offered if the following conditions are met: 1) there are no contraindications; 2) there has been a discussion regarding potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy and the uncertainties regarding long-term health outcomes; 3) patient-specific goals have been set; and 4) there is agreement that testosterone treatment will be stopped if these goals are not achieved. See text in manuscript. 9 Reassessment of men with high BMI consists of assessment for symptoms and signs of hypogonadism and re-measurement of testosterone. If there are symptoms of hypogonadism and low serum testosterone after 6–12 months of lifestyle changes, then testosterone therapy may be considered. Medical therapy to achieve weight loss and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for men whose BMI remains > 30 kg/m² after 6 months of lifestyle changes. Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; FT, free testosterone; HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total testosterone; SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin.

Urologists may commonly diagnose hypogonadism in adult men experiencing an age-related decline in serum testosterone. Low serum testosterone in conjunction with symptoms such as decreased libido, fatigue, memory deficit, or decreased vitality is described as testosterone deficiency syndrome. There are numerous therapeutic options, although each is unique in its formulation, administration, and side-effect profile. For this reason, treatment can prove to be challenging for each unique patient case. The clinician must carefully monitor key serum markers before and during treatment. With careful dosing and monitoring, therapeutic benefit can be achieved reliably and sustainably.

Serum Free Testosterone Assessments

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected (Table 2; Fig. 1). A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations (see below). The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (ie, pseudohypogonadism; Fig. 1) are obesity and T2D (Table 2).

Table 2.
Causes of high and low circulating SHBG

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171mA8L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — age-related testosterone changes and trial outcomes in older men summarizes that TT and FT concentrations fall with increasing age in men, and because SHBG increases with age the decline in FT is greater than in TT; the fall is gradual with higher rates of decline in men with adiposity and comorbid diseases. Initial RCTs in older men had relatively small sample sizes, included healthy men with low-normal T, and showed T treatment consistently increased LBM and vertebral BMD and decreased fat mass, with variable effects on other outcomes and no RCT large enough to evaluate risk. The TTrials found that T treatment of 1 year in symptomatic men ≥ 65 years of age yielded moderate improvements in sexual function and small improvements in walking distance, mood, and depressive symptoms with no improvements in vitality and cognitive function, and among anemic men a greater proportion assigned to T had hemoglobin increments ≥ 1 g/dL compared with placebo, with T administration associated with significantly greater increases in hemoglobin and PSA levels vs placebo.

### The benefits and risks of testosterone treatment in older hypogonadal men [^11347UaQ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

As men age, their serum testosterone concentrations decrease-the total testosterone very little but the free testosterone more. Testosterone treatment of older men whose serum testosterone concentrations are unequivocally low to bring their testosterone levels to normal for young men improves their sexual function, walking, mood, bone mineral density, and hemoglobin, but does not improve their sense of vitality or cognitive function. This treatment has also been suspected of increasing the risk of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and heart disease, but these possible risks have neither been confirmed nor refuted.

Monitoring of testosterone-replacement therapy — evaluation and laboratory schedule: In hypogonadal men who have started testosterone therapy, we recommend evaluating the patient after treatment initiation to assess whether the patient has responded to treatment, is suffering any adverse effects, and is complying with the treatment regimen (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Clinicians should maintain serum testosterone concentrations during treatment in the mid-normal range for healthy young men, evaluate symptoms and formulation-specific adverse events at each visit, and measure testosterone and hematocrit at 3 to 6 months, at 12 months, and annually thereafter; for those who choose prostate monitoring, include PSA and DRE 3 to 12 months.

### Male hypogonadism [^117GZtpu]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome that results from failure to produce physiological concentrations of testosterone, normal amounts of sperm, or both. Hypogonadism may arise from testicular disease (primary hypogonadism) or dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit (secondary hypogonadism). Clinical presentations vary dependent on the time of onset of androgen deficiency, whether the defect is in testosterone production or spermatogenesis, associated genetic factors, or history of androgen therapy. The clinical diagnosis of hypogonadism is made on the basis of signs and symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency and low morning testosterone concentrations in serum on multiple occasions. Several testosterone-replacement therapies are approved for treatment and should be selected according to the patient's preference, cost, availability, and formulation-specific properties. Contraindications to testosterone-replacement therapy include prostate and breast cancers, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, severe lower-urinary-tract symptoms, and erythrocytosis. Treatment should be monitored for benefits and adverse effects.

### Clinical practice patterns in the assessment and management of low testosterone in men: an international survey of endocrinologists [^113J5ADX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To document current practices in the approach to low testosterone in older men. Given that recommendations are based on low-level evidence, we hypothesized that there would be a wide variability in clinical practice patterns.

Design

Members of all major endocrine and andrological societies were invited to participate in a Web-based survey of the diagnostic work-up and management of a hypothetical index case of a 61-year old overweight man presenting with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, without evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPT) axis disease.

Results

Nine hundred and forty-three respondents (91.2% adult endocrinologists) from Northern America (63.7%), Europe (12.7%), Oceania (8.2%), Latin America and Caribbean (7.6%), and the Middle East, Asia, or Africa (7.8%) completed the survey. Response rates among participating societies ranged from 4.1–20.0%. There was a wide variability in clinical practice patterns, especially regarding biochemical diagnosis of androgen deficiency, exclusion of HPT axis pathology, and monitoring for prostate cancer. In a man with suggestive symptoms, 42.4% of participants would offer testosterone treatment below a serum total testosterone of 10.4 nmol/l (300 ng/dl). A total of 46.0% of participants were, over the last five years, 'less inclined' to prescribe testosterone to men with nonspecific symptoms and borderline testosterone levels, compared to 'no change' (29.3%) or 'more inclined' (24.7%), P < 0.001.

Conclusions

This large-scale international survey shows a wide variability in the management of lowered testosterone in older men, with deviations from current clinical practice guidelines, and a temporal trend towards increasing reluctance to prescribe testosterone to men without classical hypogonadism. These findings highlight the need for better evidence to guide clinicians regarding testosterone therapy.

### Andropause or male menopause? Rationale for testosterone replacement therapy in older men with low testosterone levels [^112PNaFU]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide rationale for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in older men with low testosterone levels and symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency.

Methods

The relevant literature was reviewed using PubMed.

Results

Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies indicate that total and free testosterone levels fall with aging, and they may be accompanied by symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency. Testosterone treatment of younger men with very low testosterone levels and hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular disease is associated with improvements in symptoms, body composition, bone density, and hematocrit/hemoglobin. Studies evaluating testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels are limited, but they suggest some increase in fat free mass, some decrease in fat mass, and some increase in bone density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.

Conclusion

The Testosterone Trial should provide definitive information regarding the potential benefits of TRT in men ≥ 65 years of age. If efficacy is confirmed, we will still need more information regarding the risks of TRT in older men.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116Zka93]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Appendix detailed methods — evidence review, key questions, search, appraisal, and stakeholder input: The Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center conducted the supporting evidence review addressing the benefits and harms of testosterone therapy for men and whether they are affected by baseline testosterone level, baseline symptoms, age, comorbid conditions (such as obesity, opiate use, corticosteroid use, HIV), or targeted or achieved testosterone level; reviewers searched several databases for studies and systematic reviews published in English from 1980 to May 2019 and assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane approach for randomized controlled trials and a modified Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality approach for observational studies. The development of this guideline also included perspectives, values, and preferences of 2 nonphysician CGC members who represent the public and a 7-member CGC Public Panel, and the supporting evidence review and guideline each were peer reviewed through the journal and posted online for comments from ACP Regents and ACP Governors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of androgen deficiency in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men and women [^115WLoGp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Androgen deficiency is a common endocrine abnormality among men and women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Low testosterone concentrations are associated with lower CD4 cell count, advanced stage of illness, medication use, and weight loss. Signs and symptoms may be nonspecific. The most useful laboratory indicator is the serum bioavailable (free) testosterone concentration. A number of different testosterone preparations for treatment of androgen deficiency in HIV-infected men now exist. Administration of im testosterone significantly increases weight and lean body mass, energy, quality of life, and depression scores in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels. Newer transdermal and gel preparations provide more-consistent steady-state dosing but are not as well tested, and sufficient testosterone concentrations may not be achieved with their use. Androgen deficiency is also common among HIV-infected women. Preliminary studies suggest that use of physiological testosterone administration, to achieve testosterone levels within the normal range, is of benefit in HIV-infected women, but further studies are necessary to define the therapeutic role of androgen therapy in this population.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113Mfw2L]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — diagnosis of testosterone deficiency directs that clinicians should use a total testosterone level below 300 ng/dL as a reasonable cut-off in support of the diagnosis of low testosterone (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B), and that the diagnosis of low testosterone should be made only after two total testosterone measurements are taken on separate occasions with both conducted in an early morning fashion (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should consider measuring total testosterone in patients with a history of unexplained anemia, bone density loss, diabetes, exposure to chemotherapy, exposure to testicular radiation, HIV/AIDS, chronic narcotic use, male infertility, pituitary dysfunction, and chronic corticosteroid use even in the absence of symptoms or signs associated with testosterone deficiency (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The use of validated questionnaires is not currently recommended to either define which patients are candidates for testosterone therapy or to monitor symptom response in patients on testosterone therapy (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Prostate health

Testosterone therapy increases serum prostate specific antigen concentrations in hypogonadal men to that of age-matched controls. Although there is no evidence that testosterone treatment increases the risk of de novo prostate cancer, clinical trials have not had enough participants or long enough follow-up to be conclusive. Testosterone stimulates metastatic and high-grade prostate cancer, but it is not known whether testosterone treatment stimulates the growth of pre-existing subclinical lower grade prostate cancer. Testosterone treatment has not been shown to have a significant effect on lower urinary tract symptoms; however, clinical trials have generally excluded men with severe benign prostatic hypertrophy. Testosterone should generally not be prescribed for men with prostate cancer (with possible exceptions in carefully selected men such as those with a history of treated low-risk, Gleason < 3 + 4 prostate cancer, undetectable PSA and no clinical evidence of disease after treatment) or to men at higher risk of prostate cancer (unevaluated prostate nodule, PSA > 4 ng/mL), and follow-up of prostate health during testosterone treatment should be individualized. Individualized prostate cancer screening should be offered with a nuanced discussion of the potential benefits (possible early detection of prostate cancer that might improve mortality and decrease the risk of metastatic disease) and the potential harm of increased prostate biopsies and prostate cancer therapies that may cause erectile dysfunction and incontinence and might not always improve long-term, health-related quality of life.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Debate about the free testosterone hypothesis: useful tool or misguided mirage? [^117GN7s7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In this debate, two clinicians discuss the merits and demerits of the free testosterone hypothesis. Although most clinical guidelines recommend the measurement of free testosterone in the evaluation for male hypogonadism (at least in men with suspected low serum sex hormone binding globulin), there remains controversy about underlying hypothesis that serum free testosterone is a significant contributor to androgen effect. In this debate, Dr. Anawalt presents evidence to support the free testosterone hypothesis and advocates for the usefulness of accurate assessment of free testosterone in the evaluation of male hypogonadism. Dr. Handelsman argues that the evidence is unconvincing, the hypothesis is flawed and biologically invalid, and free testosterone cannot be accurately assessed in clinical practice.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — adjunctive testing in men with low testosterone states that in patients with low testosterone, clinicians should measure serum luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Serum prolactin levels should be measured in patients with low testosterone levels combined with low or low/ normal luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A), and patients with persistently high prolactin levels of unknown etiology should undergo evaluation for endocrine disorders (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Serum estradiol should be measured in testosterone deficient patients who present with breast symptoms or gynecomastia prior to the commencement of testosterone therapy (Expert Opinion). Men with testosterone deficiency who are interested in fertility should have a reproductive health evaluation performed prior to treatment (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). PSA should be measured in men over 40 years of age prior to commencement of testosterone therapy to exclude a prostate cancer diagnosis (Clinical Principle).

Back to the Case

The patient has continued to have symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations. He enquired about testosterone therapy to restore his serum testosterone concentration into the normal range. Before testosterone therapy was considered and the potential benefits and risks were discussed, prostate cancer screening was discussed; untreated prostate cancer is a contraindication to testosterone therapy (Table 4). After discussion of the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, he elected to undergo prostate cancer screening; digital rectal exam revealed no prostate abnormality and PSA was 1.5 ng/dL. The potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy were discussed because he had persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly, unequivocally low serum testosterone concentrations after a year of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT axis (including lifestyle changes to lose weight and optimization of treatment of sleep apnea).

Table 4.
Contraindications to testosterone therapy in men

He was counseled about the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy (including the lack of definitive data about the effects on cardiovascular outcomes and prostate cancer) and the absence of high-quality, long-term studies. The patient's main concerns were identified as low libido, reduced energy, and low mood. He was advised that, based on the T-Trials, effects of testosterone treatment on these symptoms should be evident within 3 to 6 months while other benefits (eg, muscle mass and function, bone health) typically take longer. Testosterone formulations (including topical and intramuscular treatment) were discussed. He preferred topical testosterone for a therapeutic trial of 6 months to determine if testosterone therapy would meaningfully improve his symptoms. He agreed that testosterone treatment would be stopped if there was no significant benefit despite normal serum testosterone concentrations during therapy. The discussion about the benefits and risks of testosterone, the goals of therapeutic trial and the plan to discontinue testosterone therapy if these goals were not met were documented in the medical record. Treatment was initiated with a standardized monitoring plan that included follow-up clinic visits to assess for effectiveness and safety at 3 and 6 months with reassessment of the dosage of testosterone based on symptoms and measurement of serum testosterone concentrations and assessment of hematocrit 3 and 6 months after initiation (and increases of dosage) of testosterone.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112oc1u4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — diagnosis of hypogonadism: We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone concentrations (when indicated). We recommend against routine screening of men in the general population for hypogonadism. In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.
