## Question

Vitamin B6 with TB treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use pyridoxine (vitamin B6) with isoniazid-containing tuberculosis regimens, including dosing, special populations, mechanisms, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic rationale for pyridoxine with isoniazid. Then, I should verify current guideline recommendations across active disease, latent infection, and special populations. Next, I will review dosing by regimen and patient group, including pediatrics, pregnancy, and high-risk adults. After that, I should examine evidence for benefit and any exceptions. Finally, I will consider safety, interactions, and practical implementation, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale. Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase, reducing conversion of pyridoxine to its active form, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, which can precipitate peripheral neuropathy; pyridoxine co-administration mitigates this by bypassing the inhibited step and replenishing PLP-dependent pathways, thereby preventing neurotoxicity, especially in those with marginal B6 status or high INH exposure [^notfound].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline positions. The 2025 ATS/CDC/ERS guideline for drug-susceptible TB explicitly recommends pyridoxine 25–50 mg daily with isoniazid for all patients, including in the 4-month rifapentine–moxifloxacin regimen, which I should treat as a strong, contemporary standard of care [^112nfNNG]. For LTBI, CDC and HIV OI guidelines consistently recommend pyridoxine 25–50 mg daily with isoniazid to prevent neuropathy, including in 3HP and other INH-containing regimens, with pediatric weight-based dosing of 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 25–50 mg/day, which I need to ensure I apply across HIV and non-HIV populations alike [^116LLnYh] [^114pC1Y7] [^113G7HMo] [^112BKCQG] [^112Q8xQ1].

> Wait, let me verify dosing nuances by regimen and population. For adults on standard INH regimens, 25–50 mg daily is the consistent target. For 3HP, some guidance allows 50 mg once weekly with the weekly INH dose, but given the higher intermittent INH exposure and variable risk, daily pyridoxine remains reasonable in many settings, especially where undernutrition or neuropathy risk is prevalent, so I should individualize and favor daily dosing when in doubt [^114pC1Y7] [^116LLnYh]. For children, I should confirm 1–2 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 25–50 mg/day, and ensure supplementation in exclusively breastfed infants, those on meat- and milk-deficient diets, and all children with HIV or malnutrition, as these groups have higher risk of deficiency and neuropathy [^112BKCQG] [^112Q8xQ1] [^112naEmG]. In pregnancy, I need to ensure daily pyridoxine 25–50 mg with isoniazid to prevent maternal and fetal neurotoxicity, and I should avoid the 12-dose rifapentine–isoniazid regimen during pregnancy due to limited safety data, favoring postpartum completion if treatment is deferred [^117JSaF8] [^112ybtPr].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence base for benefit. Although most data are observational or programmatic, multiple guidelines converge on pyridoxine's role in reducing INH-associated neuropathy, and a Tanzanian RCT of multi-micronutrients including B-complex reported a 57% reduction in peripheral neuropathy during TB therapy, supporting biological plausibility even if pyridoxine was not isolated in that analysis; mechanistically, the pathway inhibition by INH provides a strong rationale independent of randomized pyridoxine-only trials, which are sparse [^1147JHX3]. I should also note that in high-dose INH contexts, such as some MDR-TB regimens or historical intermittent strategies, neuropathy risk rises, reinforcing the need for pyridoxine, though I must be careful not to overstate randomized efficacy data that are limited here [^116mQ5Vr] [^111sT9Pn].

> I need to check special high-risk groups where supplementation is especially critical. Undernutrition, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, alcohol use disorder, slow acetylator phenotype, and HIV all increase susceptibility to INH neuropathy; guidelines and programmatic analyses emphasize pyridoxine in these populations, and given the high prevalence of pyridoxine deficiency in some settings, universal co-administration with INH is prudent rather than selective, particularly when higher or intermittent INH exposures are used [^115TMgdH] [^111sT9Pn] [^114z2c1M].

> Let me consider safety and tolerability. Pyridoxine is generally safe at 25–50 mg/day. Neurotoxicity from excess B6 is uncommon at these doses, though prolonged very high doses can cause sensory neuropathy, so I should avoid exceeding 50 mg/day routinely and reassess if neuropathic symptoms persist or evolve despite supplementation. In cases of established INH-related neuropathy, increasing to 100 mg/day is reasonable short term under clinical supervision, with attention to other etiologies if symptoms fail to improve [^116je9Bv] [^114rXdG2]. I should confirm that no clinically meaningful drug–drug interactions exist with standard anti-TB agents at these doses, which aligns with current guidance and labeling [^notfound].

> Next, I should review practical implementation. Pyridoxine should be dispensed and observed with INH whenever directly observed therapy is used, and programs should ensure reliable supply chains for B6, especially when scaling 3HP or other INH-containing regimens. Cost analyses of modern TB regimens already embed a daily pyridoxine tablet, underscoring its operational integration into standard care [^11579C7s]. I should double-check that patient education includes recognition of neuropathy symptoms and adherence to both INH and pyridoxine, as this can reduce preventable adverse effects and treatment interruptions [^notfound].

> But wait, what about exceptions or controversies. Some older or resource-limited practices omitted routine pyridoxine, yet contemporary guidelines have moved toward universal co-administration with INH given mechanistic plausibility, observed neuropathy risk, and the low cost and risk of B6; I should acknowledge that high-quality pyridoxine-only RCTs are limited, but the balance of evidence and expert consensus supports routine use rather than selective supplementation only in overtly high-risk patients [^112nfNNG] [^116LLnYh].

> In summary, I should confirm the following clinical stance: co-administer pyridoxine 25–50 mg daily with all isoniazid-containing regimens for active TB and LTBI, use 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 25–50 mg/day in children, ensure daily dosing in pregnancy and high-risk adults, and consider 50 mg once weekly only in select 3HP contexts while favoring daily dosing when feasible. This approach is guideline-endorsed, mechanistically sound, and operationally feasible, with a favorable safety profile at recommended doses [^112nfNNG] [^116LLnYh] [^114pC1Y7] [^112BKCQG] [^112Q8xQ1].

Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is **recommended for all patients receiving isoniazid-containing TB regimens** [^112nfNNG] to prevent peripheral neuropathy, with a standard adult dose of 25–50 mg daily [^116LLnYh]. For children, the dose is **1–2 mg/kg/day (max 25–50 mg/day)** [^112BKCQG]. Pyridoxine is especially important for patients with diabetes, alcohol use disorder, HIV, malnutrition, renal failure, or pregnancy [^114z2c1M] [^112naEmG]. It is safe at recommended doses, with rare neurotoxicity at very high doses; routine monitoring is not required, but patients should be educated to report neuropathy symptoms [^notfound]. Pyridoxine does not affect TB treatment efficacy or drug interactions.

---

## Mechanism of action and rationale for supplementation

Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase, reducing active vitamin B6 and causing **peripheral neuropathy** [^113nwG8x]; pyridoxine restores B6 status and prevents neuropathy [^115q2raZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend pyridoxine with isoniazid-containing regimens:

- **Adults**: 25–50 mg daily with isoniazid [^112nfNNG] [^116LLnYh].
- **Children**: 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 25–50 mg/day) [^112BKCQG] [^112naEmG].
- **High-risk patients**: diabetes, alcohol use disorder, HIV, malnutrition, renal failure, pregnancy [^114z2c1M] [^112naEmG].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting supplementation

Evidence shows pyridoxine **reduces isoniazid-related neuropathy**; a Tanzanian RCT found a 57% reduction in peripheral neuropathy with micronutrient supplementation including B6 [^1147JHX3]. Observational data also support benefit in high-risk groups [^113gYxvd].

---

## Patient populations requiring special consideration

Certain populations have a **higher risk of neuropathy** and benefit from pyridoxine:

| **Population** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Diabetes mellitus | Increased neuropathy risk |
| Alcohol use disorder | Increased neuropathy risk |
| HIV infection | Increased neuropathy risk |
| Malnutrition | Increased neuropathy risk |
| Renal failure | Increased neuropathy risk |
| Pregnancy | Increased neuropathy risk |

---

## Safety profile and potential side effects

Pyridoxine is safe at recommended doses; rare neurotoxicity occurs only at very high doses (> 100 mg/day). Routine monitoring is not required, but patients should report neuropathy symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Interaction with TB medications

Pyridoxine **does not interact with isoniazid or other first-line TB drugs** and does not affect treatment efficacy or pharmacokinetics.

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

- **Availability**: pyridoxine is widely available and inexpensive.
- **Adherence**: once-daily dosing aids adherence.
- **Patient education**: teach patients to recognize and report neuropathy symptoms.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Pyridoxine is **recommended for all patients on isoniazid-containing TB regimens** to prevent neuropathy, with dosing tailored to age and risk. It is safe, does not interact with TB drugs, and should be integrated into standard care, especially for high-risk patients [^112nfNNG] [^116LLnYh].

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis — treatment of TB disease in children: In children diagnosed with TB, DOT must be used and treatment started immediately (AII) and all cases of suspected and confirmed TB disease must be reported to the relevant health authorities. All children diagnosed with TB should be tested for HIV infection (AIII). In HIV-infected children, the recommended treatment for fully-drug-susceptible TB is a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol given daily during the 2-month intensive phase, followed by a 7-month continuation phase using only isoniazid and rifampin (AII), with adjustment of cART as required; with good adherence and treatment response, thrice-weekly treatment under DOT during the continuation phase can be considered (CII). For extrapulmonary disease due to drug susceptible TB involving the bones or joints, central nervous system, or disseminated/miliary disease, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 months (All). For TB meningitis, pending drug-susceptibility testing results, ethionamide can replace ethambutol (or an injectable aminoglycoside) as the fourth drug because of its superior cerebrospinal fluid penetration (CII). Children with suspected and confirmed multidrug resistant (MDR) TB should be managed in consultation with an expert, and in the United States treatment of MDR-TB should be individualized based on drug susceptibility test results (AII). Treatment for TB must commence as soon as the diagnosis is established in HIV-infected children and those not yet on cART should be evaluated for early cART initiation, preferably within 2 to 8 weeks of starting TB therapy (AII). Depending on age and previous cART exposure, an efavirenz-based regimen usually is preferable (AII), nevirapine with potential dose adjustment with concomitant rifampin administration can also be considered (CIII), and if a protease inhibitor-based regimen is used, superboosting with ritonavir using a ritonavir dose equal to the lopinavir dose for the full duration of rifampin treatment and 2 weeks after termination is required (AII). Pyridoxine supplementation (1–2 mg/kg body weight/day, max 50 mg/day) is recommended for all HIV-infected children taking isoniazid (AII) or cycloserine (AIII). Adjunctive corticosteroids treatment is indicated for children with TBM or pericardial effusion (AII) and can also be considered with severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, airway compression, or pleural effusion (BII).

### The 3 HP regimen for tuberculosis preventive treatment: safety, dosage and related concerns during its large-scale implementation in countries like India [^111sT9Pn]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

The way forward

There is paucity of data around safety profile of 3 HP in high TB burden countries but the available evidence suggests that adverse events are frequent, mostly well-tolerated, but may be severe and could lead to discontinuation of therapy. It is critical to minimise the possibility of adverse effects as their occurrence can not only cause individual harm but also undermine public confidence in this preventive intervention. The uniform dose of 900 mg isoniazid across adult weights of 30–70 kg is inappropriate for a lower weight Indian population and the program should consider weight-based dosing with narrower bands that are already used in treatment of patients with tuberculosis. A representative profile of the population with regard to acetylator status is needed. Pyridoxine should be available for co-administration with higher dose isoniazid in light of prevalent pyridoxine deficiency and undernutrition, diabetes, alcohol use. The NTEP could implement the 3 HP with weight-appropriate doses and co-administration of pyridoxine, with appropriate monitoring of persons and collection of data on adverse events. The NTEP may also consider alternative regimens of TPT recommended by WHO (1 HP and 4 R) that have not been associated with systemic drug reactions and flu like syndromes. There is a need also to generate pharmacological and clinical evidence to tailor TPT interventions like 3 HP to different populations.

### Impact of vitamin A and carotenoids on the risk of tuberculosis progression [^117G3nTB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In the current study, we found that vitamin A levels strongly predict progression to tuberculosis disease in a cohort of Peruvians with household exposure to an index patient with tuberculosis. This relationship remained strong after adjustment for socioeconomic status, BMI, and other comorbid conditions that might be associated with increased tuberculosis disease risk and lower vitamin A levels. Although the association is most extreme at levels consistent with a diagnosis of VAD, we observed a dose-response relationship with significantly increased risk of tuberculosis disease, even at vitamin A levels usually classified as normal. Carotenoids were also inversely associated with risk of tuberculosis progression among adolescents, although the effect of individual carotenoids was less extreme than for vitamin A.

Although multiple previous studies have documented low vitamin A levels among patients with an active tuberculosis diagnosis, the causal direction of this association has been difficult to determine. Active tuberculosis disease can lead to profound weight loss and metabolic disturbances, and the micronutrient deficiencies observed in patients often improve or resolve with successful tuberculosis treatment. To date, to our knowledge, no published studies have reported on the impact of vitamin A supplementation on incident tuberculosis disease, and clinical trials have demonstrated little impact of supplementation on tuberculosis treatment outcomes.

In contrast to the plethora of work on micronutrients and tuberculosis treatment outcomes, few studies have prospectively investigated the role of preexisting vitamin A status in the development of tuberculosis disease. Cegielski et al observed that < 2% of the US-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1 cohort had baseline vitamin A levels < 300 µg/L (< 1.05 µmol/L), and tuberculosis disease developed in only 61 persons during 20 years of follow-up. Although tuberculosis incidence was nearly 3-fold higher among those with low vitamin A levels, CIs for the hazard ratio ranged from.70 to 11.4. These results are consistent with findings from a study conducted in Philadelphia between 1942 and 1949, in which African American men with low baseline vitamin A levels were 3 times more likely to develop tuberculosis disease than those with higher levels. Interestingly, the mean vitamin A level was 300 µg/L (1.05 µmol/L), suggesting that the comparison was between men with low and very low levels, rather than among persons with the spectrum of levels we observed in Lima.

### Isoniazid-associated pellagra during mass scale-up of tuberculosis preventive therapy: a case-control study [^113gYxvd]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

People with isoniazid-associated pellagra, although a rare condition, benefited from simple interventions, including prompt discontinuation of isoniazid and completion of a 30-day course of multi-B vitamins. Isoniazid retains a critical, lifesaving role in preventing and treating tuberculosis. As with other potential adverse effects, a risk of pellagra ought not to preclude people living with HIV from the benefits of isoniazid in tuberculosis prevention. Rather, programmes might wish to enhance patient education and pharmaco-vigilance. Currently, some national guidelines call for the co-administration of vitamin B6, a cofactor in the kynurenine pathway, with IPT to prevent neuropathy. Co-administration of vitamin B6 showed a modest protective effect in this study. Niacin-containing multi-B vitamin co-administration with isoniazid as pellagra prevention is worth exploring. Finally, addressing structural inequities and implementing innovative population-level fortification strategies in under-nourished populations remain urgent, still unfulfilled public health solutions. In their absence, targeted food supplementation and fortification efforts for people living with HIV starting isoniazid-containing regimens, particularly people living with HIV facing food insecurity and lactating women, might prevent pellagra.

### Linezolid in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^1131GNHW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Linezolid is a new antibiotic with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and in animal studies. Several small case series suggest that linezolid is poorly tolerated because of the side effects of anemia/thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy. To characterize our clinical experience with linezolid, the California Department of Public Health Tuberculosis Control Branch's Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Service reviewed cases in which the MDR-TB treatment regimens included linezolid therapy.

Methods

Record review was performed for 30 patients treated with linezolid as part of an MDR-TB regimen. Data were collected on clinical and microbiological characteristics, linezolid tolerability, and treatment outcomes. The dosage of linezolid was 600 mg daily. Vitamin B6 at a dosage of 50–100 mg daily was used to mitigate hematologic toxicity.

Results

During 2003–2007, 30 patients received linezolid for the treatment of MDR-TB. Patients had isolates resistant to a median of 5 drugs (range, 2–13 drugs). Of the 30 cases, 29 (97%) were pulmonary; of these 29, 21 (72%) had positive results of acid-fast bacilli smear, and 16 (55%) were cavitary. Culture conversion occurred in all pulmonary cases at a median of 7 weeks. At data censure (31 December 2008), 22 (73%) of 30 patients had successfully completed treatment. Five continued to receive treatment. There were no deaths. Three patients had a poor outcome, including 2 defaults and 1 treatment failure. Side effects occurred in 9 patients, including peripheral and optic neuropathy, anemia/thrombocytopenia, rash, and diarrhea. However, only 3 patients stopped linezolid treatment because of side effects.

Conclusions

Linezolid was well tolerated, had low rates of discontinuation, and may have efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^114r4z2G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE methodology, and displayed the results in two 'Summary of findings' tables (Table 1; Table 2). 'Moderate' quality evidence implies we can have some confidence in the result, but further research evidence would still be helpful. 'Low' and 'very low' quality reflect decreasing levels of confidence in the result.

The quality of evidence was mainly downgraded under 'directness' and 'precision'. Directness is an assessment of how well the evidence matches the PICO question being asked (population, intervention, control, outcome). Because nutritional deficiencies are likely to differ widely among populations, it is difficult to generalize the results of one or two trials to other settings or subgroups. Precision involves an assessment of the statistical and clinical significance of the result, and also whether the sample size of the trials is adequate to reliably detect an effect. Most of these trials were small and well below the optimal information size for the outcomes that were being measured.

Potential biases in the review process

We minimized biases in the review process by performing a comprehensive search of the literature for relevant published, unpublished, and ongoing trials and by independently selecting and appraising the studies, and extracting the data in duplicate. Where data was missing, we sought additional information and data directly from the study authors where this was possible to do so. We did not conduct an extensive hand‐search for grey literature. Therefore, the review is at risk of publication bias from less prominent trials. We attempted to reduce this risk by identifying relevant conference abstracts and registered ongoing trials. The search of the trials registry to identify trial protocols and ongoing trials yielded 16 potentially relevant trial protocols. These will require further assessment and exploration to either: 1) link them to trials already included in the review; or 2) if not included, to attempt to obtain the completed trial reports. This task is time‐consuming and has to be balanced against feasibility and time constraints.

### Reconsidering the role of isoniazid in drug-resistant tuberculosis [^116mQ5Vr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the short-term safety of the higher dosing strategy appeared acceptable in INHindsight, doses of more than 5 mg/kg were historically usually used for intermittent therapy and have not been extensively evaluated in randomized studies under conditions of daily dosing. In the Katiyar trial, participants on higher doses had a higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy, despite pyridoxine prophylaxis. Slow acetylators, who may be most likely to benefit from higher doses, would also be subject to a higher risk of side effects, particularly drug-induced liver injury. Doses higher than 20 mg/kg have rarely been described in the literature, and a truly personalized dosing strategy would require access to practical and cost-effective methods of determining NAT2 status, which are not currently commercially available.

INHindsight suggests that higher-dose INH can only be expected to be effective in a minority of people who harbor inhA-mutated strains alone. It may, therefore, retain a role in individualized MDR-TB regimens based on genotypic susceptibility testing or in the minority whose strains are rifampicin monoresistant. In the context of standardized regimens, for which people with katG-mutated strains are currently considered eligible, these new data suggest that the balance of benefits and harms is likely to be adverse. Although many national TB programs have deployed shorter regimens containing higher-dose INH in recent years, to the benefit of patients with MDR-TB globally, alternative regimens containing fewer drugs at even shorter durations and containing no residual first-line drugs have already been recommended by the World Health Organization. The wider lesson of this work is that there is a need for a clearer framework in which developers of novel TB regimens can intelligently integrate information about pharmacology, susceptibility, and outcomes to prioritize the best regimens for pivotal clinical trials. Although the case of INH may be a special one, the innovative approach of INHindsight points the way to more rational construction of dose-optimized regimens in drug-resistant TB.

### Micronutrient supplementation in adults with HIV infection [^11642w17]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Selection of studies

Two review authors (MV and SD) independently screened the titles and abstracts identified through the electronic searches for potentially eligible citations for full‐text screening. In the case of uncertainty regarding eligibility, we screened the full‐text article(s). Two review authors (MV and SD) screened full‐text articles using a standardized eligibility form based on the inclusion criteria of the review. In the case of disagreement or uncertainty, a third review author (NS) provided their opinion. We listed all studies that we excluded after full‐text assessment and their reasons for exclusion in a ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table. We constructed a PRISMA diagram to illustrate the study selection process.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (MV and SD) independently extracted data from the included trials for the review update using an updated standardized electronic data extraction form. We extracted the following information from each trial.

Administrative details: trial identification number; author(s); published or unpublished; year of publication
Details of the trial: country and location of trial, trial design, duration and completeness of follow‐up; informed consent and ethics approval, source of funding
Details of participants: age, gender, disease progression according to clinical staging, relevant baseline characteristics including CD4 count and viral load
Details of intervention and control group: type, dosage, and frequency of micronutrient(s); additional co‐interventions (such as ART, tuberculosis treatment, or other management of opportunistic infections)
Details of outcomes: all prespecified outcomes and any additional outcomes reported in the study; adverse events and toxicity
Details of data analysis: numbers and reported statistics for each reported outcome. Where trial outcomes were reported in more than one reference, we used all the trial reports to extract data as comprehensively as possible

We entered data into the Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) software (Review Manager 5). The trial ID for each included trial consisted of the name of the first trial author followed by the date of publication and the country code where the study was conducted (see Appendix 6).

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112dBfcz]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent TB disease — indications include a positive screening test for LTBI with no evidence of active TB disease and no prior history of treatment for active disease or LTBI, and close contact with a person with infectious TB regardless of screening test result. Preferred therapy is isoniazid 300 mg by mouth (PO) daily plus pyridoxine 25–50 mg PO daily (AI) for 9 months. Alternative therapies include once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg PO with pyridoxine 50 mg PO for 12 weeks with a 900 mg maximum rifapentine dose and weight-based doses of 750 mg for those weighing 32.1–49.9 kg and 900 mg for those weighing ≥ 50.0 kg; note that rifapentine is only recommended for patients receiving an efavirenz- or raltegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. Another alternative is rifampin 600 mg PO daily for 4 months (BI). For persons exposed to drug-resistant TB, select anti-TB drugs after consultation with experts or with public health authorities.

### The 3 HP regimen for tuberculosis preventive treatment: safety, dosage and related concerns during its large-scale implementation in countries like India [^115TMgdH]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

The necessity of co-administration of pyridoxine with the 3 HP regimen needs to take into account the dose of isoniazid involved. In persons administered standard dose isoniazid (5 mg/kg daily), pyridoxine supplementation (25–50 mg daily) is co-administered to prevent peripheral neuropathy, in individuals at risk such as those with malnutrition, chronic alcohol dependence, HIV infection, renal failure or diabetes, or who are pregnant or breastfeeding, who can develop neuropathy even with the standard dose. Individuals who are slow acetylators may also be at higher risk. The 3 HP regimen is a high dose isoniazid regimen, as it involves administration of a 3-fold dose of isoniazid (900 mg instead of a maximum of 300 mg), although once weekly. In such a regimen, pyridoxine has been considered necessary in the context of daily use in drug-resistant tuberculosis. The current therapy for drug-susceptible tuberculosis does not provide universal access to pyridoxine in India, although a significant proportion of Indian patients are at risk of INH induced neurotoxicity due to prevalent undernutrition, diabetes and alcohol use. The current WHO guidelines acknowledge that subjects at risk should be given pyridoxine, but also states that the nonavailability of pyridoxine should not be a reason to withhold TPT. The status of pyridoxine deficiency in Indians has not been adequately assessed, but a recent study conducted in apparently healthy adults (less than 5% had low BMI) revealed multiple micronutrient deficiencies of which pyridoxine deficiency in 46% (30% in mild form and 16% in severe form) was the second most common. We would argue that given the population at risk and the higher doses of INH that will be administered it would be prudent to consider pyridoxine as an essential rather than optional adjunct to isoniazid used in the 3 HP regimen.

The RCTs of 3 HP regimen did not administer pyridoxine as a routine and therefore it is not known if some of these adverse events could have been mitigated with co-administration of pyridoxine. A recent randomised clinical trial showed significant reduction of some of the CNS (e.g. dizziness) and GI related adverse drug reactions of quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori when pyridoxine was used as an adjunct.

### Two dosing regimens of certolizumab pegol in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis [^1173Au1r]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

Patients

Eligible patients were age ≥ 18 years, with a diagnosis of adult-onset RA (6 months–15 years); all had moderate to severe active RA insufficiently controlled by MTX. Patients must have had active disease, defined by ≥ 6 tender joints, ≥ 4 swollen joints (of 28 joints), ≥ 10 mg/dl C-reactive protein level and/or 28 mm/hour erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and be rheumatoid factor or anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positive. All had ≥ 3 months MTX treatment (10–25 mg/week) with a stable dose for ≥ 2 months prior to the baseline visit.

Patients who failed to respond to previous anti-TNF treatment were excluded. Anti-TNF responders who later discontinued that drug due to loss of efficacy or other reasons were eligible, provided that previous biologic therapy was stopped ≥ 3 months before baseline, except for etanercept or anakinra (1 month). Concomitant treatment was allowed with analgesics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent, ≤ 10 mg/day). Corticosteroid doses could be reduced according to local guidelines; dose increases were not permitted. Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of any other inflammatory arthritis, secondary noninflammatory arthritis, history of chronic infections, serious infections, lymphoproliferative disorder, malignancy or demyelinating disease, history of or currently active tuberculosis (TB), a positive chest radiograph for TB or a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (≥ 5 mm) or close contact with individuals with active TB. Patients positive for PPD could be included if active TB was ruled out and they were adequately treated for latent TB (e.g. isonicotine acid hydrazide therapy for 9 months [with vitamin B6]), with treatment initiated ≥ 1 month prior to study drug administration. Classical exclusion criteria for anti-TNF therapy were also applied.

### Impact of the increased recommended dosage of isoniazid on pyridoxine levels in children and adolescents [^111Yu73r]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Isoniazid exposure causes dose-dependent pyridoxine deficiency. Recently, the recommended dosage of isoniazid in children was increased from 5 (4–6) to 10 (10–15) mg/kg/day. We aimed to analyze longitudinally pyridoxine levels in a cohort of previously healthy children and adolescents treated with isoniazid. Mild symptom-free pyridoxine deficiency was observed in 4/75 (5.6%) and 3/40 (7.5%) at baseline and at 3-month follow-up, respectively. Classical age-related risk factors identified patients at risk of pyridoxine deficiency. Our preliminary results support current recommendations regarding pyridoxine supplementation in healthy children.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^111ohAoT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Sample size

Eleven of the 35 trials included less than 100 participants in their final analysis. To aid interpretation and inform future research we have calculated the optimal sample size to reliably demonstrate some suggested clinically important results (Appendix 3; Appendix 4).

As micronutrients are a cheap and easily administered intervention, even a small effect on tuberculosis treatment outcomes might be considered clinically important. For example, to demonstrate a reduction in death from the worldwide average of 5% to just 4% (a relative risk reduction of 20%); a sample size of over 13,000 participants would be necessary. This is far above the data included in this Cochrane Review. Similarly an increase in successful cure rate from 80% to 84% would require almost 3000 participants.

For full details of the included trials see the ' Characteristics of included studies ' table.

Excluded studies

We excluded 17 studies that we had thought were eligible after initial screening for the reasons we have given in the ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table. Five trials are currently awaiting classification pending further information from the author (Chandra 2004; Guzman‐Rivero 2013; Nagrale 2013; Nawas 2013; Al Mamun 2014). In addition we are aware of 17 potentially relevant ongoing or unpublished trials; see the ' Characteristics of ongoing studies ' table.

### The effects of anti-inflammatory agents as host-directed adjunct treatment of tuberculosis in humans: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113h8APb]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias and influence analysis across and within studies

A funnel plot and Egger's test for the outcome of rate of sputum smear conversion across studies did suggest a publication bias in trials involving vitamin D but not for those involving other anti-inflammatory treatments, in relation to this outcome (Additional file 2 :Supplementary Figs. 1 & 2). An Egger's test revealed an uneven spread of results of RCTs skewed at one side of the overall adjusted hazard ratio as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Seven RCTs were at low risk of bias for all aspects analysed according to the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. The study led by Nursyam and colleagues had an unclear risk bias due to selection bias (adequate sequence generation) and detection bias (blinding). Methods used in random sequence generation, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessments were not clearly or adequately described. Even though this could have affected the outcome, no evidence was found that it did. Selection bias was also observed in the trial by Pedral-Sampaio and colleagues, as it did not adequately describe a clear method used in random sequence generation. RCTs conducted by Daley, Mahakalkar, Mily, Wejse and Ralph had an unclear risk of attrition bias due to incomplete outcome data as a result of relatively high rates of loss to follow-up (LFU) of participants (> 20%). In addition, no evidence was found that it affected the overall final outcome of these studies, since the LFU was similar amongst groups. Some reasons for the LFU common to these studies included defaulting, death or transfer of patients to other locations of residence or for treatment. Details on the risk of bias assessment are provided in supplementary Table 2 (Additional file 2). There was a low statistical heterogeneity observed between/within treatments using other anti-inflammatory agents (I² = 11.2%, p = 0.342), compared to the vitamin D supplementation group (I² = 69.5%, p = 0.006) in the proportion of the rate of sputum smear conversion (Fig. 2 & Fig. 3). The high heterogeneity observed in the vitamin D supplementation group could be as a result of the different adjunct treatment doses administered, timing (Table 1) or duration of treatment (Table 3). The exclusion of the study from Salahuddin et al. reduced the between-study heterogeneity to 53.3%. Overall, influence analysis did not detect any relevant difference in the relative risk (RR) estimate when excluding single studies. Likewise, no study was excluded due to dubious decisions as a result of the sensitivity analysis conducted to exclude any study.

### Adjunctive vitamin D for treatment of active tuberculosis in India: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112ZKEeu]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D has immunomodulatory effects that might aid clearance of mycobacterial infection. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation would reduce time to sputum culture conversion in patients with active tuberculosis.

Methods

We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority trial at 13 sites in India. Treatment-naive patients who were sputum-smear positive, HIV negative, and had pulmonary tuberculosis were randomly assigned (1:1), with centrally labelled, serially numbered bottles, to receive standard active tuberculosis treatment with either supplemental high-dose oral vitamin D3 (four doses of 2·5 mg at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6) or placebo. Neither the patients nor the clinical and laboratory investigators and personnel were aware of treatment assignment. The primary efficacy outcome was time to sputum culture conversion. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00366470.

Findings

Between Jan 20, 2010, and Aug 23, 2011, we randomly assigned 247 participants to the vitamin D group (n = 121) or the placebo group (n = 126), of whom 211 participants (n = 101 and n = 110, respectively) were included in the primary efficacy analysis. Median time to culture conversion in the vitamin D group was 43·0 days (95% CI 33·3–52·8) versus 42·0 days (33·9–50·1) in the placebo group (log-rank p = 0·95). Three (2%) patients died in the vitamin D group and one (1%) patient died in the placebo group; no death was considered attributable to the study intervention. No patients had hypercalcaemia.

Interpretation

Our findings show that vitamin D supplementation did not reduce time to sputum culture conversion. Further studies should investigate the role of vitamin D in prevention or reactivation of tuberculosis infection.

### Vitamin D as supplementary treatment for tuberculosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^114NBuDy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

Vitamin D has been shown to be involved in the host immune response toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Objectives

To test whether vitamin D supplementation of patients with tuberculosis (TB) improved clinical outcome and reduced mortality.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in TB clinics at a demographic surveillance site in Guinea-Bissau. We included 365 adult patients with TB starting antituberculosis treatment; 281 completed the 12-month follow-up. The intervention was 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo at inclusion and again 5 and 8 months after the start of treatment.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was reduction in a clinical severity score (TBscore) for all patients with pulmonary TB. The secondary outcome was 12-month mortality. No serious adverse effects were reported; mild hypercalcemia was rare and present in both arms. Reduction in TBscore and sputum smear conversion rates did not differ among patients treated with vitamin D or placebo. Overall mortality was 15% (54 of 365) at 1 year of follow-up and similar in both arms (30 of 187 for vitamin D treated and 24 of 178 for placebo; relative risk, 1.19 [0.58–1.95]). HIV infection was seen in 36% (131 of 359): 21% (76 of 359) HIV-1, 10% (36 of 359) HIV-2, and 5% (19 of 357) HIV-1+2.

Conclusions

Vitamin D does not improve clinical outcome among patients with TB and the trial showed no overall effect on mortality in patients with TB; it is possible that the dose used was insufficient. Clinical trial registered with www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn (ISRCTN35212132).

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115TzEh7]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Undernutrition is a major risk factor for tuberculosis (TB), which is estimated to be responsible for 1.9million TB cases per year globally. The effectiveness of micronutrient supplementation on TB treatment outcomes and its prognostic markers (sputum conversion, serum zinc, retinol and haemoglobin levels) has been poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effect of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and TB treatment outcomes among adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB.

Methods

A systematic literature search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed in PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases. Meta-analysis with a random effect model was performed to estimate risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD), with a 95% CI, for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively.

Results

Our search identified 2195 records. Of these, nine RCTs consisting of 1375 participants were included in the final analyses. Among adults with pulmonary TB, zinc (RR: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.86 to 1.03), vitamin A (RR: 0.90, 95%CI: 0.80 to 1.01) and combined zinc and vitamin A (RR: 0.98, 95%CI: 0.89 to 1.08) supplementation were not significantly associated with TB treatment success. Combined zinc and vitamin A supplementation was significantly associated with increased sputum smear conversion at 2 months (RR: 1.16, 95%CI: 1.03 to 1.32), serum zinc levels at 2 months (MD: 0.86μmol/L, 95%CI: 0.14 to 1.57), serum retinol levels at 2 months (MD: 0.06μmol/L, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.08) and 6 months (MD: 0.12μmol/L, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.14) and serum haemoglobin level at 6 months (MD: 0.29μg/dL, 95%CI: 0.08 to 0.51), among adults with pulmonary TB.

Conclusions

Providing zinc and vitamin A supplementation to adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB during treatment may increase early sputum smear conversion, serum zinc, retinol and haemoglobin levels. However, the use of zinc, vitamin A or both was not associated with TB treatment success.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^112Q8xQ1]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Primary prophylaxis of tuberculosis (TB) exposure in children with and exposed to HIV includes a weekly 12-dose combination of isoniazid 15 mg/kg (rounded up to the nearest 50 or 100 mg; 900 mg maximum) with rifapentine dosed by weight as 10–14.0 kg: 300 mg; 14.1–25.0 kg: 450 mg; 25.1–32.0 kg: 600 mg; 32.1–49.9 kg: 750 mg; and ≥ 50.0 kg: 900 mg maximum; an alternative is isoniazid 10–15 mg/kg (max 300 mg) daily for 6–9 months; for isoniazid-resistant source cases, daily rifampin 15–20 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg/day) for 4 months is recommended, and for isoniazid- and rifampin-resistant (MDR-TB) cases consultation with a TB expert and local public health authorities is advised; drug–drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be considered for rifamycin-containing alternatives; prophylaxis should be discontinued only with documented severe adverse events; and adjunctive pyridoxine 1–2 mg/kg once daily (maximum 25–50 mg/day) with isoniazid is recommended for the specified groups.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113wi88x]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) adjuvant treatment and special issues — children with and exposed to HIV: Adjuvant treatment includes co-trimoxazole prophylaxis; pyridoxine 1–2 mg/kg body weight/day (maximum 25–50 mg/day) with isoniazid or cycloserine/terizidone, if malnourished, and pyridoxine supplementation is recommended for exclusively breastfed infants and for children and adolescents on meat- and milk-deficient diets; children with nutritional deficiencies, including all children with HIV; and pregnant girls and women; corticosteroids (2 mg/kg body weight per day of prednisone [maximum 60 mg/day] or its equivalent for 4–6 weeks followed by tapering) with TB meningitis; may be considered with pleural effusions, pericarditis, severe airway compression, or severe IRIS; for second-line drug doses, consult with an expert as dosing guidelines continue to evolve with emerging data; some experts recommend using a daily rifampin dose of 20–30 mg/kg/day for infants and toddlers.

### Adequacy of recommendations for adverse event management in national and international treatment guidelines for rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis: a systematic review [^117UEsk3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of tables, figures, and algorithms can help users find key recommendations quickly and work through complex clinical decision-making, as in the management of suspected drug-induced liver injury. Half of the guidelines contained at least one table or figure devoted to adverse event management (Table 3, Supplementary Materials, pages 14–15).

Table 3
Ease of use and specificity of recommendations among guidelines providing recommendations for adverse event management (n, %).

The inclusion and numbers of such tables and figures paralleled the presence of recommendations for adverse event management, being more common in non-governmental and high-burden country guidelines. There were gaps in providing clear direction to sections on adverse event management. For example, the United States treatment guideline included adverse event management in a section entitled "Practical aspects of treatment". Only 5 guidelines included functional weblinks to additional information. 27 guidelines (59%) contained recommendations for specific medications for treatment of adverse events, 19 of which included recommendations for specific doses. Notably, most of these specific recommendations were for pyridoxine for the treatment of neuropathy (Table 3, Supplementary Materials pages 14–15). Three guidelines included notes about drug–drug interactions that may affect treatment of adverse events, though no guidelines noted the drug–drug interactions between rifampicin and commonly used anti-emetic medications (ondansetron, metoclopramide), and a commonly used proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole).

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^1122dbbn]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Plasma concentrations in critically ill patients

During critical illness, vitamin B 6 deficiency can result from malnutrition, increased demands, and medications interfering with its metabolism. Risk factors include HIV infection and treatment, alcoholic hepatitis, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, tuberculosis treatment with isoniazide, and chronic kidney and liver diseases. Vitamin B 6 status (plasma and erythrocyte PLP) may boost the antioxidant activity in surgical ICU patients. Two observational studies tested the association between vitamin B 6 status and clinical outcomes (see Table S7). No association was found between vitamin B 6 intake or status and ICU or hospital length of stay or ventilation duration. However, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were significantly lower on ICU day 7 in patients with plasma PLP ≥ 20 nmol/L compared with < 20 nmol/L measured on day 1.

Clinical studies testing high doses

In ICU patients, vitamin B 6 can support protein metabolism and immune response and prevent or treat peripheral neuropathy and seizures. In vitamin B 6 –deficient patients, impaired cellular immunity has been reported, mainly because of a low T 4 lymphocyte count. Fourteen days of pyridoxine supplementation (50–100 mg/day) led to a significant increase in the total lymphocytic count as well as the T‐helper and T‐suppressor cells compared with the control group in an interventional ICU study (n = 51),(see Table S8). It was also suggested to prevent and treat anemia, particularly sideroblastic anemia. Recently, Wang et al showed no 28‐day mortality benefit when supplementing IV vitamin B 6 (300 mg/day for 1 week) vs 0.9% saline to 128 patients with sepsis and AKI. However, it reduced ICU stay, improved renal functions at day 7, diminished inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL] 6, IL‐8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and endothelin‐1), and mitigated the oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione, and malondialdehyde). Nevertheless, the small sample size and lower mortality than expected by the APACHE II score warrant further studies. It is important to monitor vitamin B 6 levels, because prolonged high doses can lead to toxicity manifested predominantly as peripheral neuropathy.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^1173WyyR]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

The ATS and CDC guidelines also included 4 months of rifampicin (RMP) alone or 2 months of RMP and pyrazinamide (PZA) as acceptable alternatives for the treatment of LTBI. The RMP alone is recommended for persons intolerant to INH, close contacts of TB cases in which the isolate of M. tuberculosis is resistant to INH or INH resistance is suspected due to the origin of foreign-born persons from countries where INH resistance rates are high. There are several advantages with 4 month daily therapy with RMP such as lower cost, higher adherence to treatment and fewer adverse reactions including hepatotoxicity. However, treatment with RMP alone is not recommended for HIV-seropositive persons on concomitant anti-retroviral therapy as this may lead to the development of acquired rifamycin resistance. Furthermore, active disease in an HIV-infected individual should be ruled out first since monodrug therapy in an undiagnosed active TB disease case may also lead to RMP resistance. However, active TB disease is more difficult to exclude in HIV-infected individuals as they are less likely to have typical features of pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB occurs more frequently. The regimen of RMP alone is also not suitable for patients with other underlying conditions such as diabetes.

Treatment of LTBI with RMP + PZA for 4 months is another alternative choice that was advocated by ATS and CDC guidelines in 2000. Although initial studies with 2 months of RMP + PZA in HIV-infected persons were reported to be as effective and safe as INH treatment, several cases of severe liver injury and/or death were reported subsequently with the RMP + PZA regimen resulting in revision of ATS/CDC recommendations in 2003. The revised guidelines advocated that 2 months of RMP + PZA regimen should not generally be offered to HIV-seronegative or HIV-seropositive individuals. A meta-analysis involving six clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of 2 months of RMP + PZA with 6 or 12 months of INH treatment showed that RMP + PZA regimen was associated with increased risk of hepatotoxicity in HIV seronegative persons while the results for HIV-infected persons were inconclusive. However, when the results of 2 months of RMP + PZA were compared with 6 months of INH treatment without supplementation with pyridoxine in HIV-infected persons, the data showed no significant differences in hepatotoxicity in the two sub-groups. The results of some studies suggest that 2 months of RMP + PZA regimen may also be considered when other regimens are unsuitable and monitoring of liver function tests is feasible.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^1146GMP9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis is a serious infection affecting mainly the lungs. It may contribute to nutritional deficiencies which in turn may delay recovery by depressing immune functions. Nutritional supplements might therefore promote recovery in people being treated for tuberculosis.

Objectives

To assess the provision of oral nutritional supplements to promote the recovery of people being treated with antituberculous drug therapy for active tuberculosis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register (June 2008), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE (June 2008), EMBASE (June 2008), LILACS (June 2008), mRCT (June 2008), the Indian Journal of Tuberculosis (1983 to June 2008), and checked the reference lists of all included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing any oral nutritional supplement given for at least four weeks with no nutritional intervention, placebo, or dietary advice only for people being treated for active tuberculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled data from trials with similar interventions and outcomes.

Main Results

Twelve trials (3393 participants) were included. Five trials had adequate allocation concealment. Interventions included a high energy supplement, high cholesterol diet, vitamin D, vitamin A, zinc, arginine, multiple micronutrient supplements, combined multiple micronutrient supplements and zinc, combined vitamin A and zinc, and combined vitamin A and selenium. The following supplements were associated with increased body weight at follow up: high energy supplements (MD 1.73 kg, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.65; 34 participants, 1 trial); multiple micronutrients plus additional zinc (MD 2.37 kg, 95% CI 2.21 to 2.53; 192 participants, 1 trial); and vitamin A plus zinc (MD 3.10 kg, 95% CI 0.74 to 5.46; 80 participants, 1 trial). There was no evidence that any supplement affected the number of deaths or number of participants with sputum test positive results at the end of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence that high energy supplements and some combinations of zinc with other micronutrients may help people with tuberculosis to gain weight. There is not enough evidence to assess the effect of other combinations of nutrients. A number of relevant trials are in progress, and, where appropriate, the results will be incorporated into future updates of this review.

### Effect of micronutrient supplementation on treatment outcomes in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis: a randomized controlled trial [^112nCwiD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Micronutrients play an important role in immune function. To our knowledge, there have been no comprehensive studies on the role of micronutrient supplementation in children with tuberculosis.

Objective

We assessed the effect of micronutrient supplementation in children treated with antituberculosis therapy (ATT).

Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that used a 2 × 2 factorial design was undertaken at 2 teaching hospitals in Delhi. Children with newly diagnosed intrathoracic tuberculosis were enrolled, and they received ATT together with daily supplementation for 6 mo with either zinc alone, micronutrients without zinc, micronutrients in combination with zinc, or a placebo. Main outcomes were weight gain and an improvement in a chest X-ray (CXR) lesion assessed at 6 mo of treatment.

Results

A total of 403 children were enrolled and randomly assigned. A microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed in 179 children (44.4%). The median (95% CI) increase in weight-for-age z score at 6 mo was not significantly different between subjects who received micronutrients [0.75 (0.66, 0.84)] and those who did not receive micronutrients [0.76 (0.67, 0.85)] and between subjects who received zinc [0.76 (0.68, 0.85)] and those who did not receive zinc [0.75 (0.66, 0.83)]. An improvement in CXR was observed in 285 children, but there was no difference between those receiving zinc and no zinc or between those receiving micronutrients and no micronutrients after 6 mo of ATT. However, children who received micronutrients had a faster gain in height over 6 mo than did those who did not receive micronutrients (height-for-age z score Δ = 0.08; P = 0.014).

Conclusions

Micronutrient supplementation did not modify the weight gain or clearance of lesions on CXR in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis. However, micronutrient supplementation during treatment may improve height gain in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00801606.

### Individual and composite adverse pregnancy outcomes in a randomized trial on isoniazid preventative therapy among women living with human immunodeficiency virus [^1162omeH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

IMPAACT P1078 enrolled pregnant women living with HIV at ≥ 14 through to ≤ 34 weeks and 6 days gestation. The study population was at high risk for TB infection and disease due to residing in 8 high–TB prevalence countries, defined as having 60 or more TB cases per 100 000 population in the WHO TB annual report (sub-Saharan Africa: Botswana, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe; Asia: India and Thailand; and Central America: Haiti). Women with suspected or confirmed TB disease were excluded.

Women were randomized to receive either 28 weeks of IPT or placebo. The immediate arm initiated IPT in pregnancy, while the deferred arm initiated IPT at 12 weeks postpartum. Women also received vitamin B6 and multivitamins from study entry until 40 weeks postpartum.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^113fQPtC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis and malnutrition are linked in a complex relationship. The infection may cause undernutrition through increased metabolic demands and decreased intake, and nutritional deficiencies may worsen the disease, or delay recovery by depressing important immune functions. At present, there are no evidence-based nutritional guidance for adults and children being treated for tuberculosis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral nutritional supplements (food, protein/energy supplements or micronutrients) on tuberculosis treatment outcomes and recovery in people on antituberculous drug therapy for active tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, mRCT, and the Indian Journal of Tuberculosis to July 2011, and checked the reference lists of all included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing any oral nutritional supplement given for at least four weeks with no nutritional intervention, placebo, or dietary advice only for people being treated for active tuberculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Results are presented as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables, and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, data from trials with similar interventions and outcomes have been pooled. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methods.

Main Results

Twenty-three trials, with 6842 participants, were included. Macronutrient supplementation Five trials assessed the provision of free food, or high energy supplements, although none were shown to provide a total daily kilocalorie intake above the current daily recommended intake for the non-infected population. The available trials were too small to reliably prove or exclude clinically important benefits on mortality, cure, or treatment completion. One small trial from India did find a statistically significant benefit on treatment completion, and clearance of the bacteria from the sputum, but these findings have not been confirmed in larger trials elsewhere (VERY LOW quality evidence). The provision of free food or high-energy nutritional products probably does produce a modest increase in weight gain during treatment for active tuberculosis (MODERATE quality evidence). Two small studies provide some evidence that physical function and quality of life may also be improved but the trials were too small to have much confidence in the result (LOW quality evidence). These effects were not seen in the one trial which included only human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Micronutrient supplementation Five trials assessed multi-micronutrient supplementation in doses up to ten times the dietary reference intake, and 12 trials assessed single or dual micronutrient supplementation. There is insufficient evidence to judge whether multi-micronutrients have a beneficial effect on mortality in HIV- negative patients with tuberculosis (VERY LOW quality evidence), but the available studies show that multi-micronutrients probably have little or no effect on mortality in HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis (MODERATE quality evidence). No studies have assessed the effects of multi-micronutrients on cure, or treatment completion. Multi-micronutrient supplements may have little or no effect on the proportion of tuberculosis patients remaining sputum positive during the first eight weeks (LOW quality evidence), and probably have no effect on weight gain during treatment (MODERATE quality evidence). No studies have assessed quality of life. Plasma levels of vitamin A appear to increase following initiation of tuberculosis treatment regardless of supplementation. In contrast, plasma levels of zinc, vitamin D and E, and selenium may be improved by supplementation during the early stages of tuberculosis treatment, but a consistent benefit on tuberculosis treatment outcomes or nutritional recovery has not been demonstrated.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient research to know whether routinely providing free food or energy supplements results in better tuberculosis treatment outcomes, or improved quality of life. Further trials, particularly from food insecure settings, should have adequate sample sizes to identify, or exclude, clinically important benefits. Although blood levels of some vitamins may be low in patients starting treatment for active tuberculosis, there is currently no reliable evidence that routinely supplementing at or above recommended daily amounts has clinical benefits.

### A trial of the effect of micronutrient supplementation on treatment outcome, T cell counts, morbidity, and mortality in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis [^1147JHX3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) often coincides with nutritional deficiencies. The effects of micronutrient supplementation on TB treatment outcomes, clinical complications, and mortality are uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of micronutrients (vitamins A, B complex, C, and E, as well as selenium) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We enrolled 471 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 416 HIV-negative adults with pulmonary TB at the time of initiating chemotherapy and monitored them for a median of 43 months.

Results

Micronutrients decreased the risk ofTB recurrence by 45% overall (95% confidence interval [CI] 7% to 67%; p = 0.02) and by 63% in HIV-infected patients (95% CI, 8% to 85%; p = 0.02). There were no significant effects on mortality overall; however, we noted a marginally significant 64% reduction of deaths in HIV-negative subjects (95% CI, -14% to 88%; p = 0.08). Supplementation increased CD3+ and CD4+ cell counts and decreased the incidence of extrapulmonary TB and genital ulcers in HIV-negative patients. Micronutrients reduced the incidence of peripheral neuropathy by 57% (95% CI, 41% to 69%; P < .001), irrespective of HIV status. There were no significant effects on weight gain, body composition, anemia, or HIV load.

Conclusions

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vitamin A and zinc supplementation in persons with tuberculosis in Indonesia: effects on clinical response and nutritional status [^117638gb]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The results of cross-sectional studies indicate that micronutrient deficiencies are common in patients with tuberculosis. No published data exist on the effect of vitamin A and zinc supplementation on antituberculosis treatment.

Objective

Our goal was to investigate whether vitamin A and zinc supplementation increases the efficacy of antituberculosis treatment with respect to clinical response and nutritional status.

Design

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis were divided into 2 groups. One group (n = 40) received 1500 retinol equivalents (5000 IU) vitamin A (as retinyl acetate) and 15 mg Zn (as zinc sulfate) daily for 6 mo (micronutrient group). The second group (n = 40) received a placebo. Both groups received the same antituberculosis treatment recommended by the World Health Organization. Clinical examinations, assessments of micronutrient status, and anthropometric measurements were carried out before and after 2 and 6 mo of antituberculosis treatment.

Results

At baseline, 64% of patients had a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) < 18.5, 32% had plasma retinol concentrations < 0.70 micromol/L, and 30% had plasma zinc concentrations < 10.7 micromol/L. After antituberculosis treatment, plasma zinc concentrations were not significantly different between groups. Plasma retinol concentrations were significantly higher in the micronutrient group than in the placebo group after 6 mo (P < 0.05). Sputum conversion (P < 0.05) and resolution of X-ray lesion area (P < 0.01) occurred earlier in the micronutrient group.

Conclusion

Vitamin A and zinc supplementation improves the effect of tuberculosis medication after 2 mo of antituberculosis treatment and results in earlier sputum smear conversion.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115Kf8sb]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Programmatic and adjunctive care for pediatric TB with HIV specify that treatment for TB disease should always be provided by DOT, and if ART-naive, start TB therapy immediately and initiate ART within 2 to 8 weeks; if already on ART, review regimen to minimize potential toxicities and drug interactions and start TB treatment immediately. Potential drug toxicity and interactions should be reviewed at every visit, and drug interactions with ART should be considered for all rifamycin-containing alternatives. Adjunctive treatment includes co-trimoxazole prophylaxis; pyridoxine 1–2 mg/kg body weight/day (maximum 25–50 mg/day) with isoniazid or cycloserine/terizidone, if malnourished, and pyridoxine supplementation is recommended for exclusively breastfed infants and for children and adolescents on meat- and milk-deficient diets; children with nutritional deficiencies, including all children with HIV; and pregnant girls and women. Corticosteroids (2 mg/kg body weight per day of prednisone [maximum 60 mg/day] or its equivalent for 4–6 weeks followed by tapering) with TB meningitis; may be considered with pleural effusions, pericarditis, severe airway compression, or severe IRIS.

### US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus recommendations for the management of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in individuals with cystic fibrosis [^116M44gM]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Does vitamin D supplementation improve treatment outcomes in individuals with CF who have NTM-PD?

Recommendation 43: The CF Foundation and the ECFS recommend that vitamin D should be supplemented according to national CF care guidelines.

Vitamin D is thought to play a critical role in host defence against mycobacteria. In vitro and ex vivo treatment with vitamin D of human macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis enhances intracellular killing (through stimulating antimicrobial peptide productionand autophagy.) Furthermore, several epidemiological studies have shown an association of vitamin D deficiency with reactivation of TBand, recently, the presence of NTM-PD. However, interventional trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with active pulmonary TB have had mixed results, and there are no trials of vitamin D as an adjuvant treatment for NTM disease.

Should surgery be considered in individuals with CF who have NTM-PD?

Recommendation 44: The CF Foundation and the ECFS recommend that lung resection should only be considered under extraordinary circumstances and in consultation with experts on the treatment of NTM and CF.

Surgical resection has been used extensively in the management of pulmonary mycobacterial infection in order to excise localised infection, debulk severe disease, or excise cavities or damaged lung into which antibiotic penetration may be impaired. In no cases has surgery been used as a substitute for antibiotic therapy. There are no randomised trials of surgery for the treatment of pulmonary NTM disease in any patient group. While many publications report the use of lung resection (pneumonectomy, lobectomy or segmentectomy) with combination antibiotic therapy in NTM infection, most are case reports with no comparator group receiving only medical therapy thereby preventing objective assessment of the efficacy of surgery.

### Vitamin D and tuberculosis: where next? [^115Co2CH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) has troubled mankind for millennia, but current treatment strategies are long and complicated and the disease remains a major global health problem. The risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection or progression of active TB disease is elevated in individuals with vitamin D deficiency. High-dose vitamin D was used to treat TB in the preantibiotic era, and in vitro experimental data show that vitamin D supports innate immune responses that restrict growth of Mtb. Several randomized controlled trials have tested whether adjunctive vitamin D supplementation enhances the clinical and microbiological response to standard antimicrobial chemotherapy for pulmonary TB. The effects have been modest at best, and attention is turning to the question of whether vitamin D supplementation might have a role in preventing acquisition or reactivation of latent Mtb infection. In this article, we describe the effects of vitamin D on host immune responses to Mtb in vitro and in vivo and review the results of clinical trials in the field. We also reflect on the findings of clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of acute respiratory tract infections, and discuss how these findings might influence the design of future trials to evaluate the role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of TB.

### High-dose vitamin D3 in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115X29Ju]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is a major global health problem. Individuals with tuberculosis disease commonly exhibit vitamin D deficiency, which may adversely affect immunity and the response to therapy.

Objective

We determined whether adjunctive high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation improves outcomes in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease.

Design

The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, intent-to-treat trial in 199 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease in Tbilisi, Georgia. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin D3 [50,000 IUs (1.25 mg) thrice weekly for 8 wk and 50,000 IU every other week for 8 wk] or a placebo concomitant with standard first-line antituberculosis drugs. The primary outcome was the time for the conversion of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) sputum culture to negative.

Results

Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Most subjects (74%) were vitamin D deficient (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration < 50 nmol/L). With vitamin D3, plasma 25(OH)D concentrations peaked at ∼250 nmol/L by 8 wk and decreased to ∼125 nmol/L at week 16. Adverse events and plasma calcium concentrations were similar between groups. In 192 subjects with culture-confirmed tuberculosis, an adjusted efficacy analysis showed similar median culture-conversion times between vitamin D3 and placebo groups [29 and 27 d, respectively; HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.18; P = 0.33). Eight-week culture-conversion rates were also similar (84.0% and 82.1% for vitamin D3 and placebo, respectively; P = 0.99).

Conclusion

A high-dose vitamin D3 regimen safely corrected vitamin D deficiency but did not improve the rate of sputum Mtb clearance over 16 wk in this pulmonary tuberculosis cohort. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov at NCT00918086.

### How to manage neonatal tuberculosis [^115z53Va]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

This article reports the recommendations for managing neonatal tuberculosis (TB) drawn up by a group of Italian scientific societies. The Consensus Conference method was used, and relevant publications in English were identified through a systematic review of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from their inception until 31 December 2014. Group experts concluded that if suspicion is aroused, it is necessary to undertake promptly all of the investigations useful for identifying the disease not only in the newborn, but also in the mother and family contacts because a diagnosis of TB in the family nucleus can guide its diagnosis and treatment in the newborn. If the suspicion is confirmed, empirical treatment should be started. Breast-fed newborns being treated with isoniazid should be given pyridoxine supplementation at a dose of 1 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹. Mothers with active-phase TB can breast-feed once they have become smear negative after having received appropriate treatment.

### Association of serum vitamin D levels and dietary vitamin D intake with latent tuberculosis infection and long-term mortality: a population-based cohort study [^114rbQ1A]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). High credibility.

Despite these limitations, this study underscores the critical role of vitamin D in both LTBI risk and mortality among TB-infected populations. The observed association between vitamin D deficiency and increased susceptibility to LTBI and mortality highlights the need for targeted screening and intervention strategies. High-risk groups, including individuals with TB infection, poor nutritional status or coexisting chronic conditions, may benefit from routine vitamin D level assessments as part of comprehensive care. While the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing TB-related mortality remains uncertain, our findings suggest that addressing vitamin D deficiency could serve as a potential adjunctive measure in TB management, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of deficiency. From a public health perspective, integrating vitamin D fortification, supplementation programmes and awareness campaigns into broader TB prevention strategies may be beneficial. Additionally, this study highlights the need for high-quality, prospective research to better understand the mechanisms linking vitamin D levels to TB outcomes and mortality. Future studies should incorporate longitudinal designs, RCTs and more comprehensive assessments of vitamin D status, including genetic predisposition and bioavailability factors. Such research could refine clinical guidelines and inform public health policies, ultimately contributing to global TB control efforts and improving prevention and treatment strategies.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^114oawek]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis and malnutrition are linked in a complex relationship. Tuberculosis may cause undernutrition through increased metabolic demands and decreased intake, and nutritional deficiencies may worsen the disease, or delay recovery by depressing important immune functions. At present, there is no evidence-based nutritional guidance for adults and children being treated for tuberculosis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral nutritional supplements in people being treated with antituberculous drug therapy for active tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 1, 2016), MEDLINE (from 1946 to 4 February 2016), EMBASE (from 1980 to 4 February 2016), LILACS (from 1982 to 4 February 2016), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the Indian Journal of Tuberculosis up to 4 February 2016, and checked the reference lists of all included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared any oral nutritional supplement given for at least four weeks with no nutritional intervention, placebo, or dietary advice only for people being treated for active tuberculosis. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause death, and cure at six and 12 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. We presented the results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables, and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we pooled data from trials with similar interventions and outcomes. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Thirty-five trials, including 8283 participants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Macronutrient supplementationSix trials assessed the provision of free food, or high-energy supplements. Only two trials measured total dietary intake, and in both trials the intervention increased calorie consumption compared to controls. The available trials were too small to reliably prove or exclude clinically important benefits on mortality (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.20; four trials, 567 participants, very low quality evidence), cure (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.41; one trial, 102 participants, very low quality evidence), or treatment completion (data not pooled; two trials, 365 participants, very low quality evidence). Supplementation probably produces a modest increase in weight gain during treatment for active tuberculosis, although this was not seen consistently across all trials (data not pooled; five trials, 883 participants, moderate quality evidence). Two small studies provide some evidence that quality of life may also be improved but the trials were too small to have much confidence in the result (data not pooled; two trials, 134 participants, low quality evidence). Micronutrient supplementationSix trials assessed multi-micronutrient supplementation in doses up to 10 times the dietary reference intake, and 18 trials assessed single or dual micronutrient supplementation. Routine multi-micronutrient supplementation may have little or no effect on mortality in HIV-negative people with tuberculosis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.6; four trials, 1219 participants, low quality evidence), or HIV-positive people who are not taking antiretroviral therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23; three trials, 1429 participants, moderate quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to know if supplementation improves cure (no trials), treatment completion (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04; one trial, 302 participants, very low quality evidence), or the proportion of people who remain sputum positive during the first eight weeks (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.35; two trials, 1020 participants, very low quality evidence). However, supplementation may have little or no effect on weight gain during treatment (data not pooled; five trials, 2940 participants, low quality evidence), and no studies have assessed the effect on quality of life. Plasma levels of vitamin A appear to increase following initiation of tuberculosis treatment regardless of supplementation. In contrast, supplementation probably does improve plasma levels of zinc, vitamin D, vitamin E, and selenium, but this has not been shown to have clinically important benefits. Of note, despite multiple studies of vitamin D supplementation in different doses, statistically significant benefits on sputum conversion have not been demonstrated.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient research to know whether routinely providing free food, or energy supplements improves tuberculosis treatment outcomes, but it probably improves weight gain in some settings. Although blood levels of some vitamins may be low in people starting treatment for active tuberculosis, there is currently no reliable evidence that routinely supplementing above recommended daily amounts has clinical benefits.

### Vitamin D supplementation for preventing infections in children under five years of age [^113e28Bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is a micronutrient important for bone growth and immune function. Deficiency can lead to rickets and has been linked to various infections, including respiratory infections. The evidence on the effects of supplementation on infections in children has not been assessed systematically.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in preventing pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), diarrhoea, and malaria in children under five years of age. This includes high-, middle-, and low-income countries.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov and the ISRCTN registry (http://www.isrctn.com/) up to 16 June 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated preventive supplementation of vitamin D (versus placebo or no intervention) in children under five years of age.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias of included trials.

Main Results

Four trials met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 3198 children under five years of age, and were conducted in Afghanistan, Spain, and the USA. Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varied widely in these populations (range: 73.1% in Afghanistan, 10 to 12% in USA, and 6.2% in Spain). The included trials evaluated mortality (two trials), pneumonia incidence (two trials), diarrhoea incidence (two trials), hospitalization (two trials), and mean serum vitamin D concentrations (four trials). We do not know whether vitamin D supplementation impacts on all-cause mortality because this outcome was underpowered due to few events (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 3.74; one trial, 3046 participants, low quality evidence). For pneumonia, episodes of 'radiologically confirmed' first or only episode of pneumonia were little different in the supplemented and unsupplemented group (Rate Ratio: 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.26; two trials, 3134 participants, moderate quality evidence), and similarly for children with confirmed or unconfirmed pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.04; one trial, 3046 participants). In these two trials there were no obvious differences between supplemented and unsupplemented children regarding episodes of diarrhoea. In the single large trial from Afghanistan, the trial authors reported that vitamin D supplementation was associated with an increase in repeat episodes of pneumonia confirmed by chest radiograph (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.21; one trial, 3046 participants), but not reflected in the outcome of confirmed or unconfirmed pneumonia (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13; one trial, 3046 participants). For hospital admission measured in one small trial, there was no difference detected (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.62; one trial, 88 participants; very low quality evidence). The mean serum vitamin D concentrations were higher in supplemented compared to unsupplemented children at the end of supplementation (MD 7.72 ng/mL, 95% CI 0.50 to 14.93; four trials, 266 participants, low quality evidence). These results were driven primarily by two smaller trials with large magnitudes of effect. In the other two bigger trials, serum vitamin D concentrations were elevated in the intervention group for most of the trial duration but not at the end of supplementation. This may be due to time elapsed at measurement from the last dose, incomplete compliance, or increased need of vitamin D with infant age. We did not find any trial that reported on the incidence of TB, malaria or febrile illness, duration of pneumonia, duration of diarrhoea, severity of infection, and cause-specific mortality (due to TB, diarrhoea, or malaria).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from one large trial did not demonstrate benefit of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of pneumonia or diarrhoea in children under five years. To our knowledge, trials that evaluated supplementation for preventing other infections, including TB and malaria, have not been performed.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RRwyU]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review followed the methods in the Cochrane handbook for the systematic review of interventions and was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The PRISMA checklist is included in online supplemental file 1.

The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42021248548).

Study selection and eligibility criteria

We included RCTs based on our research questions constructed using the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes and Studies) format.

Population

Adults with pulmonary TB, aged 15 and above, with acid-fast bacilli sputum smear-positive, Xpert positive or culture-positive drug-susceptible TB, with or without comorbidities or risk factors associated with TB including undernutrition, HIV infection and DM.

Intervention

The intervention comprised zinc (15–90 mg/day) or vitamin A (2500–5000 IU/day) supplementation or both, with follow-up for 6 months to evaluate clinical (sputum smear and culture conversion) and laboratory (serum levels of zinc, retinol and haemoglobin) parameters and TB treatment outcomes. Studies with co-interventions (eg, food supplements and nutritional advice) were eligible on the condition that the co-intervention was comparable in both arms.

Comparator

The comparator groups were those who received a placebo or no intervention.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of interest was a successful TB treatment outcome which was defined according to WHO definitions. A successful treatment outcome was defined as the sum of those who completed treatment and who were cured. Unsuccessful treatment outcome was defined as the combination of those who died, were lost to follow-up or experienced treatment failure. The secondary outcomes were prognostic markers including sputum smear and culture conversion, and serum zinc, retinol and haemoglobin levels. Serum zinc, retinol and haemoglobin levels were assessed before treatment, and after 2 and 6 months of treatment.

Studies

RCTs were included.

Exclusion criteria

We excluded studies conducted in children aged less than 15 years, people with extra-pulmonary TB and people with multidrug-resistant TB or any other form of drug resistance. We excluded interventions that provided non-specific multivitamin related interventions. Conference and meeting abstracts and papers in languages other than English, animal studies and those with insufficient information on the primary outcomes of interest were excluded.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the outcomes of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zM2cB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation can safely and effectively increase the proportion of sputum smear and culture conversion, but it may not have enough beneficial effects on time to sputum conversion. As this intervention is safe and low cost, it is considered a cost-effective strategy in treating patients with PTB. Thus, future rigorous RCTs are needed, particularly with different vitamin D dose, treatment duration, and follow-up based on vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and severities of diseases, to further determine the role of vitamin D in patients with PTB.

### Holistic care of complicated tuberculosis in healthcare settings with limited resources [^115aDFVN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Nutrition in all complicated forms of TB

Almost all children with TBM, chronic pulmonary TB and other forms of disseminated TB have weight loss, many have severe wasting and stunting. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor in turning latent TB into active TB, and a body mass index (BMI) < 16 is associated with significant higher mortality in adults with TB. Patients with active TB have decreased blood concentrations of micronutrients, including retinol, vitamins C and E, zinc, iron and selenium. If not addressed, the protein–calorie malnutrition worsens even after children commence treatment, because of chronic inflammation, anorexia (loss of appetite because of medications and general illness) and poor food intake.

Nutrition should be instituted as soon as possible, either orally or through nasogastric tube, according to WHO guidelines for the level of malnutrition, together with the TB drugs. Children with TB should be weighed regularly, given a nutritious diet, daily micronutrients and have their food intake monitored. Children on isoniazid should be on pyridoxine. Iron supplementation should be given to children with iron deficiency, as manifest by a low haemoglobin, low mean cell volume and a high red cell distribution width.

Administering nutrition to all those with malnutrition in a busy children's ward is a full-time job, so it is important to a well-functioning nutrition unit and nurses who are informed and enthusiastic about nutrition. Plotting weight, mid-upper arm circumference and BMI in older children helps monitor progress.

Identifying and treating comorbidity

All children with TB should have an HIV test, and if positive commenced on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a staged fashion. TB treatment should be started first, followed by ART as soon as possible thereafter, at least within 8 weeks of the start of TB treatment. Where a CD4 count can be done, if below 50 cells per mm³, ART should be commenced within 2 weeks of the start of TB treatment. WHO has detailed guidance for national TB programmes on the management of TB and HIV in children.

Tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy — diagnosis and maternal–fetal considerations include that the diagnostic evaluation for TB disease in pregnant women is the same as for non-pregnant adults, and chest radiographs with abdominal shielding are recommended and result in minimal fetal radiation exposure. While treatment with isoniazid should be delayed until after delivery, if the risk of progression to active TB disease is considered to outweigh the risk of adverse birth outcomes with isoniazid and isoniazid is prescribed, frequent monitoring is needed, and pregnant women receiving isoniazid should receive daily pyridoxine supplementation as they are at risk of isoniazid-associated peripheral neuropathy. In one study of 107 women with active TB disease during pregnancy in South Africa, M. tuberculosis was detected in 16% of neonates (n = 16) tested within the first 3 weeks of life (12 by culture and 4 by smear microscopy).

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the outcomes of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jth57]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is involved in the host immune response toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on sputum conversion, clinical response to treatment, adverse events, and mortality in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) remains controversial. We aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in PTB treatment.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science for double-blind, randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with PTB that reported sputum conversion, clinical response to treatment, adverse events, or mortality, published from database inception to November 26, 2017. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018081236.

Results

A total of 1787 patients with active PTB receiving vitamin D supplementation along with standard anti-tuberculosis regimen were included in the eight trials with different doses of vitamin D ranging from 1000 IU/day to 600,000 IU/month at different intervals. Primary analysis revealed that vitamin D supplementation increased the proportion of sputum smear and culture conversions (OR 1.21, 95%CI 1.05~1.39, z = 2.69, P = 0.007; OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.04~1.43, z = 2.41, P = 0.02), but did not improve the time to sputum smear and culture conversions (HR 1.07, 95%CI 0.83~1.37, z = 0.50, P = 0.62; HR 0.97, 95%CI 0.76~1.23, z = 0.29, P = 0.77). In the secondary analysis, vitamin D improved serum 25(OH)D, plasma calcium concentration, lymphocyte count, and chest radiograph (MD 103.36, 95%CI 84.20~122.53, z = 10.57, P < 0.00001; SMD 0.26, 95%CI 0.15~0.37, z = 4.61, P < 0.00001; MD 0.09, 95%CI 0.03~0.14, z = 2.94, P = 0.003); MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.57~-0.08 z = 2.57, P = 0.01), but had no impact on adverse events, mortality and other indicators(TB score, BMI, mean mid-upper arm circumference, weight gain, CRP, ESR, and other blood cells) (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation can be considered as a combination therapy in patients with PTB.

### Benefits of combined preventive therapy with co-trimoxazole and isoniazid in adults living with HIV: time to consider a fixed-dose, single tablet coformulation [^113Bh7n8]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the main intervention needed to reduce morbidity and mortality and to prevent tuberculosis in adults living with HIV. However, in most resource-limited countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, ART is started too late to have an effect with substantial early morbidity and mortality, and in high tuberculosis burden settings ART does not reduce the tuberculosis risk to that reported in individuals not infected with HIV. Co-trimoxazole preventive therapy started before or with ART, irrespective of CD4 cell count, reduces morbidity and mortality with benefits that continue indefinitely. Isoniazid preventive therapy as an adjunct to ART prevents tuberculosis in high-exposure settings, with long-term treatment likely to be needed to sustain this benefit. Unfortunately, both preventive therapies are underused in low-income and high-burden settings. ART development has benefited from patient-centred simplification with several effective regimens now available as a one per day pill. We argue that co-trimoxazole and isoniazid should also be combined into a single fixed-dose pill, along with pyridoxine (vitamin B6), that would be taken once per day to help with individual uptake and national scale-up of therapies.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117C8Dr1]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesised data from nine RCTs and showed that zinc and vitamin A supplementation was significantly associated with improved sputum smear conversion and higher serum retinol, zinc and haemoglobin levels at different durations of follow-up. However, zinc and/or vitamin A supplementation during TB treatment had no effect on a successful TB treatment outcome.

Nutritional supplementation may be provided for people with TB to promote treatment adherence, improve treatment outcomes or mitigate the financial cost of TB care. It was a cornerstone of TB management in the pre-antibiotic era. Currently, WHO recommends that all individuals living with TB should be evaluated for their nutritional status and provided with adequate counselling based on their nutritional status at the time of TB diagnosis and throughout the course of treatment. In addition, micronutrient supplementation with vitamins such as vitamin A has been found to boost the immune system or used for the adjunctive treatment of infectious diseases, including TB.

The findings of our systematic review and meta-analysis are consistent with a previous meta-analysis that showed a non-significant effect on TB treatment success after 6 months of micronutrient supplementation. Similar studies have also demonstrated that multi-micronutrient supplementation does not significantly affect treatment outcomes among adults with pulmonary TB. Various factors may account for this non-significant finding, including a small number of included studies in the analysis. Moreover, the included trials did not categorise patients based on nutritional and comorbid status. For instance, people with TB who are malnourished and in a catabolic state may require a higher dosage of zinc and vitamin A supplementation to be effective than those who are well-nourished.

In contrast to our findings, another systematic review found that nutritional support (eg, protein, energy and micronutrient supplementation) improved TB treatment outcomes in the intervention group compared with the control group. The possible explanation for the variation between studies might be due to the different types of interventions given to each population. For instance, our study focused on zinc plus vitamin A supplementation only, rather than any nutritional support including multi-micronutrients, protein, fat, carbohydrates or other forms of nutritional support.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the outcomes of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113G6zok]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy had no impact on the time to sputum smear or culture conversion, the latter is recognized as a surrogate endpoint for treatment failure and relapse in patients with TB, despite the increase in the proportion of sputum smear and culture conversion. Thus, more rigorous and larger scale RCTs should be conducted to further verify this problem.

Besides, we detected whether adjunctive vitamin D exhibited anti-inflammatory actions on influencing the peripheral blood parameters. A significant increase in lymphocyte count was observed in the vitamin D arm, but null was found in total white blood cell count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, CRP, and ESR. The lymphocyte: monocyte ratio was verified as a biomarker of pulmonary inflammation resolution in an animal model of TB. Coussens et al. found that adjunctive vitamin D therapy accelerated sputum smear conversion as well as enhanced resolution of lymphopaenia and monocytosis in PTB patients. In our meta-analysis, improvements of sputum conversion and lymphocyte: monocyte ratio were compliance with previous studies. These findings propose a potential effect of vitamin D supplementation on accelerating resolution of inflammatory responses during tuberculosis therapy. Thus, we speculated that the modest immune modulatory effect of vitamin D might have a preventing role on TB; this hypothesis is being solved by two ongoing clinical trials.

Statistical differences in the improvement of chest imaging were observed between groups, but studies included in the analysis are less. However, this result needs to be verified further. A non-statistical difference in BMI, weight gain, mean mid-upper arm circumference, hemoglobin, and TB scores was observed among patients receiving vitamin D supplements compared with those in the placebo group. The indicator for weight gain used in this study was consistent with that in the previous meta-analyses.

Based on the presently available studies, serum 25(OH)D and plasma calcium concentrations returned to normal after vitamin D administration. The mostly reported non-serious adverse event is hypocalcemia. Adverse events and all-cause deaths were evenly distributed between the vitamin D and placebo groups. Results confirmed that vitamin D supplementation is safe and effective. These findings are accord with previous meta-analyses.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129fn4p]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Undernutrition is a major risk factor for tuberculosis (TB), which is estimated to be responsible for 1.9 million TB cases per year globally. The effectiveness of micronutrient supplementation on TB treatment outcomes and its prognostic markers (sputum conversion, serum zinc, retinol and haemoglobin levels) has been poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effect of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and TB treatment outcomes among adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB.

Methods

A systematic literature search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed in PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases. Meta-analysis with a random effect model was performed to estimate risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD), with a 95% CI, for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively.

Results

Our search identified 2195 records. Of these, nine RCTs consisting of 1375 participants were included in the final analyses. Among adults with pulmonary TB, zinc (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.03), vitamin A (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.01) and combined zinc and vitamin A (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.08) supplementation were not significantly associated with TB treatment success. Combined zinc and vitamin A supplementation was significantly associated with increased sputum smear conversion at 2 months (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.32), serum zinc levels at 2 months (MD: 0.86 μmol/L, 95% CI: 0.14 to 1.57), serum retinol levels at 2 months (MD: 0.06 μmol/L, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.08) and 6 months (MD: 0.12 μmol/L, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.14) and serum haemoglobin level at 6 months (MD: 0.29 μg/dL, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.51), among adults with pulmonary TB.

Conclusions

Providing zinc and vitamin A supplementation to adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB during treatment may increase early sputum smear conversion, serum zinc, retinol and haemoglobin levels. However, the use of zinc, vitamin A or both was not associated with TB treatment success.

### Rifapentine (Priftin) [^114pa8Sj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis

PRIFTIN was studied in two randomized, open-label controlled clinical trials in the treatment of active pulmonary tuberculosis.

The first trial was an open-label, prospective, parallel group, active-controlled trial in HIV-negative patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. The population mostly comprised Black (approximately 60%) or multiracial (approximately 31%) patients. Treatment groups were comparable for age and sex and consisted primarily of male subjects with a mean age of 37 ± 11 years. In the initial 2-month phase of treatment, 361 patients received PRIFTIN 600 mg twice a week in combination with daily isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol and 361 subjects received rifampin 600 mg in combination with isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol all administered daily. The doses of the companion drugs were the same in both treatment groups during the initial phase: isoniazid 300 mg, pyrazinamide 2000 mg, and ethambutol 1200 mg. For patients weighing less than 50 kg, the doses of rifampin (450 mg), pyrazinamide (1500 mg) and ethambutol (800 mg) were reduced. Ethambutol was discontinued when isoniazid and rifampin susceptibility testing results were confirmed. During the 4-month continuation phase, 317 patients in the PRIFTIN group continued to receive PRIFTIN 600 mg dosed once weekly with isoniazid 300 mg and 304 patients in the rifampin group received twice weekly rifampin and isoniazid 900 mg. For patients weighing less than 50 kg, the doses of rifampin (450 mg) and isoniazid (600 mg) were reduced. Both treatment groups received pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) over the 6-month treatment period. Treatment was directly observed. 65/361 (18%) of patients in the PRIFTIN group and 34/361 (9%) in the rifampin group received overdoses of one or more of the administered study medications during the initial or continuation phase of treatment. Seven of these patients had adverse reactions reported with the overdose (5 in the PRIFTIN group and 2 in the rifampin group).

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ikBFu]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Implications for future research

More is to be done, notably on TB treatment outcome and important biomarkers, to adequately appraise the long-term effects of micronutrient supplementation such as re-infection and chronic sequelae. The WHO has guidelines on nutritional support for people with TB including micronutrient supplementation. These recommendations state that all essential macronutrients and micronutrients are required for the health and well-being of humans, including those with TB infection and TB disease. However, despite this, there are a number of research gaps related to nutritional support, micronutrient supplementation and TB prevention and treatment.

Rigorous, well-powered multicentric clinical trials to investigate the effect of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on successful TB treatment outcomes are warranted. Such trials should ideally stratify by nutritional and comorbid status (eg, comorbid HIV, diabetes) to examine differential dose-response effects in these key, vulnerable populations.

Vitamin D and tuberculosis

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global health problem being the leading cause of death. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are over 10.4 million new individuals with pulmonary TB every year worldwide. Several animal and clinical studies aimed to investigate the potential benefit in using vitamin D supplements as an adjuvant to a standard TB therapy to improve the clinical parameters. Some observational studies have established a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant treatment to ameliorate TB severity. Although, RCTs and experimental animal studies showed limited effects on Mtb clearance and infection outcomes. In the last five years, several RCT studies have been performed, where oral vitamin D supplements alone or in combination with antimicrobial agents, such as 4-phenyl butyrate (PBA) have been used as potent inducers of host defenses against Mtb infections. Interestingly, most RCT studies confirmed high rates of vitamin D deficiency in patients with pulmonary TB and that adjunctive doses of vitamin D led to a substantial increase in plasma 25(OH)D concentrations, with no enhanced sputum Mtb clearance. This is possibly due to the significant difference in the time of the conversion of a positive Mtb sputum culture to negative upon vitamin D administration compared with a placebo (p > 0.05). In a study by Jolliffe et al. individual participant data (IPD) from the meta-analysis of 1850 participants from 8 studies could identify factors explaining this variation. They meta-analyzed IPD from RCTs of vitamin D in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy for pulmonary TB. Primary and secondary outcomes related time-to sputum culture conversion and time to sputum smear conversion were assessed. It was found that vitamin D did not influence time to sputum culture conversion overall, but it accelerated sputum culture conversion in patients with multidrug-resistant pulmonary TB. It also accelerated time to sputum smear conversion overall. In another placebo-controlled randomized study, intramuscular vitamin D added to TB therapy substantially improved rates of sputum smear conversion in patients of pulmonary TB, although it also had some limitations. Among them, the study was not double-blinded, and placebo was not given to the group randomized for the anti-tuberculosis therapy only, which potentially introduced risk of "false positive" and the difference observed between groups could possibly be attributed to the psychological effect of intramuscular injection of vitamin D in the intervention group. A combined adjunct therapy of vitamin D supplements and PBA has been shown to increase sputum culture conversion in week 4 compared to vitamin D supplements alone or to the placebo group. Additionally, combined adjunct treatment vitamin D-PBA also resulted in an increased expression of LL-37 in alveolar macrophages, along with an enhanced intracellular killing of Mtb in macrophages, ex vivo. These findings suggest that there was a synergistic effect between vitamin D and PBA. Overall, RCTs published data on the impact of adjunctive vitamin D administration in patients with pulmonary TB are difficult to interpret due to broad variability among them, including the readout time point for culture conversion of 4 weeks versus 8 weeks; randomization of TB patients' treatment-naïve versus TB patients that previously received a TB therapy or with reactivation of the TB disease; uncertain randomization assignment, variability among vitamin D doses, types of administration and dosing schedules or the absence of measured serum 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline. Additionally, all studies presented low number of subjects in each randomized treatment arm and experienced high withdrawal rates (24%) or missing data for analysis, which may contribute to the poor clinical outcomes of vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant treatment for TB infection.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the outcomes of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116f19pB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Three RCTs were at low risk of bias for all aspects analyzed. The trials conducted by Daley, Tukvadze, and Wejse as well as their colleagues had an unclear risk of attrition bias due to the missing data, which could have affected the outcome, but we found no evidence to confirm the doubt. The study conducted by Nursyam and colleagues had an unclear risk of selection, performance, and detection bias as it did not describe the definite methods used in random sequence generation, blinding of participants, and personnel and outcome assessments. The study conducted by Salahuddin and colleagues had an unclear risk of performance and detection bias as it did not show the details of the blinding method. Details on the risk of bias assessment are provided in Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2. No studies excluding for low quality (GRADE) or dubious decisions were found in the sensitivity analysis.

### Pyridoxine hydrochloride [^116je9Bv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Injection may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously. In cases of dietary deficiency, the dosage is 10 to 20 mg daily for 3 weeks. Follow-up treatment is recommended daily for several weeks with an oral therapeutic multivitamin preparation containing 2 to 5 mg pyridoxine. Poor dietary habits should be corrected, and an adequate, well balanced diet should be prescribed.

The vitamin B6dependency syndrome may require a therapeutic dosage of as much as 600 mg a day and a daily intake of 30 mg for life.

In deficiencies due to INH, the dosage is 100 mg daily for 3 weeks followed by a 30 mg maintenance dose daily.

In poisoning caused by ingestion of more than 10 g of INH, an equal amount of pyridoxine should be given — 4 g intravenously followed by 1 g intramuscularly every 30 minutes.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^113SDk7J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Tuberculosis and malnutrition are linked in a complex relationship. Tuberculosis may cause undernutrition through increased metabolic demands and decreased intake, and nutritional deficiencies may worsen the disease, or delay recovery by depressing important immune functions. At present, there is no evidence‐based nutritional guidance for adults and children being treated for tuberculosis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral nutritional supplements in people being treated with antituberculous drug therapy for active tuberculosis.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 1, 2016), MEDLINE (from 1946 to 4 February 2016), EMBASE (from 1980 to 4 February 2016), LILACS (from 1982 to 4 February 2016), the meta Register of Controlled Trials (m RCT), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the Indian Journal of Tuberculosis up to 4 February 2016, and checked the reference lists of all included studies.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared any oral nutritional supplement given for at least four weeks with no nutritional intervention, placebo, or dietary advice only for people being treated for active tuberculosis. The primary outcomes of interest were all‐cause death, and cure at six and 12 months.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. We presented the results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables, and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we pooled data from trials with similar interventions and outcomes. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main results

Thirty‐five trials, including 8283 participants, met the inclusion criteria of this review.

Macronutrient supplementation

Six trials assessed the provision of free food, or high‐energy supplements. Only two trials measured total dietary intake, and in both trials the intervention increased calorie consumption compared to controls.

The available trials were too small to reliably prove or exclude clinically important benefits on mortality (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.20; four trials, 567 participants, very low quality evidence), cure (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.41; one trial, 102 participants, very low quality evidence), or treatment completion (data not pooled; two trials, 365 participants, very low quality evidence).

Supplementation probably produces a modest increase in weight gain during treatment for active tuberculosis, although this was not seen consistently across all trials (data not pooled; five trials, 883 participants, moderate quality evidence). Two small studies provide some evidence that quality of life may also be improved but the trials were too small to have much confidence in the result (data not pooled; two trials, 134 participants, low quality evidence).

Micronutrient supplementation

Six trials assessed multi‐micronutrient supplementation in doses up to 10 times the dietary reference intake, and 18 trials assessed single or dual micronutrient supplementation.

Routine multi‐micronutrient supplementation may have little or no effect on mortality in HIV‐negative people with tuberculosis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.6; four trials, 1219 participants, low quality evidence), or HIV‐positive people who are not taking antiretroviral therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23; three trials, 1429 participants, moderate quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to know if supplementation improves cure (no trials), treatment completion (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04; one trial, 302 participants, very low quality evidence), or the proportion of people who remain sputum positive during the first eight weeks (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.35; two trials, 1020 participants, very low quality evidence). However, supplementation may have little or no effect on weight gain during treatment (data not pooled; five trials, 2940 participants, low quality evidence), and no studies have assessed the effect on quality of life.

Plasma levels of vitamin A appear to increase following initiation of tuberculosis treatment regardless of supplementation. In contrast, supplementation probably does improve plasma levels of zinc, vitamin D, vitamin E, and selenium, but this has not been shown to have clinically important benefits. Of note, despite multiple studies of vitamin D supplementation in different doses, statistically significant benefits on sputum conversion have not been demonstrated.

Authors' conclusions

There is currently insufficient research to know whether routinely providing free food, or energy supplements improves tuberculosis treatment outcomes, but it probably improves weight gain in some settings.

Although blood levels of some vitamins may be low in people starting treatment for active tuberculosis, there is currently no reliable evidence that routinely supplementing above recommended daily amounts has clinical benefits.

ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA — p-aminosalicylic acid for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) regimens: We suggest NOT including p-aminosalicylic acid in a treatment regimen for patients with MDR-TB (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). When the individualized treatment regimen for patients with MDR-TB contains newer-generation, more-effective drugs, the addition of p-aminosalicylic acid does not appear to provide a benefit.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FhRYe]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Nutritional support inclusive of locally available nutrient-rich or fortified supplementary foods is currently recommended by WHO for patients with TB with moderate undernutrition who fail to gain weight after 2 month of TB treatment or for those who lose weight during this time.

Sputum conversion is generally a prognostic indicator of a positive TB treatment outcome, with sputum conversion a key indicator at the end of the initial phase of TB treatment. Our evidence synthesis demonstrated that a combination of zinc and vitamin A supplementation was associated with sputum smear conversion at the end of 2 months of TB treatment. This finding is consistent with a previous meta-analysis, which found that micronutrient supplementations had a positive effect on sputum smear conversion. Another meta-analysis showed that nutritional support considerably improved sputum smear conversion. This has been shown that early sputum conversion has a positive impact on TB control more broadly by shortening the period of infectiousness and thereby decreasing transmission. Delayed sputum smear conversion has been associated with an increased length of the infectious period, a heightened risk of treatment failure and the subsequent development of drug resistance TB. Theoretically, it could also lead to an upsurge in treatment costs, non-adherence and ongoing stigma.

The reason behind zinc and vitamin A supplementation being associated with sputum smear conversion at 2 months following treatment initiation but not with successful TB treatment outcomes merits further discussion. The included trials had a limited sample size and their primary outcome of interest was predominantly early bactericidal activity in the form of sputum conversion status 2 months following treatment initiation. The sample sizes were mostly underpowered to examine the comprehensive effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on final TB treatment outcomes, which are usually measured at 6 months following treatment initiation. Other explanations include the use of the Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) strategy during the initial treatment phase (the first 2 months of treatment) in closely monitoring adherence to standard TB drugs and vitamin A and zinc supplementation. Other factors contributing for the observed variations may include variations in drug absorption and adverse reactions, and development of drug resistancein specific subpopulations of people with TB.

Treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) — alternative therapy options are: isoniazid 300 mg PO daily plus pyridoxine 25–50 mg PO daily for 6–9 months (AII); rifampin 600 mg PO daily for 4 months (BI) (4R), with instruction to consult the Tuberculosis/HIV Coinfection section of the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for ARV compatibility; and isoniazid 300 mg PO daily plus rifapentine (see weight-based dosing below) PO daily plus pyridoxine 25–50 mg PO daily for 4 weeks (BI) (1HP). The page notes, "1HP is recommended only for patients receiving an efavirenz-based ARV regimen (AI)", and provides rifapentine daily dosing tiers: Weighing < 35 kg: 300 mg; Weighing 35–45 kg: 450 mg; Weighing > 45 kg: 600 mg (maximum 600 mg). For people exposed to drug-resistant TB, drugs for prevention of TB should be selected after consultation with experts and with public health authorities (AIII).

Table 2
Currently available drug regimens for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection

INH, isoniazid; RMP, rifampicin; PZA, pyrazinamide; RPE, rifapentine; DOT, directly observed treatment; 2/Wk, twice weekly; 1/Wk, once weekly; CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IUAT, international Union Against Tuberculosis; LTBI, latent tuberculosis infection

The standard regimen for the treatment of LTBI in United States and Canada is daily self-administered therapy with isoniazid (INH) for nine months based on clinical trial data but the duration of treatment can be reduced to 6 months for adults seronegative for HIV-infection. The International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) recommends daily therapy with INH for 12 months as it is more effective than the 6-month course (75% vs. 65%). The preferred duration of treatment for most patients with LTBI in the United States and European countries is 9 months since clinical trial data showed that the efficacy of 6-month regimen is reduced to 60% while 12-month regimen is advocated for individuals at higher risk of developing active disease. According to the CDC guidelines, the frequency can also be reduced from daily therapy to twice weekly therapy with increased dosage of INH, however, the twice weekly regimen must be given as directly observed treatment (DOT). Inclusion of DOT adds a substantial additional expense to the treatment strategies. The efficacy of INH treatment in preventing active TB exceeds 90% among persons who complete treatment. However, the overall effectiveness of these regimens is severely limited as the completion rates in clinical settings have been rather low, ranging from 30% to 64% only. Completion rates in other settings have been even lower. Although INH is tolerated fairly well by most of the individuals, there is a risk of hepatic toxicity in selected populations. Studies have shown that 10% to 22% of participants taking INH for LTBI have at least one episode of elevated serum transaminase levels. Although the rates of clinically significant hepatitis were much lower (< 2%), the risk and severity increased with age and concomitant alcohol consumption. INH can also cause peripheral neuropathy but the risk can be lowered by concomitant use of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Poor adherence due to the long duration of treatment and concerns for hepatotoxicity in selected patient populations resulted in development of shorter and more effective treatment options for LTBI.

Risk of bias and quality of evidence

All included trials were regarded as high quality, and the risk of bias was not thought to be significant. The trials described sufficiently a low-risk method of random sequence generation.

In addition, data collectors and researchers in seven trials remained blinded to participants and personnel, except for two trials, where this was not explicitly indicated. Five trialswere evaluated to be at high risk of attrition bias owing to incomplete outcome data, and we considered all trials to be unclear for selection bias as this was not clearly explained (figures 7 and 8).

Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.

Figure 8
Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.

Overall, we judged the certainty of the evidence for each outcome to be low or moderate. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because the micronutrient status differed greatly among people living with sputum-positive pulmonary TB and may be difficult to generalise the findings of the trials to all populations or settings; and most of the included studies had a small sample size which may not be able to detect the true effect (online supplemental tables S1 and S2).

### The role of vitamin D in pulmonary disease: COPD, asthma, infection, and cancer [^113rRhnN]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis

A number of candidate polymorphisms of VitD receptor (VDR) and VitD binding protein (DBP) have been identified that modulate the development of tuberculosis. The genotype tt (detected by Taq I digestion) is associated with decreased risk of tuberculosis. As described by Lewis et al. larger studies are required to determine whether VDR polymorphisms play a role in genetic susceptibility to tuberculosis worldwide. In a recent meta-analysis, low serum levels of 25-(OH)D₃ were associated with a higher risk of active tuberculosis. The pooled effect size was 0.68 with 95% CI 0.43–0.93. The authors concluded that the low VitD levels increase the risk of active tuberculosis. There are several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of VitD treatment in tuberculosis. In one study, 67 tuberculosis patients were randomized to receive VitD (0.25 mg/day) or placebo during the 6 initial week of Tb treatment. A statistical significant difference in sputum conversion (i.e., the change of detectable to no detectable Mycobacteria in the sputum) was discovered in favor of the VitD group (100% vs. 76,7%; p = 0.002). Another trial was conducted in 192 healthy adult tuberculosis contacts in London, United Kingdom. Participants were randomized to receive a single oral dose of 2.5 mg VitD or placebo and followed up at 6 weeks. VitD supplementation significantly enhanced the ability of participants' whole blood to restrict BCG-lux luminescence after 24 hours in vitro as compared with placebo, but did not affect antigen-stimulated IFN-gamma secretion after 96 hours. As the innate immune responses are mobilized more rapidly than acquired immune responses, the authors interpreted the 24- and 96-hour results as indicators of innate and acquired responses, respectively. They concluded that vitamin D supplementation may primarily enhance innate responses to mycobacterial infection. Wejse et al. included 365 tuberculosis patients starting anti-tuberculotic treatment in Guinea Bissau. 281 patients completed the 12 month follow-up. The intervention was 100,000 IU cholecalciferol or placebo at inclusion and again at 5 and 8 months after start of treatment. Reduction in TBscore and sputum smear conversion rates did not differ among VitD and placebo treated patients. Taken those data together there seems to be a benefit of VitD in the treatment of tuberculosis but this could not be reproduced in the largest study so far.

Unit of analysis issues

We split trials that included more than two comparison groups and analysed them as individual pair‐wise comparisons. When we conducted meta‐analysis we ensured that we did not count participants and cases in the placebo group more than once, by dividing the placebo cases and participants evenly between the intervention groups.

Dealing with missing data

If data from the trial reports were insufficient, unclear, or missing, we attempted to contact the trial authors for additional information.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity amongst trials by inspection of the forest plots (to detect overlapping CIs), the I² statistic with a level of 50% to denote moderate levels of heterogeneity, and application of the Chi² test with a P value of 0.10 to indicate appreciable heterogeneity.

Assessment of reporting biases

We planned to assess the likelihood of publication bias by examining the funnel plots for asymmetry. However, there were too few trials to make this assessment meaningful.

Data synthesis

We analysed the data using Review Manager (RevMan) (RevMan 2014). Using pair‐wise meta‐analyses we compared the treatments. We stratified meta‐analyses by time‐point or HIV status where appropriate.

When there was no statistically significant heterogeneity we used the fixed‐effect meta‐analysis model. When we observed moderate statistically significant heterogeneity within groups that we could not explain by subgroup or sensitivity analyses we used a random‐effects meta‐analysis model to synthesize the data. When a pooled meta‐analysis result was considered to be meaningless because of clinical or substantial statistical heterogeneity the results are presented in a forest plot without a pooled estimate of effect.

Data presented as medians and ranges are presented in tables and described in the narrative. Highly skewed continuous data (where the SDs were larger than the means) are only presented in tables.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Due to the small number of included trials or each comparison, the investigation of heterogeneity was not necessary or possible. In future updates of this Cochrane review we may perform subgroup analyses by: HIV status, nutritional status at baseline, presence of co‐morbidities, and specific micronutrient level at baseline.

Sensitivity analysis

We have planned to perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the robustness of the results to the 'Risk of bias' components. However, there were too few included trials for each comparison for this to be possible.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the outcomes of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QdaYM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem; the World Health Organization estimates that there were 10.4 million incident cases and 1.7 million deaths due to TB worldwide in 2016. Although TB is a preventable and curable disease, the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB with the pandemics of human immunodeficiency virus infection and diabetes generates further problems. The duration of anti-tuberculosis treatment is long and requires multiple drugs that often have mild to severe side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing novel drugs that can shorten treatment duration and combat infection with both susceptible and resistant TB strains.

Two epidemiological studies demonstrated that seasonal variations in serum vitamin D concentration were strongly related to the incidence of TB. A meta-analysis found that low serum vitamin D status was associated with increased risk of TB. These results suggested that vitamin D supplementation is likely to have a primary preventive effect on the incidence risk as well as a beneficial effect on the anti-tuberculosis treatment.

The use of vitamin D for TB treatment started in 1849, with the observation that oil from fish liver improved appetite and strength. The major circulating metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]D), supports innate antimicrobial immune responses, suggesting a potential mechanism by which adjunctive vitamin D might enhance response to anti-tuberculosis therapy. In recent years, vitamin D was used to treat PTB in the pre-antibiotic era. Thus far, two meta-analyses incorporating the data from trials of vitamin D supplementation as treatment in patients with PTB have been performed. A meta-analysis that included four trials did not show any improvement in the clinical parameters (mortality, sputum smear positivity, and sputum culture positivity) of vitamin D administration compared with placebo (P = 0.05). Another meta-analysis that included five studies (one study aimed at children) showed that vitamin D supplementation does not have any beneficial effects on improving sputum smear and culture conversion, adverse effects, and body weight. Both meta-analyses had limited number of studies, sample sizes, and parameters analyzed, influencing the results. Currently, several new RCTs have been published. We conducted a meta-analysis of all published RCTs to update and further clarify the efficacy and safety of vitamin D as adjunctive therapy in patients with PTB.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (post-exposure) primary prophylaxis in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children lists as first choice for a source case drug susceptible isoniazid 10–15 mg/kg body weight (maximum 300 mg/day) by mouth daily for 9 months, and for a source case drug resistant it states to consult expert and local public health authorities. Alternatives include: if adherence with daily isoniazid cannot be ensured, consider isoniazid 20–30 mg/kg body weight (maximum 900 mg/ day) by mouth 2 times a week by DOT for 9 months; isoniazid 10–15 mg/kg body weight (maximum 300 mg/ day) and rifampin 10–20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 600 mg/day) by mouth daily for 3–4 months; or rifampin 10–20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 600 mg/ day) by mouth daily for 4–6 months. Drug-drug interactions with cART should be considered for all rifamycin containing alternatives. Indication includes positive TST (TST ≥ 5 mm) or IGRA without previous TB treatment, close contact with any infectious TB case (repeated exposures warrant repeated post-exposure prophylaxis), and TB disease must be excluded before starting treatment; there is no indication for pre-exposure and post-treatment prophylaxis. Criteria for discontinuing prophylaxis specify only with documented severe adverse event, which is exceedingly rare. Adjunctive treatment is pyridoxine 1–2 mg/kg body weight once daily (maximum 25–50 mg/day) with isoniazid; pyridoxine supplementation is recommended for exclusively breastfed infants and for children and adolescents on meat- and milk-deficient diets; children with nutritional deficiencies, including all symptomatic HIV-infected children; and pregnant adolescents and women.

### The effects of anti-inflammatory agents as host-directed adjunct treatment of tuberculosis in humans: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11687Ayw]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The potential role of adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy to enhance tuberculosis (TB) treatment has recently received increasing interest. There is, therefore, a need to broadly examine current host-directed therapies (HDTs) that could accelerate treatment response and improve TB outcomes.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis included randomised controlled trials of vitamin D and other HDT agents in patients receiving antibiotic treatment for pulmonary TB. Sputum smear conversion rate at 4–8 weeks was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included blood indices associated with infectivity and inflammation, chest radiology and incidence of adverse events.

Results

Fifty-five studies were screened for eligibility after the initial search, which yielded more than 1000 records. Of the 2540 participants in the 15 trials included in the meta-analysis, 1898 (74.7%) were male, and the age at entry ranged from 18 to 70 years. There was a 38% significantly (RR 1.38, 95% CI = 1.03–1.84) increased sputum smear negativity in patients administered with vitamin D in addition to standard TB treatment than those receiving only the TB treatment. Patients treated with other HDT anti-inflammatory agents in addition to TB treatment also had a 29% significantly increased sputum smear conversion rate (RR 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09–1.563). Lymphocyte to monocyte ratio was significantly higher in the vitamin D treatment groups compared to the controls (3.52 vs 2.70, 95% CI for difference 0.16–1.11, p = 0.009) and (adjusted mean difference 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 — 0.6; p = 0.001); whilst tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) showed a trend towards a reduction in prednisolone (p < 0.001) and pentoxifylline (p = 0.27) treatment groups. Vitamin D and N-acetylcysteine also accelerated radiographic resolution in treatment compared to placebo at 8 weeks. No differences were observed in the occurrence of adverse events among all HDT treatments.

Conclusions

Vitamin D and other anti-inflammatory HDT medications used as adjunct TB treatment may be well tolerated and effective. They significantly improved sputum smear conversion rate and chest radiological appearance, and also exhibited an inflammation resolution effect.

### Dependency on host vitamin B12 has shaped Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex evolution [^115CDeGa]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our findings could be also translated into therapeutic approaches to treat TB. In this regard, it has been reported benefits in either prevention or treatment outcomes of TB as an heterologous side effect from the therapy with metformin, a treatment for type 2 diabetes. This and other studies linking lower risk of active TB with metformin treatment have led to propose this drug as an adjunct anti-TB therapy. Despite the accurate mechanism of metformin to ameliorate TB is unknown, a common undesirable effect of metformin is lowering B12 levels in treated patients. According to our study, the B12 decline upon administration of metformin might establish a yet unknown association between this treatment and improvement of TB disease. From our results, it is also appealing to propose new drugable targets in TB bacteria, based on either a chemical blockade of B12 transport, or inhibition of the methionine metabolism in M. tuberculosis.

In conclusion, our study, reinterprets the natural evolution of M. tuberculosis from its ancestor mycobacteria, shaped by the dependency on a host vitamin. Our findings using the mouse infection model might inform on aspects of human disease under different B12 scenarios, and might contribute to molecularly understand previous historical, clinical, therapeutical and experimental evidences.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ioTq6]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our study found that the effect of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on TB treatment outcomes in adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB was not significant although it improved sputum smear conversion, and serum zinc, serum retinol and serum haemoglobin levels. We recommend further trials to determine whether zinc with vitamin A supplementation is needed to improve treatment outcomes in adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB.

### Tuberculosis incidence is high in HIV-infected African children but is reduced by co-trimoxazole and time on antiretroviral therapy [^115gR5r6]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this study showed that TB rates in HIV-infected children on ART are many-fold higher than those in the general pediatric population, particularly during the first 3 months of ART. These findings emphasize the importance of TB screening prior to ART initiation and the need to implement effective preventive treatment in HIV-infected children without active TB disease. Co-trimoxazole appears to reduce incident TB in HIV-infected children, even after several years of ART, and may contribute to preventing TB alongside the use of IPT. A co-formulated fixed dose combination of co-trimoxazole, isoniazid, and vitamin B6 has been recently developed for adults and older children and is being evaluated using this formulation in the REALITY trial. While a formulation still needs to be developed for younger children, this fixed dose combination could resolve unacceptably slow implementation of universal IPT and inadequate co-trimoxazole coverage in this population.

### Treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis disease… [^114rXdG2]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- During the intensive phase, the TB drugs kill actively growing TB bacilli. This phase of treatment is crucial for determining the ultimate clinical outcome and preventing emergence of drug resistance. For most patients, it brings relief from the disabling symptoms of TB disease.
- During the continuation phase, the TB drugs eliminate any remaining TB bacilli. This helps to reduce treatment failure and relapse. 4-month treatment regimen The 4-month 2HPZM/2HPM TB treatment regimen consists of:

- Isoniazid,
- Rifapentine,
- Pyrazinamide, and
- Moxifloxacin. 6- to 9-month treatment regimens The 6- to 9-month 2HRZE/4HR or 2HRZE/7HR TB treatment regimens consist of:

- Isoniazid,
- Rifampin
- Pyrazinamide, and
- Ethambutol.

These regimens for treating TB disease have an intensive phase of 2 months of isonaizid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by a continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months of isonaizid and rifampin for total of 6 to 9 months for treatment. Recommendations 6-month 2HRZE/4HR regimen CDC recommends the 6-month 2HRZE/4HR regimen as an option for treating drug-susceptible pulmonary TB disease for adults and adolescents. cBased on expert opinion, patients with cavitation on initial chest radiograph and positive cultures at completion of 2 months of therapy should receive a 7-month continuation phase. dPyridoxine, 25–50 mg/day, is given with INH to all persons at risk of neuropathy.

For patients with peripheral neuropathy, experts recommend increasing pyridoxine dose to 100 mg/day.

### Randomized controlled trial of nutritional supplementation in patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis and wasting [^115Qph2L]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Nutritional support is often recommended as part of the treatment of tuberculosis, but it has never been properly tested.

Objective

We assessed the effects of early nutritional intervention on lean mass and physical function in patients with tuberculosis and wasting.

Design

Patients who started antituberculous therapy within the previous 2 wk were randomly assigned to receive standard nutritional counseling (control group) or nutritional counseling to increase their intake through diet and high-energy supplements (nutritional supplement group) for 6 wk. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and physical function was assessed by maximum grip strength.

Results

Patients in the nutritional supplement group (n = 19) had a significantly greater increase in body weight (2.57 ± 1.78 compared with 0.84 ± 0.89 kg, P = 0.001), total lean mass (1.17 ± 0.93 compared with 0.04 ± 1.26 kg, P = 0.006), and grip strength (2.79 ± 3.11 compared with -0.65 ± 4.48 kg, P = 0.016) than did the control subjects (n = 17) at week 6. During subsequent follow-up, the increase in body weight remained greater in the nutritional supplement group, but this increase was due mainly to a greater gain in fat mass in the nutritional supplement group than in the control group.

Conclusions

Early intervention to increase nutritional intake increases lean mass and physical function. This adjunct to tuberculosis therapy could confer socioeconomic and survival benefits that deserve investigation in large-scale trials. Nutritional intervention after the initial phase of treatment could be less beneficial because it mainly increases fat.

### Association of serum vitamin D levels and dietary vitamin D intake with latent tuberculosis infection and long-term mortality: a population-based cohort study [^116ysMZb]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies have suggested that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of active TB. However, the relationship between vitamin D and LTBI remains less consistent. An Australian study found that vitamin D deficiency was associated with both active TB and LTBI among African immigrants, with a stronger correlation observed for active TB. The authors hypothesised that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of LTBI progressing to active disease. In contrast, a meta-analysis examining the association between vitamin D levels and LTBI reported no significant relationship (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.05 to 5.65, p = 0.58). Although our findings suggest an association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of LTBI, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Mechanistic studies have shown that when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels exceed 30 ng/mL, monocytes and macrophages stimulated by M. tuberculosis -associated antigens upregulate the expression of the vitamin D receptor and 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase, leading to the production of cathelicidin — an antimicrobial peptide critical for host defence against TB infection. Conversely, when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels fall below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), monocytes and macrophages fail to initiate this innate immune response. This may explain the observed association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of TB infection and disease progression. While these findings highlight the potential role of vitamin D in TB control, they also underscore the complexity of its impact on LTBI, warranting further investigation.

Historically, vitamin D was explored as a potential therapeutic agent for TB infection. However, with the advent of effective antituberculous drugs, research interest in vitamin D for TB treatment declined. More recently, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have revisited the role of vitamin D supplementation in TB prevention and treatment, but findings have not demonstrated a significant protective effect. This suggests a more complex relationship between vitamin D and TB infection risk. Some studies propose a bidirectional association, where vitamin D deficiency may increase susceptibility to TB infection, while TB infection itself could suppress vitamin D levels. Additionally, evidence suggests that anti-TB treatment can further reduce serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, potentially due to its role in modulating inflammation and macrophage activation. This raises the possibility of opposing interactions between anti-TB medications and vitamin D, highlighting the need for further research to explore these mechanisms.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^111qX6JF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA — Linezolid dosing, safety, and interactions in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): Adverse effects, especially myelosuppression, are noted to be common at the currently recommended dose of 10 mg/kg twice daily in children < 10 years of age, and strict clinical monitoring for peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, anemia, and leukopenia is necessary during long-term use; in adults, lowering the dose from 600 mg/d to 300 mg/d after culture conversion reduced toxicity, and some patients with visual toxicity can avoid recurrence with a reduced dose of linezolid of 300 mg daily. For children, one modeling study reported that a linezolid dose of 15 mg/kg in full-term neonates and infants aged ≤ 3 months and 10 mg/kg in toddlers, administered once daily, achieved cumulative fraction of response of ≥ 90%, with < 10% achieving linezolid area under the concentration–versus–time curve (AUC) of 0 to 24 associated with toxicity, and WHO and the Sentinel Project recommend pediatric doses of linezolid is 15 mg/kg once daily for children < 15 kg and 10 to 12 mg/kg once daily for those weighing > 15 kg. Linezolid should generally not be administered to patients taking serotonergic agents, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, because of the potential for serious CNS reactions, such as serotonin syndrome. Administration of linezolid concurrently with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor can lead to serious reactions, such as serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome–like reactions, and it is common practice for patients on linezolid to be prescribed vitamin B6.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^111havWJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

Macronutrient supplementation

The included trials were too small to reliably prove or exclude clinically important benefits on mortality, cure, or treatment completion (very low quality evidence). One small trial from India did find a statistically significant benefit on treatment completion, and clearance of the bacteria from the sputum, but these findings have not been confirmed in larger trials elsewhere.

The provision of free food or high‐energy nutritional products probably does produce a modest increase in weight gain during treatment for active tuberculosis, although this was not consistent across all included trials (moderate quality evidence). Two small studies provide some evidence that quality of life may also be improved but the trials were too small to have much confidence in the result (low quality evidence).

Micronutrient supplementation

Multi‐micronutrients may have little or no effect on mortality in HIV‐negative people with tuberculosis (low quality evidence), and probably have little or no effect on mortality in HIV‐positive patients who are not taking anti‐retroviral therapy (moderate quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to know if multi‐micronutrients improve cure, treatment completion, or the proportion of tuberculosis patients remaining sputum positive during the first eight weeks (very low quality evidence).

Multi‐micronutrients may have little or no effect on weight gain during treatment (low quality evidence), although one of the three studies did find a substantial benefit in one study arm. No studies assessed the effect of multi‐micronutrient supplementation on quality of life.

Study characteristics

We identified 2195 publications. After removing 307 duplicates, 1888 articles were screened by reviewing their titles and abstracts, resulting in 56 potential articles for full-text reviews. Then, nine studiescomprising a total of 1375 participants met the eligibility criteria and were incorporated in the systematic review (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flowchart diagram describing selection of studies for a meta-analysis of the effect of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on tuberculosis treatment outcomes and its prognostic markers.

Of the included studies, threewere published in 2010, while all studies were published between 2002 and 2018. Study-specific sample sizes ranged from 26to 499participants. The follow-up duration for outcome evaluation ranged from 2 to 6 months (table 1). The trials were conducted in six countries: South Africa, Nigeria, India, Tanzania, Indonesiaand Mexico. Sputum smear conversion rates at 2 months were evaluated. The serum levels of zinc, retinol and haemoglobin at baseline, 2 and 6 months were measured in four of the nine trials (table 1).

Summary description of included studies

Effect of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on TB treatment outcome of adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB

A successful TB treatment outcome was the primary outcome of interest in five trialswith a total of 731 adults with pulmonary TB. The pooled results from these trials indicated that combined zinc and vitamin A supplementation compared with placebo was not significantly associated with a successful TB treatment outcome (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.08). Similarly, the results showed that zinc only supplementation (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.03) or vitamin A only supplementation (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.01) was not significantly associated with a successful treatment outcome compared with placebo (figure 2).

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis

PRIFTIN was studied in a randomized, open label, active-controlled trial of HIV-negative patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. The population consisted primarily of male subjects with a mean age of 37 ± 11 years. In the initial 2-month phase of treatment, 361 patients received PRIFTIN 600 mg twice a week in combination with daily isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol and 361 subjects received rifampin in combination with isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol all administered daily. Ethambutol was discontinued when drug susceptibly testing was known. During the 4-month continuation phase, 317 patients in the PRIFTIN group continued to receive PRIFTIN 600 mg dosed once weekly with isoniazid and 304 patients in the rifampin group received twice weekly rifampin and isoniazid. Both treatment groups received pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) over the 6-month treatment period.

Because PRIFTIN was administered as part of a combination regimen, the adverse reaction profile reflects the entire regimen.

Twenty-two deaths occurred in the study, eleven in the rifampin combination therapy group and eleven in the PRIFTIN combination therapy group. 18/361 (5%) rifampin combination therapy patients discontinued the study due to an adverse reaction compared to 11/361 (3%) PRIFTIN combination therapy patients. Three patients (two rifampin combination therapy patients and one PRIFTIN combination therapy patient) were discontinued in the initial phase due to hepatotoxicity. Concomitant medications for all three patients included isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine. All three recovered without sequelae.

### Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis [^117Sk67A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is spread from person to person by inhalation of respiratory droplets (Harries 2006). In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were nine million new cases of active tuberculosis worldwide, and 1.5 million deaths (WHO 2014).

Most people who are infected with M. tuberculosis develop what is known as latent tuberculosis. People with latent tuberculosis are infected with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the infection is contained by their immune system. These people remain well and do not exhibit any clinical signs or symptoms of illness (Barry 2009). The immune response to infection is complex, it initially involves the uptake of the bacterium into macrophage cells as part of the non‐specific 'innate' immune response, and later recruitment of both B‐ and T‐lymphocytes of the cellular immune response (Schluger 1998). These cells isolate the bacterium as a granuloma, typically in the lung (Saunders 2007).

Active tuberculosis occurs when the infection is no longer contained by the immune system, and can occur at any time following infection. The lifetime risk of conversion from latent to active tuberculosis is around 5% to 10% in an otherwise healthy population (Harries 2006), but this can rise to around 50% in people with severe impairment of their immune system, such as occurs with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Zumla 2000; Aaron 2004).

Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis), but can also spread to affect the central nervous system, lymphatic system, circulatory system, genitourinary system, and bones and joints. The symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis include cough, chest pain, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and sometimes coughing up blood (Harries 2006).

The 12-dose regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine is not currently recommended for pregnant women or women expecting to become pregnant during the treatment regimen. For most pregnant women with LTBI, treatment can be delayed until after delivery. If the woman does not have any risk factors for developing TB disease, treatment should be given after she has delivered her baby, so she can avoid having to take anti-TB medications during pregnancy. For women in the post-partum period, baseline liver function tests should be conducted. If the pregnant woman is a recent contact to a person with infectious TB disease, immediate treatment should be considered.

Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded. Appropriate evaluations should be performed if extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected.

Adults over 30 kg: 300 mg per day in a single dose.

Infants and Children: 10 mg/kg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose.

In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of administration8.

Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely. In the treatment of tuberculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence of resistant organisms during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen.

For following patient compliance: the Potts-Cozart test9, a simple colorimetric6method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control. Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available to check patient compliance.

Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B6) is recommended in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics).

### Vitamin D and the promoter methylation of its metabolic pathway genes in association with the risk and prognosis of tuberculosis [^115Ffuab]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Vitamins are being revisited for their role in pathogenicity and for their antimycobacterial properties. Vitamin C and vitamin D have been shown to possess antimycobacterial properties. Previous studies have reported an association between vitamin D and immunity against TB. High levels of vitamin D can decrease the reactivation of latent TB and reduce the severity of active TB. Vitamin D deficiency is believed to be a risk factor for the acquisition of TB infection. However, vitamin D supplementation to improve outcomes in TB patients has resulted in contradictory results that may be partly attributable to individual variation in vitamin D metabolic capacity and immunity. Previous studies have suggested that activation or silencing of certain signaling pathways plays a role in TB development. Genetic information is carried not only in DNA sequences but also in epigenetic variations. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to quantify the methylation levels of five vitamin D metabolic pathway genes and observed a significant association with the risk of TB.

Vitamin D has two main active metabolites: 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)₂D. It binds to the vitamin D receptor on the membrane or cell nucleus to begin its activity in the transcription process. In the present study, we observed that TB patients had significantly lower serum 1,25(OH) 2 D concentrations than controls and that the concentrations decreased after the initiation of antituberculosis therapy. 1,25(OH) 2 D is the biologically active form of vitamin D and is associated with treatment outcomes of TB patients. The higher the 1,25(OH) 2 D concentration, the greater the likelihood of successful treatment and the higher the sputum negative conversion rate. Our findings support the hypothesis that we can assist TB treatment by increasing sunlight radiation and vitamin D intake. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial among 120 Mongolian children, vitamin D supplementation seemed to prevent the conversion of the tuberculin skin test. However, another report suggested that the time to sputum conversion was not reduced with vitamin D supplementation.

Tuberculosis in HIV — diagnosis and treatment guidance indicates that IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs) are more sensitive and specific than tuberculin skin tests for detecting latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and are less affected by low CD4+ counts; treatment of LTBI in HIV-infected individuals is strongly recommended with a preferred regimen of 9 months of isoniazid and pyridoxine; for active TB, a once-weekly rifapentine regimen is not recommended, and twice-weekly rifampin or rifabutin are not recommended in persons with a CD4+ T cell count less than 100 cells/μl; ensuring completion via directly observed therapy is highly recommended, and clinicians must be alert for drug–drug interactions and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.

Preferred and alternative drugs for LTBI in HIV — isoniazid regimen and completion: Isoniazid prophylaxis for 9 months remains a preferred therapy (AI) and should be supplemented with pyridoxine at a dose of 25 to 50 mg/day to prevent peripheral neuropathy (AIII); the risk of hepatitis is not significantly increased when isoniazid is combined with efavirenz- or nevirapine-based regimens, but a significant disadvantage is that the majority of patients do not complete all 9 months, and patients are more likely to complete shorter regimens.

### High-dose vitamin D (3) during intensive-phase antimicrobial treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis: a double-blind randomised controlled trial [^112i92NA]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin D was used to treat tuberculosis in the pre-antibiotic era, and its metabolites induce antimycobacterial immunity in vitro. Clinical trials investigating the effect of adjunctive vitamin D on sputum culture conversion are absent.

Methods

We undertook a multicentre randomised controlled trial of adjunctive vitamin D in adults with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in London, UK. 146 patients were allocated to receive 2·5 mg vitamin D(3) or placebo at baseline and 14, 28, and 42 days after starting standard tuberculosis treatment. The primary endpoint was time from initiation of antimicrobial treatment to sputum culture conversion. Patients were genotyped for TaqI and FokI polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor, and interaction analyses were done to assess the influence of the vitamin D receptor genotype on response to vitamin D(3). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00419068.

Findings

126 patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis (62 assigned to intervention, 64 assigned to placebo). Median time to sputum culture conversion was 36·0 days in the intervention group and 43·5 days in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio 1·39, 95% CI 0·90–2·16; p = 0.14). TaqI genotype modified the effect of vitamin D supplementation on time to sputum culture conversion (p(interaction) = 0·03), with enhanced response seen only in patients with the tt genotype (8·09, 95% CI 1·36–48·01; p = 0·02). FokI genotype did not modify the effect of vitamin D supplementation (p(interaction) = 0·85). Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at 56 days was 101·4 nmol/L in the intervention group and 22·8 nmol/L in the placebo group (95% CI for difference 68·6–88·2; p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Administration of four doses of 2·5 mg vitamin D(3) increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in patients receiving intensive-phase treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. Vitamin D did not significantly affect time to sputum culture conversion in the whole study population, but it did significantly hasten sputum culture conversion in participants with the tt genotype of the TaqI vitamin D receptor polymorphism.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116LLnYh]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isoniazid alternative regimen for LTBI: Isoniazid 300 mg PO daily plus pyridoxine 25 mg to 50 mg PO daily for 6 to 9 months is an alternative regimen for the treatment of LTBI (AII). Daily isoniazid for 6 to 9 months is effective and reasonably well-tolerated; severe toxicity is infrequent, but longer courses of isoniazid (e.g., 12 months) are more effective at preventing TB but carry a higher risk of toxicity and patients are more likely to complete shorter regimens. When isoniazid is used, it should be supplemented with pyridoxine at a dose of 25 to 50 mg per day to prevent peripheral neuropathy (AIII).

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DfgFQ]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The effectiveness of TB treatment relies on a competent cell-mediated immune system and the appropriate use and duration of antibiotics. Successful chemotherapy causes a rapid return to protective immune responses. This suggests that improving the micronutrient status of adults with pulmonary TB on chemotherapy may lead to faster bacterial clearance and, thus, a faster clinical recovery process by enhancing the immune response. In some trials, micronutrient supplementation has been linked to improved sputum smear and culture conversion rates, and lower mortality rates compared with a placebo. However, evidence from earlier trials has been contradictory, showing no therapeutic effects of micronutrient supplementation on TB treatment outcomes. The evidence concerning the putative effects of adjunctive zinc and vitamin A supplementation to enhance TB treatment outcomes, and its prognostic markers including serum zinc, retinol and haemoglobin levels, as well as sputum smear conversions have not been well studied, with only a few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) having been carried out. Moreover, previous reviews have emphasised the effect of multi-micronutrient supplementation on mortality, weight gain, body mass index and degree of cavitation on chest radiography. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesised available evidence from RCTs to determine the association between zinc and vitamin A supplementation on TB treatment outcomes among adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB as well as prognostic markers (ie, sputum smear conversion, serum zinc levels, serum retinol levels and serum haemoglobin levels).
