## Question

do patients with a titanium occulder in heart septum need antibiotics before dental work

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with a titanium (nitinol) septal occluder in the heart need antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the device is and the pathophysiologic window of risk for infective endocarditis around implantation. Then, I should verify what major society guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC) explicitly recommend for dental prophylaxis and whether septal occluders are listed. Next, I will check device- and condition-specific guidance, including PFO/ASD position papers and real-world practice. After that, I should stratify dental procedure risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-based recommendation and confirm antibiotic choices and duration while weighing the evidence quality and stewardship considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. A "titanium occluder in the heart septum" almost certainly refers to a transcatheter septal occluder for ASD or PFO, typically constructed with nitinol frames and fabric, which behaves as intracardiac foreign material until endocardial coverage occurs over months; that endothelialization period is the key window of theoretical infectious risk, and some sources recommend endocarditis precautions for a few months until the device is covered by tissue [^114S4335].

> Wait, let me verify the core risk. Prosthetic intracardiac material can serve as a nidus for bacteremia-seeded infection, especially before complete endothelialization and in the setting of high-grade bacteremia from invasive oral procedures; although device endocarditis after septal occluder implantation is rare, late cases have been reported, underscoring the need for a cautious, time-limited strategy early after implantation [^114iBNkv] [^113bnVQU] [^113mucC9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about guidelines. My first instinct was that ACC/AHA and ESC lists might explicitly include septal occluders as a group requiring dental prophylaxis, but I should double-check; in fact, contemporary ACC/AHA and ESC recommendations restrict dental antibiotic prophylaxis to highest-risk categories such as prosthetic heart valves, prior infective endocarditis, certain congenital heart disease (including repaired defects with residual shunt/regurgitation adjacent to prosthetic material), and selected transcatheter valve repairs, without listing isolated septal occluders per se as an independent indication [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^115bEAhR].

> Next, I should review device- or condition-specific guidance. Let me check the European PFO position paper and interventional literature; the European position paper on PFO management advises administering antibiotic prophylaxis for any invasive procedure during the first six months after PFO closure, aligning with real-world interventional practice in which 6-month endocarditis prophylaxis is commonly implemented after septal occluder implantation, and expert reviews note that if prophylaxis is chosen it should be limited to the first 6 months and focused on dental procedures [^1129VkDr] [^111gXfGA] [^113sXVCU] [^117Cpxcv].

> I need to check procedural risk stratification. Dental procedures that manipulate gingival tissue, the periapical region of teeth, or perforate oral mucosa have the highest association with bacteremia and are the target for prophylaxis in eligible high-risk cardiac patients, whereas routine anesthetic injections, radiographs, or orthodontic adjustments are not indications for prophylaxis in current ESC guidance [^115bEAhR].

> Let me synthesize timing before I commit to a recommendation. For the first six months post-implantation, when endothelialization is incomplete, it is reasonable to use antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive dental procedures and, if feasible, to defer elective invasive dentistry until after that window; this approach is explicitly endorsed by the European PFO paper and reflected in device-focused expert reviews and common interventional practice patterns [^1129VkDr] [^117Cpxcv].

> Now, what about after six months. I should confirm that routine prophylaxis is generally not recommended once the device is endothelialized in the absence of residual shunt or other high-risk features; ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines support prophylaxis after dental procedures only for patients in defined high-risk categories, which would include those with repaired congenital heart disease with residual shunts or regurgitation adjacent to the device, prior infective endocarditis, or prosthetic valves, but not an isolated, well-seated septal occluder without residual flow beyond six months [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^115bEAhR].

> But wait, what does the evidence say about prophylaxis efficacy. I should review the data quality: there are no randomized trials showing that prophylaxis prevents IE, and large observational and meta-analytic assessments remain inconclusive about benefit at the population level, with contemporary AHA science advisories emphasizing the lack of definitive efficacy data; thus, any recommendation beyond high-risk categories should be conservative and stewardship-minded [^112jVbWy] [^111Hegjy].

> I need to ensure the actual antibiotic regimen is correct. The standard dental prophylaxis agent is amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before the procedure; initially, I almost said "or clindamycin if penicillin-allergic", but hold on, I should verify — current AHA VGS IE prevention guidance advises against clindamycin because of adverse event risks and recommends alternatives such as cephalexin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or doxycycline based on allergy profile, again as a single preprocedural dose [^112wDTSh] [^117Cpxcv].

> Let me reconsider the final synthesis to be precise. For patients with an ASD/PFO septal occluder: during the first 6 months after device implantation, give dental prophylaxis for invasive procedures or defer elective invasive dentistry when possible; after 6 months, do not use routine prophylaxis unless the patient meets a high-risk category such as residual shunt adjacent to the device, prior IE, or other qualifying conditions per ACC/AHA and ESC, recognizing that the absolute risk is very low and evidence for prophylaxis efficacy is limited, while case reports of late device IE warrant vigilance rather than indefinite antibiotics [^1129VkDr] [^1117ghTf] [^114BRUvb] [^115bEAhR] [^112jVbWy] [^114iBNkv].

---

No, patients with a titanium heart septal occluder **do not need antibiotic prophylaxis** [^1117ghTf] before dental work if the device was implanted more than 6 months ago [^1129VkDr] and there are no residual defects or other high-risk cardiac conditions [^114BRUvb]. Prophylaxis is only recommended **within the first 6 months after implantation** or if there are residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the device site. After 6 months, if the device is fully endothelialized and there are no residual defects, **prophylaxis is not indicated** [^114BRUvb] [^112wDTSh].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Recent ACC/AHA (2021) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC, 2023) guidelines provide clear recommendations on antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) in patients undergoing dental procedures. The **ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines** [^1117ghTf] recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures involving manipulation of gingival tissue, the periapical region of teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa [^112wDTSh] in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves, prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repairs, previous IE, or unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects. Similarly, the **ESC 2023 guidelines** [^114BRUvb] recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for dental extractions, oral surgery procedures, and procedures requiring manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of the teeth [^115bEAhR] in patients with prosthetic valves, previous IE, untreated cyanotic congenital heart disease, or ventricular assist devices.

## Specific recommendations for septal occluder devices

Septal occluder devices, including titanium occluders, are used to close atrial septal defects (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO). These devices are **typically endothelialized within six months** after implantation, significantly reducing the risk of infective endocarditis [^1129VkDr]. According to the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, **antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for the first six months after device implantation** or indefinitely if there are residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the site of the device. After six months, if the device is fully endothelialized and there are no residual defects, **antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer indicated** [^114BRUvb].

---

## Risk of infective endocarditis associated with titanium septal occluder devices

The risk of infective endocarditis associated with titanium septal occluder devices is **generally low**, particularly after the initial six-month post-implantation period [^117Cpxcv]. Nevertheless, rare cases have been reported, typically within the first six months after implantation or when residual defects are present [^113mucC9] [^114iBNkv]. Additionally, Kitamura et al. (2021) highlighted the need for close monitoring for late complications, including infective endocarditis, after percutaneous atrial septal defect closure [^114GpyFu]. However, the overall incidence of infective endocarditis in patients with fully endothelialized devices **is extremely low**.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current guidelines

The current guidelines are supported by clinical evidence demonstrating that antibiotic prophylaxis **significantly reduces the risk of infective endocarditis in high-risk patients** undergoing invasive dental procedures [^116N38xc], and a nationwide population-based cohort study published in BMJ (2017) found a significant association between invasive dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective endocarditis in high-risk patients, supporting the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients [^111f4uyM] [^114VUrpH]. The same study found no significant association between invasive dental procedures and infective endocarditis in low-risk patients, suggesting that **antibiotic prophylaxis is unnecessary in this population**.

---

## Potential risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis **carries potential risks**, including allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, and adverse drug reactions [^114ToEa4] [^112hDVQE]. Therefore, the decision to administer prophylaxis must balance the potential benefits of preventing infective endocarditis against these risks. In patients with titanium septal occluder devices, the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh the risks **only during the initial six-month period post-implantation** or in the presence of residual defects. After six months, as the risk of infective endocarditis is significantly reduced [^1117ghTf], the risks associated with prophylaxis generally outweigh the benefits.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Antibiotic prophylaxis recommended?** |
|-|-|
| Within 6 months post-implantation | Yes |
| Residual shunt or valvular regurgitation at device site | Yes |
| Fully endothelialized device (> 6 months post-implantation) without residual defects | No |

---

Patients with a titanium occluder in the heart septum **do not need antibiotic prophylaxis before dental work** [^114BRUvb] if the device was implanted more than six months ago and there are no residual defects. Prophylaxis is recommended only within the first six months after implantation or if residual shunts or valvular regurgitation are present at the device site.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis, specifically concerning antibiotic prophylaxis during dental procedures, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (IE) before dental procedures. These procedures involve the manipulation of gingival tissue, the periapical region of teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa in patients with valvular heart disease who exhibit any of the following conditions:

- **Prosthetic cardiac valves**, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses and homografts.

- **Prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repairs**, such as annuloplasty rings, chords, or clips.

- **Previous infective endocarditis**.

- **Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease**.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis, particularly concerning antibiotic prophylaxis during dental procedures, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with any of the following conditions undergoing oro-dental procedures:

- **Previous infective endocarditis**: These patients are at increased risk for recurrence, and prophylaxis can help prevent infection.

- **Surgically implanted prosthetic valves or materials used for surgical cardiac valve repair**: Antibiotic prophylaxis is crucial to protect these patients from infection.

- **Transcatheter-implanted aortic or pulmonary valvular prostheses**: Due to the foreign material in the body, prophylaxis is necessary.

- **Untreated cyanotic congenital heart disease or those treated with surgery or transcatheter procedures**: For patients with postoperative palliative shunts, conduits, or other prostheses, prophylaxis is advised after surgical repair for the first six months following the procedure, except in the absence of residual defects or valve prostheses.

- **Ventricular assist devices**: The presence of these devices increases the risk of endocarditis, necessitating antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Estimated risk of endocarditis in adults with predisposing cardiac conditions undergoing dental procedures with or without antibiotic prophylaxis [^114iz1nw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Although antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) has been recommended for persons with predisposing cardiac conditions (PCCs) for many years, its efficacy, which has not been demonstrated, has been recently challenged. To assess its usefulness, we estimated the risk of developing IE after undergoing a dental procedure for which subjects would be eligible for prophylaxis, both in subjects who had received antibiotic prophylaxis (protected procedure) and those who had not (unprotected procedure).

- **Methods**: The number of French persons with PCCs, the annual number of dental procedures in which subjects would be eligible for antibiotic prophylaxis, and the number of procedures that were unprotected were estimated on the basis of a survey performed on a sample of 2,805 subjects aged 25–84 years. The annual number of IE cases possibly due to an unprotected procedure was estimated on the basis of a one-year epidemiological study of IE conducted in an area inhabited by 16 million people.

- **Results**: After standardization, extrapolation of results to the age-equivalent general population (39 million subjects) indicated the following: First, 3.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.6%-4%) of the subjects had PCC, 2.7 million (95% CI, 2.3–3.2 million) of whom had undergone at least one at-risk dental procedure within the survey year, and the procedures were unprotected in 62% of cases. Second, 37 (95% CI, 18–68; 2.7%) of the 1,370 annual IE cases in France were possibly related to unprotected procedures. Thus, the risks of developing IE were estimated to be 1 in 46,000 for unprotected procedures.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^117H7Qjf]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis, following the introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008. This guideline recommended the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

- **Design**: Before and after study.
- **Setting**: England.
- **Population**: All patients admitted to hospitals in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

- **Main outcome measures**:
	- Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis, consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin.
	- Monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis.
	- Infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospital.
	- Cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

The results showed that after the introduction of the NICE guideline, there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, declining from a mean of 10,277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2,292 (SD 176). There was no significant evidence suggesting that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis was altered due to the guideline (P = 0.61). A non-inferiority test excluded an increase in the number of cases by 9.3% or more after the guideline's introduction. Additionally, an increase in infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospital was not observed.

### Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Current tendencies, continuing controversies [^114ToEa4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe disease with high mortality and results most often from the combination of bacteraemia (sometimes provoked) and a predisposing cardiac condition. Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis has been recommended by different countries based on the supposed pathophysiology of the disease, although no randomized clinical trial has confirmed its efficacy.

We review the data presented over the past few decades, challenge the principles underlying prophylaxis recommendations, and analyze the arguments that explain the general tendency in very recent years to decrease prophylaxis indications. Such arguments include the probable important role of everyday-life bacteraemia in the occurrence of infective endocarditis, the estimated huge number of prophylaxis doses needed to avoid a single case, and the lack of scientific evidence to identify which procedures should lead to prophylaxis. Recommendations for prophylaxis are now essentially focused on patients with high-risk predisposing cardiac conditions before dental procedures.

### Quantifying infective endocarditis risk in patients with predisposing cardiac conditions [^115HdA68]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: Infective endocarditis remains a significant concern for patients with predisposing cardiac conditions. This study aims to quantify the associated risk.

- **Methodology**: This research draws insights from contemporary guidelines, including the 2007 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on the prevention of infective endocarditis and the 2009 guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

- **Findings**: Notably, recommendations from key health bodies such as the AHA and ESC are considered. B.P. served as a member of the Task Force on Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of Infective Endocarditis of the ESC. Further, M.D. contributed as a non-voting specialty advisor for the 2015 review of NICE clinical guideline 64 on prophylaxis against infective endocarditis.

- **Conflict of interest**: L.B. and P.L. hold roles in the AHA Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease. They were instrumental in creating the 2007 AHA guideline on Prevention of Infective Endocarditis.

This research highlights the importance of continuous evaluation and implementation of contemporary clinical guidelines to effectively mitigate risks associated with infective endocarditis in susceptible patient populations.

### Nondental invasive procedures and risk of infective endocarditis: Time for a revisit: A science advisory from the American Heart Association [^112jVbWy]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

There have been no published prospective randomized clinical trials that have: (1) established an association between invasive dental and nondental invasive procedures and the risk of infective endocarditis; or (2) defined the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis administered in the setting of invasive procedures in the prevention of infective endocarditis in high-risk patients. Moreover, previous observational studies that examined the association of nondental invasive procedures with the risk of infective endocarditis have been limited by inadequate sample size. They have typically focused on a few potential at-risk surgical and nonsurgical invasive procedures. However, recent investigations from Sweden and England that used nationwide databases have demonstrated an association between nondental invasive procedures and the subsequent development of infective endocarditis, particularly in high-risk patients. These findings prompted the development of the science advisory.

### Penicillins for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^112hDVQE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, and it is believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries recommend that prior to invasive dental procedures, antibiotics are administered to individuals at high risk of endocarditis. However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of this prophylaxis outweigh the potential benefits.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether prophylactic penicillin administration compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE influences mortality, serious illness, or endocarditis incidence.

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy was developed on MEDLINE and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers (up to October 2003), as well as the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), OLDMEDLINE (1966 to June 2002), EMBASE (1980 to June 2002), SIGLE (to June 2002), and the Meta-register of Controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Due to the low incidence of BE, it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-controlled studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of penicillin compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures.

### Patent foramen ovale closure versus drug therapy in patients over 60 years and a follow-up of 5 years [^113sXVCU]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Post-interventional treatment in group A**: Post-intervention, patients took 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 3 months and 100 mg of aspirin per day for up to 9 months. Endocarditis prophylaxis was performed for 6 months. Every patient underwent TEE before being discharged from the hospital to ensure correct placement of the device. All patients were screened for post-interventional bleeding, defined as a reduction of hemoglobin count of ≥ 2 mg/dl. All study participants were clinically examined 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Afterwards, patients were contacted for annual follow-up via telephone. The centrally recorded database was subsequently evaluated by nurses and physicians. Telephone interviews with patients or their close relatives included questions relating to the appearance of cardiac death (diagnosed cardiovascular cause or death from unknown reasons not related to cardiovascular causes) and hospitalization due to neurological symptoms or thromboembolic events. If hospitalization occurred, the general practitioner responsible was consulted for further details. In this group, 96% of patients remained active in the follow-up program, whereas 4% did not respond to follow-up consultations and were excluded from this study. Follow-up studies took place over a mean time of 5.5 ± 1.5 years.

- **Medical treatment in group B**: All patients were treated with 100 mg of aspirin per day and did not undergo interventional preventive measures with a PFO occluder. The follow-up program for this group was identical to that of Group A, with 94% remaining active in follow-up studies.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^1147QxcG]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The starting point for this review was the previous 2012 guideline. We sought evidence that warranted changes from previous recommendations. The Working Party was recruited from the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) membership and specialist cardiology societies that might wish to be involved in preparing the guideline. Each society nominated a participant following approval from their respective governance structures. Other members were invited to ensure diverse expert and non-expert representation, including infection specialists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, pharmacists, laboratory scientists, and a patient and public representative.

The joint Working Party comprised members of BSAC, the British Cardiovascular Society, the British Heart Valve Society, the British Society of Echocardiography, the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, and the British Infection Association. The British Congenital Cardiac Association joined later in the process and contributed to the final guideline.

During a face-to-face meeting, an initial scoping exercise was undertaken by Working Party members to identify key clinical questions concerning the delivery of specialist infective endocarditis (IE) services to patients in the UK NHS. This was followed by a round-table discussion to determine and prioritize principal guideline topics. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken (see online supplemental file for search strategy and methods for screening and selection of papers for inclusion), followed by the development of initial recommendations from the literature review.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^114xj53A]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis, specifically in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis during cardiac surgery, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the elimination of potential sources of sepsis (including those of dental origin) at least two weeks before the implantation of a prosthetic valve or other intracardiac or intravascular foreign material, except in urgent procedures.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^112i6ccw]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Based on the variability of the monthly data before the change, we set a margin of a 15% increase over the fitted number for cases and deaths. To carry out the test, we constructed a 95% confidence interval for the monthly mean number of cases or deaths for the 25 months after the guideline change. If the upper limit of the confidence interval corresponded to an increase of less than 15% over the model's estimate for the number of cases or deaths for March 2008 (that is, < 139.8 or < 22.4, respectively), we considered that the number of cases or deaths had not increased significantly.

Prespecified secondary tests were performed to determine whether cases of infective endocarditis or deaths had increased since the introduction of the guideline. These involved testing whether there was an increase in the time trend in the Poisson regression models and observing whether in 17 or more months from April 2008 to April 2010, the number of cases or deaths exceeded the fitted value for March 2008 (121.6 cases or 19.5 deaths). The probability of 25 independent counts of 17 exceeding this level was 0.22 (that is, < 5%), and so we set 17 as the test statistic.

### Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis among individuals at high risk following dental treatment: a nested case-crossover and case-control study [^1179pm8n]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Between July 1, 2008, and January 1, 2018, 240 cases of VGS-IE occurred among the 76,762 individuals at high risk (Fig. 1). During the same period, 98,247 invasive dental procedures (IDPs) were carried out in the cohort: 624 occasions of oral surgery, 44,190 tooth extractions, and 53,433 sessions of subgingival scaling (removal of dental calculus).

The case-control study could not confirm that IDPs were more common among cases than controls, OR = 1.22, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.64–2.3. Eleven (4.6%) cases and 98 (4.1%) controls underwent IDPs during the 3 months preceding VGS-IE. Four out of the 11 cases temporally associated with IDPs occurred after October 2012, when cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for the prevention of IE in Swedish dentistry was recommended (Fig. 3).

- **Fig. 3**: Cases of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis temporally associated with invasive dental procedures.
	- **Legend**: The red dotted line represents the time of the recommended cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry for the prevention of viridans streptococcal infective endocarditis (VGS-IE) in October 2012. Four out of the eleven invasive dental procedures temporally associated with VGS-IE occurred after the change.

The case-crossover study could not confirm that IDPs were more common during the 3-months prior to VGS-IE than during reference periods, OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.34–2.18. Stratification on procedure did not alter these results. No OR could be calculated for oral surgery because no such procedures were detected during case or reference periods.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: Do the changes make sense? A critical review [^111JqndQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

- **Recent findings**: The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

- **Summary**: While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis, there is controversy as to what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^111f4uyM]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a rare but severe disease with an in-hospital mortality rate of about 20% and a five-year mortality rate of 40%. This disease is also associated with high morbidity and a high cost burden, as the treatment of infective endocarditis requires prolonged hospital stay, and one out of two patients undergoes valve surgery during the acute phase of the disease. Strategies for antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis have been proposed for many years for patients with heart disease at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing invasive procedures responsible for bacteremia. This is despite the lack of proof of efficacy; neither randomized clinical trials (providing the highest level of evidence) nor cohort studies have been conducted to support an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy. Over the past three decades, five case-control studies have been conducted; only two of them established an association between dental procedures and streptococcal infective endocarditis, and none of them was sufficiently powered to establish the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis.

In addition to the lack of scientific evidence of efficacy for an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy, statistical modeling showed that "everyday low-level bacteremia" that occurs after tooth brushing, flossing, or chewing (and not covered by antibiotic prophylaxis) may more frequently trigger oral streptococcal infective endocarditis bacteremia than invasive dental procedures. On the basis of these hypotheses, the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis have been restricted to two different contexts.

### Dual-center experiences with interventional closure of patent foramen ovale: A medium-term follow-up study comparing two patient groups aged under and over 60 years [^111gXfGA]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

All patients received 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily for at least 1 week prior to intervention. In brief, venous access was gained through the right femoral vein under local anesthesia, and device implantation was guided by fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The type and size of device was chosen by the physician performing the implantation according to: (a) the diameter of the defect, (b) presence of an atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), (c) availability of the device, and (d) appropriate preference. A randomization algorithm was not used.

After implantation, patients continued to receive 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily for 3 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for up to 6 months. Before hospital discharge, a transthoracic echocardiography was performed to confirm the correct device position. Prophylaxis of infectious endocarditis was administered for the first 6 months. Clinical follow‐ups were performed after 3 and 6 months by TEE. Additionally, telephone contact based on a centrally recorded database was conducted on an annual basis. All verification of database recordings and interviews was conducted by an experienced nurse or physician. During this interview, the patient or a family member was queried about the occurrence of cardiac events, such as: (a) cardiovascular death, defined as any death with a demonstrable cardiovascular cause or any death that was not clearly attributable to a non‐cardiovascular cause, or (b) hospitalization for neurological or peripheral thromboembolic events.

### Infectious endocarditis prophylaxis in children [^111d4PpD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Infectious endocarditis (IE) is a rare illness with high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of IE is on the rise in industrialized countries, particularly as individuals with congenital heart defects are living longer and the use of indwelling central catheters increases. With the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines, there has been a shift in recommending antibiotic prophylaxis only to high-risk patient populations. This clinical review will highlight the changing epidemiology and etiology of IE, followed by an emphasis on the appropriate indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk populations undergoing specific procedures.

A 66-year-old man with a large secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) that had been repaired percutaneously 30 months previously with an Amplatzer ASD occluder (ASO) presented with fevers and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 1.5 x 1.5 cm mobile mass on the left atrial side of his ASO, consistent with a vegetation. When the ASO was explanted, the left atrial side of the device was poorly endothelialized. In conclusion, this report is the first description of late infective endocarditis in an adult with an ASO.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^113C61PT]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

We carried out a nationwide population-based cohort study to assess the rate of infective endocarditis associated with oral streptococci during the three months following invasive dental procedures, according to different categories of exposure. This three-month interval was based on data from previous studies, which reported long intervals between dental procedures and the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, as well as data from the literature.

Participants entered the cohort six months after the first identification of a prosthetic heart valve during the study period to ensure analysis under stable conditions. To be included in the cohort, patients had to be aged 18 years or older with no discharge diagnosis code for oral streptococcal infective endocarditis or other specific codes related to prosthetic heart valves before inclusion in the cohort.

- **Time frame of cohort study**: Includes examples of exposure during follow-up for three patients. *Death from any cause (other than oral streptococcal infective endocarditis), admission to hospital for prosthetic heart valve, replacement of prosthetic heart valve, lost to follow-up, or follow-up until December 2014. Participant A was exposed to an invasive dental procedure during follow-up but did not present with oral streptococcal infective endocarditis. Participant B was exposed to both a non-invasive and an invasive dental procedure during follow-up and presented with oral streptococcal infective endocarditis; during the co-exposure period, priority was given to exposure from an invasive dental procedure.

**Limitations**: Our study is limited to a relatively small number of patients and only presents retrospective results from a non-randomized study, as we were required to accept the patients' decision. Furthermore, a recall bias is possible, as parts of the follow-up data were only collected from telephone contact with patients and physicians.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1141hHsg]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

There is concern that the period of follow-up was not long enough; however, in over 90% of cases, the incubation period for infective endocarditis is less than six weeks, and other studies have used three months as the cut-off for capturing all cases of infective endocarditis that will develop after exposure to the risk of infection. We, therefore, believe that if antibiotic prophylaxis were effective in preventing infective endocarditis, the large decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis that occurred after the introduction of the NICE guideline would have resulted in a detectable increase in cases during the 25 months of the study. Any such change should have been particularly noticeable among those cases where the causal organism was of possible oral streptococcal origin. Regardless, we intend to periodically monitor the rate of endocarditis in the English population over time.

The 78.6% decrease in prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis in the months after the introduction of the guideline was significant and suggests much better compliance than is often seen after policy changes in medicine. Compliance was particularly good among dentists who, as well as being strongly urged to adopt the new guidelines by the Chief Dental Officer, NICE, and the dental press, were advised by malpractice insurance organisations that it would be difficult to defend cases where the new guidelines had not been followed. A residual level of prescribing does, however, seem to persist at around 20% of the level before the guideline.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112DEFQs]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease with high morbidity and mortality. For more than 50 years, antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been the primary focus for preventing infective endocarditis and remains the standard of care for patients with the disease in most parts of the world. The rationale for such treatment is to reduce or eliminate the bacteraemia that may result from such procedures. A particular focus is on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, as oral streptococci have been implicated in between 18% and 65% of cases of infective endocarditis, although most studies suggest the proportion is closer to 35–45%.

Regardless, little or no firm scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infective endocarditis, and two case-control studies provide evidence that dental treatment is unlikely to be a risk factor. Some authors, therefore, suggest that the focus on antibiotic prophylaxis is an unproved, expensive, and potentially harmful standard of care, whereas others argue that it prevents cases of infective endocarditis. Owing to ethical and medicolegal issues, cost, and the large number of patients necessary to achieve statistically significant results, a randomised placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis has never been attempted.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom produced controversial new guidance recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^1165vmws]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

In our case-crossover analysis, we found a low rate of invasive dental procedures during the three months preceding oral streptococcal infective endocarditis (5.1%, but consistent with the literature), showing that most cases of streptococcal infective endocarditis were not associated with recent dental procedures. Notably, this case-crossover analysis was not affected by recall bias, as dental procedures were retrieved from the SNIIRAM database. In a recently published case-control study performed in patients with infective endocarditis admitted to hospitals in six French tertiary care hospitals (regardless of predisposing heart conditions), we showed that 16.9% of participants with definite streptococcal infective endocarditis had undergone dental procedures during the preceding three months.

Although the case-crossover analysis revealed a statistically significant association between invasive dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective endocarditis among participants with prosthetic heart valves, there is no good evidence to support a different effect between invasive and non-invasive dental procedures, probably as a result of a lack of power (P = 0.07). We failed to show the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis, again possibly owing to the lack of power attributable to the small number of participants in the different subgroups included in the antibiotic prophylaxis dental procedures model, in which only discordant pairs contributed.

- **Limitations of this study**: Both the cohort and the case-crossover study present several limitations. Firstly, they are subject to the limit…

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2016–2018 [^1128pnob]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis is common yet unnecessary for many dental visits. In this analysis, our objective was to assess whether the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis has improved over time.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using dental visits from 2016 to 2018 (data analyzed in 2021) using medical and prescription claims data of patients from the U.S. with commercial dental insurance. Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a ≤ 2 days' supply prescription dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit. Appropriateness of prophylaxis was defined on the basis of the manipulation of the gingiva/tooth periapex or oral mucosa perforation in patients with appropriate cardiac diagnoses. Associations between patient and visit characteristics and appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were assessed using multiple Poisson regression.

Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was highly prevalent in this cohort, ranging from 77.0% in 2016 to 78.5% in 2018. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis included younger age, female sex, geographic region, rurality, type of antibiotic, and certain dental procedures. The factors associated with the highest risk of unnecessary prophylaxis in the adjusted analysis were orthodontic procedures and having a history of a prosthetic joint. Notably, the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time in the adjusted analysis.

Unnecessary prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists continues to be common.

### Investigation of the impact of the NICE guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures on the incidence of infective endocarditis in England: an electronic health records study [^112Wmy9d]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is an uncommon but serious infection for which the evidence regarding the provision of antibiotic prophylaxis to people undergoing invasive dental procedures is inconclusive. In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued guidelines recommending that antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures should no longer be routinely offered to people at risk of infective endocarditis in England. This contrasted with the American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines issued around the same time, which continued to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis in certain high-risk cases, such as patients with prosthetic heart valves or those who had previously experienced infective endocarditis.

Although much research on the impact of guideline changes on the incidence of infective endocarditis has been conducted internationally, including a particular study in England which showed an increase in cases following the NICE guideline change, no consensus has been reached. In a 2016 update to their guidelines, NICE reaffirmed their previous position while clarifying that doctors and dentists should still apply their clinical judgement on a case-by-case basis.

A recent study of ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) diagnosis codes used to represent infective endocarditis cases at two large English hospital trusts concluded that the inclusion criteria for observational studies using electronic health records (EHRs) need to be selected very carefully, even when specific diagnostic codes are used.

### Closure versus medical therapy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale and a history of cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111CB5mX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

The optimal therapy for preventing recurrent stroke in people with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) has not been defined. The choice between medical therapy (antithrombotic treatment with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants) and transcatheter device closure has been the subject of intense debate over the past several years. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, a substantial number of people undergo transcatheter device closure (TDC) for secondary stroke prevention.

- **Objectives**: To compare the safety and efficacy of TDC with best medical therapy alone for preventing recurrent stroke (fatal or non-fatal) or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in people with PFO and a history of cryptogenic stroke or TIA; to identify specific subgroups of people most likely to benefit from closure for secondary prevention; and to assess the cost-effectiveness of this strategy, if possible.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (July 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to July 2014), and EMBASE (1980 to July 2014). In an effort to identify unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched seven trials registers and checked reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding, publication status, and language, comparing the safety and efficacy of device closure with medical therapy for preventing recurrent stroke or TIA in people with PFO and a history of cryptogenic stroke or TIA.

### Temporal association between invasive procedures and infective endocarditis [^1146gRTZ]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

We report a significant association between the implantation of CIEDs, upper and lower GI endoscopy, bronchoscopy, and dental extractions (including surgical tooth removal), and subsequent infective endocarditis (IE). These procedures resulted in an additional 14.3–49.5 IE cases per 100,000 procedures in those at high IE risk and an additional 1.1–3.9 IE cases per 100,000 procedures in those at moderate risk. These data support a reconsideration of the possible role of preprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for these procedures in individuals at high IE risk.

### Commentary: Don't leave patients to their own devices: Consider long-term complications after percutaneous atrial septal defect closure [^114GpyFu]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is an important late complication after atrial septal defect (ASD) device closure. Patients undergoing percutaneous closure of ASDs require close monitoring for late complications such as infective endocarditis, cardiac erosion, and valve damage.

Percutaneous device closure of ASDs was introduced in the late 1990s as a feasible alternative to surgical repair. Since then, several studies have shown that short-term outcomes and complication rates after percutaneous ASD closure are noninferior to those after surgery. However, an important consideration with percutaneous ASD closure is the prevalence of late complications that have come to light after its widespread adoption. Some of these, including cardiac erosion, thromboembolism, and infective endocarditis, carry significant morbidity and mortality.

Kitamura and colleagues present a case report of a 20-year-old man with atopic dermatitis and a secundum ASD who was treated with an Amplatzer device (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill) closure and developed endocarditis with large mobile vegetations three years later. The authors concluded that ASD closure devices are associated with risks of thrombotic and infectious complications over the long term.

### Patent foramen ovale closure for stroke prevention and other disorders [^117Cpxcv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

A TTE is done 1 day after the procedure or before discharge. The postprocedure TTE should carefully assess for residual shunts, device instability, evidence of device erosion, deformation of surrounding structures, and evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion. The duration and frequency of follow-up echocardiograms post-PFO closure is unknown. In one study, in addition to TTE evaluation 1 day after the procedure or before discharge, contrast TTE was repeated at 6 months to document proper device implantation and assess for residual shunts. Serial echocardiograms thereafter may be done in cases of persistent shunt or larger device implant.

Infection of a PFO device postimplant is exceedingly rare, but several case reports have documented device infection that required either intravenous antibiotics or surgical management. Given the scarcity of data and low infection rate of patients with intracardiac devices (including Amplatzer devices), there is no definitive evidence that postprocedure prophylaxis is warranted in the absence of high-risk features for intracardiac infection.

- **Infective endocarditis prophylaxis**: If warranted, it should be done for the first 6 months only for dental procedures, which involve manipulation of the gingival tissue, perforation of the oral mucosa, or manipulation of the periapical region of the teeth. Ideally, elective dental procedures should be deferred until 6 months postprocedure. However, if not possible, a single dose of amoxicillin 2 mg should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before dental work.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis incidence following invasive dental procedures: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Hegjy]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis after invasive dental procedures is still unclear. Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis were restricted by guidelines beginning in 2007.

To systematically review and analyze existing evidence on the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures, a comprehensive search was conducted. PubMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, Proquest, Embase, Dentistry and Oral Sciences Source, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from inception to May 2023.

Studies on the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures or time-trend analyses of infective endocarditis incidence before and after antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines were included. Study quality was evaluated using structured tools. Data were extracted by independent observers, and a pooled relative risk (RR) of developing infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in individuals who were receiving antibiotic prophylaxis versus those who were not was computed by random-effects meta-analysis.

The outcome of interest was the incidence of infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis. Of 11,217 records identified, 30 were included (1,152,345 infective endocarditis cases). Of them, 8 (including 12 sub-studies) were either case-control/crossover or cohort studies.

### Can we really do without antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis [^1129fVBS]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Guidance recommends against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of dental intervention for the prevention of infective endocarditis. The authors report the case of a previously well patient with an asymptomatic isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) who developed evidence of systemic and pulmonary emboli following dental treatment. A diagnosis of severe endocarditis affecting a previously normal native mitral valve was made. She subsequently underwent surgical repair of her mitral valve and closure of her VSD. She was deemed fit for discharge on parenteral antibiotics on the thirtieth postoperative day. The authors highlight the need for further re-evaluation of the issues surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis in the context of dental procedures.

### Prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis: To use or not to use [^114cGiYC]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) published their revised guidelines in 2007, markedly limiting the recommendations for the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE), except for patients at the highest risk of adverse outcomes. A recent focused update on valvular heart diseases changed the recommendation for antibiotic use for patients with various underlying heart conditions, including mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which were previously considered "low risk" heart defects. In this article, we argue that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered until concrete clinical evidence disputes the use of this strategy, especially for patients with MVP. This approach is cost-efficient and provides a chance to prevent a dreadful disease.

We have also enlisted two clinical cases to support our argument. These are not uncommon clinical scenarios and emphasize that IE can be fatal in spite of optimum treatment. Patients have the right to make the final decision, and they should be allowed to participate in choosing for, or against this approach until adequate clinical evidence is available.

### Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis among individuals at high risk following dental treatment: A nested case-crossover and case-control study [^114gsg27]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

It is not clear whether the risk of VGS-IE (Viridans Group Streptococcal Infective Endocarditis) among individuals at high risk is elevated following bacteraemia caused by invasive dental procedures (IDPs) compared to daily bacteraemia. If such an association does not exist, the use of prophylactic antibiotics (AP) in dentistry for the prevention of VGS-IE is not clinically meaningful.

Individuals with prior IE, prosthetic heart valve, or complex congenital heart disease (CHD) are considered at high risk because incidence rates of IE among these groups are increased compared to the general population. Between 25%–30% of IE cases are caused by VGS, commonly found in the oral cavity, and may be associated with chewing, brushing, or dental procedures. According to European and American guidelines, individuals at high risk should receive AP prior to IDPs (dental extractions, the removal of dental calculus, and oral surgical procedures) to reduce the risk of VGS-IE. Expert committees revising the guidelines acknowledge that it is unclear whether AP prevents VGS-IE and that VGS-IE is more likely the result of daily bacteraemia caused by chewing and brushing of teeth than by occasional dental procedures.

Recent studies on national data from England as well as Sweden (where prophylaxis is no longer routinely recommended since 2008 and 2012, respectively) detected no increase in VGS-IE associated with the guideline change. In England, an addendum in 2016 stated that prophylaxis is not recommended routinely, although amoxicillin prescriptions did not increase among dentists.

### Secondary stroke prevention: patent foramen ovale, aortic plaque, and carotid stenosis [^114S4335]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

All patients should undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) prior to the intervention for initial diagnosis of patent foramen ovale (PFO) and detailed delineation of anatomy, such as associated atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) and Eustachian valve [Figures 3 and 5]. This includes assessment of right-to-left shunt. The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia and may take less than 30 minutes. Patients can be released to unrestricted physical activity as early as a few hours after the intervention. Antibiotics during the intervention are commonplace, and prevention against endocarditis is recommended for a few months until the device is completely covered by tissue. Failed implantation due to inability to cannulate the PFO is extremely rare, as a 90% success rate can be expected.

Follow-up treatment includes acetylsalicylic acid (80–300 mg daily) for 1–6 months, with the addition of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) for 1–6 months at some centers. At 3–6 months after percutaneous PFO closure, a contrast TOE should be repeated to assess for residual shunt following endothelial overgrowth and exclude thrombosis of the device. Transcranial Doppler is an alternative; however, it cannot rule out a thrombus on the device. If the PFO is completely closed, all medication can be discontinued unless required for another indication, such as associated coronary artery disease.

### In adults, risk for infective endocarditis varied for invasive dental procedures and by antibiotic prophylaxis [^116N38xc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Study overview**: This study examined how the risk of infective endocarditis in adults varied depending on whether they underwent invasive dental procedures and received antibiotic prophylaxis.

- **Methodology**: Researchers drew data from a cohort of patients who underwent various dental procedures. The incidence of infective endocarditis was studied in relation to whether antibiotic prophylaxis was administered.

- **Results**: The findings showed that patients who underwent invasive dental procedures had a higher likelihood of developing infective endocarditis. However, this risk was noticeably reduced in those who received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis.

- **Conclusion**: The study suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis prior to invasive dental procedures might significantly mitigate the risk of infective endocarditis in adults. These results underscore the importance of careful clinical assessment and the potential benefits of prophylactic antibiotics in certain patient populations.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1176wr4N]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Without accurate data on the proportion of cases caused by dental procedures, it is difficult, for statistical analysis purposes, to predefine a clinically relevant level of change after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis, or to determine the sample size needed to detect the change. Using the premise that a high proportion of cases are caused by dental procedures, a large increase in the number of cases would be expected if antibiotic prophylaxis was stopped and was effective, and a comparatively small population would be needed to detect a statistically significant change. On the other hand, if the number of cases caused by dental procedures was small, it would require an infinitely large population to detect any increase in the number.

Indeed, to exclude a 1% increase in the incidence of infective endocarditis above the baseline trend, assuming a similar incidence of infective endocarditis and variability in the numbers of cases on a month-by-month basis, would require a study population of 478.5 million people. For this reason, even with a study covering the entire population of England, the possibility of a small increase in cases after cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis cannot be excluded. However, that we identified no significant increase in cases in a population of this size, despite a large decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, suggests that invasive dental procedures are unlikely to account for a high proportion of the cases.

### Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^117VUob7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection occurring in the lining of the heart, characterized by a high mortality rate. Many dental procedures cause bacteremia, which was previously believed to potentially lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in some individuals. Guidelines from various countries have recommended administering antibiotics to those at high risk of endocarditis before invasive dental procedures. However, recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England as well as Wales suggests that antibiotics are not necessary.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in individuals at increased risk of BE, influences mortality, serious illness, or endocarditis incidence.

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy from the previous review was expanded and run on MEDLINE (1950 to June 2008) and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers, as well as the following databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), EMBASE (1980 to June 2008), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to June 2008).

- **Selection criteria**: Due to the low incidence of BE, it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotics compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk.

### Inappropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis in obstetric patients [^114AEGxL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate infective endocarditis prophylaxis practices during the intrapartum period and assess obstetric providers' adherence to the American Heart Association and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines for infective endocarditis prophylaxis, this study performed a chart review of pharmacy records, electronic nursing records, and physician records. It reports a case series of obstetric patients who received infective endocarditis prophylaxis during the intrapartum period at a single tertiary referral care center over a 1-year study period from August 1, 2004, to July 31, 2005.

Fifty patients received antibiotics for infective endocarditis prophylaxis. Among them, three patients had high-risk cardiac lesions, and three others had moderate-risk cardiac lesions with evidence of intrapartum infection. Thus, only six patients (12.0%, 95% confidence interval 4.5%-24.3%) met the American Heart Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria for an appropriate indication for infective endocarditis prophylaxis. Of these six patients, only three (50.0%, 95% confidence interval 11.8%-88.2%) received appropriate antibiotic regimens.

Antibiotics are frequently administered to obstetric patients during pregnancy. While many receive antibiotics for recommended indications, some do not, as demonstrated by this study. A concerted effort by all practitioners and institutions is necessary to ensure appropriate use of antibiotics.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^115zBmBZ]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The aim of infective endocarditis (IE) services is a critical aspect of patient care. In the absence of high-quality evidence, all new recommendations in this section represent Working Party consensus. IE is an uncommon and challenging condition, and management by experienced multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) is widely considered to be the standard of care. The primary aim of the IE team is to improve patient outcomes, with a secondary aim to enhance the efficiency of care. The need for IE teams in all hospitals is axiomatic, since patients with IE or suspected IE can present to any acute hospital; however, this need has not been sufficiently emphasized. The functions and composition of an IE team will vary in different settings and may need to be dynamic, allowing individuals to rotate into the role, depending on resources and local staffing arrangements.

- **Functions of the multidisciplinary IE team**: Early diagnosis of IE is believed to lead to improved outcomes, though it is likely dependent on the early initiation of optimal antibiotic therapy and the optimal timing of surgery. A reduction in time to targeted antibiotic therapy and the first transthoracic echocardiogram was observed in one MDT evaluation. Educational packages to raise awareness of the risk of IE in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia may also help speed diagnosis. One factor likely to positively affect outcomes for many patients is prompt access to cardiac surgery. Since this is best assessed in a heart centre, there is a need for clear pathways for consultation and referral between non-surgical and surgical centres, alongside objective criteria to guide referral or transfer.

### Infective endocarditis among high-risk individuals before and after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry: A national cohort study [^114TxKmu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Individuals with prior infective endocarditis (IE), prosthetic heart valves, or cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) are at an increased risk of developing IE. The incidence of IE in the overall population is reported to be 2–7 cases per 100,000 individuals per year. However, among high-risk groups, the incidence rates of IE are 100-fold higher compared to the general population.

In Sweden, which has a population of approximately 10 million people, there are around 600 cases of IE annually, with 25%–30% attributed to oral viridans group streptococci (VGS-IE). American and European guidelines recommend that high-risk individuals receive antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures to reduce the risk of post-procedural VGS-IE, despite a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of this prophylaxis. The United Kingdom and Sweden are the only countries that have discontinued AP for individuals considered to be at high risk for developing IE.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112wDTSh]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only four categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcomes. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

- **Methods and results**: A writing group was formed consisting of experts in the prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis, including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were conducted for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency of and morbidity or mortality from VGS IE after publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines, but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

- **Conclusions**: On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis.
