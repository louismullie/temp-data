## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Symptomatic relief of cluster headache in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for symptomatic relief of cluster headache in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and distinguishing acute symptomatic relief from preventive therapy. Then, I should verify first-line acute treatments and their dosing. Next, I will review second-line alternatives and their evidence. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation with dosing limits and special considerations, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "symptomatic relief" refers to acute abortive therapy to stop an attack, not preventive therapy to reduce frequency, so I should focus on treatments with rapid onset and strong evidence for acute efficacy rather than agents like verapamil or galcanezumab that are used for prevention, even though they are important in overall management [^106180e6] [^d926b971].

> Next, I should review first-line options and their dosing. High-quality guidelines consistently recommend 100% oxygen at high flow and subcutaneous sumatriptan as the most effective acute treatments, with oxygen typically delivered at 12 L/min for about 15 minutes via a non-rebreather mask and sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneously as a single dose, repeatable once after at least 1 hour if needed, not exceeding 12 mg in 24 hours [^106180e6] [^aa768599] [^2749227f].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for sumatriptan. The Cochrane review and FDA labeling show that 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan achieves pain freedom in about 48% at 15 minutes and headache relief in about 75% at 15 minutes, with NNTs around 3.3 for pain freedom and 2.4 for relief, which is clinically meaningful given the rapid crescendo of cluster pain; this supports its primacy when available and not contraindicated [^d22be915] [^a10166cd] [^c6a3e456].

> I will now examine second-line alternatives for when sumatriptan is unavailable or contraindicated. Intranasal zolmitriptan 10 mg is the next-best supported option, with randomized data showing significant benefit at 30 minutes and guideline endorsement; intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg is also effective in placebo-controlled trials, though onset is slower than subcutaneous routes, and both are reasonable when subcutaneous injection is not feasible [^952525d6] [^321fdffa] [^1264eee2].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of dihydroergotamine. The FDA label lists IV dihydroergotamine 1–2 mL daily in 1–2 divided doses for symptomatic relief, but contemporary guidelines judge the evidence for acute cluster headache as insufficient, so I should present it as a labeled but lower-priority alternative when triptans and oxygen are not options, with caution about vasoconstriction and drug interactions [^b7f307b1] [^e3376c02].

> Let me consider non-triptan options briefly. Octreotide 100 mcg subcutaneous has modest evidence and may be considered when triptans are contraindicated, though guidelines differ in their enthusiasm; intranasal lidocaine 4–10% can be tried as an adjunct, but evidence is limited and technique-dependent, so I should not overstate its utility [^7f4bc6d4] [^72d27492] [^a62a9f44].

> I need to ensure safety and contraindications are explicit. Triptans carry cardiovascular risk due to vasoconstriction and should be avoided in patients with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic/basilar migraine phenotypes; oxygen is generally safe but may be impractical without access to high-flow delivery systems; I should also confirm that oral triptans are not recommended for acute cluster because of slow onset, which the FDA labeling reflects for sumatriptan tablets [^ab69b52e] [^35be28ac].

> But wait, what if the user is conflating symptomatic relief with prevention? I should double-check that I am not mixing these. Verapamil and galcanezumab are preventive therapies and should not be used for acute attack relief; galcanezumab 300 mg monthly is FDA-approved for episodic cluster headache prevention, not for aborting attacks, so I must keep these categories separate in the final recommendation [^d926b971] [^106180e6].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy. First-line acute treatment is 100% oxygen at 12 L/min for 15 minutes via non-rebreather mask, repeated once if needed, or subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg with a second 6 mg dose after at least 1 hour if there is partial response, not exceeding 12 mg in 24 hours. If neither is feasible, use intranasal zolmitriptan 10 mg or intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg as alternatives, recognizing slower onset. Reserve IV dihydroergotamine or octreotide for special circumstances and consider intranasal lidocaine as an adjunct when available [^106180e6] [^aa768599] [^952525d6] [^321fdffa] [^b7f307b1].

> I should confirm dosing limits and repetition rules clearly. Sumatriptan subcutaneous maximum is 12 mg in 24 hours with doses separated by at least 1 hour, and a second dose should only be considered if there was some response to the first; oxygen can be repeated once if the first treatment is inadequate, but there is no established maximum beyond clinical judgment and access constraints [^aa768599] [^106180e6].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. For adult symptomatic relief of cluster headache, use high-flow 100% oxygen at 12 L/min for 15 minutes or subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg, with a second 6 mg dose after 1 hour if needed up to 12 mg/day; if these are unavailable or contraindicated, use intranasal zolmitriptan 10 mg or intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg, and consider IV dihydroergotamine or octreotide only when first-line options are not suitable, while avoiding oral triptans for acute cluster due to slow onset [^106180e6] [^aa768599] [^952525d6] [^321fdffa] [^35be28ac].

---

For acute cluster headache relief in adults, **high-flow 100% oxygen at 12–15 L/min for 15–20 minutes** [^106180e6] via a non-rebreather mask is first-line [^2749227f] and can be repeated as needed. If oxygen is unavailable or ineffective, **subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg** [^aa768599] is the preferred alternative, with a second 6 mg dose after 1 hour if needed, not exceeding 12 mg in 24 hours [^08280589]. Intranasal zolmitriptan 10 mg [^952525d6] is a reasonable second-line option when sumatriptan is contraindicated or not tolerated [^d22be915]. Avoid oral triptans due to slow onset [^d22be915], and limit triptan use to no more than two days per week to prevent medication overuse.

---

## First-line treatment: high-flow oxygen therapy

- **Dosage**: 100% oxygen at 12–15 L/min for 15–20 minutes [^106180e6] via a non-rebreather mask.
- **Administration**: Start at attack onset; repeat once if needed.
- **Efficacy**: Rapid relief in ~78% of patients within 15 minutes [^6b6eb211].
- **Safety**: Minimal adverse effects; monitor for respiratory compromise in COPD.

---

## Second-line treatment: subcutaneous sumatriptan

- **Dosage**: 6 mg subcutaneously [^aa768599]; repeat once after 1 hour if needed, not exceeding 12 mg in 24 hours [^08280589].
- **Efficacy**: Pain freedom in ~48% at 15 minutes; relief in ~75% at 15 minutes [^d22be915].
- **Limitations**: Contraindicated in cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic/basilar migraine; monitor for chest tightness, flushing, and dizziness [^ab69b52e].

---

## Alternative acute treatments

- **Intranasal zolmitriptan**: 10 mg intranasally [^e895f0ae]; consider if sumatriptan is contraindicated or unavailable [^d22be915].
- **Intranasal lidocaine**: 4–10% solution, 1 mL in the ipsilateral nostril; consider as adjunctive therapy [^a62a9f44].
- **Octreotide**: 100 mcg subcutaneously; consider when triptans are contraindicated or ineffective [^7f4bc6d4].

---

## Treatments to avoid or use with caution

Avoid **oral triptans** because of slow onset and lower efficacy [^d22be915]. Use **ergotamines** cautiously due to vasoconstriction and limited evidence [^e3376c02]. Limit **triptan frequency** to no more than two days per week to prevent medication overuse.

---

## Summary of recommended dosages

| **Treatment** | **Dosage** | **Route** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oxygen | 12–15 L/min | Inhalation | 15–20 minutes; repeat once if needed |
| Sumatriptan | 6 mg | Subcutaneous | Repeat once after 1 hour; max 12 mg/24 h |
| Zolmitriptan | 10 mg | Intranasal | Once; may repeat after 2 hours if needed |
| Lidocaine | 4–10% solution, 1 mL | Intranasal | Every 2–4 hours as needed |
| Octreotide | 100 mcg | Subcutaneous | Once; may repeat after 1 hour if needed |

---

High-flow oxygen is the **first-line acute treatment** for cluster headache, with subcutaneous sumatriptan as the preferred alternative when oxygen is unavailable or ineffective. Intranasal zolmitriptan, intranasal lidocaine, and octreotide are additional options, and oral triptans should be avoided due to slow onset.

### Triptans for acute cluster headache [^d22be915]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2010 (Law 2010). Cluster headache is an uncommon, severely painful, and disabling condition, with rapid onset. Validated treatment options are limited; first-line therapy includes inhaled oxygen. Other therapies such as intranasal lignocaine and ergotamine are not as commonly used and are less well studied. Triptans are successfully used to treat migraine attacks and they may also be useful for cluster headache.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the triptan class of drugs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the acute treatment of episodic and chronic cluster headache in adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies from inception to 22 January 2010 for the original review, and from 2009 to 4 April 2013 for this update.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of triptans for acute treatment of cluster headache episodes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants with different levels of pain relief, requiring rescue medication, and experiencing adverse events and headache-associated symptoms in treatment and control groups were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNT) and harm (NNH).

Main Results

New searches in 2013 did not identify any relevant new studies. All six included studies used a single dose of triptan to treat an attack of moderate to severe pain intensity. Subcutaneous sumatriptan was given to 131 participants at a 6 mg dose, and 88 at a 12 mg dose. Oral or intranasal zolmitriptan was given to 231 participants ata 5 mg dose, and 223 at a 10 mg dose. Placebo was given to 326 participants. Triptans were more effective than placebo for headache relief and pain-free responses. By 15 minutes after treatment with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg, 48% of participants were pain-free and 75% had no pain or mild pain (17% and 32% respectively with placebo).NNTs for subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg were 3.3 (95% CI 2.4 to 5.0) and 2.4 (1.9 to 3.2) respectively. Intranasal zolmitriptan 10mg was of less benefit, with 12% of participants pain-free and 28% with no or mild pain (3% and 7% respectively with placebo).NNTs for intranasal zolmitriptan 10 mg were 11 (6.4 to 49) and 4.9 (3.3 to 9.2) respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited data, subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg was superior to intranasal zolmitriptan 5 mg or 10 mg for rapid (15 minute)responses, which are important in this condition. Oral routes of administration are not appropriate.

Background and Purpose

Cluster headache is a relatively rare, disabling primary headache disorder with a major impact on patients' quality of life. This work presents evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of cluster headache derived from a systematic review of the literature and consensus among a panel of experts.

Methods

The databases PubMed (Medline), Science Citation Index, and Cochrane Library were screened for studies on the efficacy of interventions (last access July 2022). The findings in these studies were evaluated according to the recommendations of the European Academy of Neurology, and the level of evidence was established using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).

Recommendations

For the acute treatment of cluster headache attacks, there is a strong recommendation for oxygen (100%) with a flow of at least 12L/min over 15min and 6mg subcutaneous sumatriptan. Prophylaxis of cluster headache attacks with verapamil at a daily dose of at least 240mg (maximum dose depends on efficacy and tolerability) is recommended. Corticosteroids are efficacious in cluster headache. To reach an effect, the use of at least 100mg prednisone (or equivalent corticosteroid) given orally or at up to 500mg iv per day over 5days is recommended. Lithium, topiramate, and galcanezumab (only for episodic cluster headache) are recommended as alternative treatments. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation is efficacious in episodic but not chronic cluster headache. Greater occipital nerve block is recommended, but electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve is not recommended due to the side effect profile.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled clinical trials in cluster headache [^361d0058]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1995, a committee of the International Headache Society developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for Controlled Trials of Drugs in Cluster Headache. These have not been revised. With the emergence of new medications, neuromodulation devices and trial designs, an updated version of the International Headache Society Guidelines for Controlled Clinical Trials in Cluster Headache is warranted. Given the scarcity of evidence-based data for cluster headache therapies, the update is largely consensus-based, but takes into account lessons learned from recent trials and demands by patients. It is intended to apply to both drug and neuromodulation treatments, with specific proposals for the latter when needed. The primary objective is to propose a template for designing high quality, state-of-the-art, controlled clinical trials of acute and preventive treatments in episodic and chronic cluster headache. The recommendations should not be regarded as dogma and alternative solutions to particular methodological problems should be explored in the future and scientifically validated.

### Acute and preventive pharmacologic treatment of cluster headache [^7c58d2ef]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Cluster headache (CH) is a rare and disabling primary headache disorder. CH attacks are unilateral, short, severe headaches associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms that occur in a periodic fashion. We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing trials of pharmacotherapy for CH and evidence-based suggestions for acute abortive treatment and preventive therapy for cluster headache. Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trials of any pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic relief or prevention of CH were included in this evidence-based review. The main outcomes considered were headache response and pain-free response at 15 and 30 minutes for acute treatment trials, and the cessation of CH attacks within a specific time period or the number of days on which CH attacks occurred for preventive trials. Twenty-seven trials were included in the analysis. The American Academy of Neurology quality criteria were used to assess trial quality and to grade advisements. Based on the evidence, for acute treatment of CH, Level A advice can be given for subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg, zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg and 10 mg, and 100% oxygen 6–12 L/min. Level B advice can be given for sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg and oral zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg. For the prevention of CH, Level B advice can be given for intranasal civamide 100 microg daily and suboccipital steroid injections, and Level C advice can be given for verapamil 360 mg, lithium 900 mg, and melatonin 10 mg.

### Cluster headache: an overview of established and emerging treatments [^d4328988]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The first paper highlights the efficacy and safety of oxygen as a first line, rapidly acting treatment for cluster headache, with reasonable efficacy and side effect profiles for several other agents. The second and third papers demonstrate encouraging progress with neuromodulatory and monoclonal antibody treatments for episodic cluster headache although it remains unclear why many treatments are ineffective in chronic cluster headache. Further work on the pathophysiological differences between episodic and chronic cluster headache could help tailor therapies for chronic cluster headache.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in episodic cluster headache: a randomized clinical trial [^c8c08e69]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by attacks of very severe unilateral pain lasting 15 to 180 minutes occurring in bouts. In its most typical form (episodic CH [ECH]), bouts last weeks or months with attack frequency varying from once every other day to 8 times per day. Pain during attacks is excruciating, with nearly three-fourths of people rating the intensity 10 on a 0- to 10-point scale.CH affects approximately 0.1% of the population, causes substantial negative impacts on all areas of life, and is associated with disability, reduced self-rated health and quality of life (QOL), worsened family and social relations, decreased work productivity, and psychological health decline.

Due to this high disease burden, a preventive therapy capable of rapidly reducing the severity and frequency of CH attacks and inducing improvements in QOL is highly needed. However, none of the recommended preventive medications (eg, verapamil, lithium, topiramate) were developed specifically for CH, and data supporting their efficacy and safety for CH are limited. These agents are often used in higher doses than those recommended in approved indications, and their use is associated with adverse events (AEs) that may require burdensome clinical management, including laboratory and instrumental testing.

Clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) — a neuromodulatory and vasodilatory peptide involved in pathophysiology of headache disorders, — have provided conflicting results in CH. A galcanezumab trial in ECH was positive, whereas another in chronic CH (CCH) was negative; fremanezumab trials in ECH and CCH were negative and terminated early. Ultimately, galcanezumab was approved for ECH prevention in the USbut not in Europe.

Eptinezumab is a high-affinity, humanized anti-CGRP mAb approved for the preventive treatment of migraine. Administered intravenously, eptinezumab provides 100% bioavailability by the end of the infusionand allows rapid binding to CGRP, inhibiting its action. In migraine, eptinezumab was effective during a migraine attack and, therefore, may provide a similar fast onset of benefit in CH. The current trial, Eptinezumab in Participants With Episodic Cluster Headache (ALLEVIATE), was designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in adults with ECH; we present results of the placebo-controlled period (weeks 1–4).

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Headache — preventive pharmacotherapy selection notes that comparative efficacy is either conflicting or shows no difference across preventive medications; in cluster headache, a network meta-analysis comparing verapamil and galcanezumab found no statistically significant difference in number of cluster headache episodes, and randomized controlled trials were limited by small sample size. The Work Group categorized this topic as Reviewed, New-added and stated its confidence in the evidence was very low, citing limitations including small sample size, conflicting critical outcomes, and inconsistent dosing between studies with subtherapeutic dosing. Management should be individualized, considering administration, monitoring, safety, and patient values and preferences to balance benefits versus risks and harms. Accordingly, the Work Group recommends: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific medication over another for the prevention of migraine headache, tension headache, or cluster headache.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for real-world evidence studies in migraine and cluster headache [^0dbe3511]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Real-world evidence studies are an important tool for investigating the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of treatments for headache disorders in clinical practice. These studies use data generated from routine clinical practice from a variety of sources and can help to identify unmet needs in headache care and guide new therapies, including populations not always included in randomized clinical trials of different ages, comorbidities, and concomitant stable treatments. Real-world evidence pertains to the clinical evidence surrounding the utilization, as well as the potential advantages or drawbacks of treatment, which is extracted through an analysis of real-world data. Real-world evidence studies can present unique challenges, including timing of data collection (prospective vs retrospective), data selection, data quality issues and potential biases (selection, confounding factors, etc.). The International Headache Society has developed these guidelines for optimizing the design and conduct of real-world evidence studies, and therefore the strength and reliability of their output.

1.2.3. Design types

Recommendations:

1.2.3.1. Although both parallel-group and crossover designs may be used, parallel-group designs are preferred.

1.2.3.2. Limited to phase II trials, group-sequential, adaptive treatment, and dose-defining designs may be appropriate.

Comments:

The parallel-group design has the advantage of simplicity. Parallel-group trials have successfully demonstrated both superiority and similarity among treatments. Multiple-attack, parallel-group designs can be used to assess intra-individual consistency of response, although carry-over effects and intra-individual correlation must be taken into account (refer to Section 1.2.12 for information about consistency of response). With crossover trial designs, period and carry-over effects may occur, and complexities may be introduced if the tested treatment has notable side effects. Crossover designs can also be used in multiple-attack trials to estimate intra-individual consistency of response with placebo-control groups. In addition, crossover designs allow for the assessment of acute treatment preferences. Subjects who have taken more than one treatment can be asked which treatment they would prefer to take again. Reponses to this question reflect subjects' net assessment of benefits and tolerability. Given the popularity of social media, participants in crossover trials should be instructed to refrain from posting about the trial.

Non-traditional clinical trial designs include step-wise, adaptive, enriched designs and futility trials. Adaptive designs allow for the modification of aspects of a trial (e.g. dosing) while in progress without undermining its scientific validity or integrity. For phase II evaluations of optimal dosing, randomised group-sequential, adaptive treatment, dose-defining, proof-of-concept and two-stage, adaptive, dose-ranging designs are appropriate. The major advantage of these non-traditional designs is that they allow evaluation of the lowest effective dose and highest tolerated dose over a wide dose range in relatively few subjects. The chosen dose(s) can then be confirmed as optimal in phase III clinical trials.

1.2.4. Randomization

Recommendation:

Subjects enrolled in parallel-group and crossover trials should be randomized at entry to the trial, except when considering adaptive randomization.

Comments:

True randomization is crucial to avoid bias and, in large trials, to contribute to group matching. Block randomization using varying block sizes (e.g. blocks sizes of two, four, six, etc.) may be helpful in preventing participants from guessing treatment assignments.

14.2 Cluster Headache

The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4).

n = Number of headaches treated

An estimate of the cumulative probability of a patient with a cluster headache obtaining relief after being treated with either sumatriptan injection or placebo is presented in Figure 1.

The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection).

Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours).

Episodic cluster headache — galcanezumab randomized trial outcomes and safety: In a trial of patients randomized to receive 300 mg once monthly, galcanezumab produced a significant reduction in weekly cluster headaches versus placebo (-3.5 cluster headaches per week; p = 0.04) and a greater proportion achieved at least a 50% reduction at week 3 (71% versus 53%; p = 0.046). No serious adverse events (AEs), deaths, or suicidal ideation or behavior were reported; AEs were more common with galcanezumab, with 8% experiencing pain at the injection site. The study was terminated before reaching the planned sample size (n = 162). After this study, the FDA approved galcanezumab for preventive treatment of episodic cluster headache in adults at a dose of 300 mg subcutaneous, administered once monthly.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials conducted in the US (Study 11) or the US and Canada (Study 12) established the effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for the preventive treatment of migraine), or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

1.3.4.5. Headache relief

Recommendations:

1.3.4.5.1. Headache relief, defined as the decrease in headache pain from moderate or severe at baseline to mild or none at 2 hours after treatment and before taking any rescue medication (refer to Section 1.2.11), should be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

1.3.4.5.2. A time point before 2 hours after treatment can be used when testing parenteral treatments.

Comments:

Headache relief should be used as an outcome measure, but only as a secondary endpoint and mainly to facilitate comparison of the results of new clinical trials with those of previous programmes Since headache relief is associated with relief of disability, it can be used in clinical trials as a proxy for pain improvement and restoration of function. Headache relief is also useful for comprehensive cost of treatment analyses.

In older acute migraine clinical trials, headache relief at 2 hours after treatment was used extensively as a primary efficacy outcome based on the suggestion that patients may consider an acute treatment effective while residual headache pain persists. The validity of this argument has been challenged by evidence showing that patients do not believe a reduction in headache pain from moderate to mild constitutes success and expect acute treatment to provide freedom from pain. In addition, the headache relief endpoint assumes that the magnitude of change from severe pain to no pain is clinically equivalent to the change from moderate pain to mild pain, which is not the case. Finally, the verbal rating of pain intensity as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe assumes it is an interval variable in the absence of clinical validation.

1.3.4.6. Time to meaningful relief

Recommendation:

Time to meaningful relief can be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

Comments:

Time to meaningful relief is most often assessed by subjects using electronic diaries with time-stamp capabilities, which have largely replaced the use of stopwatches. The time-stamped information improves the precision of time estimates relative to the fixed-interval assessments once commonly used in migraine trials by providing data about treatment response over a clinically relevant period of time instead of at pre-specified time points (e.g. 1, 2, or 4 hours after treatment). Time stamping also allows diary entries for time to meaningful relief to be analysed by powerful statistical methods, such as survival analysis, that are superior to analyses based on fixed intervals.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^f4028b08]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Management of cluster headache

Treatment strategies are either abortive (acute pain relief), transitional or prophylactic. The first-line abortive strategy is subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg (maximum two per day), with most people obtaining pain relief within 15 min (effective in 75%). If this cannot be used or tolerated, intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg or zolmitriptan 5 mg are alternatives but can take up to 30 min for their full effect. Home oxygen can be very useful at high flow, 100% concentration, via a non-rebreathe mask at 12–15 L/min for up to 20 min. In the UK, this is ordered via a Home Oxygen Order Form (HOOF-A). If carbon dioxide retention is a concern, we initially obtain an arterial blood gas sample and undertake formal respiratory assessment. If it is effective, then patients can use ambulatory oxygen to take to work and so on (in the UK, this requires a HOOF-B). These small cylinders contain around 30 min of oxygen, so patients need an ample supply.

Transitional treatments can help the patient get through a crisis period while starting preventative strategies. Prednisolone can be used, typically at 1 mg/kg up to 60 mg, for 5–7 days before tapering over 2 weeks. However, the efficacy rapidly diminishes during corticosteroid withdrawal and prolonged or multiple courses of corticosteroids carry significant side effects. GON blocks can also be very effective in reducing the attacks in the short term.

Patients may need a preventative therapy to shorten the duration of the cluster bout and to help to control pain. Verapamil has proven efficacy in reducing the frequency of cluster headache after the first week, with a reduced median number of cluster headaches per day (1.65 on placebo vs 0.6 on verapamil). We perform ECG before starting verapamil, and again with each dose increase, looking for a prolonged electrocardiography P wave to R wave interval. A typical starting dose is 240 mg with 80 mg increments. Some centres use a faster titration although there are no safety studies to evaluate this regimen (see online supplementary table S1). Second-line agents include lithium carbonate (see online supplementary table S2) and topiramate. There is less evidence for gabapentin, melatonin and sodium valproate but we may occasionally use these if other agents fail.

### Topiramate (trokendi XR) [^16bb718b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials conducted in US (Study 11) or the US and Canada (Study 12) established the effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, opthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventative medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either immediate-release topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for migraine prophylaxis) or placebo, and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period.). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

1.2.12. Consistency of response

Recommendations:

1.2.12.1. Intra-individual consistency of response may be evaluated over multiple attacks in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

1.2.12.2. Response to at least four attacks should be assessed, and at least one of the four attacks should be treated with placebo in a randomized fashion.

Comments:

Population-level consistency of response refers to the proportion of treated subjects who achieve a trial endpoint for the first, second, third, or n th treated attack. This is best assessed in randomized controlled trials evaluating multiple attacks (≥ 4) using any of the following three designs. In the first design, all subjects use active treatment for at least three attacks, with placebo in one additional attack, in a randomized order. The second design administers the active treatment for all attacks in most subjects, while a subset uses both active treatment and placebo in a randomized manner for at least four attacks. The third design uses a combined approach, with an initial 1-month double-blind phase (subjects use active treatment or placebo for the first attack) followed by a 1- or 2-month open-label phase, during which subjects treat at least three attacks with the active intervention.

Testing the effect of an acute treatment on several migraine attacks may increase the discriminative power for efficacy when outcome measures are averaged across multiple attacks for each subject, provided that all analysed subjects treat the same number of attacks. Using a generalized estimating equation or random-effects modelling, all treated attacks can be used as a basis for comparison. Generalized estimating equations control for intra-individual correlation, whereas random-effects models treat each individual as a random effect. However, the increase in analytic power can be counterbalanced by a decrease in the number of subjects completing the trial. Relative to single-attack trials, multiple attack trials have higher dropout rates and may introduce an unmanageable bias if dropouts are related to tolerability issues or lack of efficacy. Furthermore, repeated intake of placebo when a standard treatment is available raises ethical issues.

Assessing intra-individual and population-level consistency of response has been difficult in long-term safety trials because they rarely include a placebo control and often introduce selection bias when responders from an efficacy trial are carried over. Long-term trials should be used to evaluate the development of tolerance (tachyphylaxis).

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^a0abf2be]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.4.2. Sustained pain freedom

Recommendations:

1.3.4.2.1. Sustained pain freedom is defined as the percentage of subjects who are pain free at 2 hours with no use of rescue medication or relapse within 24 or 48 hours of the initial treatment.

1.3.4.2.2. Sustained pain free is a recommended secondary endpoint, and it is the primary endpoint in early intervention trials.

Comments:

Sustained pain freedom is an important measure of migraine treatment response. By integrating initial response, use of rescue medication, and relapse, the sustained pain-free rate is a more scientifically robust outcome measure than the relapse rate alone. It is therefore recommended over relapse as an endpoint in comparative trials. Investigators should be aware that the clinical success of acute treatment may be underestimated when using this narrowly-defined efficacy outcome measure, but it has been useful in comparing triptans and can be useful for non-triptan comparisons. Sustained pain freedom can also be helpful in trials evaluating the use of acute treatment in subjects with mild pain (e.g. early intervention trials).

Sustained relief is a composite efficacy outcome measure based on concepts similar to those of sustained pain-free. It is defined as headache relief (not pain freedom) and absence of relapse or use of rescue medication after the initial response. Sustained relief is not recommended as a secondary efficacy outcome measure.

### Management of cluster headache: treatments and their mechanisms [^f13e7d0a]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of cluster headache is similar to that of other primary headache disorders and can be broadly divided into acute and preventive treatments. Acute treatments for cluster headache are primarily delivered via rapid, non-oral routes (such as inhalation, nasal, or subcutaneous) while preventives include a variety of unrelated treatments such as corticosteroids, verapamil, and galcanezumab. Neuromodulation is becoming an increasingly popular option, both non-invasively such as vagus nerve stimulation when medical treatment is contraindicated or side effects are intolerable, and invasively such as occipital nerve stimulation when medical treatment is ineffective. Clinically, this collection of treatment types provides a range of options for the informed clinician. Scientifically, this collection provides important insights into disease mechanisms.

Methods

Two authors performed independent narrative reviews of the literature on guideline recommendations, clinical trials, real-world data, and mechanistic studies.

Results

Cluster headache is treated with acute treatments, bridge treatments, and preventive treatments. Common first-line treatments include subcutaneous sumatriptan and high-flow oxygen as acute treatments, corticosteroids (oral or suboccipital injections) as bridge treatments, and verapamil as a preventive treatment. Some newer acute (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation) and preventive (galcanezumab) treatments have excellent clinical trial data for episodic cluster headache, while other newer treatments (occipital nerve stimulation) have been specifically tested in treatment-refractory chronic cluster headache. Most treatments are suspected to act on the trigeminovascular system, the autonomic system, or the hypothalamus.

Conclusions

The first-line treatments have not changed in recent years, but new treatments have provided additional options for patients.

### Intranasal sumatriptan in cluster headache: randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study [^321fdffa]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Current evidence-based acute treatments of cluster headache are limited to oxygen inhalation and subcutaneous sumatriptan. Intranasal sumatriptan is a new formulation with better tolerability than the subcutaneous route. Two open-label studies suggested efficacy of intranasal sumatriptan in cluster headache.

Methods

In a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial, patients with episodic or chronic cluster headache whose attacks lasted at least 45 minutes each treated one attack with 20 mg sumatriptan nasal spray and another one, at least 24 hours later, with matching placebo. They scored their headache on a five-point scale (very severe, severe, moderate, mild, or none) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes. The primary outcome measure was headache response (a decrease in pain from very severe, severe, or moderate to mild or none) at 30 minutes. Secondary outcome measures included pain-free rates, relief of associated symptoms, and rates of adverse events. Multilevel multivariate analysis was used for statistical analysis.

Results

Five study centers enrolled 118 patients in whom 154 attacks were treated: 77 with sumatriptan and 77 with placebo. The responder rates at 30 minutes were 57% for sumatriptan and 26% for placebo (p = 0.002). Pain-free rates at 30 minutes were 47% for sumatriptan and 18% for placebo (p = 0.003). Sumatriptan was also superior to placebo considering initial response, meaningful relief, and relief of associated symptoms. There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusion

Sumatriptan nasal spray is effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of cluster headache attacks of at least 45 minutes' duration.

Cluster headache – triptan adverse effects and patient preferences — Reported adverse events (AEs) included local reaction paresthesia (the most common), sweating, feeling of heaviness, somnolence, nausea and vomiting, injection-site reaction (e.g., pain, swelling, burning, erythema, tingling), neurologic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, tiredness, numbness of hands, tingling, feeling of paralysis in the face, cold and hot sensations), bad taste, discomfort of nasal cavity, and pain or tightness in the throat, chest, or neck; AEs were more common with a triptan versus placebo but were generally mild or moderate in severity. Patient preferences vary little regarding the acute treatment of cluster headache, and despite intranasal and subcutaneous administration methods typically being less preferred than oral medications, patients with cluster headaches have less variability in acceptance of these alternative administration methods because the preference for rapid pain freedom is much stronger.

Preventive treatment

Verapamil

Verapamil was found to be effective initially in an open-label studyand subsequently in two randomised clinical trials. It is widely accepted as the first-line preventive treatment for cluster headache, typically starting with 80 mg three times a day with view to increasing it by 80 mg every 2 weeks according to response; the maximum recommended dose is 320 mg three times a day (see table 2).

Table 2
Recommended verapamil titration regimen

Treating clinicians should aware that up to one in five patients taking verapamil develop cardiac arrhythmia, bradycardia or lengthening of the PR interval. Hence, it is recommended to perform a baseline 12-lead ECG before starting treatment, then at 10 days after each dose increment. After reaching a stable dose, ECGs should be checked once every 1–2 months and then every 6 months. There are reports of delayed onset of ECG abnormalities up to 2 years after being on a stable verapamil maintenance dose. Other less serious side effects to verapamil therapy include constipation and pedal oedema.

Once a bout of cluster headache is over, the patient should withdraw verapamil cautiously to stop, with view to going straight on the effective dose of verapamil in the next cluster bout, provided the baseline ECG is normal. It is important not to keep patients on verapamil after their bout ends; anecdotally, we have found that this prolongs future bouts and there is a risk of tachyphylaxis.

Lithium

The evidence is limited for lithiumhowever it is generally accepted as a reasonable second-line option. It is more commonly used in chronic compared with episodic cluster headache but its potential impact on thyroid function and risk of interference with diuresis may complicate and limit its use. Lithium therapy requires regular blood monitoring to maintain a serum concentration between 0.4 and 1.2 mEq/L, due to its narrow therapeutic index and potential risk of toxicity manifesting as a wide array of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms.

Lithium dosing starts at 300 mg once a day, with weekly 300 mg increments according to response, to a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day; serum concentrations are best checked 12 hours after dosing; once the dose is stable and attacks controlled, serum lithium should be checked once every 1–2 months.

### Gabapentin for the treatment and prophylaxis of cluster headache [^e9a2d49d]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cluster headache is an uncommon debilitating condition for which effective management remains a challenge. We describe the use of gabapentin in the treatment and prophylaxis of cluster headache in a patient who was refractory to other treatments.

Case Report

A 38-year-old man had a history of intermittent right-side headaches for 24 years, diagnosed as cluster headache. He received only partial relief from a range of conventional treatments. A trial with gabapentin 300 mg twice daily was tried and found to be effective in treatment and prophylaxis of his headaches.

Conclusion

Gabapentin was effective in the treatment of a patient with cluster headache. Further investigation of gabapentin compared with conventional treatments and placebo is warranted.

### Differential efficacy of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation for the acute treatment of episodic and chronic cluster headache: a meta-analysis [^6b6eb211]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache is a highly disabling brain disorder typically characterized by attacks of excruciating unilateral headache associated with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features and often an urge to move. Attacks last from 15 minutes to 3 hours and may occur up to eight times a day, frequently at night. About 80% of patients have episodic cluster headache, in which attacks come in periods lasting from 1 week to several months and are separated by attack-free periods of more than 1 month. The remaining 20% experience chronic cluster headache, in which attacks continue to recur for more than 1 year without attack-free periods longer than a month.

Research into differential treatment effects among episodic and chronic cluster headache subtypes warrants further attention in clinical trials. Cluster headache therapy for the acute treatment of both subtypes should preferably have a low adverse event profile and be easy to use and must be fast acting because the pain builds up quickly and is extremely severe. Current acute treatments for cluster headache, although limited, have shown efficacy, but clinical disadvantages include daily dosing limitations, cardiovascular contraindications, inconvenience, and/or unavailability. Pain-free rates of up to 49% (subcutaneous sumatriptan) at 15 minutes have been reported in clinical studies of triptans for the acute treatment of cluster headache, and inhalation of 100% oxygen was shown to relieve attacks at 15 minutes in 78% of patients. Results for episodic and chronic cluster headache subtypes are not commonly evaluated separately, likely because of the much smaller chronic cluster headache subgroups typically enrolled. Studies that separately evaluated both subtypes demonstrated higher treatment effects in episodic cluster headache than in chronic cluster headache but were not powered to dissect any differential effects. Consistent with these findings, recent data suggested that a monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand was ineffective for the preventive treatment of chronic cluster headache but effective for preventing attacks in episodic cluster headache.

2.2.2. Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint in early intervention trials should be pain-free at 2 hours after treatment. However, as the aim of early intervention trials is also to evaluate efficacy on pain progression, sustained pain-free to 24 or 48 hours (refer to Section 1.3.4.2) should be used as a co-primary endpoint. The number of protocol violators (subjects assigned to treat mild headache who treat moderate-severe and vice versa) in early intervention trials can be substantial. As protocol violators, these subjects can be excluded from the ITT analysis, but there is a risk that analysis of the smaller sample will not be sufficiently powered to detect treatment effects. An acceptable alternative is to reassign these subjects to their actual treatment groups, as long as the re-allocation is done before the blind is broken.

### Cluster headache pathophysiology-insights from current and emerging treatments [^8e508578]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Cluster headache is a debilitating primary headache disorder that affects approximately 0.1% of the population worldwide. Cluster headache attacks involve severe unilateral pain in the trigeminal distribution together with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features and a sense of agitation. Acute treatments are available and are effective in just over half of the patients. Until recently, preventive medications were borrowed from non-headache indications, so management of cluster headache is challenging. However, as our understanding of cluster headache pathophysiology has evolved on the basis of key bench and neuroimaging studies, crucial neuropeptides and brain structures have been identified as emerging treatment targets. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is known about the pathophysiology of cluster headache and discuss the existing treatment options and their mechanisms of action. Existing acute treatments include triptans and high-flow oxygen, interim treatment options include corticosteroids in oral form or for greater occipital nerve block, and preventive treatments include verapamil, lithium, melatonin and topiramate. We also consider emerging treatment options, including calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation and somatostatin receptor agonists, discuss how evidence from trials of these emerging treatments provides insights into the pathophysiology of cluster headache and highlight areas for future research.

### Emerging treatments for cluster headache: hopes and disappointments [^4cabf354]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cluster headache stands among the worst debilitating pain conditions. Available treatments for cluster headache have often disabling side effects, are not tolerated, or are ineffective. The management of drug-refractory chronic forms is challenging. New treatments are warranted and reported here.

Recent Findings

In cluster headache acute treatment, delivery systems like Demand Valve Oxygen or nonrebreather-type masks could enhance the effectiveness of inhaled oxygen therapy. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation relieves cluster headache pain at short-term in episodic patients. Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation combines acute and preventive properties in subsets of patients and is of interest in selected refractory chronic forms. In cluster headache prevention, 'hypothalamic' deep brain stimulation is being refined using slightly different stereotactic coordinates or lower risk methods like endoventricular stimulation. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies provide interesting results in episodic cluster headache, have a good safety profile, but do not appear effective in chronic cluster headache.

Summary

These novel approaches provide additional alternatives to conventional cluster headache management, but results obtained in chronic forms are often disappointing. Research on cluster headache is often hampered by the lack of awareness in the medical world and by the relatively low prevalence of cluster headache compared with migraine. However, common features shared by these two primary headaches could help developing disease-specific therapies.

Conclusions

In this systematic review of non-invasive neuromodulation device studies in the acute and preventive treatment of migraine and cluster headache, nVNS studies demonstrated the most consistent adherence to IHS recommendations. Future trials should be rigorously designed to facilitate comparisons across devices. Guidelines specific to evaluating non-invasive neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of migraine and cluster headache will soon be available, but adherence to current recommendations for pharmacological trials will minimise heterogeneity among neuromodulation studies.

### Placebo response in cluster headache trials: a review [^125db591]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

Probably because of its relative rarity as primary headache, there are few well-controlled clinical trials on cluster headache (CH) patients. Due to the severity of the pain, the placebo response in CH has been considered to be small. During the eighties the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were reported, and placebo responses demonstrated. Here we review the placebo response in CH trials in order to assess its magnitude and consider how future studies can be optimized. Six trials were identified with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design testing treatments of acute CH. For those with a primary endpoint set to no or mild headache the placebo responses varied from 7 to 42%. In five of seven prophylactic trials, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design, the placebo was merely used to set a baseline for comparison. The placebo responses were reported in only two trials. Here the response varies from 14 to 43%, the lowest value was reported using the strict endpoint; cessation of headache attacks. We conclude that a placebo response exists in trials of drugs on CH patients. Furthermore, this placebo response is of the same magnitude as that seen in migraine studies. We recommend the use of IHS guidelines when designing new trials. The possibility of a genuine biological mechanism responsible for the placebo response is discussed.

1.3.4.7. Time to pain freedom

Recommendations:

1.3.4.7.1. Speed of onset of therapeutic effect can be evaluated using a survival analysis of pain freedom at time points earlier than 2 hours after treatment.

1.3.4.7.2. Time to pain freedom is a recommended secondary efficacy outcome measure.

Comments:

Time to pain freedom is a more exact measure than time to meaningful relief. Ratings of headache intensity at pre-defined time points before 2 hours (e.g. at 10- to 15-minute intervals) can be used to analyse the speed of onset of treatment response. Investigators should be aware that additional data recordings can complicate headache diaries and potentially lead to missing data.

Time-to-event analysis is the most appropriate statistical method to assess speed of onset of therapeutic effect, using no headache when pain freedom is the outcome and mild or no headache when headache relief is the outcome. The difference between two treatments should be expressed as a percentage, and because p -value calculations alone can be misleading, 95% CIs should be given in order to better inform readers about the significance of the difference. Time-to-headache relief analyses have been used in previous trials, but early response rates were relatively small. Subcutaneous sumatriptan is an exception.

1.3.4.8. Duration of attacks

Recommendation:

Duration of attacks should not be used as an efficacy measure.

Comments:

The duration of a migraine attack can be influenced by the effect of treatment, as well as by physiological factors (e.g. sleep) and external variables (e.g. use of rescue medication beyond 2 hours). Since these variables cannot be controlled for in a clinical trial, they prevent an accurate and scientifically sound interpretation of the independent effect of an investigational intervention. The robustness of the pain freedom and sustained pain freedom outcome measures mitigates the need for attack duration as an efficacy measure.

Cluster headaches are characterized by a rapid onset of severe pain and are associated with a higher suicide risk, and none of the acute treatments discussed here assessed their potential to decrease suicide rate in this population, underlining the need for acute treatment options. The Work Group determined that the benefits of verapamil for cluster headache prevention were balanced with the potential harms of AEs and burdens associated with monitoring requirements and medication administration, and patient values and preferences varied because of differences in tolerance and feasibility for the safety monitoring required for this drug.
