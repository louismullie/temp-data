## Question

Can you safely take qulipta and topiramate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Qulipta (atogepant) and topiramate can be safely taken together, and if so, what dose adjustments or precautions are needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and interaction potential. Then, I should verify what the FDA label says about coadministration with CYP3A4 inducers like topiramate. Next, I will check for any direct drug–drug interaction studies and quantify the magnitude of any exposure change. After that, I need to consider clinical implications for episodic versus chronic migraine and any special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation with monitoring points and counseling language.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and mechanism. Atogepant is a CGRP receptor antagonist metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, which makes it susceptible to inducers and inhibitors of that pathway, whereas topiramate is a weak CYP3A4 inducer and also has carbonic anhydrase activity, so I need to ensure I'm not missing a clinically meaningful interaction here [^32e681a8] [^1ec82980].

> Wait, let me verify the direct interaction data. The FDA label explicitly states that coadministration of atogepant with topiramate, a weak CYP3A4 inducer, decreased atogepant mean steady-state AUC by about 25% and Cmax by about 24% in healthy subjects, and importantly, there was no clinically significant change in topiramate pharmacokinetics, which supports bidirectional safety in that regard [^1ec82980] [^f224bc7a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance. A 25% reduction in exposure could theoretically blunt efficacy, but the label's dosing guidance treats weak inducers differently than strong inducers: for episodic migraine, the recommended atogepant dose with weak inducers is 30–60 mg once daily, whereas for chronic migraine, the label advises avoiding concomitant use with strong or moderate inducers and does not specifically restrict weak inducers, which implies that weak inducers are acceptable with dose optimization in episodic migraine and that chronic migraine requires more caution even though the topiramate effect is modest [^ac787690].

> I should double-check whether any authoritative drug–drug interaction databases flag a contraindication. DrugBank reports no interaction found between atogepant and topiramate, which aligns with the FDA's characterization of a manageable, non-contraindicated interaction rather than a prohibition, reinforcing that coadministration is not inherently unsafe when appropriately dosed [^15532d21].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability to ensure there isn't a hidden additive toxicity signal. Atogepant's most common adverse effects are nausea, constipation, and fatigue/somnolence, while topiramate carries risks including cognitive effects, paresthesia, mood changes, metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, and teratogenicity; importantly, there is no signal for overlapping toxicity that would create a new safety concern when combining them, though clinicians should still monitor for cumulative CNS effects and kidney stone risk with topiramate [^8ce983d1] [^5ede19de] [^6d918727].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications. In pregnancy, both agents carry fetal risk and should generally be avoided, so coadministration would not be appropriate in that context. In severe hepatic impairment, atogepant is contraindicated, and in severe renal impairment or ESRD, atogepant dosing is restricted, so I need to ensure organ function is adequate before combining therapies. For women of childbearing potential on topiramate, reliable contraception is essential given teratogenic risk, and clinicians should remember topiramate can reduce contraceptive efficacy at higher doses, which is a separate but critical safety issue [^1b3defae] [^9e15f619] [^72534dba] [^b5578c57].

> I will now examine practical dosing strategy. For episodic migraine, if topiramate is already on board, increasing atogepant to 30–60 mg daily is reasonable to offset the modest induction effect, with the choice of 30 versus 60 mg guided by response and tolerability. For chronic migraine, although the label emphasizes avoiding strong/moderate inducers, it does not prohibit weak inducers; nonetheless, given the exposure reduction and the higher stakes in chronic disease, I should confirm that the benefit–risk is favorable and consider alternatives or closer monitoring if response is suboptimal, recognizing that the evidence base for this specific combination in chronic migraine is indirect [^ac787690] [^c02d5e65].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on atogepant and we are adding topiramate? I should confirm that we anticipate a gradual reduction in atogepant exposure as topiramate is titrated, so if migraine control wanes during topiramate initiation, up-titration of atogepant within the labeled 30–60 mg range is appropriate, with reassessment after steady state is reached for both drugs [^ac787690] [^c02d5e65].

> Next, I should review monitoring and counseling. I need to ensure we monitor for constipation and nausea with atogepant, watch for cognitive slowing, paresthesia, mood changes, and metabolic acidosis with topiramate, and counsel on hydration and kidney stone prevention. I should also advise on contraception and pregnancy planning given topiramate's teratogenicity and the limited pregnancy safety data for atogepant, and remind patients not to stop topiramate abruptly to avoid seizure risk even in non-epileptic users [^5ede19de] [^72534dba] [^5ddb3931].

> Final synthesis: Yes, atogepant and topiramate can be safely coadministered in appropriate patients, with the key steps being to increase atogepant to 30–60 mg daily for episodic migraine to compensate for the roughly 25% exposure reduction from topiramate's weak CYP3A4 induction, to avoid the combination in pregnancy, to screen for hepatic and renal contraindications, and to monitor for additive CNS and GI effects while reinforcing contraception and kidney stone precautions with topiramate. For chronic migraine, the label's caution about inducers supports careful selection and monitoring rather than a blanket prohibition of weak inducers, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential [^1ec82980] [^ac787690] [^5ede19de] [^72534dba].

---

Qulipta (atogepant) and topiramate can be used together, but **topiramate reduces atogepant exposure by about 25%** [^1ec82980], so for episodic migraine the atogepant dose should be increased to 30–60 mg daily [^ac787690]. For chronic migraine, avoid coadministration because efficacy may be compromised [^ac787690]. No clinically significant interaction occurs in the other direction, and no special monitoring is required beyond standard care [^f224bc7a]. If combined, monitor migraine control and adjust the atogepant dose as needed [^ac787690].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and interaction potential

Atogepant is a CGRP receptor antagonist metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 [^32e681a8]; topiramate is a weak CYP3A4 inducer [^1ec82980]. This induction can **reduce atogepant exposure** and potentially decrease efficacy [^1ec82980].

---

## Clinical evidence on interaction

A dedicated drug–drug interaction study showed that topiramate reduced atogepant exposure by about 25% (AUC and Cmax) [^1ec82980]. Importantly, **no clinically significant changes in topiramate pharmacokinetics** were observed, indicating the interaction is unidirectional [^f224bc7a].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

### Episodic migraine

For episodic migraine, the FDA recommends increasing atogepant to **30–60 mg once daily** when coadministered with topiramate to maintain efficacy [^ac787690].

---

### Chronic migraine

For chronic migraine, the FDA advises **avoiding coadministration** with topiramate because reduced atogepant exposure may compromise efficacy [^ac787690].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Adverse effects**: No new safety signals have been identified with the combination; adverse effects are consistent with the individual drug profiles [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Standard monitoring for each drug is sufficient; no special tests are required [^notfound].
- **Patient counseling**: Inform patients about potential reduced efficacy and the need for dose adjustment if topiramate is added or removed [^df5d3e1d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinion

Guidelines support the use of atogepant for migraine prevention and acknowledge topiramate as a preventive option, but they do not specifically address the combination; expert consensus aligns with FDA guidance to **adjust the atogepant dose** when combined with topiramate [^a33a5120] [^6d918727].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Episodic migraine + topiramate | Increase atogepant to 30–60 mg daily [^ac787690] |
| Chronic migraine + topiramate | Avoid coadministration [^ac787690] |
| Adding topiramate to atogepant | Monitor migraine control; adjust atogepant dose as needed [^ac787690] |
| Removing topiramate from combination | Consider reducing atogepant dose back to 10–60 mg daily [^c02d5e65] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical takeaways

- **Combination use**: Atogepant and topiramate can be combined, but dose adjustment is needed due to reduced atogepant exposure [^1ec82980].
- **Episodic migraine**: Increase atogepant to 30–60 mg daily when used with topiramate [^ac787690].
- **Chronic migraine**: Avoid coadministration to prevent loss of efficacy [^ac787690].
- **Monitoring**: Standard monitoring suffices; adjust therapy based on migraine control [^notfound].

Overall, the combination is acceptable with **dose adjustment** for episodic migraine, but should be avoided in chronic migraine; monitor response and titrate as needed [^ac787690].

### Atogepant (Qulipta) [^1ec82980]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Atogepant is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, NTCP, BSEP, MRP3, or MRP4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Atogepant is a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and MATE1. No clinical drug interactions are expected for atogepant as a perpetrator with these transporters.

In Vivo Studies

CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Co-administration of QULIPTA with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a clinically significant increase (Cmaxby 2.15-fold and AUC by 5.5-fold) in the exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling suggested co-administration of QULIPTA with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors increase atogepant AUC by 1.7- and 1.1-fold, respectively. The changes in atogepant exposure when coadministered with weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant.

CYP3A4 Inducers

Co-administration of QULIPTA with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased atogepant AUC by 60% and Cmaxby 30% in healthy subjects [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. No dedicated drug interaction studies were conducted to assess concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Moderate inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease atogepant exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Co-administration of QULIPTA with topiramate, a weak inducer of CYP3A4, decreased atogepant mean steady-state AUC₀-τ by 25% and mean steady-state Cmaxby 24% in healthy subjects [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Raynaud's Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of QULIPTA was evaluated in 2657 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of QULIPTA. Of these, 1225 patients were exposed to QULIPTA for at least 6 months, and 826 patients were exposed for 12 months.

In the 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 314 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 10 mg once daily, 411 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 30 mg once daily, 678 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 60 mg once daily, and 663 patients received placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Approximately 88% were female, 75% were White, 13% were Black, 10% were Asian, and 10% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean age at study entry was 41 years (range 18 to 74 years).

The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 4% and greater than placebo) are nausea, constipation, and fatigue/somnolence.

8.000000000000000e+00 6 Renal Impairment

The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For episodic migraine, in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15–29 mL/min) and in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CLcr < 15 mL/min), the recommended dosage of QULIPTA is 10 mg once daily; in patients with ESRD undergoing intermittent dialysis, QULIPTA should preferably be taken after dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. For chronic migraine, avoid use of QULIPTA in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

8.000000000000000e+00 7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment of QULIPTA is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use of QULIPTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Atogepant (Qulipta) [^bda6a687]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of atogepant PO (also known as Qulipta):
- **Decreased serum rimegepant levels**: use caution in patients taking CYP3A4 inducers. Increase atogepant dose to 30–60 mg once daily for episodic migraine. Avoid use for chronic migraine.
- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as atogepant has been associated with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema.
- **Increased serum rimegepant levels**: use caution in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Reduce atogepant dose to 10 mg once daily for episodic migraine. Avoid use for chronic migraine.
- **Increased serum rimegepant levels**: use caution OATP inhibitors. Reduce atogepant dose to 10–30 mg once daily for episodic migraine and 30 mg once daily for chronic migraine.

BCRP/OATP/P-gp Inhibitors

Co-administration of QULIPTA with single dose rifampin, an OATP inhibitor, increased atogepant AUC by 2.85-fold and Cmaxby 2.23-fold in healthy subjects [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

Co-administration of QULIPTA with quinidine, a P-gp inhibitor, increased atogepant AUC by 26% and Cmaxby 4% in healthy subjects. The changes in atogepant exposure when co-administered with P-gp inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant.

PBPK modeling suggests that co-administration of QULIPTA with BCRP inhibitors increases atogepant exposure by 1.2-fold. This increase is not expected to be clinically significant.

Other Drug Interaction Evaluations

Co-administration of QULIPTA with oral contraceptive components ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, famotidine, esomeprazole, acetaminophen, naproxen, sumatriptan, or ubrogepant did not result in significant pharmacokinetic interactions for either atogepant or co-administered drugs. Co-administration of QULIPTA with topiramate did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Atogepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 5 times the maximum recommended daily dose, QULIPTA does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Following oral administration of QULIPTA, atogepant is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations at approximately 1 to 2 hours. Atogepant displays dose-proportional pharmacokinetics up to 170 mg per day (approximately 3 times the highest recommended dosage), with no accumulation.

Effect of Food

When QULIPTA was administered with a high-fat meal, the food effect was not significant (AUC and Cmaxwere reduced by approximately 18% and 22%, respectively, with no effect on median time to maximum atogepant plasma concentration). QULIPTA was administered without regard to food in clinical efficacy studies.

Distribution

Plasma protein binding of atogepant was not concentration-dependent in the range of 0.1 to 10 µM; the unbound fraction of atogepant was approximately 4.7% in human plasma. The mean apparent volume of distribution of atogepant (Vz/F) after oral administration is approximately 292 L.

Elimination

Metabolism

Atogepant is eliminated mainly through metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4. The parent compound (atogepant), and a glucuronide conjugate metabolite (M23) were the most prevalent circulating components in human plasma.

14.2 Chronic Migraine

Study 3

The efficacy of QULIPTA for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine in adults was demonstrated in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 3). The study enrolled patients with at least a 1-year history of chronic migraine, according to the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria.

Study 3 (NCT03855137) included randomization of patients to QULIPTA 60 mg once daily (N = 262) or placebo (N = 259) for 12 weeks. A subset of patients (11%) was allowed to use one concomitant migraine preventive medication. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids) as needed. Patients with medication overuse headache also were enrolled. The use of a concomitant medication that acts on the CGRP pathway was not permitted for either acute or preventive treatment of migraine. The study excluded patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks within six months prior to screening.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean MMD across the 12-week treatment period. Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline in mean monthly headache days, the change from baseline in mean monthly acute medication use days, the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction from baseline in mean MMD (3-month average), the change from baseline in mean monthly AIM-D PDA domain scores, the change from baseline in mean monthly AIM-D PI domain scores, across the 12-week treatment period, and the change from baseline at Week 12 for MSQ v2.1 RFR domain scores.

Hypersensitivity reactions can occur days after administration. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue QULIPTA and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications (4)].

5.000000000000000e+00 2 Hyper tension

Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. QULIPTA was discontinued in many of the reported cases.

Monitor patients treated with QULIPTA for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of QULIPTA is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled.

5.000000000000000e+00 3 Raynaud's Phenomenon

Development of Raynaud's phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA. In reported cases with small molecule CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 1.5 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms.

QULIPTA should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.

### Rates of response to atogepant for migraine prophylaxis among adults: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^03505a20]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Trial Design

This study is a secondary analysis of ADVANCE, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 clinical trial conducted at 128 US sites from December 14, 2018, to June 19, 2020. Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to 10, 30, or 60 mg of atogepant or placebo administered orally once daily for 12 weeks. A 4-week screening of baseline eDiary data was followed by 12 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of safety follow-up. The numbers of migraine-days during the baseline period (ie, day –28 to –1) were evaluated. Atogepant tablets and matching placebo were provided in identical blister cards to maintain blinding. Participants were instructed to take study treatment once daily at approximately the same time. The first dose of study treatment was taken at the clinic. This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles derived from the International Classification on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines. The protocol (Supplement 1) and all relevant documents were submitted to and approved by a Central Institutional Review Board (Advarra, Inc) and individual study site review boards before study initiation. Participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

### Rates of response to atogepant for migraine prophylaxis among adults: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^6bf40551]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, response to oral atogepant treatment was evident as early as the first 4 weeks and increased over time, demonstrating an early onset and sustained response. These data suggest that a 12-week trial may be of adequate duration to determine response to atogepant. Higher atogepant doses appeared to produce the greatest responder rates, which can guide clinicians in individualizing starting doses. Atogepant responder rates were consistent with other migraine prevention treatments. The ORs suggest that the likelihood of experiencing a 50% or greater reduction in mean MMDs is approximately 3 to 4 times greater with atogepant than placebo across the 12-week treatment period. Patient-reported outcomes showed a significant proportion of participants reporting feeling much better or very much better and satisfied or extremely satisfied with treatment. No new safety signals were identified for atogepant.

### Atogepant for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine (PROGRESS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^71371084]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) was published by Patricia Pozo-Rosich and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Migraine. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the trial question was: what is the role of atogepant in patients with chronic migraine? In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the population was: 512 patients (452 female, 60 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–80 years with ≥ 1 year history of chronic migraine. The key exclusion criteria were cluster headache; painful cranial neuropathy; history of inadequate response to > 4 preventive migraine treatments; use of opioids or barbiturates for at least 4 days per month in the previous 3 months. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the interventions were: n = 257 atogepant (at an oral dose of 30 mg BID) n = 255 placebo (matching placebo). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks (7.5 days vs. 5.1 days; MD 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.5). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in monthly headache days (7.4 days vs. 5.1 days; MD 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.4) Significant increase in reduction in monthly acute medication use days (6.7 days vs. 4.1 days; MD 2.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.6) Significant increase in ≥ 50% reduction in 3 month average of monthly migraine days (43% vs. 26%; OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.1). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent serious adverse events. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 18–80 years with ≥ 1 year history of chronic migraine, atogepant was superior to placebo with respect to a least-square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks.

### Effect of atogepant for preventive migraine treatment on patient-reported outcomes in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 ADVANCE trial [^ca349d5d]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial Design

Detailed methods of the ADVANCE trial have been published. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 trial was conducted from December 14, 2018, to June 19, 2020, at 136 sites in the United States. Participants were randomized to receive placebo and atogepant (10, 30, or 60 mg) once daily (QD) at a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified by previous exposure to a migraine prevention medication with proven efficacy. The randomization sequence was generated by an automated interactive web response system. Blinding was maintained by providing treatments in identical blister cards and masking treatment assignment from participants and site and sponsor personnel. The study included a 4-week baseline period, 12-week double-blind treatment period, and 4-week safety follow-up period. Participants were instructed to take study treatment once daily, orally, at approximately the same time each day.

Participants

Eligible participants were adults aged 18–80 years with 4–14 MMDs in the 3 months before screening and 4–14 migraine days recorded in an electronic diary (eDiary) during the 28-day baseline run-in period. Additional inclusion criteria required ≥ 1-year history of migraine with or without aura consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition (ICHD-3)and migraine onset before 50 years of age. Participants were excluded if they had a current diagnosis of chronic migraine (CM), new persistent daily headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (e.g. cluster headache), or painful cranial neuropathy as defined by ICHD-3; ≥ 15 monthly headache days (MHDs) on average across 3 months before visit 1 or during the 28-day baseline period; a history of inadequate response to > 4 medications (2 with different mechanisms of action) prescribed for preventive migraine treatment; use of opioids > 2 days per month, triptans or ergots ≥ 10 days per month, or simple analgesics (e.g. aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen) ≥ 15 days per month during the 3 months before screening or baseline period; or the use of barbiturates > 2 days per month in the 3 months before screening or any use within 30 days of screening.

### Topiramate (Qudexy) [^214795e9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials conducted in the US (Study 11) or the US and Canada (Study 12) established the effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for the preventive treatment of migraine), or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

Results

Participants and Baseline Demographics

In the ADVANCE, ELEVATE, and PROGRESS trials, 910, 315, and 778 participants were randomized to a treatment arm, respectively. Of the 2 arms included in this analysis, the safety populations included ADVANCE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 231; placebo, n = 222; ELEVATE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 156; placebo, n = 157; and PROGRESS, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 261; placebo, n = 255. The mITT populations included ADVANCE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 222; placebo, n = 214; ELEVATE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 151; placebo, n = 154; and PROGRESS, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 256; placebo, n = 246 (Figure 1). For each trial, demographics were similar across treatment arms. The majority of participants across the ADVANCE, ELEVATE, and PROGRESS trials were female (87.6% [397/453], 89.5% [280/313], 87.2% [450/516]) and White (85.2% [386/453], 95.8% [300/313], 59.7% [308/516]), with a mean age of 41.6, 42.2, and 42.1 years and a mean body mass index of 30.6, 25.9, and 25.5 kg/m², respectively (Table 1). Prior oral migraine preventive treatment use occurred in 70% of participants in ADVANCE. In PROGRESS, 66% of participants met criteria for acute medication overuse at baseline.

### New drugs in migraine treatment and prophylaxis: telcagepant and topiramate [^0bee6633]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Although the triptan drugs provide effective relief from migraine for many patients, a substantial number of affected individuals are unresponsive to these compounds, and such therapy can also lead to a range of adverse effects. Telcagepant represents a new class of antimigraine drug-the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. This compound exerts its effects by blocking receptors for the calcitonin-gene-related peptide at several sites in the trigeminal and central nervous systems, resulting in pain relief. Telcagepant does not cause vasoconstriction, a major limitation in the use of triptans. Comparisons with triptans in clinical trials for acute treatment of migraine attacks revealed clinical effects similar to those of triptans but better than those of placebo. Telcagepant might provide hope for those who have a poor response to, or are unable to use, older drugs. In patients who need prophylaxis because of frequent attacks of migraine, topiramate is a first-line drug for migraine prevention in many countries; it is generally safe and reasonably well tolerated. Data suggest that topiramate could aid reversion of chronic migraine to episodic migraine.

Efficacy outcomes by day in the first week

The proportions of participants who reported a migraine day on any given day during the baseline period was derived from the baseline MMDs divided by 28 and ranged from 26.6%–28.1% across treatment groups. On post-dose day 1, the proportion of participants who reported a migraine day was 14.1% for atogepant 10 mg, 10.8% for atogepant 30 mg, and 12.3% for atogepant 60 mg vs 25.2% in the placebo group (P ≤ 0.0071 for all atogepant groups) (Figure 3). On post-dose days 2–6, the proportion of participants reporting a migraine was consistently lower across the 3 atogepant treatment groups compared with placebo, with the majority of days reaching significance vs placebo (P < 0.05) in the atogepant 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups. The days when the difference between atogepant and placebo did not reach significance were day 3, day 4, and day 6 for atogepant 10 mg and day 4 for atogepant 60 mg. On post-dose day 1, the odds ratio vs placebo for reporting a migraine was 0.49 with atogepant 10 mg, 0.33 with atogepant 30 mg, and 0.39 with atogepant 60 mg.

Safety

Once-daily oral atogepant was safe and well tolerated throughout the trial. The percentage of participants reporting treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar among all groups, ranging from 52.2%– 53.7% across the atogepant treatment groups compared with 56.8% in the placebo group. AEs leading to discontinuation ranged from 1.8%–4.1% in the atogepant groups compared with 2.7% in the placebo group. No dose-response relationship was observed for AEs leading to discontinuation, and no deaths occurred. Results and a description of the AEs from the safety population have been previously reported.

### Efficacy of atogepant in chronic migraine with and without acute medication overuse in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 PROGRESS trial [^51319d83]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This subgroup analysis of the PROGRESS trial found that the preventive treatment of CM with atogepant among participants with and without acute medication overuse resulted in greater reductions in mean MMDs, MHDs, and monthly acute medication use days and a greater proportion of participants achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs compared with placebo across the 12-week treatment period. Both atogepant treatment groups also demonstrated a reduction in headache-related disability and physical impairment and an improvement in the performance of daily activities and HRQoL compared with placebo, regardless of acute medication overuse status. Efficacy for the subgroup analyses reported in this study is consistent with the primary results in the PROGRESS trial. Tolerability and safety were consistent with the full population reported in the primary PROGRESS results. Constipation was the most commonly reported TEAE. Rates of constipation were consistent with previous 12-week and long-term atogepant trials, and there were no serious cases of constipation. Treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs was low across the treatment arms and consistent with previous atogepant trials.

Our subgroup analysis study demonstrates the efficacy of the oral CGRP receptor antagonist, atogepant, in participants with CM and acute medication overuse. This population with high unmet needs has been assessed in multiple pooled, secondary, or post hoc analyses evaluating the efficacy of other migraine preventive treatments in patients with acute medication overuse or medication-overuse headache. Preventive treatments such as topiramate and onabotulinumtoxinA demonstrated efficacy in CM and acute medication overuse populations. In addition, injectable monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments targeting CGRP or the CGRP receptor were evaluated for efficacy in this population. Erenumab (mAb to CGRP canonical-receptor blocker), fremanezumab (mAb to CGRP), and galcanezumab (mAb to CGRP) demonstrated a reduction in mean MMDs and a higher proportion of participants achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs at month 3 in participants with acute medication overuse. Eptinezumab (mAb to CGRP) demonstrated a reduction in acute headache medication use in participants with CM and medication-overuse headache. These studies are consistent with the results in this subgroup analysis of the PROGRESS trial demonstrating a reduction in MMDs, MHDs, and acute medication use days in atogepant-treated participants with CM and acute medication overuse.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^f3a765b3]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine affects an estimated 1.1 billion individuals worldwide and is the second leading cause of disability in the general population, and the leading cause of disability in young, adult women. In addition, migraine causes more years lived with disability than all other neurologic diseases combined. Migraine substantially affects daily life during and between attacks, with patients reporting negative effects on relationships, parenting, career, and finances, all leading to an increase in daily stress and a lower quality of life. Owing to the high disability in the migraine population, treatments for migraine should have both a high efficacy and a rapid onset of action.

Current conventional oral preventive treatments require dose titration and may take weeks to months to demonstrate maximum efficacy. In addition, individuals may experience suboptimal efficacy, safety, or tolerability issues, causing premature treatment discontinuation and cycling through multiple classes of conventional oral preventive treatments. The American Headache Society treatment guidelines state that a preventive migraine treatment should reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and also improve function and quality of life and reduce disability. Rapid onset of action may lead to earlier improvements in daily functioning, work productivity, and disability, reducing the overall effect of migraine on patient lives.

Introduction

Migraine attacks can be severe, incapacitating, and have a substantial impact on an individual's life. The goals of preventive treatment for migraine include reducing the frequency, intensity, and duration of attacks, as well as improving functional ability and quality of life. However, many people with migraine discontinue or repeatedly cycle through preventive treatment options due to suboptimal efficacy or concerns regarding the safety and tolerability of currently available oral preventive medications.

In studies that evaluated individual preferences for the treatment of migraine, participants ranked efficacy, speed of onset, and an oral formulation among the most important attributes when choosing a preventive medication. However, some current oral preventive drugs require administration for several weeks or months before therapeutic benefit occurs, with many individuals still failing to achieve sufficient efficacy. When efficacy is not reached after a certain treatment duration, or a medication has been titrated to the ceiling dose but is no longer effective or tolerated, it is recommended to re-evaluate and possibly discontinue treatment. Considering the significant impact of migraine on an individual's life both during and between attacks, there is a need for treatments that reliably address preventive treatment goals and provide a rapid onset of action.

Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator and inflammatory mediator known to play an important role in migraine pathophysiology. CGRP levels increase during attacks, and CGRP concentrations can be elevated between attacks in people with high frequency or chronic migraine. Furthermore, an infusion of CGRP has been shown to trigger migraine-like attacks in people who have migraine with or without aura. Blocking CGRP, either the neuropeptide or its receptor, is effective for the preventive treatment of migraine. Atogepant is an oral, small-molecule, CGRP receptor antagonist (gepant) in development for the preventive treatment of migraine. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily atogepant was demonstrated in a phase 2/3 dose-ranging trial, the phase 3 ADVANCE trial, and a 52-week, open-label, long-term safety (LTS) trial.

### Safety and efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults for whom conventional oral preventive treatments have failed (ELEVATE): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b trial [^7dc4f3c3]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The study ELEVATE was published by Cristina Tassorelli and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Migraine. In the ELEVATE study, the trial question was: what is the effect of atogepant in patients with episodic migraine who had previously failed conventional oral preventive treatments? In the ELEVATE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ELEVATE study, the population was: 313 patients (280 female, 33 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–80 years with episodic migraine who had previously failed 2–4 classes of conventional oral treatments for migraine prevention. The key exclusion criteria were clinically significant hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or neurologic disease; ≥ 15 headache days/month 3 months prior to the first visit; history of migraine accompanied by diplopia or decreased level of consciousness or retinal migraine. In the ELEVATE study, the interventions were: n = 156 atogepant (at an oral dose of 60 mg/day) n = 157 placebo (matching placebo). In the ELEVATE study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks (4.2 days vs. 1.9 days; MD 2.4, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.2). In the ELEVATE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction of ≥ 50% in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks (51% vs. 18%; OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.9 to 8.1). In the ELEVATE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent adverse events. In the ELEVATE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 18–80 years with episodic migraine who had previously failed 2–4 classes of conventional oral treatments for migraine prevention, atogepant was superior to placebo with respect to least square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks.

### Topiramate (Qudexy) [^5ede19de]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of topiramate XR PO (also known as Qudexy XR):
- **Acute myopia, secondary angle-closure glaucoma**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as topiramate can cause acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma, potentially leading to vision loss. Monitor for changes in vision or eye pain during the first month of therapy. Discontinue topiramate promptly and manage intraocular pressure as needed.
- **Hyperammonemia, encephalopathy**: use caution in patients with inborn errors of metabolism, reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity, or those taking concomitant valproic acid, as they may be at increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Monitor ammonia levels regularly, especially in high-risk patients or those experiencing symptoms such as lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status.
- **Hypothermia**: use caution in patients taking valproic acid concomitantly, as this combination increases the risk of hypothermia (body core temperature < 35°C or 95°F), which may occur with or without hyperammonemia.
- **Increased body temperature, hypohidrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as topiramate may cause oligohidrosis and hyperthermia, especially in pediatric patients, during high temperatures, or when combined with drugs that predispose to heat-related disorders, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and anticholinergic drugs.
- **Metabolic acidosis**: use extreme caution in patients with conditions or therapies that predispose them to acidosis, such as kidney disease, severe pulmonary disease, status epilepticus, diarrhea, a ketogenic diet, or certain drugs, as these may have additive effects with topiramate's bicarbonate-lowering action. Monitor serum bicarbonate levels regularly, and consider dose reduction or discontinuation if acidosis persists.
- **Nephrolithiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as topiramate increases the risk of kidney stone formation, particularly in males, pediatric patients, and those on a ketogenic diet or taking concomitant drugs that cause metabolic acidosis.
- **Seizures**: do not discontinue abruptly topiramate, as this may increase the risk or frequency of seizures, even in patients without a history of seizures or epilepsy.
- **Somnolence, cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disorder, paresthesia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as topiramate may cause cognitive dysfunction (e.g., confusion, memory issues), psychiatric disturbances (e.g., depression, mood changes), and somnolence or fatigue, particularly with higher doses or rapid titration. Utilize slower titration schedules and the lowest effective dose, and monitor for cognitive, psychiatric, or fatigue-related symptoms during treatment.
- **Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as topiramate has been associated with an increased risk of serious skin reactions.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as antiepileptic drugs, including topiramate, are associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviour. Monitor patients closely for signs of depression, suicidal thoughts, or mood changes, especially during the first week of treatment and throughout therapy.
- **Visual field defect**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as topiramate is associated with visual field defects, independent of elevated intraocular pressure. Discontinue topiramate if visual problems occur, as most cases resolve after the drug is stopped.

### Time course of efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from the randomized, double-blind ADVANCE trial [^9db6a949]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of a preventive medication is highly individualized and some people may prefer an orally administered medication. In addition to providing a less-invasive route of administration, gepants have a shorter half-life compared with mAbs (hours versus weeks). This may be preferable in cases where women are trying to become pregnant and would want to immediately halt preventive treatment, or when side effects are intolerable and there is a need to immediately reduce plasma concentrations of the medication.

Additional studies are also needed to characterize the dose-response relationship of atogepant and determine whether there are greater benefits with the higher atogepant doses. The ADVANCE trial was limited to participants with fewer than 15 migraine days per month and, therefore, the results may vary in individuals with chronic migraine. As the treatment period in this trial was limited to 12 weeks, the long-term efficacy of atogepant could not be evaluated. Also, due to the treatment duration, any potential changes in magnitude of treatment effect beyond 3 months with atogepant could not be fully evaluated. One strength of the analysis was that follow-up time began as early as day 1 after the initial dose, which allowed for the characterization of the early benefits of atogepant treatment. Additionally, the first dose of study medication was administered in clinic. This ensured that day 1 efficacy reflects accurate dosing from the previous day.

Results

Participants

A total of 910 participants were randomized to treatment with placebo (n = 223), atogepant 10 mg (n = 222), atogepant 30 mg (n = 230), or atogepant 60 mg (n = 235). Overall, 88.5% of participants (805/910) completed the double-blind treatment period. The mITT population included 873 participants: placebo, n = 214; atogepant 10 mg, n = 214; atogepant 30 mg, n = 223; atogepant 60 mg, n = 222. The most common reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal by participant (3.8% [35/910]), AEs (2.7% [25/910]), and protocol deviations (2.6% [24/910]). Baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups (Table 1).

Table 1.
Baseline demographic characteristics (safety population).

Efficacy outcomes by month (4-week treatment periods)

The mean MMDs at baseline in the mITT population ranged from 7.5–7.9 across treatment groups (Table 2). During the first treatment period (weeks 1–4), LS mean change from baseline in MMDs was −3.1 for atogepant 10 mg, −3.4 for atogepant 30 mg, −3.9 for atogepant 60 mg, and −1.6 for placebo (P < 0.0001 for all atogepant groups) (Figure 1). This greater decrease in MMDs with atogepant compared with placebo was maintained during the second 4-week treatment period (weeks 5–8: −3.7 for atogepant 10 mg, −3.9 for atogepant 30 mg, −4.2 for atogepant 60 mg, and −2.9 for placebo; P ≤ 0.012 for all atogepant groups) and the third 4-week treatment period (weeks 9–12: −4.2 for atogepant 10 mg, −4.3 for atogepant 30 mg, −4.4 for atogepant 60 mg, and −3.0 for placebo; P < 0.0002 for all atogepant groups).

### Adverse and serious adverse events incidence of pharmacological interventions for managing chronic and episodic migraine in adults: a systematic review [^8cb43d92]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The main strength of our review is the analysis of adequately powered studies of the wide range of medications, as most systematic reviews in the literature focus on only one or a few drugs. We included the CGRP MAbs namely fremanezumab, eptinezumab, galcanezumab and erenumab, along with BTA, topiramate, amitriptyline, atogepant and rimegepant. This diversity provides a comprehensive overview of medication safety, enabling decision-makers to compare treatments and obtain a more accurate reflection of clinical practice. We used a comprehensive search strategy across a wide range of electronic databases, without imposing any restrictions on date or language.

It is important to mention additional limitations of some included trials in this review. Specifically, atogepant and rimegepant have product licenses but are not yet approved by NICE. However, Scottish Medicine Consortium in 2023 approved atogepant for chronic and episodic migraine and rimegepant for episodic migraine. The BTA trial for episodic migraine patients used non-standard doses, while the standard dose for chronic migraine patients is 155U. Additionally, the 150 mg dose of galcanezumab, which is not commonly used, had a noticeably higher adverse events profile.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^f59c2a18]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians clinical guideline — prioritization and sequencing of preventive medications for episodic migraine: Based on cost differences and patient preferences for oral agents, the CGC suggests that clinicians and patients use a β-blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), valproate, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline before using a CGRP-mAb or a CGRP antagonist-gepant; if a patient does not tolerate or inadequately responds to those options, the CGC suggests that clinicians use topiramate and then a further trial with a CGRP antagonist-gepant (atogepant or rimegepant) or a CGRP-mAb (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab). CGRP-mAbs and CGRP antagonist-gepants were substantially more costly (ranged from $7071 to $22 790) than initial treatments (metoprolol [$123], propranolol [$393], valproate [$274], venlafaxine [$378], amitriptyline [$67]), and patients' values and preferences favored oral over injectable medications.

### Comparative efficacy, quality of life, safety, and tolerability of atogepant and rimegepant in migraine prevention: a matching-adjusted indirect comparison analysis [^1494192c]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Comparative evaluations of preventive migraine treatments can help inform clinical decision making for managing migraine in clinical practice.

Methods

An anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison analysis was conducted using pooled participant-level data from two phase 3 atogepant trials (ADVANCE and PROGRESS) and one phase 2/3 rimegepant trial (BHV3000-305) to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety/tolerability of atogepant and rimegepant as preventive migraine treatments. Participants receiving atogepant 60mg once daily, rimegepant orally disintegrating tablet 75mg once every other day, and placebo were included. Only participants meeting the BHV3000-305 inclusion/exclusion criteria were analyzed: ≥ 6 monthly migraine days and ≤ 18 monthly headache days at baseline. The primary efficacy assessment of interest was change in monthly migraine days across weeks 1–12.

Results

There were 252 participants in the atogepant group and 348 in the rimegepant group. Across weeks 1–12, atogepant 60mg demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared with rimegepant 75mg (mean difference [95% CI]: -1.65 [-2.49, -0.81]; p < 0.001). Both atogepant and rimegepant demonstrated similar safety/tolerability profiles.

Conclusion

In this matching-adjusted indirect comparison analysis, oral atogepant 60mg once daily demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in monthly migraine days compared with rimegepant 75mg orally disintegrating tablet once every other day.

### Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of orally administered atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine in adults: a double-blind, randomised phase 2b / 3 trial [^28f3c25e]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Atogepant is an orally administered, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist under investigation for treatment of migraine. We aimed to examine a range of oral doses for safety, tolerability, and efficacy for the preventive treatment of migraine.

Methods

In this double-blind, phase 2b/3 trial, adults (aged 18–75 years), with a history (≥ 1 year) of migraine and 4–14 migraine days per month, were randomly assigned 2:1:2:2:1:1 (by means of a sequence generated by the statistical programming department of the sponsor, and operationalised through an automated interactive web-based response system) to receive placebo or atogepant 10 mg once daily, 30 mg once daily, 60 mg once daily, 30 mg twice daily, or 60 mg twice daily, in matching capsules. Participants, site personnel, and all study sponsor personnel were masked to treatment allocations. The study was done in 78 academic and private practice settings in the USA. The primary outcome was change from baseline in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks of treatment using a modified intention-to-treat approach. The overall type I error rate for multiple comparisons across active treatment doses was controlled at the 0.05 level by means of a graphic approach. The main outcomes to assess safety and tolerability were adverse event recordings. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02848326 and is completed.

Findings

Between Sept 6, 2016, and April 23, 2018, of 1772 individuals screened, 834 were randomly assigned and 825 received one dose or more of study medication: 186 received placebo, 93 atogepant 10 mg once daily, 183 atogepant 30 mg once daily, 186 atogepant 60 mg once daily, 86 atogepant 30 mg twice daily, and 91 atogepant 60 mg twice daily. Overall, 714 (87%) of 825 participants were female, 628 (76%) were white, median migraine duration was 17.5 years (IQR 10.0–28.0), and 232 (28%) had previously used preventive treatment. The primary efficacy analysis included 795 patients: 178 received placebo, 92 atogepant 10 mg once daily, 182 atogepant 30 mg once daily, 177 atogepant 60 mg once daily, 79 atogepant 30 mg twice daily, and 87 atogepant 60 mg twice daily. Across the 12-week treatment period, all five atogepant groups showed significant least-squares mean (SE) change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days versus placebo: atogepant 10 mg once daily -4.0 (0.3; p = 0.024), 30 mg once daily -3.8 (0.2; p = 0.039), 60 mg once daily -3.6 (0.2; p = 0.039), 30 mg twice daily -4.2 (0.4; p = 0.0034), and 60 mg twice daily -4.1 (0.3; p = 0.0031); placebo -2.9 (0.2). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across all groups were nausea (range 5% [5/93] for 10 mg once daily to 12% [22/186] for 60 mg once daily vs 5% [9/186] for placebo) and fatigue (1% [1/93] for 10 mg once daily to 10% [9/91] for 60 mg twice daily vs 3% [6/186] for placebo). Treatment-related TEAE frequency ranged from 18% (17/93) for 10 mg once daily to 26% (24/91) for 60 mg twice daily, versus 16% (30/186) for placebo. Seven participants reported a total of eight serious TEAEs (two participants each in the placebo, 30 mg once-daily, and 60 mg once-daily groups, and one participant in the 10 mg once-daily group). TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 33 (5%) of 639 atogepant participants and 5 (3%) of 186 of those randomised to placebo. All serious TEAEs were unrelated to treatment.

Interpretation

All doses of oral atogepant were associated with a significant decrease in monthly migraine days over 12 weeks compared with placebo. Atogepant was safe and well tolerated over 12 weeks, supporting its phase 3 development for the preventive treatment of migraine.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cb80d0a5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this clinical guideline for clinicians caring for adults with episodic migraine headache (defined as 1 to 14 headache days per month) in outpatient settings.

Methods

ACP based these recommendations on systematic reviews of the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments to prevent episodic migraine, patients' values and preferences, and economic evidence. ACP evaluated the comparative effectiveness of the following interventions: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril), angiotensin II-receptor blockers (candesartan and telmisartan), antiseizure medications (valproate and topiramate), β-blockers (metoprolol and propranolol), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist-gepants (atogepant or rimegepant), CGRP monoclonal antibodies (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine and venlafaxine), and a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline). ACP used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to analyze the effects of pharmacologic treatment on the following outcomes: migraine frequency and duration, number of days medication was taken for acute treatment of migraine, frequency of migraine-related emergency department visits, migraine-related disability, quality of life and physical functioning, and discontinuations due to adverse events. In addition, adverse events were captured through U.S. Food and Drug Administration medication labels and eligible studies.

Recommendations

In this guideline, ACP makes recommendations for clinicians to initiate monotherapy for episodic migraine prevention in nonpregnant adults in the outpatient setting as well as alternative approaches if initial treatments are not tolerated or result in an inadequate response. All 3 ACP recommendations have conditional strength and low-certainty evidence. Clinical considerations provide additional context for physicians and other clinicians.

### Adverse and serious adverse events incidence of pharmacological interventions for managing chronic and episodic migraine in adults: a systematic review [^20457b71]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Study characteristics

The patients in each of the included studies satisfied the diagnostic criteria of chronic or episodic migraine in accordance with the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Nineteen RCTs included only participants with episodic migraine, nine RCTs enrolled participants exclusively with chronic migraine, and five RCTs had a mixed population of both chronic or episodic migraine participants. All of the RCTs were conducted across multiple centres. The number of participants randomised across the 33 trials evaluating the safety of pharmacological treatment ranged from 217to 1379with a total of 22 615 participants. The mean age of trial participants ranged from 36to 46years; and the percentage of female participants ranged from 74%to 91%.

Most of the trials utilised double-blinded designs except two trials that were classed as open-label. Treatment duration varied across the trials; one trial had a 4-week treatment duration, while 19 trials reported 12 weeks. Additionally, one trial had a treatment duration of 22 weeks,11 trials reported a 24-week treatment duration, and for one trial the treatment duration was 52 weeks.

The included studies evaluated 20 different dosing regimens of nine drugs, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg, erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg and 675 mg and galcanezumab 120 mg, 150 mg and 240 mg), onabotulinumtoxin A (BTA) 7U, 25U, 50U, 155U and 195U, topiramate 100 mg, atogepant 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg, amitriptyline 25 mg to 100 mg and rimegepant 75 mg. Further details of included characteristics of these studies are presented in online supplemental table 1 and online supplemental appendix 3.

### Magnesium supplementation for migraine prophylaxis [^39df1594]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

While the underlying mechanisms of migraine remain largely unknown, prophylactic treatment is typically considered for individuals with severe migraine or significantly impaired quality of life. This is defined as the use of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions with the primary goal of reducing the frequency, severity, or duration of migraine attacks, and minimizing migraine‐related disability, rather than treating individual acute episodes. Preventive therapy is indicated for patients with frequent, severe, or disabling migraines, or those who overuse acute medications or have contraindications to acute therapies. It may involve antihypertensive agents (beta‐blockers such as propranolol, metoprolol and angiotensin receptor blockers including candesartan, telmisartan); calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) pathway‐targeted therapies such as gepants (atogepant, rimegepant) or anti‐CGRP antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, and eptinezumab); antiepileptic drugs (valproic acid/sodium valproate, topiramate, gabapentin, pregabaline, etc); or antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline. These medications are associated with a range of adverse effects, including paresthesia, weight loss, fatigue, somnolence, and cognitive and psychiatric effects such as depression and difficulty with memory and concentration.

### Topiramate (Qudexy) [^9b1bdc78]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

Safety and effectiveness of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine was studied in 5 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in a total of 219 pediatric patients, at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day, or 2 to 3 mg/kg/day. These comprised a fixed dose study in 103 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.5)], a flexible dose (2 to 3 mg/kg/day), placebo-controlled study in 157 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (including 67 pediatric patients 12 to 16 years of age), and a total of 49 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in 3 studies for the preventive treatment of migraine primarily in adults. Open-label extension phases of 3 studies enabled evaluation of long-term safety for up to 6 months after the end of the double-blind phase.

Efficacy of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is demonstrated for a 100 mg daily dose in Study 13 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Efficacy of topiramate (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) for the preventive treatment of migraine was not demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial of 157 pediatric patients (6 to 16 years of age) that included treatment of 67 pediatric patients (12 to 16 years of age) for 20 weeks.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^26f3ef67]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

Headache medicine and therapeutics evidence have been rapidly expanding and evolving since the 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the management of headache. Therefore, the CPG was revised in 2023, earlier than the standard 5-year cycle. This article reviews the 2023 CPG recommendations relevant to primary care clinicians for treatment and prevention of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH).

Methods

Subject experts from the VA and the DoD developed 12 key questions, which guided a systematic search using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After reviewing evidence from 5 databases published between 6 March 2019 and 16 August 2022, the work group considered the strength and quality of the evidence, patient preferences, and benefits versus harms on critical outcomes before making consensus recommendations.

Recommendations

The revised CPG includes 52 recommendations on evaluation, pharmacotherapy, invasive interventions, and nonpharmacologic interventions for selected primary and secondary headache disorders. In addition to triptans and aspirin-acetaminophen-caffeine, newer calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors (gepants) are options for treatment of acute migraine. Medications to prevent episodic migraine (EM) include angiotensin-receptor blockers, lisinopril, magnesium, topiramate, valproate, memantine, the newer CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and atogepant. AbobotulinumtoxinA can be used for prevention of chronic migraine but not EM. Gabapentin is not recommended for prevention of EM. Ibuprofen (400 mg) and acetaminophen (1000 mg) can be used for treatment of TTH, and amitriptyline for prevention of chronic TTH. Physical therapy or aerobic exercise can be used in management of TTH and migraines.

Adverse effects and costs — profiles varied by class and inform counseling and affordability considerations: adverse event profiles differed across drug classes, but most medications were associated with generally mild AEs, such as paresthesia, pain, reduced physical activity, rash, or dizziness; some treatments, particularly topiramate, were associated with a higher number of AEs, which influenced prioritization of less costly treatments with similar efficacy and more favorable AE profiles, and clinicians should inform patients about AE profiles and should consider black box warnings reported in FDA labels. There is no comparative evidence from CEAs on the value of available pharmacologic classes or treatments, and when compared with each other, the costs of the CGRP antagonists-gepants atogepant and rimegepant and the CGRP-mAbs eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab are much higher than the costs of the β-blockers metoprolol and propranolol, amitriptyline, topiramate, and valproate; annualized wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) differed substantially between pharmacologic classes. There were no comparative data for any evaluated treatment on frequency of emergency department visits and measures of physical functioning, and the CGC's recommendations do not include the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, the ARBs candesartan and telmisartan, or the SSRI fluoxetine because of the lack of comparative studies or insufficient-certainty evidence for prioritized outcomes.

Figure 2
Participants Meeting Criteria for Acute Medication Overuse at Baseline, During the Three 4-Week Intervals, and at Weeks 1–12 (A) and Participants Meeting Criteria for Acute Medication Overuse by Medication Type (B) (Modified Intent-to-Treat Population)

In (A), at baseline and during the three 4-week intervals, acute medication overuse was defined as use of triptans for ≥ 10 days; use of ergots for ≥ 10 days; use of simple analgesics (i.e. aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], or acetaminophen) for ≥ 15 days; or use of any combination of triptans, ergots, or simple analgesics for ≥ 10 days. At weeks 1–12, acute medication overuse was defined as use of triptans for ≥ 30 days; use of ergots for ≥ 30 days; use of simple analgesics for ≥ 45 days; or use of any combination of triptans, ergots, or simple analgesics for ≥ 30 days. In (B), at baseline, triptan overuse was defined as use of triptans for ≥ 10 days, regardless of use of other medications. Simple analgesic overuse was defined as use of simple analgesics for ≥ 15 days, regardless of use of other medications. Combination overuse was defined as use of any combination of triptans, ergots, or simple analgesics for ≥ 10 days. At weeks 1–12, triptan overuse was defined as use of triptans for ≥ 30 days, regardless of use of other medications. Simple analgesic overuse was defined as use of simple analgesics for ≥ 45 days, regardless of use of other medications. Combination acute medication overuse was defined as use of any combination of triptans, ergots, or simple analgesics for ≥ 30 days. The week 1–12 analyses were restricted to participants who completed the double-blind treatment period. Combination headache medications such as Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine) were categorized as simple analgesics for these analyses. Ergot overuse (ergot use for ≥ 10 days, regardless of use of other medications) was also evaluated but was not included in the figure because of ≤ 3 participants per treatment arm meeting criteria for ergot overuse. ✱ p -value for the interaction between the treatment visit and atogepant 30 mg BID compared with placebo. † p -value for the interaction between the treatment visit and atogepant 60 mg QD compared with placebo.

### Topiramate tablet (Topiramate) [^5ddb3931]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

How should I take topiramate tablets?

Take topiramate tablets exactly as prescribed.

Your healthcare provider may change your dose. Do not change your dose without talking to your healthcare provider.

Topiramate tablets should be swallowed whole. Do not chew the tablets. They may leave a bitter taste.

Topiramate tablets can be taken before, during, or after a meal. Drink plenty of fluids during the day. This may help prevent kidney stones while taking topiramate tablets.

If you take too much topiramate tablets, call your healthcare provider or poison control center right away or go to the nearest emergency room.

If you miss a single dose of topiramate tablets, take it as soon as you can. However, if you are within 6 hours of taking your next scheduled dose, wait until then to take your usual dose of topiramate tablets, and skip the missed dose. Do not double your dose. If you have missed more than one dose, you should call your healthcare provider for advice.

Do not stop taking topiramate tablets without talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping topiramate tablets suddenly may cause serious problems. If you have epilepsy and you stop taking topiramate tablets suddenly, you may have seizures that do not stop. Your healthcare provider will tell you how to stop taking topiramate tablets slowly.

### Safety and efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults for whom conventional oral preventive treatments have failed (ELEVATE): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b trial [^f05ae6d7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Atogepant, an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, has been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine, but its efficacy and safety in people who have been failed by conventional oral preventive migraine treatments has not yet been evaluated in a dedicated clinical trial. The ELEVATE trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in participants for whom two to four classes of conventional oral preventive treatments have failed.

Methods

ELEVATE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3b trial done at 73 sites in Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Adults (18–80 years) with episodic migraine who had previously been failed by two to four classes of conventional oral treatments for migraine prevention were randomly assigned (1:1) using interactive web response technology to oral atogepant 60 mg once a day or placebo, stratified by baseline monthly migraine days, number of treatment classes participants have been failed by, and region. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period in the off-treatment hypothetical estimand (OTHE) population, which included participants in the safety population (all participants who received ≥ 1 dose of study intervention) who had evaluable data available for the baseline period and for one or more of the 4-week post-baseline periods (whether on treatment or off treatment). The primary endpoint was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures and a fixed-sequence procedure was used to control for multiple comparisons. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04740827) and EudraCT (2019-003448-58), and is completed.

Findings

Between March 5, 2021, and Aug 4, 2022, 540 participants were screened, 315 were randomly assigned, and 313 participants (280 [89%] female, 33 [11%] male, and 300 [96%] White) received at least one dose of study intervention. In the OTHE population, which comprised 309 participants (155 assigned to placebo and 154 to atogepant), least squares mean changes from baseline in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks were -1.9 (SE 0.4) with placebo and -4.2 (0.4) with atogepant (least squares mean difference -2.4, 95% CI -3.2 to -1.5; adjusted p < 0.0001). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event with atogepant was constipation in 16 (10%) of 156 participants (vs four [3%] of 157 for placebo). Serious adverse events occurred in four [3%] of 156 participants in the atogepant group vs none in the placebo group, and treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation occurred in three [2%] in the atogepant group vs two [1%] in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Atogepant 60 mg once a day was safe, well tolerated, and showed significant and clinically relevant reductions in mean monthly migraine days compared with placebo across 12 weeks in patients with episodic migraine who had previously been failed by two to four classes of conventional oral preventive treatments. Atogepant might be an effective preventive treatment option for patients in this difficult-to-treat population.

Caveats

A limitation of this study is that it was carried out in males only. We have found that it is more difficult to maintain stable physiological parameters and obtain well isolated neuronal recordings in females — factors critical for establishing reliability in the present experimental paradigm. In addition, our previous study on atogepant effects on the meningeal nociceptors was also carried out in males (which makes comparisons between the two studies more relevant). Our previous studies with both sexes have found no basic differences in CSD responses and drug effects, but nonetheless it will be useful in future studies to confirm the present results in females.

### Adverse and serious adverse events incidence of pharmacological interventions for managing chronic and episodic migraine in adults: a systematic review [^a83431ec]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Overview and key findings

We systematically reviewed and narratively synthesised the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events from 33 clinical trials involving 22 615 participants with chronic or episodic migraine. Our findings suggest that all the pharmacological interventions reviewed were well tolerated, although the incidence of adverse events varied among the drugs. For instance, amitriptyline and topiramate had a higher incidence of adverse events in nervous system disorders, while rimegepant did not cause such disorders in any of the trials. Topiramate was associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders. All drugs caused some infections and infestations, with erenumab and eptinezumab having the highest rates and BTA having the lowest rates. BTA had a higher incidence of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders compared with other medications. Amitriptyline and topiramate were associated with more gastrointestinal disorders in participants, while fremanezumab and Galcanezumab were linked to more general disorders and administration site conditions than other drugs.

It should be noted that the number of included trials for each drug are different. Safety profiles for erenumab, topiramate and galcanezumab were investigated more extensively than other medications. Additionally, almost half of the included trials were potentially biased (medium or high risk), which should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Many of these trials raised concerns due to their outcome assessors being aware of the interventions received by study participants. It remained unclear whether the assessment of outcomes had been influenced by knowledge of whether interventions were received or not.

RCTs are not typically powered to show adverse events. Even in this systematic review, there is likely to be insufficient statistical power to identify differences in the incidence of uncommon adverse events. These are best identified in observational studies.

Our review found that placebo-related adverse events were more frequent than those observed in patients who were receiving various doses of erenumab, rimegepant, topiramate and eptinezumab. Reported AE percentages for placebo were similar to those for atogepant, while they were lower for the other medications.

Atogepant infusion

One hour prior to induction of CSD, atogepant or vehicle (50% dextrose water, 40% PEG 400 and 10% tocopherol) were administered intravenously at the same volume and rate. The final dose of atogepant was 5 mg/kg (5 mg/ml, 1 ml/kg, total infusion volume 0.24–0.3 ml, infusion rate 6 ml/min, ∼30 s total). We used our previous published datato determine how much time should elapse before testing the effects of atogepant on CSD-induced activation.

CSD induction and electrocorticogram recording

One hour after atogepant infusion, CSD was induced, as previously described. For verification of CSD, electrocorticogram activity was recorded with a glass micropipette (0.9% saline, ∼1 MΩ, 7 μm tip) placed just below the surface of the parietal cortex (∼100 μm). We opted to use a single wave of CSD because patients rarely describe/experience more than one wave of aura in a single migraine attack; thus, this paradigm adheres better to the clinical reality.

Results

Baseline activity

The median [interquartile range (IQR)] firing rates at baseline, prior to CSD induction, were 9.95 spikes/s (4.47–15.0) for HT neurons in the control group, 6.24 spikes/s (1.8–15.05) for HT neurons in the treatment group, 3.25 spikes/s (0–7.22) for WDR neurons in the control group and 5.75 spikes/s (0.45–10.23) for WDR neurons in the treatment group. As noted below, there was no significant difference in baseline firing between neurons from animals treated with atogepant and neurons from animals treated with vehicle [P = 0.62 (Z = 0.56, n 1 = 10, n 2 = 10), P = 0.84 (Z = 0.25, n 1 = 10, n 2 = 10), HT and WDR, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank test].

When analysing both types of neurons (HT and WDR) combined, the baseline median (IQR) rates prior to CSD induction was 6.05 spikes/s (1.27–11.7) for all neurons in the control group and 5.75 spikes/s (0.96–11.36) for all neurons in the treatment group. There was no significant difference in baseline firing between neurons from the control group and neurons from the treatment group [P = 0.98 (Z = 0.03, n 1 = 20, n 2 = 20)], Wilcoxon signed rank test].

### Rates of response to atogepant for migraine prophylaxis among adults: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^c0626ed4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Some patients with migraine, particularly those in primary care, require effective, well-tolerated, migraine-specific oral preventive treatments.

Objective

To examine the efficacy of atogepant, an oral, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, using 4 levels of mean monthly migraine-day (MMD) responder rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis of a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine from December 14, 2018, to June 19, 2020, in adults with 4 to 14 migraine-days per month at 128 sites in the US.

Interventions

Patients were administered 10 mg of atogepant (n = 222), 30 mg of atogepant (n = 230), 60 mg of atogepant (n = 235), or placebo (n = 223) once daily in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

These analyses evaluated treatment responder rates, defined as participants achieving 50% or greater (α-controlled, secondary end point) and 25% or greater, 75% or greater, and 100% (prespecified additional end points) reductions in mean MMDs during the 12-week blinded treatment period.

Results

Of 902 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.6 [12.3] years; 801 [88.8%] female; 752 [83.4%] White; 825 [91.5%] non-Hispanic), 873 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population (placebo, 214; 10 mg of atogepant, 214; 30 mg of atogepant, 223; and 60 mg of atogepant, 222). For the secondary end point, a 50% or greater reduction in the 12-week mean of MMDs was achieved by 119 of 214 participants (55.6%) treated with 10 mg of atogepant (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.1–4.6), 131 of 223 participants (58.7%) treated with 30 mg atogepant (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.4–5.3), 135 of 222 participants (60.8%) treated with 60 mg of atogepant (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.6–5.7), and 62 of 214 participants (29.0%) given placebo (P < .001). The numbers of participants who reported a 25% or greater reduction in the 12-week mean of MMDs were 157 of 214 (73.4%) for 10 mg of atogepant, 172 of 223 (77.1%) for 30 mg of atogepant, and 180 of 222 (81.1%) for 60 mg of atogepant vs 126 of 214 (58.9%) for placebo (P < .002). The numbers of participants who reported a 75% or greater reduction in mean MMDs were 65 of 214 (30.4%) for 10 mg of atogepant, 66 of 223 (29.6%) for 30 mg of atogepant, and 84 of 222 (37.8%) for 60 mg of atogepant compared with 23 of 214 (10.7%) for placebo (P < .001). The numbers of participants reporting 100% reduction in mean MMDs were 17 of 214 (7.9%) for 10 mg of atogepant (P = 0.004), 11 of 223 (4.9%) for 30 mg of atogepant (P = 0.02), and 17 of 222 (7.7%) for 60 mg of atogepant (P = 0.003) compared with 2 of 214 (0.9%) for placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

At all doses, atogepant was effective during the 12-week double-blind treatment period beginning in the first 4 weeks, as evidenced by significant reductions in mean MMDs at every responder threshold level. Higher atogepant doses appeared to produce the greatest responder rates, which can guide clinicians in individualizing starting doses.

### Efficacy of atogepant in chronic migraine with and without acute medication overuse in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 PROGRESS trial [^d040de1d]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The binary efficacy end point of 50% responder rates was analyzed using a logistic regression model. Within each subgroup category, data were divided into mutually exclusive subsets and then a separate analysis was performed for each subset. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI were provided. An interaction test was performed based on all participants in the mITT population. The p -value for the interaction term was calculated based on the same logistic regression model for the subgroup analyses, also with subgroup and treatment-by-subgroup interaction as categorical fixed effects.

The proportion of participants meeting criteria for acute medication overuse at baseline and after baseline was reported, including each 4-week interval and after treatment (weeks 1–12). The change in the proportion of participants meeting criteria for acute medication overuse over time was assessed using a generalized linear mixed model. The response variable was with or without acute medication overuse. The statistical model included treatment group, visit, treatment group–by-visit interaction, stratification of migraine preventive medication and number of failures, stratification of region, and number of acute medication use days at baseline. The p -value for the interaction between treatment group and visit was reported to assess change after treatment compared with baseline.

The primary and secondary end points in the PROGRESS trial had an overall familywise error rate controlled at 2-sided α = 0.05 for the comparisons between the 2 atogepant doses and placebo as previously described. Efficacy analyses other than the primary and secondary end points were not controlled for type I error. In addition, these analyses were not powered to compare the 2 atogepant dosing regimens. Hypothesis testing for adverse events was not performed because there was no multiplicity control. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 or newer (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registration, and Patient Consents

The trial was approved by a local or central institutional review board at each participating institution and conducted in accordance with the ICH guidelines, applicable regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed consent before screening. The study is registered with(NCT03855137). The study protocol and statistical analysis plan have been published.

### Atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in Japanese participants: a phase 2 / 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an active treatment extension (RELEASE) [^894c292f]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

BackgroundAtogepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist approved in the US and EU for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine (EM) in Japanese participants. MethodsRELEASE was a phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling adult participants with a ≥ 1-year history of migraine, < 50 years of age at time of migraine onset, history of 4–14 monthly migraine days (MMDs), and < 15 monthly headache days in the three months prior to screening and during the screening/baseline period. The study included a four-week screening/baseline period, 12-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP), 12-week active treatment extension period, and 30-day safety follow-up. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to placebo, atogepant 10mg once daily (QD), 30mg QD, or 60mg QD for the 12-week DBTP. Completers of the DBTP could continue to the 12-week active treatment extension period where the placebo group was rerandomized 1:1:1 to atogepant 10mg, 30mg, or 60mg; atogepant groups continued the same dose. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean MMDs across the 12-week DBTP. ResultsOf 807 participants screened, 523 were treated in the 12-week DBTP (Safety Population 1 [placebo, N = 134; atogepant 10mg, N = 126; 30mg, N = 131; 60mg, N = 132]; modified intent-to-treat population [placebo, N = 133; atogepant 10mg, N = 127; 30mg, N = 130; 60mg, N = 131]). The least square mean difference (95% confidence interval) from placebo in mean MMDs across 12 weeks was -1.57 (-2.24, -0.89) for atogepant 10mg, -1.90 (-2.57, -1.22) for 30mg, and -2.10 (-2.78, -1.43) for 60mg (all p < 0.0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the DBTP occurred in 46.3%, 45.2%, 38.9%, and 43.2% of participants receiving placebo, atogepant 10mg, 30mg and 60mg, respectively. During the DBTP, TEAEs occurring ≥ 5% were constipation and nasopharyngitis, and there was one serious TEAE in the atogepant 10mg group considered not related to treatment. TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation were infrequent in all treatment groups in the DBTP. Safety was consistent in the 12-week active treatment extension period. ConclusionsAtogepant treatment demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in mean MMDs compared with placebo across the 12-week DBTP in Japanese participants with EM. The safety profile of atogepant in Japanese participants was consistent with the known safety profile in the global population. No new safety signals were identified.

### Safety and tolerability results of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine from a 40-week, open-label multicenter extension of the phase 3 ADVANCE trial [^36316472]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Atogepant is a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. The study objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of atogepant in participants who completed the phase 3 ADVANCE trial (NCT03777059).

Methods

This 40-week, open-label extension trial (NCT03939312) monitored safety in participants receiving oral atogepant 60mg once daily, followed by a four-week safety follow-up period.

Results

Of the 685 participants taking at least one dose of atogepant, the treatment period was completed by 74.6% of participants with a mean (standard deviation) treatment duration of 233.6 (89.3) days. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 62.5% of participants, with upper respiratory tract infection (5.5%), urinary tract infection (5.3%), nasopharyngitis (4.8%), sinusitis (3.6%), constipation (3.4%), and nausea (3.4%) occurring at ≥ 3%. Serious adverse events were observed in 3.4% of participants (none were treatment-related), and there were no deaths. Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurring at > 0.1% were nausea (0.4%) and abdominal pain, vomiting, weight decrease, dizziness, and migraine (0.3% each).

Conclusion

These results are consistent with atogepant's known safety profile and support long-term use of atogepant 60mg once daily dosing as safe and well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov Registration Number: NCT03939312.

### Gepants, calcitonin-gene-related peptide receptor antagonists: what could be their role in migraine treatment? [^41061346]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Migraine is the second leading cause of years lived with disability after back pain. Poor tolerability, contraindications, drug-drug interactions and efficacy limited to a subpopulation make new approaches necessary for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. The study of the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway over the last decades is a good example of translational medicine leading to directed therapies for patients.

Recent Findings

After some of the first-generation CGRP receptor antagonists, gepants, were not fully developed because of hepatotoxicity, the second generation of gepants have shown efficacy, safety and tolerability in recent clinical trials.

Summary

Both rimegepant and ubrogepant have published positive randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials data. Vazegepant is the first intranasal gepant for the acute treatment of migraine and has announced a positive phase II/III study. Daily rimegepant use has preliminary data to suggest efficacy. Atogepant has shown efficacy in migraine prevention in a phase II/III study. Most importantly, hepatotoxicity has not been reported in specifically designed phase I studies or long-term extension studies, with rimegepant or ubrogepant, or in a preventive study with atogepant. Given the preventive effect, it seems likely that gepants will not lead to medication overuse headache. They will likely have no cardiovascular warnings. Because of the particular benefit gepants may represent for these groups of patients, specific studies in patients with medication overuse headache, as well as those with comorbid cardiovascular diseases, would be of considerable interest.

### New directions in migraine [^71453716]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine therapy

Therapies are broadly divided into acute symptomatic and prophylactic. To date, triptans are the gold standard in acute migraine therapy. They are potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) subtypes 1B and 1D receptor agonists that, when delivered orally, are effective in 29% to 64% of patients, depending on the criteria used to define pain relief: (1) pain-free after two hours and (2) moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain after two hours, respectively. However, clinical use can be limited by their potent vasoconstriction. The most significant recent advance in acute treatments relates to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists. Stimulation of TG neurons results in the release of CGRP; high levels of CGRP are found in external jugular venous blood during migraine attacks; and infusion of CGRP can cause MO. Telcagepant (the first orally administered CGRP antagonist) has been shown to possess efficacy similar to that of zolmitriptan as acute therapy. It also shows improved safety and tolerability, although it caused elevated levels of liver transaminases in a minority of patients taking the drug twice daily for three months. Insights gleaned from genetic studies offer novel drug targets and potential prophylactic agents through alterations in neuronal excitability. Indeed, current prophylactics such as valproate, verapamil, topiramate and lamotrigine are known to have effects on migraine-associated ion channels. Several drugs that block glial cell activation are also available and have approved clinical safety profiles. These drugs include naltrexone, naloxone, minocycline and ibudilast, and some have already been shown to be effective as prophylactics for migraine.

### Topiramate for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^8e869c16]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of topiramate taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between topiramate and comparator (placebo, active control, or topiramate in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and, in select cases, risk ratios (RRs); we also calculated numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We calculated MDs for selected quality of life instruments. Finally, we summarised data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Twenty papers describing 17 unique trials met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of data from nine trials (1737 participants) showed that topiramate reduced headache frequency by about 1.2 attacks per 28 days as compared to placebo (MD -1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.59 to -0.80). Data from nine trials (1190 participants) show that topiramate approximately doubled the proportion of responders relative to placebo (RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.57 to 2.60; NNT 4; 95% CI 3 to 6). Separate analysis of different topiramate doses produced similar MDs versus placebo at 50 mg (-0.95; 95% CI -1.95 to 0.04; three studies; 520 participants), 100 mg (-1.15; 95% CI -1.58 to -0.71; six studies; 1620 participants), and 200 mg (-0.94; 95% CI -1.53 to -0.36; five studies; 804 participants). All three doses significantly increased the proportion of responders relative to placebo; ORs were as follows: for 50 mg, 2.35 (95% CI 1.60 to 3.44; three studies; 519 participants); for 100 mg, 3.49 (95% CI 2.23 to 5.45; five studies; 852 participants); and for 200 mg, 2.49 (95% CI 1.61 to 3.87; six studies; 1025 participants). All three doses also significantly improved three or more domains of quality of life as compared to placebo. Meta-analysis of the three studies that included more than one dose of topiramate suggests that 200 mg is no more effective than 100 mg. With regard to mean headache frequency and/or responder rate, seven trials using active comparators found (a) no significant difference between topiramate and amitriptyline (one study, 330 participants); (b) no significant difference between topiramate and flunarizine (one study, 83 participants); (c) no significant difference between topiramate and propranolol (two studies, 342 participants); (d) no significant difference between topiramate and relaxation (one study, 61 participants); but (e) a slight significant advantage of topiramate over valproate (two studies, 120 participants). Relaxation improved migraine-specific quality of life significantly more than topiramate. In trials of topiramate against placebo, seven adverse events (AEs) were reported by at least three studies. These were usually mild and of a non-serious nature. Except for taste disturbance and weight loss, there were no significant differences in the frequency of AEs in general, or of the seven specific AEs, between placebo and topiramate 50 mg. AEs in general and all of the specific AEs except nausea were significantly more common on topiramate 100 mg than on placebo, with NNHs varying from 3 to 25, and the RDs versus placebo were even higher for topiramate 200 mg, with NNHs varying from 2 to 17.

Authors' Conclusions

Meta-analysis demonstrates that topiramate in a 100 mg/day dosage is effective in reducing headache frequency and reasonably well-tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine. This provides good evidence to support its use in routine clinical management. More studies designed specifically to compare the efficacy or safety of topiramate versus other interventions with proven efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine are needed.

Topiramate for migraine prevention — recommendation and safety: We suggest topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine. It is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The benefits of topiramate in improving monthly migraine days in patients with chronic and episodic migraines slightly outweighed the potential harm of adverse events. Safety cautions include the reduced efficacy of contraception at topiramate doses > 200 mg and an increased risk of teratogenicity with use during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester; cognitive side effects can be extremely bothersome, especially in patients with TBI or PTH, and should be used cautiously or avoided.

Topiramate — Four Class I studies reported that topiramate 50–200 mg/day is effective in migraine prevention; in one Class I placebo-controlled study (mean topiramate dose 125 mg/day [range 25–200 mg/day]), the 28-day migraine frequency was lower with topiramate vs placebo (3.31 ± 1.7 vs 3.83 ± 2.1; p = 0.002).

7.2 CNS Depressants

Concomitant administration of topiramate and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of topiramate to cause CNS depression, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, topiramate should be used with extreme caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants.

7.3 Oral Contraceptives

Exposure to ethinyl estradiol was statistically significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg/day (18%, 21%, and 30%, respectively) when topiramate was given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking valproic acid). However, norethindrone exposure was not significantly affected. In another pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers with a concomitantly administered combination oral contraceptive product containing 1 mg norethindrone (NET) plus 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE), topiramate, given in the absence of other medications at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day, was not associated with statistically significant changes in mean exposure (AUC) to either component of the oral contraceptive. The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding should be considered in patients taking combination oral contraceptive products with topiramate. Patients taking estrogen-containing contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns. Contraceptive efficacy can be decreased even in the absence of breakthrough bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

Topiramate patient education — weight management use, dosing, and safety are detailed: Although topiramate is not currently approved by the FDA for weight loss, it is used commonly in weight management clinics for this purpose. Topiramate helps patients feel full more quickly and feel less hungry and may also help patients binge eat less often; Topiramate may help you stick to a healthy diet, though used alone, it will not cause weight loss. Topiramate is a medication that was originally developed to treat seizures in children and migraine headaches in adults; it affects chemical messengers in the brain, but the exact way it works to decrease weight is unknown. Dosing is specified as follows: Start with 25 mg (1 tab) daily for a week. Increase to 50 mg (2 tabs) daily for the next week. At the third week, take 3 tabs (75 mg) daily. Stay at 3 tabs until you are seen again. Safety notes include: Most people tolerate topiramate with no problems. Please tell your doctor if you have a history of kidney stones, if you are taking phenytoin or birth control pills, or if you are pregnant. Topiramate is harmful in pregnancy. Topiramate can decrease your ability to tolerate hot weather. Be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration and kidney stones.

### Utility of topiramate for the treatment of patients with chronic migraine in the presence or absence of acute medication overuse [^2200d8d9]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic migraine has been linked to the excessive use of acute headache medications. Medication overuse (MO) is commonly considered the most significant risk factor for the progression of migraine from an episodic to a chronic condition. Managing MO is a challenge. Discontinuation of the acute medication can result in withdrawal headache, nausea, vomiting and sleep disturbances. This review summarizes the results from two similarly designed, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies of chronic migraine conducted in the USA and European Union. Both studies demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the migraine preventive medication, topiramate, for the treatment of chronic migraine in patient populations both with and without MO. These studies may have important implications for the future of chronic migraine management, suggesting that detoxification prior to initiating prophylactic therapy may not be required in all patients if MO is present.

### Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis [^caf137fe]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

About 14% of adults in the UK have migraines. Drugs used in migraine prophylaxis include beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol), 5HT antagonists (e.g. pizotifen), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), antiepileptics (e.g. sodium valproate) and NSAIDs. The antiepileptic topiramate (Topamax-Janssen-Cilag) is licensed for the prophylaxis of migraine headache in patients aged over 16 years. Here we discuss the place of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis.

Regarding the use of topiramate XR PO (also known as Qudexy XR) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Use during pregnancy can cause major congenital malformations (particularly oral clefts) and small for gestational-age infants. Women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy should use effective contraception to mitigate these risks. The drug topiramate XR PO (also known as Qudexy XR) is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

Follow-up and titration while on phentermine — Check BP and HR in 2–3 days if patient has hx of HTN, and see the patient every 1–3 months initially to review BP, HR, exam, side effects, risks/benefits, and off-label use at each visit. Dosage should be individualized to obtain adequate response with lowest effective dose; if BMI is not stabilized or if the patient develops tolerance, consider: 1) discontinuing phentermine, or 2) increasing dose to 30–37.5 mg QD (or divided), or 3) adding topiramate or other AOM such as GLP1RA.

14.3 Preventive Treatment of Migraine

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials established the effectiveness of topiramatein the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials (Study 11 was conducted in the U.S. and Study 12 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada) was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

Regarding preventative measures for migraine, more specifically with respect to migraine prophylaxis, CGRP inhibitors, ACP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering monotherapy with a CGRP antagonist (atogepant or rimegepant) or a CGRP antibody (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab) for the prevention of episodic migraine in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings not tolerating or inadequately responding to a trial or trials of a β-blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), valproate, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline.

### Effect of atogepant for preventive migraine treatment on patient-reported outcomes in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 ADVANCE trial [^cf0f2400]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

This trial has strengths and limitations. This rigorously designed double-blind placebo-controlled trial used established validated PRO instruments that measure changes in functional ability, activity impairment, and headache effect over time. The trial was not powered for key secondary endpoints, including the change from baseline in MSQ v2.1 RFR at week 12 and AIM-D PDA and PI across the 12-week treatment period, although these were prespecified alpha-controlled secondary efficacy endpoints. The MSQ v2.1 RFR measure has been included in the US labeling for migraine preventives; however, the HIT-6 has not. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke highly recommends both the MSQ v2.1 and HIT-6 for headache studies. The MSQ v2.1 and HIT-6 have 4-week recall periods, raising recall bias as a potential limitation. There are other recall-based PROs, which were not included or available during the study, including the Migraine Functional Impact Questionnaire. By contrast, as a daily diary, the AIM-D has a same-day recall period. The AIM-D, which was specifically constructed based on FDA guidance for PRO developmentfor use in clinical trials of migraine treatments, provides some unique insights into the effects of atogepant on migraine-related activity impairment. The lack of statistically significant changes in AIM-D scores in the 10 mg dose group is surprising, considering the significant changes with MSQ v2.1 and HIT-6. AIM-D scores are averaged across the month for HA and nHA days. In an EM study, by definition, participants do not have headaches on most days, truncating the potential range of AIM-D scores and creating a potential for floor effects. The baseline AIM-D total score for the overall population was 14.3 (range: 13.6–15.4), on a scale with a maximum value of 100. In addition, the benefits of atogepant might be greater on HA days than on nHA days. Combining HA days and nHA days may generate an AIM-D metric that is less sensitive than an HA day measure, particularly for a lower dose of a preventive treatment. The AIM-D has not been compared directly with other diary data or scales. Finally, the duration of follow-up was only 12 weeks; some PRO outcomes may continue to improve beyond 12 weeks, so longer studies could be helpful. Future work should separately score HA and nHA days to distinguish the benefits of atogepant on ictal and interictal burden. Only participants with 4–14 MMDs were included in the ADVANCE trial, but a phase 3 atogepant trial in people with CM is ongoing (NCT03855137).

### Weight loss with atogepant during the preventive treatment of migraine: a pooled analysis [^cbf25554]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Migraine is associated with obesity. These analyses evaluated weight change with atogepant used as a preventive migraine treatment.

Methods

Five atogepant clinical trials in adults with migraine (one phase 2b/3; four phase 3) were included: Three 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (episodic migraine: two; chronic migraine: one); one 40-week, open-label extension trial and one 52-week, standard care, randomized, long-term safety trial in episodic migraine. Change from baseline in body weight was measured.

Results

Mean baseline body mass indexes were 30.0–30.7kg/m² (pooled episodic migraine [United States only]) and 25.0–25.5kg/m² (chronic migraine [East Asia, Europe, and North America]). More participants treated with atogepant 60mg once-daily compared to placebo experienced ≥ 7% weight loss at any time in the pooled episodic migraine placebo-controlled trials (4.9% vs. 2.8%), chronic migraine placebo-controlled trial (5.8% vs. 2.0%), and pooled open-label extension and long-term safety trials (24.0% vs.14.7% in standard care [long-term safety only]). In the placebo-controlled trials, weight loss with atogepant 60mg once-daily was observed at week 2 (pooled episodic migraine: -0.32%; chronic migraine: -0.39%), increasing at week 12 (pooled episodic migraine: -1.02%; chronic migraine: -1.50%); compared to weight gain with placebo at week 12 (pooled episodic migraine: +0.49%; chronic migraine: +0.10%). In the long-term episodic migraine studies, weight loss with atogepant 60mg once-daily was observed at week 4 (long-term safety: -0.42%; open-label extension: -0.76%), increasing at week 40 (long-term safety: -2.38%; open-label extension: -2.09%).

Conclusion

Atogepant was associated with modest dose- and duration-dependent weight loss.

Phentermine–topiramate extended-release (ER) — special clinical considerations and dosing: Phentermine–topiramate ER is available in capsules with doses of 3.75 mg/23 mg, 7.5 mg/46 mg, 11.25 mg/69 mg, and 15 mg/92 mg; initiation uses the starter dose of 3.75 mg/23 mg taken once daily for 14 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg daily; after 12 weeks, if the patient has not lost at least 3% of their body weight, consider discontinuation or further dose escalation; for escalation, titrate up to 11.25 mg/69 mg daily for 14 days, followed by the maintenance maximum dose of 15 mg/92 mg daily; although 7.5 mg/46 mg is considered the standard dose, our analysis demonstrated superior efficacy for the 15 mg/92 mg option, and we recommend this as the target dose, as long as the balance of benefit and risk is favorable for a given individual patient. Caution is advised and phentermine–topiramate ER should be avoided in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension; pivotal phase 3 trials enrolled subjects up to the age of 70 years with no high-quality data to guide geriatric use; it should also be avoided in patients treated with, or within 14 days, of monoamine oxidase inhibitors; due to concerns for arrhythmias and seizures, medications with phentermine should not be used in patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. For pregnancy-related safety, fetal exposure to topiramate during the first trimester is associated with an increased risk of oral clefts, patients with child-bearing potential should be counseled on teratogenic risks and contraception, and monitoring with monthly pregnancy tests can be considered. Because topiramate has carbonic anhydrase inhibitor properties that can induce metabolic acidosis and urine pH changes, there may be an increased risk of kidney stones; caution is advised in patients with a history of significant nephrolithiasis, and consideration should be given to periodic monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels during long-term treatment. Due to the potential for insomnia, it is recommended that phentermine–topiramate ER be taken early in the day; commonly reported adverse effects include cognitive impairment, constipation, dry mouth, palpitations, paresthesias, dysgeusia, and irritability; and phentermine–topiramate ER is classified as a schedule IV-controlled substance.
