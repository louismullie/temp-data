## Question

How does a patient get klebsiella

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a patient gets Klebsiella pneumoniae. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline ecology of Klebsiella and where it normally lives. Then, I should verify the distinction between colonization and infection and what triggers progression. Next, I will examine transmission pathways in healthcare versus community settings, including person-to-person spread and environmental reservoirs. After that, I need to consider the role of antimicrobial exposure and microbiome disruption. Finally, I will integrate host risk factors and summarize the acquisition pathways with practical implications for prevention and detection.

> Let me first confirm the ecological baseline. Klebsiella pneumoniae commonly colonizes human mucosal surfaces, particularly the gastrointestinal tract and oropharynx, and is also found in environmental reservoirs such as water, sewage, and soil. Colonization is often asymptomatic and precedes infection in many cases, which frames the rest of the reasoning [^116zTodt] [^116JUsgz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — colonization is not the same as infection. I need to ensure I distinguish that colonization represents carriage without disease, whereas infection requires invasion of normally sterile sites and clinical manifestations; progression from colonization to infection is influenced by bacterial factors, host vulnerabilities, and healthcare exposures, with carriage rates higher in hospitalized patients than in the community [^116zTodt] [^116JUsgz].

> Next, I should review transmission in healthcare settings. Person-to-person spread via the fecal–oral route is a major driver in hospitals, facilitated by contaminated hands of healthcare workers, shared equipment, and environmental surfaces. Asymptomatic carriers, including patients and staff, serve as reservoirs, and whole-genome sequencing studies have linked inter-facility transmission to silent colonization and patient transfers, underscoring the need for infection control [^112ikm25] [^1138vG6X] [^117Sgg8a] [^111gZ7T5].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative transmissibility data. In ICU settings, extended-spectrum cephalosporin–resistant non–E. coli Enterobacterales (predominantly Klebsiella) have approximately 3.7-fold higher transmission capacity than E. coli, and ESBL-positive Klebsiella strains have markedly higher onward nosocomial transmission risk than ESBL-negative strains, which helps explain why AMR Klebsiella often seed outbreaks despite standard precautions [^115q2CSf] [^112Nka3m].

> I will now examine community transmission. Community-acquired hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is increasingly recognized outside Asia, with carriage documented in healthy individuals and household transmission reported. One Health studies also show shared sequence types and mobile elements between human and animal isolates, suggesting environmental and zoonotic contributions, though most human infections still reflect person-to-person spread in defined networks [^112RPWo6] [^116hnYtL] [^114GJeGg] [^112cJCXu].

> But wait, what if the environment is the key source in some contexts? Environmental contamination around colonized patients can be substantial, and a minority of "super-spreaders" with high rectal concentrations account for a disproportionate share of environmental shedding, reinforcing the role of fecal–oral dynamics and colonization pressure in hospital transmission [^113rcc12].

> Next, I should review the role of antibiotics and microbiome disruption. Antibiotic exposure diminishes colonization resistance, allowing Klebsiella to expand in the gut and increasing the likelihood of subsequent infection. Specific agents such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins have been linked to acquisition of multidrug-resistant and carbapenem-resistant strains, and experimental work shows that Bacteroidetes-mediated IL-36 signaling protects against colonization, which is disrupted by antibiotics [^116JUsgz] [^117UfcQV] [^114UXL3s].

> Let me consider host and healthcare risk factors that facilitate acquisition. ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, indwelling devices, and prolonged hospital stay increase exposure and colonization risk. Diabetes, alcohol use disorder, and immunocompromise predispose to infection once colonized, and older adults have higher incidence and mortality from Klebsiella bloodstream infection, reflecting both exposure and host susceptibility [^116zTodt] [^115S9riN] [^113pKjWm].

> I should double-check the contribution of the patient's own microbiota to infection. Prospective ICU studies using whole-genome sequencing show that roughly half of Klebsiella infections arise from the patient's own preexisting gut strain, with colonization on admission strongly associated with later infection. This endogenous pathway complements exogenous cross-transmission and explains why decolonization and microbiome-targeted strategies are being explored [^116s9k1Z] [^1138sqYg] [^113ouGEM].

> Let me synthesize the acquisition pathways clearly. Patients acquire Klebsiella through three interrelated routes: endogenous activation of carriage already present in the gut or oropharynx, exogenous person-to-person transmission in healthcare settings via the fecal–oral route and contaminated hands or equipment, and community exposure including household and environmental reservoirs. The balance among these depends on colonization pressure, antibiotic exposure, and host vulnerability [^116zTodt] [^112ikm25] [^112RPWo6].

> Hold on, I should verify practical implications for detection and prevention. Because silent gastrointestinal carriage is common and linked to downstream infection, active surveillance cultures in high-risk wards can identify reservoirs and enable preemptive isolation; molecular tools like KlebSeq and Kleborate support rapid strain and resistance profiling, and bundled infection control interventions — including cohorting, contact precautions, and chlorhexidine bathing — reduce acquisition and infection rates in long-term acute care hospitals, while stewardship to limit high-risk antibiotics mitigates selection pressure [^114vVafZ] [^112RvcEB] [^117Xcxd9] [^115oJK34].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that colonization inevitably leads to infection. I should correct that: colonization increases risk but does not guarantee infection. Progression is probabilistic and modifiable by patient factors, bacterial virulence, and infection prevention practices, which is why early identification of carriers and targeted precautions are central to control strategies [^117XpyfA].

Patients acquire Klebsiella pneumoniae primarily through **person-to-person contact** in healthcare settings [^1114jHPE], especially via contaminated hands and medical equipment [^111UkJpA], and through **environmental reservoirs** such as sinks, ventilators, and surfaces [^113rcc12]. Community acquisition is less common but occurs via **fecal-oral transmission** [^112ikm25], contaminated food or water [^116JUsgz], and close contact with colonized individuals [^112cJCXu]. Risk increases with **antibiotic exposure** [^1138vG6X], **indwelling devices** (catheters, ventilators) [^112E5a1A], and immunocompromised states [^116zTodt]. Preventing transmission relies on strict hand hygiene, device care, and infection control [^111UkJpA].

---

## Transmission routes and sources

### Healthcare-associated transmission

- **Person-to-person contact**: The most common route in hospitals, especially via contaminated hands of healthcare workers [^111UkJpA] and patient-to-patient contact [^1156H5sM].

- **Contaminated medical equipment**: Devices such as ventilators, catheters, and endoscopes [^113oE1o2] can harbor Klebsiella, facilitating transmission [^113oE1o2].

- **Environmental reservoirs**: Hospital surfaces, sinks, and water systems [^notfound] are frequent sources; environmental contamination supports persistence and spread [^113rcc12].

---

### Community-acquired transmission

- **Fecal-oral route**: Community spread occurs via ingestion of fecally contaminated water or food [^112ikm25], particularly in areas with poor sanitation [^113TB96F].

- **Close contact**: Household transmission has been documented [^112cJCXu], especially among individuals with recent healthcare exposure or colonization [^113mgcFF].

- **Foodborne transmission**: Contaminated produce and improperly handled food can be sources of community-acquired Klebsiella [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors for acquisition

Several factors increase susceptibility to Klebsiella colonization and infection:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Antibiotic exposure | Broad-spectrum antibiotics disrupt normal flora, facilitating colonization [^1138vG6X] [^116JUsgz] |
| Indwelling medical devices | Catheters, ventilators, and endoscopes provide entry points and biofilm niches [^112E5a1A] |
| Immunocompromised state | HIV/AIDS, diabetes, malignancy, and immunosuppressive therapy increase risk [^115S9riN] |
| Prolonged hospitalization | Extended stays increase exposure to healthcare-associated reservoirs [^116JUsgz] |
| Intensive care unit admission | ICU patients face higher colonization and infection risk due to devices and antibiotics [^116FuaWg] |

---

## Clinical implications of acquisition

Klebsiella acquisition can lead to **colonization** — often asymptomatic but a reservoir for subsequent infection [^116JUsgz] — or to **infection**, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bloodstream infection, and liver abscess, with high mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^114PNqc8] [^113L7ueC].

---

## Prevention strategies

Effective prevention requires **multimodal interventions**:

- **Hand hygiene**: Rigorous handwashing by healthcare workers and patients [^111UkJpA].

- **Infection control measures**: Contact precautions, environmental cleaning, and antimicrobial stewardship [^117Xcxd9].

- **Device management**: Strict aseptic technique and prompt removal of indwelling devices [^notfound].

- **Surveillance**: Active screening for colonization in high-risk settings to enable early intervention [^117XpyfA].

---

Patients acquire Klebsiella pneumoniae through healthcare-associated contact, environmental contamination, and community exposure, with risk shaped by antibiotics, devices, and immunity. Prevention hinges on **hygiene, device care, and surveillance** to limit transmission and colonization.

### Carbapenem resistance among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates: risk factors, molecular characteristics, and susceptibility patterns [^112a6Mt7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Carbapenem resistance among isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae has been unusual.

Objectives

To identify risk factors for infection with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) and to characterize microbiological aspects of isolates associated with these infections.

Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Setting

A 900-bed tertiary care hospital.

Results

From January 2006 through April 2007, K. pneumoniae was isolated from 461 inpatients; 88 had CRKP infection (case patients), whereas 373 had carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae infection (control subjects). The independent risk factors for infection with CRKP were prior fluoroquinolone use (odds ratio [OR], 1.87 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–3.26]; p = 0.026), previous receipt of a carbapenem drug (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.02–3.27]; p = 0.042), admission to the intensive care unit (OR, 4.27 [95% CI, 2.49–7.31]; P < .001), and exposure to at least 1 antibiotic drug before isolation of K. pneumoniae (OR, 3.93 [95% CI, 1.15–13.47]; p = 0.029). All CRKP isolates carried the bla(KPC) gene. Approximately 90% of the tested isolates carried the bla(KPC-2) allele, suggesting patient-to-patient transmission. Almost all CRKP isolates were resistant to all antibiotics, except to colistin (resistance rate, 4.5%), gentamicin (resistance rate, 7%), and tigecycline (resistance rate, 15%).

Conclusions

CRKP should be regarded as an emerging clinical threat. Because these isolates are resistant to virtually all commonly used antibiotics, control of their spread is crucial.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^114tMGtH]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative, non-motile encapsulated bacteria, and strains are separated into two pathotypes: classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp). CKp strains are frequently multidrug resistant and are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in immunocompromised individuals. HvKp can also cause these types of infections but are distinct in their ability to cause severe community-acquired tissue-invasive infections in immunocompetent individuals. While hvKp infections are most prevalent in populations in Asian countries, their incidence is rising globally, and hvKp is now recognized as a significant cause of pyogenic (pus-filled) liver abscesses in the United States and Europe.

K. pneumoniae is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, detected in 4%–35% of stool samples in Western countries and in 18%–88% of individuals in endemic regions. In Asian populations, approximately 10% of individuals colonized with K. pneumoniae harbor strains that are likely hvKp. However, the prevalence of hvKp GI carriage in Western countries remains poorly defined, as most studies do not distinguish between cKp and hvKp strains.

KLAs can occur when hvKp migrates from the gut to the liver via the portal vein, typically following bowel leakage. However, KLAs can also arise from other primary sites, such as lung or wound infections. Gut colonization by hvKp is also thought to facilitate community transmission through the fecal-oral route.

Once established, hvKp liver abscesses are difficult to treat with antibiotics and are prone to metastatic spread, leading to conditions such as endophthalmitis or meningitis that can result in vision loss or death, respectively. Reported mortality rates for KLAs range from 5% to 40%. Despite the significant clinical impact of KLAs, the mechanisms underlying the poor outcomes are not well understood. In this review, we explore the pathogenesis of KLAs, and the challenges associated with management and treatment of these infections.

Declaration on infection prevention and management in global surgery

Beginning with the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the late 1920s, antibiotics have revolutionized modern medicine saving millions of lives each year. However, bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics, causing infections that are more serious and difficult to treat.

Antibiotics can be lifesaving when managing patients with bacterial infections. However, they are often used inappropriately, unnecessary administered for long durations, or used without consideration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles.

Large variability in antibiotic prescriptions exists among countries worldwide, and while excessive use remains a major problem in some regions of the world, elsewhere there is a lack of access to many antibiotics. This disparity creates a concerning gap jeopardizing the sustainability and safety of the global antibiotic supply, ultimately compromising access to effective treatments and leading to suboptimal prescription practices in some areas of the world. Effective antibiotic treatment is an essential component of delivering universal healthcare, and the whole world has a collective responsibility to use antibiotics appropriately to maintain their effectiveness.

AMR is a natural phenomenon occurring as microorganisms evolve; however, human activities are accelerating the pace at which bacteria develop and spread AMR. Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing practices, as well as incorrect infection prevention and control measures, are contributing to the development and spread of AMR. AMR is a complex issue involving not only humans but also animals and the environment. The term "One Health" is now accepted to define the strict interconnectedness of the health of people, animals, and the environment where we live.

Hospitalized patients often have multiple risk factors for the acquisition of AMR. Acute care facilities are incubators for the spread of AMR representing an environment that can facilitate the emergence and the spread of resistant organisms. Healthcare workers in hospital settings play a critical role in preventing the spread of AMR. In 2008, the acronym "ESKAPE" including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species was coined to emphasize that these bacteria currently cause the majority of hospital infections and can "escape" the effects of antibiotics.

### Outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae: a systematic review [^116KeA4G]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

First detected in the United States in 1996, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has spread internationally among gram-negative bacteria, especially K pneumoniae. These microorganisms can cause serious infections in hospitalized patients, and there are few therapeutic options, culminating in increased mortality. The objective of this study was to describe the occurrence of outbreaks that were caused by KPC-producing K pneumoniae, emphasizing the interventions that were implemented to contain the outbreaks.

Methods

PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Literatura Latino Americana em Ciências da Saúde databases were searched for articles that were published between 2001 and 2012 according to the recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Results

Of the 586 studies identified, 13 were selected for the final sample. Most studies showed that the containment of KPC outbreaks is possible in hospital settings through several actions, particularly use of surveillance cultures and the establishment of contact precautions.

Conclusions

The results show that limiting the cross-transmission of these and other KPC-producing bacteria is possible in a hospital setting. However, such isolates need to be detected early with the aid of culture surveillance and contained early using appropriate actions immediately to prevent an outbreak.

### Animal model to study Klebsiella pneumoniae gastrointestinal colonization and host-to-host transmission [^112ikm25]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

An important yet poorly understood facet of the life cycle of a successful pathogen is host-to-host transmission. Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) resulting from the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens affect hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. a Gram-negative bacterium, is notorious for causing HAI, with many of these infections difficult to treat, ashas become multidrug resistant. Epidemiological studies suggest thathost-to-host transmission requires close contact and generally occurs through the fecal-oral route.

### Commensal bacteroidetes protect against Klebsiella pneumoniae colonization and transmission through IL-36 signalling [^114UXL3s]. Nature Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

The microbiota primes immune defences but the identity of specific commensal microorganisms that protect against infection is unclear. Conversely, how pathogens compete with the microbiota to establish their host niche is also poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate the antagonism between the microbiota and Klebsiella pneumoniae during colonization and transmission. We discover that maturation of the microbiota drives the development of distinct immune defence programmes in the upper airways and intestine to limit K. pneumoniae colonization within these niches. Immune protection in the intestine depends on the development of Bacteroidetes, interleukin (IL)-36 signalling and macrophages. This effect of Bacteroidetes requires the polysaccharide utilization locus of their conserved commensal colonization factor. Conversely, in the upper airways, Proteobacteria prime immunity through IL-17A, but K. pneumoniae overcomes these defences through encapsulation to effectively colonize this site. Ultimately, we find that host-to-host spread of K. pneumoniae occurs principally from its intestinal reservoir, and that commensal-colonization-factor-producing Bacteroidetes are sufficient to prevent transmission between hosts through IL-36. Thus, our study provides mechanistic insight into when, where and how commensal Bacteroidetes protect against K. pneumoniae colonization and contagion, providing insight into how these protective microorganisms could be harnessed to confer population-level protection against K. pneumoniae infection.

### Genomic insights unveil the plasmid transfer mechanism and epidemiology of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae in Vietnam [^116hnYtL]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Previous studies have shown little evidence of K. pneumoniae transmission between humans and non-human sources –. Meanwhile, hvKp have been found in the gastrointestinal tracts of both healthy individuals and patients. Here, we sought to understand the circulation of hvKp strains in healthy individuals and the extent of genetic sharing with disease-causing organisms. In healthy children, while classical K. pneumoniae strains were identified from rectal swabs, no hvKp strains were detected. We speculate this observation may stem from the frequent exposure of children in our setting to antibiotics, coupled with the prevailing pan-susceptibility of most hvKp strains to these antimicrobial agents. In healthy adults, we found a prevalence of 3.7% of hvKp isolates, exhibiting diverse but significant overlap in sequence types with those found in humans with bloodstream infections. The fact that the carriage and infecting isolates share the same STs and exhibit limited genetic distances strongly suggests that the human gastrointestinal tract constitutes an important reservoir for the transmission of hvKp strains. The biological and epidemiological factors governing the establishment of gut colonization in susceptible hosts and the community transmission of hvKp remain poorly understood. We need to address these knowledge gaps to devise appropriate preventative measures to prevent/reduce risks of gut colonization and infection development in vulnerable populations. Furthermore, although hvKp infections have been rarely reported in children, it is essential to note that such infections can lead to severe illnesses with high mortality rates. Given that our study primarily centered on bloodstream infections in adult patients, we strongly advocate for further investigations into the community transmission and incidence rates of various hvKp infections across diverse populations (adults vs. children) and settings (community vs. hospital environments).

### Antimicrobial-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage and infection in specialized geriatric care wards linked to acquisition in the referring hospital [^116Wnk2R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Patients' own gut microbiota were the major source of Klebsiella pneumoniae, but extended-spectrum β-lactamase strains were acquired in the referring hospital. This highlights the potential for rectal screening, and the importance of the wider hospital network, for local risk management.

### Antimicrobial resistance as risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^112pK9PN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

We studied recurrence up to 1 year, accounting for all species and types of bacteremia onset. Although this definition differs from previous works, which focused on recurrence to the same bacterium, we argue that it better captures the potential effect of AMR and ensuing antibiotic exposure on host microbiota and overall susceptibility to infection. Irrespective of their appropriateness to treat a given bacterium, antibiotics can induce dysbiosis, with repercussions for host immunity, selection of antibiotic-resistant strains, colonization, and infection by antibiotic-susceptible or antibiotic-resistant strains (,–). Given that approximately half the recurrences were attributable to the same species, we conducted sensitivity analyses in the 2 subgroups with recurrence attributable to the same or to a different species. Those analyses showed results consistent with the overall analysis, while suggesting a greater effect of isolating 3GC-resistant E.coli during the incident episode on the risk for recurrence attributable to the same species compared with recurrence attributable to a different species. On the other hand, the link between 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. and the risk for recurrence attributable to the same or a different species was similar. Those results support previous works showing higher rates of illness associated with Klebsiella spp. infections compared with E. coli infections. Al-Hasan et al. showed that isolation of Klebsiella spp. was associated with bacteremia recurrence, relative to isolation of E. coli and after adjustment. Other work has suggested that patients with ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia have higher rates of ICU admission and death compared with patients with ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia. Overall, our findings demonstrate a new facet to the disease burden imposed by 3GC resistance in E. coli and especially Klebsiella spp. infections, the proportions of which are increasing in community settings worldwide. Our findings support ongoing calls for increased awareness and intervention to limit the spread of antibiotic-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp. in the community. For clinicians in particular, our results highlight the need for increased caution in the follow-up of patients with community-onset bacteremia attributable to 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. or E. coli.

### Clonal background and routes of plasmid transmission underlie antimicrobial resistance features of bloodstream Klebsiella pneumoniae [^112E5a1A]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The Gram-negative commensal bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae typically inhabits human mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract. It is also an opportunistic pathogen that is responsible for a wide range of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, which often lead to adverse clinical and health-economic outcomes. The disease presentations of K. pneumoniae include pneumonia, bloodstream infection, meningitis, urinary tract infections, wound or soft tissue infections, and liver abscess. K. pneumoniae can invade normally sterile sites of the body, such as the blood, through localized infectious diseases, surgical procedures, and the presence of catheters and other intravascular medical devices. The entry and proliferation of bacteria in the bloodstream can lead to a strong immune response, including organ failure and dysfunction, that can be fatal if not treated promptly and appropriately. Worldwide, K. pneumoniae is the third leading cause of bloodstream infections.

### Gastrointestinal carriage is a major reservoir of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in intensive care patients [^116dR8NN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of K. pneumoniae colonization in an at-risk cohort in an intensive care unit (ICU) within a modern, well-equipped, and well-managed tertiary teaching hospital in Australia. Additionally, we investigated whether colonization on admission enhances risk of subsequent K. pneumoniae infection among ICU patients and the relative contribution of patients' own gut microbiota and intra-hospital transmission to the burden of K. pneumoniae carriage and infection in the ICU.

### Population genomics of Klebsiella pneumoniae [^113JvKKN]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of antimicrobial-resistant opportunistic infections in hospitalized patients. The species is naturally resistant to penicillins, and members of the population often carry acquired resistance to multiple antimicrobials. However, knowledge of K. pneumoniae ecology, population structure or pathogenicity is relatively limited. Over the past decade, K. pneumoniae has emerged as a major clinical and public health threat owing to increasing prevalence of healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases and/or carbapenemases. A parallel phenomenon of severe community-acquired infections caused by 'hypervirulent' K. pneumoniae has also emerged, associated with strains expressing acquired virulence factors. These distinct clinical concerns have stimulated renewed interest in K. pneumoniae research and particularly the application of genomics. In this Review, we discuss how genomics approaches have advanced our understanding of K. pneumoniae taxonomy, ecology and evolution as well as the diversity and distribution of clinically relevant determinants of pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance. A deeper understanding of K. pneumoniae population structure and diversity will be important for the proper design and interpretation of experimental studies, for interpreting clinical and public health surveillance data and for the design and implementation of novel control strategies against this important pathogen.

### Virulence characteristics of Klebsiella and clinical manifestations of K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections [^113pKjWm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In the past decade, geographic differences have been recognized in the spectrum of disease caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. These differences include a preponderance of severe invasive disease in Taiwan and other parts of Asia. A characteristic syndrome has emerged in which liver abscess is accompanied by K. pneumoniae bacteremia and sometimes by endophthalmitis or meningitis. This is typically a community-acquired infection that occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus. Reports of this syndrome from North America, Europe, and Australia are uncommon.

Additionally, K. pneumoniae has long been recognized as a possible cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Over the past 2 decades, K. pneumoniae has been an exceedingly rare cause of community-acquired pneumonia in North America, Europe, and Australia. Yet, it remains an important cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia in Asia and Africa. In these regions, patients also have classic risk factor of alcoholism.

We have completed a prospective study of 455 patients from 7 countries with K. pneumoniae bacteremia. We found that although nosocomial infections with K. pneumoniae occurred worldwide, some manifestations of community-acquired infection (namely, liver abscess and community-acquired pneumonia) were geographically restricted. These manifestations of disease occurred almost exclusively in Taiwan and South Africa. Potential explanations for these geographic differences in clinical manifestations include host factors such as rates of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, access to healthcare, and socioeconomic factors.

Another explanation for these differences is related to the organism. In this study, we performed capsular serotyping, determined the presence of mucoid phenotype and aerobactin production, and assessed lethality in a murine model and correlated these in vitro and in vivo results with the clinical manifestation of patients with K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections. Our aim was to determine whether the different manifestations of infection occurring in different geographic regions could be correlated with differences in organism characteristics.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates with features of both multidrug-resistance and hypervirulence have unexpectedly low virulence [^1171N4H3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae has been classified into two types, classical K. pneumoniae (cKP) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP). cKP isolates are highly diverse and important causes of nosocomial infections; they include globally disseminated antibiotic-resistant clones. hvKP isolates are sensitive to most antibiotics but are highly virulent, causing community-acquired infections in healthy individuals. The virulence phenotype of hvKP is associated with pathogenicity loci responsible for siderophore and hypermucoid capsule production. Recently, convergent strains of K. pneumoniae, which possess features of both cKP and hvKP, have emerged and are cause of much concern. Here, we screen the genomes of 2,608 multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from the United States and identify 47 convergent isolates. We perform phenotypic and genomic characterization of 12 representative isolates. These 12 convergent isolates contain a variety of antimicrobial resistance plasmids and virulence plasmids. Most convergent isolates contain aerobactin biosynthesis genes and produce more siderophores than cKP isolates but not more capsule. Unexpectedly, only 1 of the 12 tested convergent isolates has a level of virulence consistent with hvKP isolates in a murine pneumonia model. These findings suggest that additional studies should be performed to clarify whether convergent strains are indeed more virulent than cKP in mouse and human infections.

### Household carriage and acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: a systematic review [^112cJCXu]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The epidemiology of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) has been extensively studied in hospitals, but data on community transmission are scarce. We investigated ESBL-PE cocarriage and acquisition in households using a systematic literature review.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search to retrieve cross-sectional or cohort studies published between 1990 and 2018 evaluating cocarriage proportions and/or acquisition rates of ESBL-PE among household members, without language restriction. We excluded studies focusing on animal-to-human transmission or conducted in nonhousehold settings. The main outcomes were ESBL-PE cocarriage proportions and acquisition rates, stratified according to phenotypic or genotypic assessment of strain relatedness. Cocarriage proportions of clonally related ESBL-PE were transformed using the double-arcsine method and were pooled using a random-effects model. Potential biases were assessed manually.

Results

We included 13 studies. Among 863 household members of ESBL-PE positive index cases, prevalence of ESBL-PE cocarriage ranged from 8% to 37%. Overall, 12% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8%-16%) of subjects had a clonally related strain. Those proportions were higher for Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%-25%) than for Escherichia coli (10%-20%). Acquisition rates of clonally related ESBL-PE among 180 initially ESBL-PE-free household members of a previously identified carrier ranged between 1.56 and 2.03 events per 1,000 person weeks of follow-up. We identified multiple sources of bias and high heterogeneity (I2, 70%) between studies.

Conclusions

ESBL-PE household cocarriage is frequent, suggesting intrafamilial acquisition. Further research is needed to evaluate the risk and control of ESBL-PE household transmission.

### A 4.5-year within-patient evolution of a colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae sequence type 258 [^113oE1o2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) has emerged globally over the last decade as a major nosocomial pathogen that threatens patient care. These highly resistant bacteria are mostly associated with a single Kp clonal group, CG258, but the reasons for its host and hospital adaptation remain largely unknown.

Methods

We analyzed the in vivo evolution of a colistin-resistant KPC-Kp CG258 strain that contaminated a patient following an endoscopy and was responsible for a fatal bacteremia 4.5 years later. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 17 KPC-Kp isolates from this patient; single-nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed and their implication in antimicrobial resistance and bacterial host adaptation investigated.

Results

The patient KPC-Kp strain diversified over 4.5 years at a rate of 7.5 substitutions per genome per year, resulting in broad phenotypic modifications. After 2 years of carriage, all isolates restored susceptibility to colistin. Higher expression of the fimbriae conferred the ability to produce more biofilm, and the isolate responsible for a bacteremia grew in human serum. The convergent mutations occurring in specific pathways, such as the respiratory chain and the cell envelope, revealed a complex long-term adaptation of KPC-Kp.

Conclusions

Broad genomic and phenotypic diversification and the parallel selection of pathoadaptive mutations might contribute to long-term carriage and virulence of KPC-Kp CG258 strains and to the dissemination of this clone.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with acquisition of colistin-resistant KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: a matched case-control study [^112FzN5S]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

A matched 1:3 case-control study investigated factors predicting colistin-resistant versus colistin-susceptible KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae acquisition and its impact on patient outcomes. Case patients were more often admitted from other institutions (P = 0.019) and had longer therapy with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (P = 0.002) and higher overall mortality (P = 0.05). All 52 study isolates were clonally related, suggesting horizontal dissemination. None of these parameters independently predicted colistin resistance, which probably occurred in a susceptible KPC-KP strain that was subsequently disseminated horizontally.

### Combined comparative genomics and clinical modeling reveals plasmid-encoded genes are independently associated with Klebsiella infection [^117U2bXz]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we have identified novel Klebsiella genes associated with infection in colonized patients. The findings from this diverse collection of Klebsiella isolates, carefully adjusted for patient risk factors and phylogeny, and validated in a second geographically distinct cohort, provides important insights into the broader dynamics of Klebsiella pathogenesis. Most of these genes were found across a diverse set of plasmids, suggesting that these genes are either direct mediators of fitness and virulence or indirect markers of large, conjugative plasmids that increase infection risk as a unit. These genes can be separated into two categories: those whose association with infection is mediated through increased abundance in the gut, and those that have a direct association with infection. Genes whose effect on infection risk is not mediated through intestinal dominance may act at a subsequent step of pathogenesis. These genes associated with infection are readily mobilized within and across members of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, and changes in infection-associated gene content and genetic context were detectable within colonized patients who progressed to infection. Collectively, this study provides a set of genetic signatures of infection that have potential for predicting risk of infection in patients colonized by diverse Klebsiella.

### KlebSeq, a diagnostic tool for surveillance, detection, and monitoring of Klebsiella pneumoniae [^114vVafZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Health care-acquired infections (HAIs) kill tens of thousands of people each year and add significantly to health care costs. Multidrug-resistant and epidemic strains are a large proportion of HAI agents, and multidrug-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a leading HAI agent, have caused an urgent public health crisis. In the health care environment, patient colonization by K. pneumoniae precedes infection, and transmission via colonization leads to outbreaks. Periodic patient screening for K. pneumoniae colonization has the potential to curb the number of HAIs. In this report, we describe the design and validation of KlebSeq, a highly informative screening tool that detects Klebsiella species and identifies clinically important strains and characteristics by using highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing without a live-culturing step. We demonstrate the utility of this tool on several complex specimen types, including urine, wound swabs and tissue, and several types of respiratory and fecal specimens, showing K. pneumoniae species and clonal group identification and antimicrobial resistance and virulence profiling, including capsule typing. Use of this amplicon sequencing tool to screen patients for Klebsiella carriage could inform health care staff of the risk of infection and outbreak potential. KlebSeq also serves as a model for next-generation molecular tools for public health and health care, as expansion of this tool can be used for several other HAI agents or applications.

Summary

Klebsiella pneumoniae colonization is a significant risk factor for infection in ICU, with approximately half of K. pneumoniae infections resulting from patients' own microbiota. Screening for colonization on admission could limit risk of infection in the colonized patient and others.

### A genomic surveillance framework and genotyping tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae and its related species complex [^112RvcEB]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) healthcare-associated infections, neonatal sepsis and community-acquired liver abscess, and is associated with chronic intestinal diseases. Its diversity and complex population structure pose challenges for analysis and interpretation of K. pneumoniae genome data. Here we introduce Kleborate, a tool for analysing genomes of K. pneumoniae and its associated species complex, which consolidates interrogation of key features of proven clinical importance. Kleborate provides a framework to support genomic surveillance and epidemiology in research, clinical and public health settings. To demonstrate its utility we apply Kleborate to analyse publicly available Klebsiella genomes, including clinical isolates from a pan-European study of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella, highlighting global trends in AMR and virulence as examples of what could be achieved by applying this genomic framework within more systematic genomic surveillance efforts. We also demonstrate the application of Kleborate to detect and type K. pneumoniae from gut metagenomes.

### Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae-clinical and molecular perspectives [^112BZz5B]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) has emerged as a concerning global pathogen. hvKp is more virulent than classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and capable of causing community-acquired infections, often in healthy individuals. hvKp is carried in the gastrointestinal tract, which contributes to its spread in the community and healthcare settings. First recognized in Asia, hvKp arose as a leading cause of pyogenic liver abscesses. In the decades since, hvKp has spread globally and causes a variety of infections. In addition to liver abscesses, hvKp is distinct from cKp in its ability to metastasize to distant sites, including most commonly the eye, lung and central nervous system (CNS). hvKp has also been implicated in primary extrahepatic infections including bacteremia, pneumonia and soft tissue infections. The genetic determinants of hypervirulence are often found on large virulence plasmids as well as chromosomal mobile genetic elements which can be used as biomarkers to distinguish hvKp from cKp clinical isolates. These distinct virulence determinants of hvKp include up to four siderophore systems for iron acquisition, increased capsule production, K1 and K2 capsule types, and the colibactin toxin. Additionally, hvKp strains demonstrate hypermucoviscosity, a phenotypic description of hvKp in laboratory conditions that has become a distinguishing feature of many hypervirulent isolates. Alarmingly, multidrug-resistant hypervirulent strains have emerged, creating a new challenge in combating this already dangerous pathogen.

### Within-host genetic diversity of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales in long-term colonized patients [^115RhsAG]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) are considered a critical threat by public health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Infections with ESBL-PE are associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and higher health-care costs. Despite this recognition of the immediate impact on human health, important aspects regarding the molecular epidemiology of ESBL-PE remain largely under investigated. In particular, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the potential of a particular strain to persist in a host over long time periods, the number of mutational events occurring within a host during colonization, and the genetic diversity of colonizing and infecting isolates within an individual patient and over time. Such knowledge is critical for a deeper understanding of the ESBL-PE epidemiology requiring data on reservoirs and transmission chains, their sustainability and thus their potential to persist over time. Further, investigation of bacterial in-host mutation events may provide important knowledge on the host-pathogen interactions required to establish successful colonization and subsequently infection. So far, ESBL-PE colonization has been mainly studied in presumably "healthy" returning travelers or patients with limited follow-up periods usually not longer than 24 months –. In addition, these studies mostly lack detailed whole-genome analyses.

At our institution, patients colonized with ESBL-PE are routinely screened at different body sites upon each admission and at least one ESBL-PE isolate recovered by routine clinical sampling is systematically collected. In this work, we investigate the within-host genetic diversity of colonizing and infecting ESBL- Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex and ESBL- Escherichia coli isolates and their plasmids by sequencing these isolates, collected over a 10-year period from different screening and clinical samples.

### Clonal background and routes of plasmid transmission underlie antimicrobial resistance features of bloodstream Klebsiella pneumoniae [^113aoYvs]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The burden of K. pneumoniae infections in hospitals is compounded by antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which greatly limits available treatment options and increases mortality rates especially for patients infected with invasive strains. Some K. pneumoniae clones have become increasingly resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents and are designated as multidrug or extensively drug resistant. Bacteria that harbor carbapenemases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are particularly notable because they render many beta-lactams ineffective. The World Health Organization recognizes third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including K. pneumoniae, as critical threats and for which new antibiotics are urgently needed. Mortality rates of patients with bloodstream infections due to resistant K. pneumoniae are distressingly high, ranging from 17 to 34% for patients with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae – and up to 42% for patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae have been reported in several hospital outbreaks – and their increasing prevalence may be linked to the overuse of expanded spectrum cephalosporins in healthcare settings. A systematic analysis of combined literature reviews, hospital systems, laboratory data, and surveillance systems spanning 204 countries and territories reported over 50,000 deaths in 2019 alone that were attributed to third-generation cephalosporin resistance in K. pneumoniae. Forecasting models suggest that if current trends in antimicrobial use continue, over half of invasive K. pneumoniae will become resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems by 2030. Despite the increasing threat of resistant K. pneumoniae and the constantly growing suite of high-risk clones, our understanding of the underlying bacterial and genetic features that promote AMR in bloodstream infections and subsequent spread within the hospital setting remains incomplete.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^116sHs8z]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is among the most common gram-negative bacteria encountered by physicians worldwide. It is a common hospital-acquired pathogen, causing urinary tract infections, nosocomial pneumonia, and intraabdominal infections. K. pneumoniae is also a potential community-acquired pathogen. In this international collaborative study, we evaluated geographic differences and trends in three prominent presentations of community-acquired Klebsiella infection.

First, K. pneumoniae has been a recognized pulmonary pathogen since its discovery > 100 years ago. The classic clinical presentation is dramatic: toxic presentation with sudden onset, high fever, and hemoptysis (currant jelly sputum). Chest radiographic abnormalities such as bulging interlobar fissure and cavitary abscesses are prominent. However, the incidence of community-acquired Klebsiella pneumonia has apparently declined in the United States. In studies from the 1920s to the 1960s, K. pneumoniae was considered an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia; however, in the last decade K. pneumoniae accounted for < 1% of cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization in North America.

Second, a striking clinical finding concerning a new manifestation of community-acquired K. pneumoniae infections has been documented. An unusual invasive presentation of K. pneumoniae infection, primary bacteremic liver abscess, has been described by numerous investigators in Asia; > 900 patients with Klebsiella liver abscess have been reported from Taiwan in the last 10 years. In addition, case reports and small series from Korea, Singapore, Japan, India, and Thailand have been published. The Taiwanese patients with K. pneumoniae liver abscess have no history of hepatobiliary disease. Seventy percent of such patients have diabetes mellitus; 11% to 12% of the reported patients with Klebsiella liver abscess have other septic metastatic lesions, including pulmonary emboli or abscess, brain abscess, pyogenic meningitis, endophthalmitis, prostatic abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or psoas abscess.

### Characteristics of healthcare-associated and community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in Taiwan [^113xv8iC]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Klebsiella pneumoniae is the major cause of community-onset pyogenic infections in Taiwan. We investigated the clinical features and outcomes of community-acquired (CA) and healthcare-associated (HCA) infections among community-onset K. pneumoniae bacteremia.

Methods

Adult patients with community-onset monomicrobial K. pneumoniae bacteremia were analysed retrospectively at a medical centre in Taiwan over a 4-year period. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients from the CA and HCA groups and identified the risk factors for infection-related mortality.

Results

In a total of 372 patients, HCA infections were observed in 44%. The HCA group had higher Charlson score, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, version II (APACHE II) score, frequency of malignancy, rates of respiratory tract infection and bacteremia from unknown sources, and higher mortality than the CA group. Diabetes and liver abscess were predominant in the CA group. Whereas old age, APACHE II score > 15, malignancy, liver cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, respiratory tract infection, skin and soft tissue infection, and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy were predictors for mortality, HCA bacteremia was not.

Conclusions

HCA bacteremia showed different characteristics and higher mortality than CA bacteremia, but HCA infection was not an independent risk factor for mortality.

### Clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia developing secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection [^112atiWL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Although many studies have focused on KP-BSI, there are some limitations, which are as follows: (1) Many studies have demonstrated that several comorbidities are risk factors for KP-bacteremia, including diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disease, and biliary tract disease. However, these risk factors were inconsistent, possibly because of different primary infections, such as KP-caused liver abscess, urinary tract infection or biliary tract infection/intraperitoneal sources. At present, the risk factors for KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI remain unclear. (2) Some studies have suggested that pneumonia as a primary infection source might be an important prognostic factor for crude 28-day mortality of KP-BSI. However, these studies focused primarily on the prognosis of secondary KP-BSI but less on the direct comparison of the prognoses between primary KP pneumonia alone and KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI. (3) Although a recent single-center study investigated the independent risk factors for developing secondary KP-BSI from underlying pneumonia, the study only included patients infected with carbapenem-resistant KP (CRKP) bacteria. In addition, the study recruited very specific ICU patients and had a relatively small sample size (n = 76). Therefore, the clinical features of KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI are still largely unknown.

Given the poor prognosis of KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI and the fact that the risk factors for KP- pneumonia to develop secondary KP-BSI have not been investigated, it is urgent and critical to identify some preventable factors to inhibit the development of secondary KP-BSI in patients with KP alone. Thus, we performed this study to analyze the characteristics, risk factors and prognoses of patients with KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI compared with patients who had KP-pneumonia alone.

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is emerging as a significant healthcare-associated pathogen. Clinical cultures detect only a fraction of the colonized population, and patients with asymptomatic colonization are at risk of invasive infection. Additional study of the impact of detection of asymptomatic colonization on subsequent infection and transmission is needed.

### COVID-19 and fatal sepsis caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, Japan, 2020 [^113Z1AXR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

For a minority of patients, bacterial and fungal co-infections can complicate the course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Co-infection can contribute to the poor prognosis for patients with COVID-19, especially for high-risk populations such as elderly patients. Indeed, a large retrospective multicenter study reported that for half of the patients who died of COVID-19, secondary bacterial co-infection developed during hospitalization. In a retrospective study in China, the second most common respiratory pathogen detected from patients with COVID-19 was Klebsiella pneumoniae, following only Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) was originally recognized as a pathogen that causes severe community-acquired infections among relatively healthy persons. hvKp isolates carry virulence plasmids that harbor cardinal virulence genes, and with higher frequency than classical K. pneumoniae they cause disseminated infections involving liver, lungs, central nervous system, and eyes. Although hvKp infections have been reported mainly from hvKp-endemic areas such as eastern Asia, in recent years, sporadic cases have been increasingly reported worldwide. Furthermore, recent studies from hvKp-endemic areas demonstrated that hvKp is often associated with healthcare and hospitalization for elderly and debilitated populations. A multicenter study in Japan showed that more than half of bloodstream infections caused by hvKp occurred as healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired infections.

Therefore, hvKp infections may have the potential for seriously complicating the course of COVID-19, especially in hvKp-endemic areas. We describe a fatal case of superimposed hvKp infection in an elderly woman with COVID-19 in Japan.

### Genomically defined hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae contributed to early-onset increased mortality [^115bY5QT]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Patients in the hvKp-p cohort were numerically more likely to acquire infection in the ambulatory setting compared to the cKp-p cohort (24.4% vs 17.7%; P = 0.065), but this difference was not statistically significant. Surprisingly, the majority of infections in the hvKp-p cohort were either HAI or HCAI (45.7% and 29.9%), and as expected the majority of infections in the cKp-p cohort were also either HAI or HCAI (60.3% and 22.1%); HAI infections were significantly more common in cKp-p cohort (P = 0.002) and HCAI infections were significantly more common in hvKp-p cohort (P = 0.046). However, the hvKp-p cohort was more likely to acquire infections outside of the hospital (CAI and HCAI) (54.3% vs 39.8%, P = 0.002). In the hvKp-p cohort, pneumonia was the most common infection, which accounted for 64.5% (20/31) in CAI, 67.2% (39/58) in HAI, and 57.9% (22/38) in HCAI respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Pneumonia was also significantly more common than in the cKp-p cohort (49.9%, P = 0.003). By contrast, urinary tract infection was significantly more common in the cKp-p cohort (16.7% vs 7.1%; P = 0.005) (Table 1).

Interestingly, the hvKp-p cohort had a significantly lower ICU admission rate than cKp-p cohort (19.7% vs 30.4%; P = 0.012), where most of the ICU-admitted hvKp-p cohort presented with respiratory tract infection (Supplementary Fig. 1C). In addition, patients with respiratory tract infections also exhibited the highest mortality rate (Supplementary Fig. 1D). However, in the unmatched comparison, no statistical differences were observed between the hvKp-p and cKp-p cohorts for 14, 28, and 90-day poor prognosis and mortality (Table 1).

### Combined comparative genomics and clinical modeling reveals plasmid-encoded genes are independently associated with Klebsiella infection [^113eaKmD]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Members of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex frequently colonize the gut and colonization is associated with subsequent infection. To identify genes associated with progression from colonization to infection, we undertook a case-control comparative genomics study. Concordant cases (N = 85), where colonizing and invasive isolates were identical strain types, were matched to asymptomatically colonizing controls (N = 160). Thirty-seven genes are associated with infection, 27 of which remain significant following adjustment for patient variables and bacterial phylogeny. Infection-associated genes are not previously characterized virulence factors, but instead a diverse group of stress resistance, regulatory and antibiotic resistance genes, despite careful adjustment for antibiotic exposure. Many genes are plasmid borne, and for some, the relationship with infection is mediated by gut dominance. Five genes were validated in a geographically-independent cohort of colonized patients. This study identifies several genes reproducibly associated with progression to infection in patients colonized by diverse Klebsiella.

### Patient-to-patient transmission is important in extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae acquisition [^1156H5sM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

We performed a prospective cohort study to quantify the number of cases of patient-to-patient transmission of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella species on perianal surveillance culture. Among 27 patients who acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, 14 had infections (52%) that were due to patient-to-patient transmission, and 6 (22%) had a subsequent positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamase clinical culture results.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^115oJK34]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Prevention

A fundamentally important challenge in clinical medicine is how to control or prevent antibiotic resistance. Several strategies may be beneficial.

Rapid diagnostics

Rapid treatment of sepsis is associated with decreased mortality in patients with serious infections, but diagnosis of sepsis can be difficult and delayed in critically ill patients. Hence broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics are often started before microbiology results are available, resulting in some patients receiving unnecessary antibiotic treatment. More rapid, culture-independent identification methods are being developed, which, in addition to providing quicker identification of the pathogen causing an infection, can also rapidly identify the susceptibility patterns of the organism. The benefits of such information are twofold: if the organism possesses resistance mechanisms, appropriate therapy based on susceptibilities can be more quickly accomplished; and, based on susceptibility information, the duration of broad-spectrum therapy may be limited. By enabling earlier, accurate diagnosis of infection and of the causative microorganism(s), these tests may help optimize antibiotic prescriptions, and in so doing potentially reduce selection pressure and thus resistance.

Colonization prevention

Embracing the principle that colonization is the antecedent event leading to clinical infection, the clinician is poised to incorporate an important infection prevention opportunity into clinical practice. In an observational cohort study in two ICUs with endemic carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, patients were screened with perineal swabs at admission and twice-weekly thereafter. Patients colonized with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae had a 1.8 times greater hazard of dying in the ICU than noncolonized patients, primarily because of an increased length of stay. In a study designed to prevent colonization and infection by KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae in four long-term acute-care hospitals with high endemic KPC prevalence, a bundled intervention was tested using a stepped-wedge design. Patients were screened for rectal KPC colonization on admission and every other week. Contact isolation and geographic separation of KPC-positive patients was implemented in ward cohorts or single rooms. All patients were bathed daily with chlorhexidine gluconate. Healthcare workers were educated, and their adherence was monitored. During the intervention period of the study, the incidence rate of KPC colonization fell from 4 to 2 acquisitions per 100 patient-weeks (p = 0.004 for linear decline). Compared with the preintervention period, there were decreases in the isolation of KPC in any clinical culture, KPC bacteremia, and all-cause bacteremia. The demonstration that prevention of colonization can have significant clinical benefits in the era of carbapenemase infections has significant implications for ICU and non-ICU settings.

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: a randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; p = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

### Genomic dissection of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in hospital patients reveals insights into an opportunistic pathogen [^116zTodt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are common throughout the world, and in industrialised countries the burden of HAIs exceeds that of all other communicable diseases combined. The major causative agents are opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which are generally viewed as commensals but can take advantage of the weakened immune system and altered microbiome of hospitalized patients to cause disease –. Particularly concerning are HAIs caused by Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is intrinsically resistant to ampicillin and increasingly displays acquired resistance to multiple additional drugs (multidrug resistance, MDR). Of particular concern, this organism readily acquires extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or carbapenemase genes that confer resistance to third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems, respectively, leaving very limited options for antimicrobial therapy. K. pneumoniae is amongst the leading causes of HAIs in hospitals globally, including urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia, wound infections and sepsis. Recent studies confirm it is also a leading cause of neonatal sepsis in Africaand Asia. K. pneumoniae is a clear opportunist, colonizing the human gut, nasopharynx and skin at high frequency. K. pneumoniae is the 'K' in the ESKAPE pathogens, the group of opportunistic pathogens that together account for the majority of clinically significant MDR HAIs. ESBL and carbapenemase-producing (CP) K. pneumoniae combined make up the fastest-growing cause of drug-resistant infections in European hospitals.

### Clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia developing secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection [^112yywmB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI is relatively common in patients with KP pneumonia. Risk factors, including male sex, immunosuppression, APACHE II score higher than 21, serum PCT above 1.8 ng/ml, ICU stay of more than 2.5 days before pneumonia onset, mechanical ventilation, ESBL-positive KP, and inappropriate antibacterial therapy, are independent for KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI. Once patients with KP pneumonia develop secondary KP-BSI, they have a worse prognosis. Taken together, how to rapidly identify and prevent the development of secondary KP-BSI from KP pneumonia alone in a timely manner is critical and merits further investigation.

### Gastrointestinal carriage is a major reservoir of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in intensive care patients [^1138sqYg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We estimated a 5.9% CA rate for culture-positive GI carriage of K. pneumoniae, similar to the 3.9% estimated among healthy individuals in the Human Microbiome Project based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of stool samples. HA carriage among ICU patients was estimated to be much higher at 19%, with 12% of patients converting from culture-negative at baseline to culture-positive on follow-up. This likely reflects acquisition of bacteria in the hospital (transmission of strains was directly observed in 5% of cases) and/or selection for growth of pre-existing K. pneumoniae in the GI microbiome during hospitalization (MDR rate was 18% in HA baseline carriage and 15% at follow-up, but MDR was not detected in CA baseline carriage). The HA rate estimated here is similar to the culture-positive GI carriage rates estimated in other hospital studies.

Our data demonstrate that K. pneumoniae is a fairly common component of the human GI microbiome (5.9%) and of clinical significance in the ICU setting, as: (i) K. pneumoniae carriage on admission to ICU was significantly associated with subsequent K. pneumoniae infection (OR = 6.9, P = 0.0003), consistent with the results reported from the 1970s Denver study (OR = 4.0, P = 0.0009) and the 2016 Michigan study (OR = 4.1, P = 0.00002); and (ii) the WGS data confirmed a direct link between colonizing and infecting strains in 13 patients (80% of those with paired isolates available for testing), also consistent with the Michigan study. We found strong evidence that a large proportion of ICU K. pneumoniae infections are attributable to patients' own GI microbiota: (i) of all 49 K. pneumoniae infections diagnosed in ICU patients during the study period, 49% were associated with K. pneumoniae lineages unique to the patient; and (ii) of the 27 K. pneumoniae infections diagnosed in ICU patients from whom screening swabs were obtained, 48% occurred in patients who tested positive for prior GI colonization with K. pneumoniae. In contrast, only 12% of infections showed evidence of resulting from intra-hospital transmission in this setting. This suggests that although measures to reduce cross-contamination between patients are necessary, they are not sufficient to eliminate K. pneumoniae infections in hospitalized patients, and measures to minimize the risk of infection with the patients' own microbiome deserves significant attention.

### Risk factors, temporal dependence, and seasonality of human extended-spectrum β-lactamases-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae colonization in Malawi: a longitudinal model-based approach [^113TB96F]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2015, the World Health Organization declared antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a priority public health threat. The latest estimates showed that 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial AMR in 2019. The attributable death rate was highest in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), where leading pathogens included Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli; however, large gaps in data availability were noted. Of particular note has been the rapid emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) in gram-negative bacteria. Studies have shown that the prevalence of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) in sSA is high, with prevalence varying between 5% and 84%, with a relationship to setting. A separate 2019 review found a median prevalence of resistance of 14.3% in E. coli and 46.7% in Klebsiella spp. in Eastern Africa. Learning more about asymptomatic colonization, a key step before infection in vulnerable patient groups, is therefore crucial to prevent transmission, and consequently, reduce drug-resistant infections.

Before 2016, no studies described risk factors for colonization among healthy individuals in the community in sSA. Antibiotic use, age, hospital admission, and income have since been identified in community-based studies. However, most of them focused on a specific subset of the community; therefore, we cannot be confident these risk factors are generalizable across the population. Moreover, although it is believed that inadequacies in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and associated behaviors play an important role in transmission of AMR bacteria, risk factors related to WASH in this context are not well described.

To be able to reduce transmission of, and colonization by, AMR enteric bacteria in sSA, we need to explore the dynamics of colonization to tailor appropriate interventions; for example, the role of seasonality. A first step in understanding the temporal dynamics of within-household transmission is to determine how long a household is at risk of colonization once one member has been colonized. This will help inform the design of public health policies that interrupt transmission of AMR bacteria.

Here, we describe an analysis of an 18-month longitudinal cohort study using microbiological, household, and WASH surveys, where WASH refers to containment of human and animal feces, hygiene, and food hygiene. We fit a serially correlated generalized linear mixed model, exploring household, individual, and WASH risk factors for ESBL-E colonization in settings with different degrees of urbanization in Malawi.

### Bloodstream infections: mechanisms of pathogenesis and opportunities for intervention [^113L7ueC]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are common in hospitals, often life-threatening and increasing in prevalence. Microorganisms in the blood are usually rapidly cleared by the immune system and filtering organs but, in some cases, they can cause an acute infection and trigger sepsis, a systemic response to infection that leads to circulatory collapse, multiorgan dysfunction and death. Most BSIs are caused by bacteria, although fungi also contribute to a substantial portion of cases. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans are leading causes of BSIs, although their prevalence depends on patient demographics and geographical region. Each species is equipped with unique factors that aid in the colonization of initial sites and dissemination and survival in the blood, and these factors represent potential opportunities for interventions. As many pathogens become increasingly resistant to antimicrobials, new approaches to diagnose and treat BSIs at all stages of infection are urgently needed. In this Review, we explore the prevalence of major BSI pathogens, prominent mechanisms of BSI pathogenesis, opportunities for prevention and diagnosis, and treatment options.

### Antimicrobial resistance as risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^114CkLTA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

We investigated links between antimicrobial resistance in community-onset bacteremia and 1-year bacteremia recurrence by using the clinical data warehouse of Europe's largest university hospital group in France. We included adult patients hospitalized with an incident community-onset Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. bacteremia during 2017–2019. We assessed risk factors of 1-year recurrence using Fine-Gray regression models. Of the 3,617 patients included, 291 (8.0%) had > 1 recurrence episode. Third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)-resistance was significantly associated with increased recurrence risk after incident Klebsiella spp. (hazard ratio 3.91 [95% CI 2.32–6.59]) or E. coli (hazard ratio 2.35 [95% CI 1.50–3.68]) bacteremia. Methicillin resistance in S. aureus bacteremia had no effect on recurrence risk. Although several underlying conditions and infection sources increased recurrence risk, 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. was associated with the greatest increase. These results demonstrate a new facet to illness induced by 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. and E. coli in the community setting.

### Epidemic of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Europe is driven by nosocomial spread [^1114jHPE]. Nature Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Public health interventions to control the current epidemic of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae rely on a comprehensive understanding of its emergence and spread over a wide range of geographical scales. We analysed the genome sequences and epidemiological data of > 1,700 K. pneumoniae samples isolated from patients in 244 hospitals in 32 countries during the European Survey of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae. We demonstrate that carbapenemase acquisition is the main cause of carbapenem resistance and that it occurred across diverse phylogenetic backgrounds. However, 477 of 682 (69.9%) carbapenemase-positive isolates are concentrated in four clonal lineages, sequence types 11, 15, 101, 258/512 and their derivatives. Combined analysis of the genetic and geographic distances between isolates with different β-lactam resistance determinants suggests that the propensity of K. pneumoniae to spread in hospital environments correlates with the degree of resistance and that carbapenemase-positive isolates have the highest transmissibility. Indeed, we found that over half of the hospitals that contributed carbapenemase-positive isolates probably experienced within-hospital transmission, and interhospital spread is far more frequent within, rather than between, countries. Finally, we propose a value of 21 for the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms that optimizes the discrimination of hospital clusters and detail the international spread of the successful epidemic lineage, ST258/512.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae employs a type VI secretion system to overcome microbiota-mediated colonization resistance [^114W9iZy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Microbial species must compete for space and nutrients to persist in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and our understanding of the complex pathobiont-microbiota interactions is far from complete. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a problematic, often drug-resistant nosocomial pathogen, can colonize the GI tract asymptomatically, serving as an infection reservoir. To provide insight on how K. pneumoniae interacts with the resident gut microbiome, we conduct a transposon mutagenesis screen using a murine model of GI colonization with an intact microbiota. Among the genes identified were those encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS), which mediates contact-dependent killing of gram-negative bacteria. From several approaches, we demonstrate that the T6SS is critical for K. pneumoniae gut colonization. Metagenomics and in vitro killing assays reveal that K. pneumoniae reduces Betaproteobacteria species in a T6SS-dependent manner, thus identifying specific species targeted by K. pneumoniae. We further show that T6SS gene expression is controlled by several transcriptional regulators and that expression only occurs in vitro under conditions that mimic the gut environment. By enabling K. pneumoniae to thrive in the gut, the T6SS indirectly contributes to the pathogenic potential of this organism. These observations advance our molecular understanding of how K. pneumoniae successfully colonizes the GI tract.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: a review of epidemiological and clinical aspects [^116dGUM5]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The indiscriminate use of antibiotics associated with other situations has revealed a considerable increase in outbreaks caused by microorganisms resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among these is the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Areas Covered

This review provides an overview of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with emphasis on the epidemiological and clinical aspects.

Expert Opinion

The KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was first described in the US. Most cases were reported between 2007 and 2009. It is widespread in almost all continents. The presence of severe comorbidities, previous use of fluoroquinolones and broad-spectrum cephalosporin are independent factors for this type of infection. Besides the increasing number of resistant strains that greatly complicates the therapeutic management of patients, the clinical characteristics of infection make the diagnosis difficult, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. The spread of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae shows how we are prone to pandemics. Transport systems, the exchange of healthcare professionals, the transfer of patients between hospitals and, mainly, the lack of preventive measures such as hand washing are related to the spread of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in virtually all continents.

### Cohorting KPC + (KPC-Kp)-positive patients: a genomic exposéof cross-colonization hazards in a long-term acute-care hospital (LTACH) [^1164BcLk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cohorting patients who are colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) protects uncolonized patients from acquiring MDROs in healthcare settings. The potential for cross transmission within the cohort and the possibility of colonized patients acquiring secondary isolates with additional antibiotic resistance traits is often neglected. We searched for evidence of cross transmission of KPC+ Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) colonization among cohorted patients in a long-term acute-care hospital (LTACH), and we evaluated the impact of secondary acquisitions on resistance potential.

Design

Genomic epidemiological investigation.

Setting

A high-prevalence LTACH during a bundled intervention that included cohorting KPC-Kp-positive patients.

Methods

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and location data were analyzed to identify potential cases of cross transmission between cohorted patients.

Results

Secondary KPC-Kp isolates from 19 of 28 admission-positive patients were more closely related to another patient's isolate than to their own admission isolate. Of these 19 cases, 14 showed strong genomic evidence for cross transmission (< 10 single nucleotide variants or SNVs), and most of these patients occupied shared cohort floors (12 patients) or rooms (4 patients) at the same time. Of the 14 patients with strong genomic evidence of acquisition, 12 acquired antibiotic resistance genes not found in their primary isolates.

Conclusions

Acquisition of secondary KPC-Kp isolates carrying distinct antibiotic resistance genes was detected in nearly half of cohorted patients. These results highlight the importance of healthcare provider adherence to infection prevention protocols within cohort locations, and they indicate the need for future studies to assess whether multiple-strain acquisition increases risk of adverse patient outcomes.

### The colonization of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae: epidemiology, resistance mechanisms, and risk factors in patients admitted to intensive care units in China [^116FuaWg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has become a threat to public health, most notably as a superbug causing nosocomial infections. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at increased risk of hospital-acquired K pneumoniae infection, especially CRKP. This study was conducted to investigate the frequency of gastrointestinal and nasopharyngeal K pneumoniae colonization and its contribution to infections in ICU patients.

Methods

A 3-month prospective cohort study was performed in which 243 ICU patients were screened for intestinal and nasopharyngeal carriage of K pneumoniae at admission and once per week thereafter. The colonization and clinical infection isolates were analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing to identify CRKP and were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole-genome sequencing combined with epidemiological data to investigate the resistance mechanisms and assess the possible transmitted infection.

Results

Twenty-eight percent (68 of 243) of patients tested positive for carriage of K pneumoniae immediately upon admission to ICU, 54% (37 of 68) of which were nonduplicate CRKP isolates. Patients with carbapenem-susceptible K pneumoniae (CSKP) colonization at admission were more likely to acquire CRKP colonization during the ICU stay compared with patients without K pneumoniae colonization at admission. The incidence of subsequent CRKP infection in the baseline CSKP (32.3%, 10 of 31) and CRKP (45.9%, 17 of 37) carrier group was significantly higher than that of the baseline non-KP carrier group (8.6%, 15 of 175). The risk factors associated with acquired CRKP colonization during the ICU stay among negative CRKP colonization at admission included previous exposure to carbapenem, tigecycline or β-lactam/β-lactamases inhibitor, and invasive processes or surgical operations. Sixty-four percent (27 of 42) of patients with K pneumoniae infection were colonized by clonally related K pneumoniae strains according to enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-polymerase chain reaction analysis. ST11 (72%, 53 of 74) was the most predominant MLST type of clonally related CRKP isolate colonizing these patients, followed by ST15 (26%, 19 of 74).

Conclusions

The colonization of K pneumoniae may increase the incidence of corresponding K pneumoniae infection in critically ill patients in the ICU. High prevalence of ST11 CRKP (due to blaKPC-2) carriage and infection in ICU was observed.

### The interface between COVID-19 and bacterial healthcare-associated infections [^113FvCwA]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A wide range of bacterial infections occur in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, particularly in those with severe coronaviral disease. Some of these are community-acquired co-infections.

Objective

To review recent data that indicate the occurrence of hospital-onset bacterial infections, including with antibiotic-resistant isolates, in COVID-19 patients.

Sources

Using PubMed, the literature was searched using terms including: 'COVID-19'; 'SARS-CoV-2'; 'bacterial infection'; 'healthcare-associated infection'; 'antibiotic resistance'; 'antimicrobial resistance'; 'multi-drug resistance'; 'Streptococcus'; 'Staphylococcus'; 'Pseudomonas'; 'Escherichia'; 'Klebsiella'; 'Enterococcus'; 'Acinetobacter'; 'Haemophilus'; 'MRSA'; 'VRE'; 'ESBL'; 'NDM-CRE'; 'CR-Ab'; 'VRSA'; 'MDR'.

Content

There is a growing number of reports of bacterial infections acquired by patients with severe COVID-19 after hospital admission. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens found to cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in COVID-19 patients include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum β-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. COVID-19 has impacted bacterial HAIs in a number of ways with an increase in the incidence of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii reported at some hospital sites compared with before the pandemic. Recommended guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship in COVID-19 patient treatment are discussed regarding minimization of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Other studies have reported a decrease in methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci cases, which has been attributed to enhanced infection prevention and control practices introduced to minimize intra-hospital spread of COVID-19.

Implications

Poorer outcomes have been observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with an antibiotic-resistant infection. Although heightened IPC measures have been accompanied by a reduction in some HAIs at specific sites, in other situations, COVID-19 has been associated with an increase in bacterial HAI incidence. Further research is needed to define the cost-benefit relationship of maintaining COVID-19-related infection prevention and control protocols beyond the pandemic to reduce the burden of HAIs. In addition, the longer-term impact of high usage of certain broad-spectrum antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic requires evaluation.

### Spread of KPC-producing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: the importance of super-spreaders and rectal KPC concentration [^113rcc12]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae is a pathogen causing an epidemic of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in healthcare settings in developed countries. The spread is primarily by patient-to-patient transmission. Understanding the mode of spread is important for designing effective control measures. We studied CRE dissemination by quantifying environmental contamination from the vicinity of 34 carriers using selective contact plates. We examined rectal CRE concentrations and clinical characteristics and correlated these with environmental contamination. Eight (24%) carriers were non-spreaders: no CRE was detected in their vicinity. Faecal continence was the only independent predictor of being a non-spreader. Among the 26 spreaders, we identified a distinct group of six (18%) super-spreaders who accounted for 79% of environmental colonies detected. Super-spreaders were likely to have high rectal CRE concentrations and to have been admitted with respiratory disease. CRE spread to the environment follows the 20/80 rule: 20% of carriers are responsible for 80% of shedding and may play a central role in CRE transmission.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^114SBZvP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) in adults — antibiotic therapy is not suggested based on low-quality evidence and uncertain clinical benefit. "In patients with VAT, we suggest not providing antibiotic therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)". VAT definitions included "positive ETA culture (> 10⁶ CFU/mL)… and no radiographic evidence of nosocomial pneumonia". Evidence review "identified 3 randomized trials", but "the panel decided to exclude 2 of the trials" for indirectness; "the remaining randomized trial randomly assigned 58 patients to receive either intravenous antibiotics or no antibiotics for 8 days". In that trial, the antibiotic group had lower "ICU mortality (18% vs 47%; OR, 0.24, 95% CI, 0.07–.88)", less "subsequent VAP (13% vs 47%; OR, 0.17, 95% CI, .04–.70)", and more "mechanical ventilation–free days (median 12 vs 2 days; P < .001), but no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation or length of ICU stay". Observational data showed antibiotics were associated with shorter ventilation duration "(−3.5 days; 95% CI −6.88 to −0.19 days)" without significant differences in mortality or ICU stay; isolates commonly included "Acinetobacter (27%), Klebsiella (5%), and MRSA (32%)", with "MDR organisms" in "61%" and polymicrobial infections in "31%". Overall, "the evidence suggests that antibiotic therapy for VAT may shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation; however, it is uncertain whether it improves other clinical outcomes", and "the… quality of evidence… was low".

### Household transmission of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^114GJeGg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Despite limited contact, the patient probably acquired carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae from his wife, who was a documented carrier of this organism. Because his early urine cultures (taken after his wife was discharged from hospital) were sterile, we can assume that the transmission of the organism occurred at their home. We cannot rule out that the strain was transferred by an intermediary, such as the couple's son. It is unlikely that the organism was acquired at the private hospitals from which no case of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae was reported (in Israel reporting carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates to health authorities is mandatory). Also, the patient had 2 negative urine cultures.

Carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae is a recent addition to the pool of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. Most publications on this organism have focused on issues of structural and molecular epidemiology. Little is known regarding clinical characteristics and importance of infection with this organism. Until now, the strain has been recovered only from hospitalized patients with a longer hospital stay, those given multiple antimicrobial drug courses, and those mechanically ventilated. The strain can colonize the urinary, intestinal, and respiratory tracts, as well as wounds; bloodstream infection is associated with higher death rates than infection at other sites. Hand carriage is probably the biggest factor in transmission of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers, and there is little evidence to suggest that carriers of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae would be different. Environmental contamination plays a limited role in transmission of the organism. Caregivers should be aware that multidrug-resistant organisms of nosocomial origin can be transmitted in the community. Acquisition of such strains is probably of negligible importance in an otherwise healthy person. However, consequences may be different if the recipient of the strain is a debilitated patient.

### Gastrointestinal carriage is a major reservoir of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in intensive care patients [^113phYkt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The main limitations of the study arise from the swabbing procedure to identify K. pneumoniae colonization on admission. Efforts were made to collect swabs as soon as possible following admission; however, delays due to obtaining consent and avoiding patient care disruption meant that it was often not possible to obtain screening swabs on the day of admission. Notably, similar culture-positive rates were observed for swabs collected on day 0, 1, or 2 of admission (Supplementary Table 2), so it is unlikely that this had a significant impact on CA colonization results. Although the recruitment rate was low (33%) during the consent-based recruitment period, the demographic features and K. pneumoniae colonization rate in this group were not significantly different from those recruited under the universal surveillance protocol (75% recruitment; Supplementary Figure 1); hence, there is no evidence of significant selection bias. We used rectal swab culture to determine K. pneumoniae GI colonization status; however, although this approach is standard for pathogen carriage screening, its sensitivity to detect K. pneumoniae is not well characterized and likely depends on the K. pneumoniae strain, GI microbiome composition, and recent antimicrobial exposures. There is likely a significant false negative rate. Hence our study probably underestimates the rate of colonization in the community and the contribution of colonisation to subsequent infection. Additionally, as only 1 isolate was stored from each K. pneumoniae positive infection or carriage specimen, it is possible that the proportion of matching infection/carriage pairs underestimates the contribution of carriage to infection and misses some instances of transmission.

Our conclusion that the GI microbiome is a source of K. pneumoniae infections in ICU patients echoes similar findings that colonizing strains of S. aureus, A. baumannii, Enterococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae are a common source of HA infections. Routine screening for nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus or gut carriage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus or ESBL/CP Enterobacteriaceae has been introduced in various hospital settings. A recent study of CP K. pneumoniae in Israel suggested screening and isolation of carriers could help end current outbreaks and prevent future ones. A similar study introduced screening for ESBL K. pneumoniae in order to limit and prevent current and future outbreaks. Although those studies focus on screening for CP or ESBL K. pneumoniae, our results indicate that routine screening for general K. pneumoniae carriage in the ICU could also be a valuable tool. Foreknowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of K. pneumoniae, as well as other opportunistic pathogens resident in the microbiome, could guide the choice of prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial treatment.

### Decolonization and pathogen reduction approaches to prevent antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections [^113ouGEM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite its success, topical decolonization is not simple to implement, but pathogen reduction of the gastrointestinal tract can be even more challenging. One relatively well characterized method is selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), practiced under guidelines in critically ill patients in the Netherlands. Application of SDD antibacterial suspensions along with short courses of intravenous third-generation cephalosporin has been associated with improved patient outcomes in critically ill hospital patients in the Netherlands, where AMR prevalence is relatively low. However, SDD effectiveness in settings of moderate to high AMR remains to be verified. The SDD strategy was shown effective at considerably reducing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a cohort of colonized patients with severe underlying conditions, suggesting that a pathogen reduction approach might be suitable for critically ill patients colonized with K. pneumoniae. However, the combination of nonabsorbable and intravenous prophylactic antimicrobial drugs during SDD raises concerns for long-term effects on selecting for AMR in patients' gut microbiota once SDD is discontinued. SDD of critically ill patients colonized with MDR-GNB has been most extensively explored in Europe, including a multiyear trial in Spain that reported marked reduction of MDR-GNB infections after SDD treatment in an ICU with high AR prevalence. Nevertheless, the European Committee of Infection Control has withheld recommendations for decolonization or pathogen reduction with SDD, citing major limitations in study heterogeneity, colonization pressure, and SDD agents.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^113QCiEv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Results

Two hundred two (44.4%) of 455 episodes of K. pneumoniae bacteremia during the study period were community-acquired cases. The percentage of cases of K. pneumoniae bacteremia that were community acquired in each study country differed strikingly: 96 (68%) of 142 in Taiwan, 25 (43%) of 68 in the United States, 28 (39%) of 71 in Australia, 40 (34%) of 116 in South Africa, 6 (22%) of 27 in Europe, and 7 (17%) of 41 in Argentina. K. pneumoniae bacteremia in Taiwan was significantly more likely to be community acquired than was bacteremia in the other countries combined (68% vs. 36%, p = 0.0001).

The characteristics of patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremia from Taiwan, South Africa, and the rest of the world were compared (Table 1). The source of bacteremia in community-acquired cases was geographically distinctive (Table 2). Pneumonia was the most common infection worldwide, accounting for 57 (28%) of 202 cases. However, 53 (93%) of 57 of all cases of community-acquired K. pneumoniae pneumonia occurred in Taiwan and South Africa.

### Incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States: a systematic literature review [^115Z7Ysg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND Despite a reported worldwide increase, the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States is unknown. Understanding the incidence and trends of ESBL infections will aid in directing research and prevention efforts. OBJECTIVE To perform a literature review to identify the incidence of ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States. DESIGN Systematic literature review. METHODS MEDLINE via Ovid, CINAHL, Cochrane library, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for multicenter (≥ 2 sites), US studies published between 2000 and 2015 that evaluated the incidence of ESBL-E. coli or ESBL-Klebsiella infections. We excluded studies that examined resistance rates alone or did not have a denominator that included uninfected patients such as patient days, device days, number of admissions, or number of discharges. Additionally, articles that were not written in English, contained duplicated data, or pertained to ESBL organisms from food, animals, or the environment were excluded. RESULTS Among 51,419 studies examined, 9 were included for review. Incidence rates differed by patient population, time, and ESBL definition and ranged from 0 infections per 100,000 patient days to 16.64 infections per 10,000 discharges and incidence rates increased over time from 1997 to 2011. Rates were slightly higher for ESBL-Klebsiella infections than for ESBL-E. coli infections. CONCLUSION The incidence of ESBL-E. coli and ESBL-Klebsiella infections in the United States has increased, with slightly higher rates of ESBL-Klebsiella infections. Appropriate estimates of ESBL infections when coupled with other mechanisms of resistance will allow for the appropriate targeting of resources toward research, drug discovery, antimicrobial stewardship, and infection prevention.

### Gastrointestinal colonization by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae following hospital discharge: duration of carriage and risk factors for persistent carriage [^114o15gf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

The natural history of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC KP) carriage is unknown. We aimed to examine the duration of KPC KP carriage following hospital discharge and to study the risk factors for persistent carriage. A cohort of 125 KPC KP carriers was followed monthly for between 3 and 6 months after discharge from an acute-care hospital. Rectal swabs and data were collected at baseline and at each visit. KPC KP was detected by culture and direct blaKPC PCR. Acquisition time was regarded as the earliest date of KPC KP isolation. Resolution of carriage was defined as a negative KPC KP test in at least two consecutive samples. Analyses were separated for recent (< 4 months) (REC, 75 patients) and remote (≥ 4 months) (REM, 50 patients) acquisition groups. Risk factors for persistent carriage were examined by survival analyses for the REC group and by prevalence methods for the REM group. The mean age of patients was 67.5 years and 49.6% were male. Forty-six (61%) patients in the REC group and 14 (28%) in the REM group were persistent carriers (p < 0.001). A significant risk factor for persistent carriage identified in both the REC and REM groups was the presence of any catheter (p < 0.05). Unique risk factor groups included long-term care facility (LTCF) residence (p < 0.01) and a low functional status as measured by the Barthel's index (p < 0.05) in the REC group and high Charlson's score in the REM group (p < 0.05). Out of the entire 100 patients who had at least one negative sample, only 65 remained negative on subsequent cultures. In conclusion, persistent carriage of KPC KP is associated with catheter use and a low functional status; it is more common in patients with recent acquisition and is related to LTCF stay. A single negative KPC KP test is insufficient to exclude persistent carriage.

### Clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia developing secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection [^114ABGsw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Compared to KP pneumonia alone, KP pneumonia/KP BSI was more frequently caused by ESBL-positive KP and had a higher frequency of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy. Over the past few decades, overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to an increase in antibiotic resistance, which has become a major public health problem. The World Health Organization (in 2017) has placed ESBL-positive KP on the list of the most threatening superbugs along with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The antimicrobial resistance of KP is mainly related to ESBL production. Previous findings found that indiscriminate antibiotic application upregulates ESBL expression, which plays a hydrolytic role in β-lactam antibiotic resistance. In the current study, only 45.2% of the patients (61/135) with KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI received effective empiric therapy, while early and appropriate antimicrobial treatment is critical to reduce mortality in patients with bacteremia. Taken together, these risk factors are very instructive to shed light on how to distinguish and prevent KP pneumonia from KP pneumonia/KP BSI.

Patients with KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI have worse outcomes, as evidenced by a higher incidence of septic shock, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer lengths of ICU stay and total hospital stay. The overall in-hospital crude mortality rate was higher once KP pneumonia progressed to KP pneumonia/KP BSI. Our study showed that underlying host conditions influence the outcome, which was evidenced by the fact that patients with KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI are more likely to have chronic underlying diseases and other indicators of severe conditions, such as increased APACHE II and SOFA scores. In addition, a worse outcome was also found to have a strong association with the severity of pneumonia infection in this study, particularly with patients requiring mechanical ventilation, which is consistent with Baruah et al.'s study. The relevant finding in our study was that the infections in patients with KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI were more often caused by resistant bacteria and that these patients had a higher frequency of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy, while antibiotic resistance was also associated with high rates of mortality in clinical patients. Accordingly, patients with KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI seem to have a more severe illness and a worse prognosis.

### Microbiota-mediated protection against antibiotic-resistant pathogens [^1123aXBR]. Genes and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Colonization by the microbiota provides one of our most effective barriers against infection by pathogenic microbes. The microbiota protects against infection by priming immune defenses, by metabolic exclusion of pathogens from their preferred niches, and through direct antimicrobial antagonism. Disruption of the microbiota, especially by antibiotics, is a major risk factor for bacterial pathogen colonization. Restoration of the microbiota through microbiota transplantation has been shown to be an effective way to reduce pathogen burden in the intestine but comes with a number of drawbacks, including the possibility of transferring other pathogens into the host, lack of standardization, and potential disruption to host metabolism. More refined methods to exploit the power of the microbiota would allow us to utilize its protective power without the drawbacks of fecal microbiota transplantation. To achieve this requires detailed understanding of which members of the microbiota protect against specific pathogens and the mechanistic basis for their effects. In this review, we will discuss the clinical and experimental evidence that has begun to reveal which members of the microbiota protect against some of the most troublesome antibiotic-resistant pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Clostridioides difficile.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^1166DiDp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We initiated a worldwide collaborative study, including 455 episodes of bacteremia, to elucidate the clinical patterns of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Historically, community-acquired pneumonia has been consistently associated with K. pneumoniae. Only four cases of community-acquired bacteremic K. pneumoniae pneumonia were seen in the 2-year study period in the United States, Argentina, Europe, or Australia; none were in alcoholics. In contrast, 53 cases of bacteremic K. pneumoniae pneumonia were observed in South Africa and Taiwan, where an association with alcoholism persisted (p = 0.007). Twenty-five cases of a distinctive syndrome consisting of K. pneumoniae bacteremia in conjunction with community-acquired liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis were observed. A distinctive form of K. pneumoniae infection, often causing liver abscess, was identified, almost exclusively in Taiwan.

### Gastrointestinal carriage is a major reservoir of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in intensive care patients [^115S6J8L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Ethics

Ethical approvals for these studies were granted by the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee (project numbers 550/12 and 526/13).

Recruitment and Specimen and Data Collection

The Klebsiella Acquisition Surveillance Project at Alfred Health (KASPAH) was conducted from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014. Eligible patients (adults aged ≥ 18 years and expected to spend ≥ 3 days in ICU) were recruited as soon as possible after admission, and baseline rectal and throat screening swabs were collected. For the first 9 months verbal consent was required to participate. For the last 3 months a universal surveillance study for multidrug resistant organisms was conducted for which consent was waived; samples and data from this period were also included in KASPAH (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure 1). Follow-up swabs were repeated each 5–7 days after baseline for the duration of ICU stay and up to 4 days following transfer to another ward. Information on age, sex, dates of hospital and ICU admission/s, surgery in the last 30 days, and antibiotic treatment in the last 7 days were extracted from hospital records at the time each swab was taken. Dates of discharge and/or death were extracted from hospital records at the conclusion of the study. All clinical isolates recovered from ICU patients and identified as K. pneumoniae infections by the hospital diagnostic laboratory as part of routine care were included in the study. Full details are given in Supplementary Methods.

Community Associated vs Healthcare Associated Carriage

Individuals in the community-associated (CA) screening group include patients who were both (i) admitted to the Alfred Hospital ICU either directly (day 0) or via another ward on day 0, 1, or 2 of the original hospital admission; and (ii) first swabbed on day 0, 1, or 2 of that admission. Patients first swabbed on day 3 or later of their hospital admission are included in the HA/Day 3+ screening group. Individuals referred to the Alfred Hospital ICU by the trauma ward of another hospital were assumed to be emergency admissions from the community and were assigned to the CA/Day 0–2 or HA/Day 3+ screening groups according to the day of first swab relative to their Alfred Hospital admission. All other patients transferred from another hospital were included in the HA/D3+ screening group. As such, the CA/Day 0–2 screening groups represent individuals admitted directly to the hospital from the community, whereas the HA/D3+ group includes individuals with recent hospital exposure.

### Hospital-acquired infections in the neonatal intensive care unit – Klebsiella pneumoniae [^111UkJpA]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is medically the most important organism of the Klebsiella species. It is responsible for a significant proportion of hospital-acquired infections including septicemias, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and soft tissue infections especially in the immunocompromised hosts such as the neonate. The hands of healthcare workers and the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized infants serve as reservoirs for the transmission of the organism and are responsible for multiple hospital outbreaks. In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of outbreaks caused by multidrug resistance K. pneumoniae organisms or the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae. The problems associated with extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms include difficulties in accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing, limited treatment options and increased morbidity and perhaps mortality. Hence, prevention through implementation of strict infection control guidelines, effective hand washing and judicious use of antimicrobials such as third generation cephalosporins is important to effectively reduce the morbidity associated with this infection.

### Management of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections [^1111HbDK]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP) has become one of the most important contemporary pathogens, especially in endemic areas.

Aims

To provide practical suggestion for physicians dealing with the management of KPC-KP infections in critically ill patients, based on expert opinions.

Sources

PubMed search for relevant publications related to the management of KPC-KP infections.

Contents

A panel of experts developed a list of 12 questions to be addressed. In view of the current lack of high-level evidence, they were asked to provide answers on the bases of their knowledge and experience in the field. The panel identified several key aspects to be addressed when dealing with KPC-KP in critically ill patients (preventing colonization in the patient, preventing infection in the colonized patient and colonization of his or her contacts, reducing mortality in the infected patient by rapidly diagnosing the causative agent and promptly adopting the best therapeutic strategy) and provided related suggestions that were based on the available observational literature and the experience of panel members.

Implications

Diagnostic technologies could speed up the diagnosis of KPC-KP infections. Combination treatment should be preferred to monotherapy in cases of severe infections. For non-critically ill patients without severe infections, results from randomized clinical trials are needed for ultimately weighing benefits and costs of using combinations rather than monotherapy. Multifaceted infection control interventions are needed to decrease the rates of colonization and cross-transmission of KPC-KP.

### Screening for intestinal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in critically ill patients: expected benefits and evidence-based controversies [^112SzePb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The rising burden of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) strengthens the requirement for efficient prevention strategies. The detection of intestinal carriage of ESBL-E through active surveillance cultures (ASC) and the implementation of contact precautions (CP) in carriers are currently advocated in most high-income countries, to prevent cross-transmission and subsequent ESBL-E infections in critically-ill patients. Yet, recent studies have challenged the benefit of ASC and CP in controlling the spread of ESBL-E in ICUs with high compliance to standard hygiene precautions and no ongoing outbreak of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter spp. Besides, given their debated performance to positively predict which patients are at risk of ESBL-E infections, ASC results appear of limited value to rationalize the empirical use of carbapenems in the ICU, emphasizing the urgent need for novel anticipatory and diagnostic approaches. This Viewpoint article summarizes the available evidence on these issues.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: a new invasive syndrome [^113BLx4T]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well known human nosocomial pathogen. Most community-acquired K pneumoniae infections cause pneumonia or urinary tract infections. During the past two decades, however, a distinct invasive syndrome that causes liver abscesses has been increasingly reported in Asia, and this syndrome is emerging as a global disease. In this Review, we summarise the clinical presentation and management as well the microbiological aspects of this invasive disease. Diabetes mellitus and two specific capsular types in the bacterium predispose a patient to the development of liver abscesses and the following metastatic complications: bacteraemia, meningitis, endophthalmitis, and necrotising fasciitis. For patients with this invasive syndrome, appropriate antimicrobial treatment combined with percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses increases their chances of survival. Rapid detection of the hypervirulent strain that causes this syndrome allows earlier diagnosis and treatment, thus minimising the occurrence of sequelae and improving clinical outcomes.

### Genomic dissection of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in hospital patients reveals insights into an opportunistic pathogen [^116mjvGK]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In contrast to the findings above, we did not find any evidence of association between infection site and genomic features of the bacteria, but rather infection site was associated with patient demographics and infection onset. Specifically, UTIs were significantly associated with age and female sex; respiratory infections with nosocomial onset; and wound infections with community onset. This is consistent with there being no genetically-determined tissue tropism (or limited effect size of bacterial factors, which were underpowered to detect here), and suggests the outcome of the host-pathogen interaction is primarily determined by the patient's health status and vulnerabilities, consistent with the concept of opportunistic infection. The likely exception is the so-called 'hypervirulent' strains that express virulence plasmid-encoded siderophores and hypermucoidy;, such strains were rare in our study, but were mostly detected in community-onset infections (bold in Table 4). The spectrum of K. pneumoniae disease identified here (~two-thirds UTI, 15% respiratory, ~10% wound, ~10% sepsis) mirrors patterns in other hospitals around the world, and the genomic diversity we uncovered is consistent with WGS studies of unselected bloodstream isolates, and even from AMR-selected studies;, hence our results are likely to be broadly representative of the K. pneumoniae clinical picture in other hospital settings.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^115HVgxN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Methods

A prospective study of consecutive patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremia was performed in 12 hospitals. 1 The study period was January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997. Records of patients > 16 years of age with positive blood cultures for K. pneumoniae were reviewed, and a 188-item study form was completed. All items on the form were objective criteria, allowing standardization among medical centers. The study was observational in that administration of antimicrobial agents and other therapeutic management were controlled by the patient's physician, not the investigators.

Community-acquired bacteremia was defined as a positive blood culture taken on or within 48 hours of admission. Severity of acute illness at the time of positive blood cultures was assessed by a previously validated scoring system, based on mental status, vital signs, need for mechanical ventilation, and recent cardiac arrest (Pitt bacteremia score). Type of infection was defined as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, meningitis, incisional wound infection, other soft tissue infection, intraabdominal infection, and primary bloodstream infection, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions. In addition, distinctive sites of K. pneumoniae bacteremia were further defined as liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis. Liver abscesses were defined by the coexistence of blood cultures positive for K. pneumoniae and evidence of an intrahepatic abscess cavity by ultrasonography or computed tomography. Meningitis was defined as culture of K. pneumoniae from cerebrospinal fluid, and endophthalmitis was defined as decreased visual acuity, pain, hypyon, or severe anterior uveitis in a patient concurrently bacteremic with K. pneumoniae. Death was defined as including deaths from all causes within 14 days of the date the first positive blood culture for K. pneumoniae was obtained.

### Whole genome sequencing detects inter-facility transmission of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae [^111gZ7T5]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify transmission patterns of Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection during an outbreak at a large, tertiary care hospital and to detect whether the outbreak organisms spread to other facilities in the integrated healthcare network.

Methods

We analyzed 71 K. pneumoniae whole genome sequences collected from clinical specimens before, during and after the outbreak and reviewed corresponding patient medical records. Sequence and patient data were used to model probable transmissions and assess factors associated with the outbreak.

Results

We identified close genetic relationships among carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates sampled during the study period. Transmission tree analysis combined with patient records uncovered extended periods of silent colonization in many study patients and transmission routes that were likely the result of asymptomatic patients transitioning between facilities.

Conclusions

Detecting how and where Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections spread is challenging in an environment of rising prevalence, asymptomatic carriage and mobility of patients. Whole genome sequencing improved the precision of investigating inter-facility transmissions. Our results emphasize that containment of Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections requires coordinated efforts between healthcare networks and settings of care that acknowledge and mitigate transmission risk conferred by undetected carriage and by patient transfers between facilities.

### Gastrointestinal carriage is a major reservoir of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in intensive care patients [^116s9k1Z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen and leading cause of hospital-associated infections. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are particularly at risk. Klebsiella pneumoniae is part of the healthy human microbiome, providing a potential reservoir for infection. However, the frequency of gut colonization and its contribution to infections are not well characterized.

Methods

We conducted a 1-year prospective cohort study in which 498 ICU patients were screened for rectal and throat carriage of K. pneumoniae shortly after admission. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from screening swabs and clinical diagnostic samples were characterized using whole genome sequencing and combined with epidemiological data to identify likely transmission events.

Results

Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage frequencies were estimated at 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3%-8%) among ICU patients admitted direct from the community, and 19% (95% CI, 14%-51%) among those with recent healthcare contact. Gut colonization on admission was significantly associated with subsequent infection (infection risk 16% vs 3%, odds ratio [OR] = 6.9, P < .001), and genome data indicated matching carriage and infection isolates in 80% of isolate pairs. Five likely transmission chains were identified, responsible for 12% of K. pneumoniae infections in ICU. In sum, 49% of K. pneumoniae infections were caused by the patients' own unique strain, and 48% of screened patients with infections were positive for prior colonization.

Conclusions

These data confirm K. pneumoniae colonization is a significant risk factor for infection in ICU, and indicate ~50% of K. pneumoniae infections result from patients' own microbiota. Screening for colonization on admission could limit risk of infection in the colonized patient and others.

### Klebsiella invasive syndrome: a challenging diagnosis [^114PGbVs]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Klebsiella invasive syndrome is a rare condition that typically presents as a liver abscess with metastatic infection, with mortality rates as high as 14% potentially due to diagnostic delay by clinicians. Here, we present a case of a woman in her 60s, who presented with symptoms and signs consistent with meningitis, imaging findings suggestive of possible leptomeningeal carcinomatosis a long with areas of lung consolidation and abdominal nodules and lymphadenopathy, presumably metastatic malignancy. We diagnosed Klebsiella invasive syndrome and treated it conservatively with medical management, including a long course of intravenous antibiotic therapy and supportive care. This is an infrequently encountered clinical entity with potentially fatal consequences, and we hope to add to the existing literature on the subject and drive home the point that it should be considered in the differential diagnoses in the appropriate clinical scenario.

### Global trends of antimicrobial resistance and virulence of Klebsiella pneumoniae from different host sources [^112RPWo6]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Klebsiella pneumoniae, classified as a critical priority healthcare-associated pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO), serves as a major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) worldwide. In recent years, the emergence of highly antimicrobial-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae producing carbapenemases has posed a serious public health threat. These strains exhibit extensive resistance to multiple antibiotics, making infections increasingly challenging to treat. K. pneumoniae is classified into two major virulence phenotypes: hypervirulent and classical strains. Classical K. pneumoniae is the most common phenotype, typically associated with nosocomial infections in patients with underlying comorbidities. In contrast, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp), although less frequent, is characterized by its ability to cause severe infections in healthy individuals in community settings, with a propensity for rapid dissemination. While these hypervirulent isolates generally retain sensitivity to antibiotics, the increasing convergence of multidrug resistance and high virulence in specific strains represents a growing global concern.

K. pneumoniae is transmitted not only among humans but also is commonly detected in animals and shared environments –. This widespread presence facilitates the co-dissemination of AMR and virulence factors across different species, amplifying the risk to human health. Recent One Health studies show that identical sequence types (STs) and shared mobile elements are present in both human and animal isolates, highlighting two-way transmission across species. However, most existing studies primarily focus on clinical K. pneumoniae isolates from humans, resulting in gaps in our comprehension of the distribution of AMR and virulence in non-human populations. Moreover, it is unclear whether the lineages and AMR or virulence elements common in human infections are equally represented in animal and environmental populations. Understanding the transmission pathways of these pathogens from animals to humans is crucial, as animals can act as reservoirs for K. pneumoniae strains accountable for human clinical infections.

### The transmissibility of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units [^115q2CSf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The global emergence of infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) in intensive care units (ICUs) is, at least partly, driven by cross-transmission. Yet, individual transmission capacities of bacterial species have not been quantified.

Methods

In this post hoc analysis of a multicenter study in 13 European ICUs, prospective surveillance data and a mathematical model were used to estimate transmission capacities and single-admission reproduction numbers (RA) of Escherichia coli and non-E. coli Enterobacteriaceae (non-EcE), all being ESC resistant. Surveillance was based on a chromogenic selective medium for ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, allowing identification of E. coli and of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citrobacter species, grouped as non-EcE.

Results

Among 11420 patients included, the admission prevalence was 3.8% for non-EcE (74% being Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 3.3% for E. coli. Acquisition rates were 7.4 and 2.6 per 100 admissions at risk for non-EcE and E. coli, respectively. The estimated transmission capacity of non-EcE was 3.7 (95% credibility interval [CrI], 1.4–11.3) times higher than that of E. coli, yielding single-admission reproduction numbers (RA) of 0.17 (95% CrI, .094-.29) for non-EcE and 0.047 (95% CrI, .018-.098) for E. coli.

Conclusions

In ICUs, non-EcE, mainly K. pneumoniae, are 3.7 times more transmissible than E. coli. Estimated RA values of these bacteria were below the critical threshold of 1, suggesting that in these ICUs outbreaks typically remain small with current infection control policies.

### Risk factors and mortality for elderly patients with bloodstream infection of carbapenem resistance Klebsiella pneumoniae: a 10-year longitudinal study [^1153SZYg]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Population-based studies showed the incidence rate of BSI has been rising in recent years, especially in elderly patients. A recent study showed that the average incidence rate of age group over 65 was 6000 times per 100 thousand population. More than half of BSI occurs in patients aged 65 and over, and 70% of deaths occur in this age group, highlighting the severity of BSI in elderly patients. Klebsiella spp. is the common pathogen causing BSI in the elderly, accounting for about 3% — 10%. It is worth noting that CRKP infection is becoming a serious problem and has attracted much attention due to limited treatment options and adverse effects on prognosis. However, currently, there is a lack of epidemiological data on BSI caused by CRKP in the elderly population, especially the studies on specific measures to prevent BSI infection of older patients are still insufficient.

### Antimicrobial resistance as risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^1112NuVS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health issue, associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Although the effects of AMR on clinical and economic outcomes have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the effects of AMR on infection recurrence, a significant event that results in substantial illness, death, and healthcare costs. Recurrence is of particular concern among bacteremia patients, who are often fragile and have underlying conditions, because bacteremia is associated with high rates of death and AMR. AMR in bacteremia is associated with greater infection severity, higher risk for treatment failure, and longer length of hospital stay, all of which may affect risk for recurrence.

Few studies have investigated AMR as a potential risk factor for recurrent bacteremia, and all have been limited to recurrence of infection attributable to the same bacterium that caused initial infection. Conversely, the few studies not targeting a specific bacterial species or patient population (e.g. those with underlying conditions) and studying risk factors associated with recurrence within 1 year did not consider AMR as a potential risk factor. However, when studying the link between AMR and recurrence, it is important to consider the prolonged microbial imbalance that broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure (i.e. standard bacteremia treatment) can induce on the host microbiome. This imbalance includes ensuing effects on host susceptibility to colonization and infection and effects on selection and duration of carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which, for instance, can exceed 1 year for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae. AMR in an initial bacteremia episode may thus increase risk for recurrence attributable not only to the same bacterium that caused the initial infection but to any bacterium, whether acquired in the community or hospital. As such, studying bacteremia recurrence across all bacterial species and sources of infection seems clinically relevant. Moreover, it is particularly important to focus on community-onset infections, given the increasing spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community settings globally.

In this study, we investigated the effect of AMR in incident community-onset bacteremia on the probability of bacteremia recurrence within 1 year. We restricted incident bacteremia episodes to infections caused by S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. 3 leading pathogens responsible for community-onset bacteremia, and to their leading forms of AMR of major public health concern: methicillin resistance for S. aureus and third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) resistance for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. the major mechanism of which is ESBL production.

### Multidrug-resistant bacteria in the community: an update [^111syxhg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Multidrug-resistant bacteria are among the most important current threats to public health. Typically, they are associated with nosocomial infections. However, some have become prevalent causes of community-acquired infections, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Salmonella, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The community spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria is also a crucial development. An important global threat on the horizon is represented by production of carbapenemases by community-acquired hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae. Such strains have already been found in Asia, Europe, and North America. Prevention of further community spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria is of the utmost importance, and will require a multidisciplinary approach involving all stakeholders.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^111PzJS8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The third striking clinical observation is the preponderance of K. pneumoniae as a cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults in Taiwan, even in the absence of liver abscess or other sites of infection. The proportion of cases of culture-proven bacterial meningitis due to K. pneumoniae in one Taiwanese hospital increased from 8% during 1981 and 1986 to 18% during 1987 to 1995. In contrast, in a recent large review only 3 (1.2%) of 253 cases of community-acquired bacterial meningitis from the Massachusetts General Hospital were due to K. pneumoniae.

Given these empiric observations, we established an international collaboration of researchers from each of the world's populated continents. These investigators worked in large tertiary-care hospitals or hospitals serving veterans. One of our aims was to delineate in a single time period, with a consistent set of definitions, global differences in the clinical manifestations of serious K. pneumoniae infections. We also examined the influence of prior antibiotic use on these differences in K. pneumoniae infections.

### Risk factors and clinical impact of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae [^117UfcQV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae is an emerging pathogen with serious clinical and infection control implications. To our knowledge, no study has specifically examined risk factors for KPC-producing K. pneumoniae or its impact on mortality.

Methods

To identify risk factors for infection or colonization with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, a case-control study was performed. Case patients with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae were compared with control subjects with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae. A cohort study evaluated the association between KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Fifty-six case patients and 863 control subjects were identified. In multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for KPC-producing K. pneumoniae were (1) severe illness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25–8.25), (2) prior fluoroquinolone use (AOR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.50, 7.66), and (3) prior extended-spectrum cephalosporin use (AOR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.18, 5.52). Compared with samples from other anatomic locations, K. pneumoniae isolates from blood samples were less likely to harbor KPC (AOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12, 0.86). KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (AOR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.87–6.91).

Conclusions

KPC-producing K. pneumoniae is an emerging pathogen associated with significant mortality. Our findings highlight the urgent need to develop strategies for prevention and infection control. Limiting use of certain antimicrobials, specifically fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, use may be effective strategies.

### Clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia developing secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection [^114PNqc8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is a gram-negative, encapsulated, bacterium in the environment. The bacterium typically colonizes human mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and oropharynx. Once the bacteria enter the body, they can exhibit a high degree of toxicity and antibiotic resistance. KP pneumonia accounts for approximately 11.8% of all hospital-acquired pneumonia cases cases worldwide and nearly 15% of all cases of pneumonia in developing countries. Patients with KP pneumonia often display a poor prognosis. Even with optimal treatment, the mortality rate of KP pneumonia is between 30 and 50%. KP bloodstream infection (KP-BSI) is one of the most fatal infections and is associated with high mortality ranging from 20 to 40%, whereas mortality was reported to reach 67.6% in ICU patients. The most important prognostic variables in KP-BSI are the main site of infection (i.e. pneumonia more than urinary tract infection), the severity of the underlying disease (i.e. septic shock or a higher APACHE II score) and the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. Indeed, the prognosis, including hospital stays, mortality and hospitalization costs, is usually worse in patients with KP pneumonia once they are complicated with bacteremia. However, whether the outcomes of patients with KP pneumonia developing into secondary KP-BSI (KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI) would be worse than in the patients with KP-pneumonia alone or which risk factors contribute to the development of secondary KP-BSI from KP pneumonia alone are largely unknown.

### Clinical and genomic characterization of a cohort of patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection [^112ddR8r]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical and microbial factors associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections (BSIs) are not well characterized. Prior studies have focused on highly resistant or hypervirulent isolates, limiting our understanding of K. pneumoniae strains that commonly cause BSI. We performed a record review and whole-genome sequencing to investigate the clinical characteristics, bacterial diversity, determinants of antimicrobial resistance, and risk factors for in-hospital death in a cohort of patients with K. pneumoniae BSI.

Methods

We identified 562 patients at Massachusetts General Hospital with K. pneumoniae BSIs between 2016 and 2022. We collected data on comorbid conditions, infection source, clinical outcomes, and antibiotic resistance and performed whole-genome sequencing on 108 sequential BSI isolates from 2021 to 2022.

Results

Intra-abdominal infection was the most common source of infection accounting for 34% of all BSIs. A respiratory tract source accounted for 6% of BSIs but was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 5.4 [95% confidence interval, 2.2–12.8]; P < .001 for comparison with other sources). Resistance to the first antibiotic prescribed was also associated with a higher risk of death (adjusted odds ratio, 5.2 [95% confidence interval, 2.2–12.4]; P < .001). BSI isolates were genetically diverse, and no clusters of epidemiologically and genetically linked cases were observed. Virulence factors associated with invasiveness were observed at a low prevalence, although an unexpected association between O-antigen type and the source of infection was found.

Conclusions

These observations demonstrate the versatility of K. pneumoniae as an opportunistic pathogen and highlight the need for new approaches for surveillance and the rapid identification of patients with invasive antimicrobial-resistant K. pneumoniae infection.

### Incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia [^115S9riN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although Klebsiella pneumoniae is the second most common cause of Gram-negative bloodstream infections, its epidemiology has not been defined in a nonselected population. We sought to describe the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcomes associated with K. pneumoniae bacteremia.

Methods

Population-based surveillance for K. pneumoniae bacteremia was conducted in the Calgary Health Region (population 1.2 million) from 2000 to 2007.

Results

A total of 640 episodes of K. pneumoniae bacteremia were identified for an overall annual population incidence of 7.1 per 100,000; 174 (27%) were nosocomial, 276 (43%) were healthcare-associated community onset, and 190 (30%) were community acquired. Elderly patients and men were at highest risk for K. pneumoniae bacteremia. Dialysis, solid-organ transplantation, chronic liver disease, and cancer were the most important risk factors for acquiring K. pneumoniae bacteremia. Rates of resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole increased significantly during 2000 to 2007. The case fatality rate was 20%, and the annual population mortality rate was 1.3 per 100,000. Increasing age, nosocomial acquisition, non-urinary and non-biliary focus of infection, and several comorbid illnesses were independently associated with an increased risk of death.

Conclusion

This is the first population-based study to document the major burden of illness associated with K. pneumoniae bacteremia and identifies groups at increased risk of acquiring and dying of these infections.

### Modifiable risk factors for the spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae among long-term acute-care hospital patients [^114LZxAK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE To identify modifiable risk factors for acquisition of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (KPC) colonization among long-term acute-care hospital (LTACH) patients. DESIGN Multicenter, matched case-control study. SETTING Four LTACHs in Chicago, Illinois. PARTICIPANTS Each case patient included in this study had a KPC-negative rectal surveillance culture on admission followed by a KPC-positive surveillance culture later in the hospital stay. Each matched control patient had a KPC-negative rectal surveillance culture on admission and no KPC isolated during the hospital stay. RESULTS From June 2012 to June 2013, 2,575 patients were admitted to 4 LTACHs; 217 of 2,144 KPC-negative patients (10.1%) acquired KPC. In total, 100 of these patients were selected at random and matched to 100 controls by LTACH facility, admission date, and censored length of stay. Acquisitions occurred a median of 16.5 days after admission. On multivariate analysis, we found that exposure to higher colonization pressure (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04; p = 0.002), exposure to a carbapenem (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.06–4.77; p = 0.04), and higher Charlson comorbidity index (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01–1.29; p = 0.04) were independent risk factors for KPC acquisition; the odds of KPC acquisition increased by 2% for each 1% increase in colonization pressure. CONCLUSIONS Higher colonization pressure, exposure to carbapenems, and a higher Charlson comorbidity index independently increased the odds of KPC acquisition among LTACH patients. Reducing colonization pressure (through separation of KPC-positive patients from KPC-negative patients using strict cohorts or private rooms) and reducing carbapenem exposure may prevent KPC cross transmission in this high-risk patient population.

### Screening for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in hospitalised patients, and risk of progression from colonisation to infection: systematic review [^117XpyfA]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transmission of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (AMR-GNB) amongst hospitalised patients can lead to new cases of carriage, infection and outbreaks, hence the need for early carrier identification. We aim to explore two key elements that may guide control policies for colonisation/infection in hospital settings: screening practices on admission to hospital wards and risk of developing infection from colonisation.

Methods

We searched on PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases for studies published from 2010 up to 2021 reporting on adult patients hospitalised in high-income countries.

Results

The search retrieved 11,853 articles. After screening, 100 studies were included. Combining target patient groups and setting type, we identified six screening approaches. The most reported approach was all admitted patients to high-risk (HR) wards (49.4%). The overall prevalence of AMR-GNB was 13.8% (95%CI 9.3–19.0) with significant differences across regions and time. Risk of progression to infection amongst colonised patients was 11.0% (95%CI 8.0–14.3) and varied according to setting and pathogens' group (p value < 0.0001), with higher values reported for Klebsiella species (18.1%; 95%CI 8.9–29.3).

Conclusions

While providing a comprehensive overview of the screening approaches, our study underlines the considerable burden of AMR-GNB colonisation and risk of progression to infection in hospitals by pathogen, setting and time.

The intestinal microbiota and antibiotic-resistant pathogens

For many bacterial pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridioides difficile, colonization of the intestinal tract is the first step on the pathway to acute infection. Despite these three pathogens ultimately causing a different spectrum of diseases, colonization of the intestinal tract is a shared point in their pathogenesis; thus, understanding this key step in disease could lead to treatments that are broadly effective against multiple pathogens.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative Proteobacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is commensal of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract in several mammals, including humans, with human carriage estimated to be around 3–8%. In hospital patients, the incidence of gastrointestinal colonization can be significantly higher (up to 38%). Beyond its human host, it is also found in environmental reservoirs such as water, sewage, and soil. In a fraction of its hosts, K. pneumoniae causes respiratory, urinary tract, wound, and bloodstream infections. Classically, it has been considered an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen with higher incidence in neonates, the elderly, immunocompromised, and notably patients receiving antibiotic treatment. This view of K. pneumoniae as a purely nosocomial pathogen has, however, been reevaluated with a growing number of infections now also being identified in the community and not solely in patients with comorbidities. K. pneumoniae capable of infecting these mostly healthy patients in a community setting is thought to be more virulent, and is associated with specific capsule types. The development of antibiotic resistance has also amplified the importance of K. pneumoniae infections. Following the first European case of an extended-spectrum β-lactamase in 1983, carbapenems became vital in treating these resistant organisms. However, resistance to these last-line defense antibiotics has expanded where carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-Kp) clinical isolates rose from 1.6% in 2001 to 10.4% in 2011. Similar rates of CR-Kp have increased in China from 2.4 to 13.4% between 2005 and 2016. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have thus declared the emergence of these carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae an urgent threat to public health owing to the lack of treatment options and high fatality rate. Gastrointestinal colonization is the pivotal step in K. pneumoniae pathogenesis. Studies examining K. pneumoniae carriage and subsequent infection have attempted to identify factors that predispose a patient to colonization. Duration of hospital exposure and usage of antibiotics increase the rate of K. pneumoniae colonization. Length of stay is likely to increase the probability of a patient being exposed to the bacteria via healthcare workers and fomites. Antibiotic usage causes dysbiosis of the microbiota providing favorable conditions for K. pneumoniae. Limited data are available on which antibiotics predispose to K. pneumoniae colonization but some clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between vancomycin treatment and subsequent K. pneumoniae colonization. Supporting this idea vancomycin addition to a simulated intestinal microbial system allowed the expansion of K. pneumoniae. The utility of the microbiota for preventing K. pneumoniae colonization is supported by studies where fecal microbiota transplant has been shown to promote the clearance of K. pneumoniae from the intestine in both humans and animal models. Studies using animal models have shown that of the major bacterial phyla in the intestinal microbiota, it is members of the Bacteroidetes, but not the Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, or Actinobacteria, that protect against K. pneumoniae colonization. Bacteroidetes provide protection via the stimulation of the intestinal immune system. Specifically, the development of Bacteroidetes post weaning primes the production of intestinal IL-36γ that stimulates a macrophage-dependent barrier against K. pneumoniae. This priming of intestinal IL-36 requires that Bacteroidetes intimately associate with the intestinal mucosal and this is dependent on the Bacteroidetes commensal colonization factors that promote the association of these organisms with the mucosa. Other studies demonstrate that protection against K. pneumoniae by the microbiota is not limited to indirect stimulation of the immune system but can also occur via direct inhibition from the microbiota. Specifically, production of SCFA by the microbiota leads to intracellular acidification of K. pneumoniae thus inhibiting its growth. Within the other major human niche of K. pneumoniae, the upper airway, the microbiota is seemingly less able to prevent colonization. Again, in animal models, after direct inoculation of K. pneumoniae into the upper airway K. pneumoniae is able to successfully compete with the upper airway microbiota and establish colonization. Successful colonization of the upper airway requires production of the capsular polysaccharide. Capsular polysaccharide is a well-established virulence factor important for evading innate immune defenses during acute infection. There is a multitude of different capsule types produced by different strains of K. pneumoniae. Capsular composition has a designated K nomenclature based on the K-antigen, of which there has been thought to be a total of 77 different types. Originally done using agglutination, the advancement of technologies for whole genome sequencing suggests there may be even more than 138 distinct K types. Importantly, the vast majority of the infections in the community are from hypervirulent strains of the serotype K1 and K2 capsule types only. The capsule may support initiating gastrointestinal colonization but is seemingly unimportant for persistent intestinal colonization, unlike its established role in colonization in the urinary tract or its contribution to immune evasion. In the absence of the capsule, K. pneumoniae can no longer compete with the upper airway microbiota and is cleared from this site. Clearance is driven by the stimulation of innate immunity by commensal Proteobacteria in the upper airway, rather than Bacteroidetes, and via IL-17A activity, rather than IL-36. If K. pneumoniae does manage to evade the intestinal microbiota and immune defenses that inhibit its colonization, it can go on to cause lung infection. Nevertheless, the intestinal microbiota is still important in resisting disease in this distal tissue. Members of the intestinal, and upper airway, microbiota that are potent stimulators of the pattern recognition receptor Nod2 enhance early innate clearance of K. pneumoniae from the lung by alveolar macrophages through a IL-17A, GM-CSF, and ERK-dependent pathway. This highlights the complexity of the interaction between the microbiota, immune system, and K. pneumoniae. At different mucosal sites there are different commensal groups that are having different effects on the immune system that may, or may not, lead to resistance to colonization and thus infection. Enterococci are part of the human microbiota but two members of this genus are significant human pathogens: E. faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococci are the major Gram-positive coccus in the human intestinal microbiota and commensal strains can be present at levels of up to 10 7 CFU/g in feces. These organisms are naturally resistant to many antibiotics and can easily acquire further resistant elements leading to many strains being multidrug resistant. Disease-causing enterococci are responsible for systemic infections, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis. A feature of enterococcal biology is that strains associated with disease are often markedly different to commensal enterococci. Commensal strains have smaller genomes and disease-causing strains having a broader repertoire of carbohydrate utilization pathways allowing use of host-derived glycans. This may underlie why commensal strains rarely cause disease. It has been known for a number of years that antibiotic therapy facilitates the expansion of VRE in the intestine. Of particular note is that human and animal studies have found that the suppression of VRE is particularly associated with anaerobic bacteria indicating that these commensals are particularly important in keeping the levels of enterococci in check. There have been a number of pathways delineated by which the microbiota provides protection against VRE expansion. Protection has been shown to be via both the stimulation of the immune system and also through the direct antagonism of commensals against VRE. Microbiota-mediated resistance to intestinal VRE colonization driven by the immune system can occur via the stimulation of the innate immune system. During homeostasis the microbiota provides basal stimulation to the innate immune system through agonism of pattern recognition receptors, fortifying intestinal antimicrobial defenses. In the intestine, the microbiota activates Toll-like receptors on stromal cells that stimulate the production of the AMP REG3γ, indicating that while the innate immune system in the intestine has its activity restrained to prevent pathological inflammation its responsiveness is not eliminated. Simple restoration of a pure TLR agonist was sufficient to stimulate this immune defense pathway and protect against VRE. There are further more indirect immunological defenses that restrict enterococcal expansion through the activity of the IL-22 receptor. Signaling through the IL-22 receptor has been proposed to limit the levels of intestinal enterococci by promoting the fucosylation of host glycans. It is thought that these act as a nutrient source for intestinal anaerobes, such as Bacteroides, promoting their expansion thereby limiting enterococcal numbers. Further studies have begun to delineate at lower taxonomic levels specific members of the microbiota that protect against VRE. By comparing mouse microbiota that provide different levels of protection against VRE colonization, and then isolating commensals from the protective microbiota by culturing, a simple consortium of four commensals was identified that protect against VRE. This consortium consisted of Clostridium bolteae, Blautia producta, Bacteroides sartorii, and Parabacteroides distasonis. Within this consortium it is Blautia producta that is directly antagonistic to VRE through the elaboration of a lantibiotic that is inhibitory to VRE. Similarly, in patients, the enrichment of lantibiotic genes was associated with reduced E. faecium being detected in their stool. Enterococci are also thought to be directly antagonistic to one another through the production of bacteriocins. E. faecalis strains that produce bacteriocins from the pPD1 plasmid are able to outcompete non-bacteriocin producing strains in the intestine, including VRE.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115KP4pH]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop on experimental models of bacterial pneumonia — scope and key focuses are as follows: the report summarizes an American Thoracic Society workshop on animal models of bacterial pneumonia and includes review of non-animal complementary or alternative models for studying bacterial pneumonia, with emphasis on bacterial pathogens that frequently cause community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia and key aspects in modeling infection. Preclinical models are described as of utmost importance to decipher pathogenesis and develop novel targets for intervention and treatment, and animal models offer the powerful ability to investigate different pneumonia types at varying stages of infection and disease, although the same models can promote important variations in outcome that potentially confound scientific understanding. Animal models discussed included small and large animals based on their strengths, and the ethical considerations in the use of animal modeling for the study of bacterial lung infections was discussed; this workshop report is intended to provide insights to investigators and may serve as a starting point for formal recommendations in the future. The overview underscores that bacterial pneumonia remains a major global health issue and highlights the value of animal and non-animal models for studying key pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; keywords include bacterial infection, lungs, experimental models, animals, and ethical considerations.

### Genomic dissection of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in hospital patients reveals insights into an opportunistic pathogen [^112Nka3m]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of opportunistic healthcare-associated infections, which are increasingly complicated by the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenem resistance. We conducted a year-long prospective surveillance study of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates in hospital patients. Whole-genome sequence (WGS) data reveals a diverse pathogen population, including other species within the K. pneumoniae species complex (18%). Several infections were caused by K. variicola/K. pneumoniae hybrids, one of which shows evidence of nosocomial transmission. A wide range of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes are observed, and diverse genetic mechanisms identified (mainly plasmid-borne genes). ESBLs are correlated with presence of other acquired AMR genes (median n = 10). Bacterial genomic features associated with nosocomial onset are ESBLs (OR 2.34, p = 0.015) and rhamnose-positive capsules (OR 3.12, p < 0.001). Virulence plasmid-encoded features (aerobactin, hypermucoidy) are observed at low-prevalence (< 3%), mostly in community-onset cases. WGS-confirmed nosocomial transmission is implicated in just 10% of cases, but strongly associated with ESBLs (OR 21, p < 1×10–11). We estimate 28% risk of onward nosocomial transmission for ESBL-positive strains vs 1.7% for ESBL-negative strains. These data indicate that K. pneumoniae infections in hospitalised patients are due largely to opportunistic infections with diverse strains, with an additional burden from nosocomially-transmitted AMR strains and community-acquired hypervirulent strains.

### Patterns of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremic dissemination from the lung [^1116dPNR]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Bacteremia, a leading cause of death, generally arises after bacteria establish infection in a particular tissue and transit to secondary sites. Studying dissemination from primary sites by solely measuring bacterial burdens does not capture the movement of individual clones. By barcoding Klebsiella pneumoniae, a leading cause of bacteremia, we track pathogen dissemination following pneumonia. Variability in organ bacterial burdens is attributable to two distinct dissemination patterns distinguished by the degree of similarity between the lung and systemic sites. In metastatic dissemination, lung bacterial clones undergo heterogeneous expansion and the dominant clones spread to secondary organs, leading to greater similarity between sites. In direct dissemination, bacterial clones exit the lungs without clonal expansion, leading to lower burdens in systemic sites and more dissimilarity from the lung. We uncover bacterial and host factors that influence the dynamics of clonal sharing and expansion. Here, our data reveal unexpected heterogeneity in Klebsiella bacteremia dynamics and define a framework for understanding within-host bacterial dissemination.

### Whole genome sequencing detects inter-facility transmission of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae [^117Sgg8a]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

Objectives:

To identify transmission patterns of Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection during an outbreak at a large, tertiary care hospital and to detect whether the outbreak organisms spread to other facilities in the integrated healthcare network.

Methods:

We analyzed 71 K. pneumoniae whole genome sequences collected from clinical specimens before, during and after the outbreak and reviewed corresponding patient medical records. Sequence and patient data were used to model probable transmissions and assess factors associated with the outbreak.

Results:

We identified close genetic relationships among carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates sampled during the study period. Transmission tree analysis combined with patient records uncovered extended periods of silent colonization in many study patients and transmission routes that were likely the result of asymptomatic patients transitioning between facilities.

Conclusions:

Detecting how and where Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections spread is challenging in an environment of rising prevalence, asymptomatic carriage and mobility of patients. Whole genome sequencing improved the precision of investigating inter-facility transmissions. Our results emphasize that containment of Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections requires coordinated efforts between healthcare networks and settings of care that acknowledge and mitigate transmission risk conferred by undetected carriage and by patient transfers between facilities.

### Genomically defined hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae contributed to early-onset increased mortality [^1134YaMd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Enrolled patients and demographic and clinical data collection

We conducted a systematic retrospective investigation on a large cohort infected with K. pneumoniae from 2017 to 2023 in Beijing, China. Demographic information was obtained from electronic medical records. Social-economical characteristics, including the permanent residence area and medical insurance, were also recorded. Residence in either a village or a city was determined by the detailed address recorded in the medical record. We also collected the medical insurance types of the patients, which were categorized into superior and non-superior groups. Clinical characteristics, including underlying diseases, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), ICU admission, and specimen types, were also collected. Infection was defined as: (1) signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory and radiographic findings were consistent with infection from the site where Kp was cultured; (2) antibiotic therapy initiation following the positive culture result; (3) Kp was cultured from a sterile site. The inclusion of infection cases was first assessed by a junior physician and then reviewed by a senior physician. The process was independently conducted to ensure accuracy and reliability. Meeting any of the above criteria was defined as infection. Hospital-acquired infection (HAI) was defined as patients who developed the infection after being admitted for more than 48 h. Community-acquired infection (CAI) was defined as cases without any prior exposure to healthcare facilities, and healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) was defined as an infection in a patient who had prior interaction with the healthcare system before developing their infection. Sepsis and septic shock were defined as previous described. Poor prognosis, measured at 14, 28, and 90 days, was defined as death or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Patients lost to follow-up who do not have the 90-day outcome were excluded from the mortality analysis.

### Animal model to study Klebsiella pneumoniae gastrointestinal colonization and host-to-host transmission [^1138vG6X]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Host-to-host transmission of pathogens is the primary source of nosocomial infections, which are considered a serious threat to patients' health and also a significant burden on the health care system. Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) account for ∼100,000 deaths in the United States alone. A leading cause of these hospital-acquired infections and multiple outbreaks in hospitals around the world is, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family that frequently causes pneumonia, bacteremia, pyogenic liver abscesses, and urinary tract infections, with most of these infections generally occurring in immunocompromised patients. With the rampant use of antibiotics, isolates have become extensively drug resistant, and some are now even considered pan-drug resistant, making the infections they cause extremely difficult to treat. For this reason, the WHO listsas a critical pathogen for which new antibiotics and other therapies are urgently required to address this growing health care problem. Further exacerbating treatment ofinfections is the recent identification of isolates termed hypervirulent(hvKP) that can cause disease, such as community-acquired pyogenic liver abscesses in healthy individuals. Patients recovering from hvKP infections often suffer from postinfectious sequelae that can lead to loss of limb or vision. These strains, originally isolated in the Pacific Rim, have since disseminated worldwide.

In the natural environment, the initial mucosal sites of colonization tend to be the oropharynx and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These colonization events are generally asymptomatic. However, under certain circumstances, can gain access to other sterile sites in the host and cause disease. Epidemiological data suggest that many patients in hospitals carryin the GI tract, with a correlation betweencarriage and subsequent disease from the same isolate. Besides patients, hospital personnel can also be asymptomatic carriers of, and these silent carriers act as a reservoir from whichcan manifest disease within the same host or act as a source of transmission to a new host.

Colonization resistance provided by the host microbiota plays a critical role in blocking colonization by pathogens. However, the use of antibiotics diminishes the microbial diversity in the GI tract, which potentially allowsto readily colonize a host. Studies also show that antibiotic treatment of mice predisposes them to a "supershedder" state in which they shed resident gut pathogens at a higher number, which enhances host-to-host transmission. It is, however, unclear whether antibiotic treatment in a hospital setting contributes toward the increased transmission of drug-resistant.

### Deciphering the gastrointestinal carriage of… [^1159De7c]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

Bacterial infections pose a significant global health threat, accounting for an estimated 7.7 million deaths. Hospital outbreaks driven by multi-drug-resistant pathogens, notably Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), are of grave concern. This opportunistic pathogen causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The rise of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae adds complexity, as it increasingly infects healthy individuals. Recent epidemiological data suggest that asymptomatic gastrointestinal carriage serves as a reservoir for infections in the same individual and allows for host-to-host transmission via the fecal-oral route. This review focuses on K. pneumoniae 's gastrointestinal colonization, delving into epidemiological evidence, current animal models, molecular colonization mechanisms, and the protective role of the resident gut microbiota. Moreover, the review sheds light on in vivo high-throughput approaches that have been crucial for identifying K. pneumoniae factors in gut colonization. This comprehensive exploration aims to enhance our understanding of K. pneumoniae gut pathogenesis, guiding future intervention and prevention strategies.

### Transmission dynamics of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in the tertiary care hospital and the household setting [^113mgcFF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Since the late 1980s, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been recognized as a major cause of nosocomial infections and outbreaks. However, during the late 1990s, bla ESBL genes have increasingly been identified within the community setting in the context of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Escherichia coli. Currently, the CTX-M-15 is recognized as the most widely distributed bla ESBL among Enterobacteriaceae, and the worldwide spread of the E. coli hyper-epidemic clone of sequence type (ST) 131 represents one of the major challenges for the healthcare systems.

An important strategy for controlling the spread of these multidrug-resistant pathogens is the identification of patients with risks for acquisition. In addition, active surveillance and isolation precautions are recommended. However, proposed guidelines refer to the outbreak situations only and data about the efficiency of infection control measures in the endemic hospital setting or even in the community are currently not available.

Community spread of ESBL producers indicates that person-to-person transmission may occur outside the hospital but data regarding household spread and risk factors thereof are still limited. Prolonged carriage of ESBL producers in the gastrointestinal tract of patients after hospital discharge may enhance such transmission. Thus, a better understanding of the transmission dynamics of ESBL producers in this setting is warranted in order to guide measures for the control of ESBL producers in the community.

In the present study, we prospectively evaluated transmission rates of ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL- Ec) and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (ESBL- Kp) from hospital index patients to hospital roommates and to household persons. Our data indicate that the transmission rate is significantly higher within households than in our non-outbreak hospital scenario.

### Prevention of colonization and infection by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in long-term acute-care hospitals [^117Xcxd9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (hereafter "KPC") are an increasing threat to healthcare institutions. Long-term acute-care hospitals (LTACHs) have especially high prevalence of KPC.

Methods

Using a stepped-wedge design, we tested whether a bundled intervention (screening patients for KPC rectal colonization upon admission and every other week; contact isolation and geographic separation of KPC-positive patients in ward cohorts or single rooms; bathing all patients daily with chlorhexidine gluconate; and healthcare-worker education and adherence monitoring) would reduce colonization and infection due to KPC in 4 LTACHs with high endemic KPC prevalence. The study was conducted between 1 February 2010 and 30 June 2013; 3894 patients were enrolled during the preintervention period (lasting from 16 to 29 months), and 2951 patients were enrolled during the intervention period (lasting from 12 to 19 months).

Results

KPC colonization prevalence was stable during preintervention (average, 45.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 42.1%-49.5%), declined early during intervention, then reached a plateau (34.3%; 95% CI, 32.4%-36.2%; P < .001 for exponential decline). During intervention, KPC admission prevalence remained high (average, 20.6%, 95% CI, 19.1%-22.3%). The incidence rate of KPC colonization fell during intervention, from 4 to 2 acquisitions per 100 patient-weeks (P = 0.004 for linear decline). Compared to preintervention, average rates of clinical outcomes declined during intervention: KPC in any clinical culture (3.7 to 2.5/1000 patient-days; p = 0.001), KPC bacteremia (0.9 to 0.4/1000 patient-days; p = 0.008), all-cause bacteremia (11.2 to 7.6/1000 patient-days; p = 0.006) and blood culture contamination (4.9 to 2.3/1000 patient-days; p = 0.03).

Conclusions

A bundled intervention was associated with clinically important and statistically significant reductions in KPC colonization, KPC infection, all-cause bacteremia, and blood culture contamination in a high-risk LTACH population.

### Mortality due to KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections: systematic review and meta-analysis: mortality due to KPC Klebsiella pneumoniae infections [^114ENFzo]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP) has become a major public health challenge. Accordingly, this study sought to use a systematic review of the scientific literature to ascertain the mortality of KPC-KP infection, and analyze such mortality by country, year of publication, hospital ward, and type of interpretation used to define carbapenem resistance.

Methodology

A search without language restrictions was made of the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EBSCO, LILACS and EMBASE databases from 1996 through June 2017, to locate all studies which had determined the existence of KPC-KP infection. We then performed a meta-analysis of all studies that reported KPC-KP infection-related mortality, and analyzed mortality by subgroup in accordance with standard methodology.

Results

A total of 51 papers were included in the systematic review. From 2005 through 2017, data on KPC-KP infection were reported in 5124 patients, with an average of 465 patients per year. The most widely studied type of infection was bacteremia (28∙0%). The meta-analysis showed that overall mortality for the 37 studies was 41.0% (95%CI 37.0–44.0), with the highest mortality rates being observed in oncology patients, 56.0% (95%CI 38.1–73.0), and Brazil, 51.3% (95%CI 43.0–60.0).

Conclusion

KPC-KP infection-related mortality is high, is manifested differently in some countries, and is highest among oncology patients.
