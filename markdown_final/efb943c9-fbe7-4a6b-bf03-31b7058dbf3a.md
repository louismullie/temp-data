## Question

What are the common side effects of Rezmedteron in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common side effects of Rezmedteron in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the drug identity and indication. Then, I should verify the highest-quality efficacy and safety data from pivotal trials. Next, I will extract gastrointestinal and other common adverse events with frequencies and timing. After that, I should review serious adverse events and hepatic safety signals. I will then examine endocrine effects, especially thyroid function. I need to check drug–drug interactions, particularly with statins, and consider gallbladder-related risks. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary with monitoring guidance and dose-related nuances, anchoring to FDA labeling and AASLD guidance where possible.

> Let me first confirm the medication and indication. Wait, let me verify the name: "Rezmedteron" appears to be a misspelling. The correct drug is resmetirom, brand name Rezdiffra, which received accelerated FDA approval in March 2024 for adults with MASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis (F2–F3) without cirrhosis, with weight-based dosing of 80 mg daily if less than 100 kg and 100 mg daily if 100 kg or more [^111C2eDF] [^112WLEi4].

> Next, I should review the pivotal safety data. I will now examine the phase 3 trials and FDA label to anchor the adverse event profile. The MAESTRO-NASH and MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trials, along with the FDA's integrated safety analysis of 2019 patients, provide the most reliable estimates of common adverse reactions and discontinuation patterns, which I should prioritize over smaller or earlier-phase studies [^1164Skao] [^113y6t7d] [^114tmaSj].

> I need to check gastrointestinal adverse effects first because these are consistently the most frequent. Diarrhea and nausea are the most common treatment-emergent adverse events, typically occur early after initiation, and are usually mild to moderate. Let me verify the ranges: diarrhea occurred in roughly 24% to 34% and nausea in about 12% to 22% across trials, with onset often within the first 4 weeks and median duration of diarrhea around 15 to 20 days; importantly, the incidence of diarrhea did not remain elevated versus placebo after week 12, suggesting early transient risk [^1177184Y] [^112pJmyf] [^114tmaSj].

> Hold on, I should verify other commonly reported adverse events beyond diarrhea and nausea. Pruritus, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and dizziness have each been reported in more than 5% of patients in some summaries, though frequencies vary by source and dose; these are generally mild to moderate and manageable, but I should note that the FDA label emphasizes diarrhea and nausea as the predominant drivers of discontinuation, which aligns with trial observations [^1122TZQw] [^114tmaSj].

> I will now examine serious adverse events and hepatic safety signals. Serious adverse event rates were similar to placebo in MAESTRO-NASH, but I need to ensure I capture liver-related warnings. The FDA label highlights hepatotoxicity and gallbladder-related adverse reactions as clinically significant warnings; there was a single case of severe hepatotoxicity with marked bilirubin elevation in the safety trial, and resmetirom was associated with an increased incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease, though gallstones per se are not a contraindication [^1164Skao] [^114tmaSj] [^1177184Y].

> Let me consider early transient liver enzyme changes, because clinicians often notice ALT/AST rises shortly after initiation. I should double-check the timing and magnitude: mean ALT and AST increases of less than 1.5 times baseline occurred around week 4 and generally returned to baseline by week 8; this pattern supports early monitoring rather than reflex discontinuation if enzymes normalize and the patient is otherwise well [^112t1z6o] [^1122TZQw].

> Next, I should review endocrine effects, especially thyroid function. Resmetirom is a liver-directed THR-β agonist, so I need to check whether clinically meaningful thyroid dysfunction occurs. Free T4 decreased by a mean of about 2% with placebo, 13% with 80 mg, and 17% with 100 mg at 12 months, while TSH and T3 remained within normal limits; development of hypothyroidism requiring levothyroxine occurred in 1.8% of treated participants, and the FDA concluded that thyroid axis function was maintained overall, recommending baseline TSH assessment and optimization of thyroid disease before initiation rather than routine monitoring in those without thyroid disease [^112t1z6o] [^116s3Nwt] [^1112h2vS].

> But wait, what about sex hormone–binding globulin and androgen effects? Could this confound interpretation or patient counseling? Resmetirom increases SHBG, with total testosterone rising 50% to 100% in men while free testosterone remains unchanged, and estradiol increases in women; these changes reflect hepatic THR-β activation and are not typically associated with clinical symptoms, though I should counsel patients accordingly [^115UQUdd].

> I need to ensure I cover drug–drug interactions, particularly with statins, because many MASH patients are on lipid-lowering therapy. AASLD guidance advises that resmetirom can be coadministered with statins but recommends maximum statin doses of atorvastatin 40 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg, and simvastatin 20 mg; if a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor like clopidogrel is used, the resmetirom dose should be reduced to 80 mg if 100 kg or more, or 60 mg if less than 100 kg, with careful lipid monitoring to maintain cardiovascular risk targets [^112WLEi4] [^113Hid7o] [^112RUw5m].

> Let me reconsider gallbladder-related adverse events, since symptomatic gallstone disease was more frequent. I should confirm that symptomatic gallstone disease is the concern, not silent stones; indeed, the FDA warns of increased symptomatic gallstone disease, and AASLD advises avoiding initiation in patients with symptomatic gallstone-related conditions such as acute cholecystitis, while noting that gallstones alone are not a contraindication [^114tmaSj] [^111vxTZP].

> Next, I should review discontinuation patterns to contextualize tolerability. Exposure-adjusted discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were approximately 4 per 100 person-years with placebo, 5 per 100 person-years with 80 mg, and 8 per 100 person-years with 100 mg; diarrhea and nausea were the most common reasons for discontinuation, which reinforces early symptom management and dose consideration in those with prominent GI intolerance [^114tmaSj].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring guidance to translate this into practice. AASLD recommends hepatic function panel testing at baseline and periodically, for example at 3, 6, and 12 months, with discontinuation if clinically significant hepatotoxicity occurs per DILI criteria; after 12 months, continued periodic monitoring every 6 months is suggested, and thyroid function should be assessed at baseline with standard monitoring in patients with known thyroid disease [^113kRxoa] [^116SScuE] [^1112h2vS].

> Let me synthesize the common side effect profile succinctly. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal — diarrhea and nausea — which are usually mild to moderate, occur early, and often resolve within weeks. Other frequent events include pruritus, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and dizziness, while serious adverse events are comparable to placebo but with labeled warnings for hepatotoxicity and symptomatic gallstone disease. Thyroid function is generally maintained with a small risk of new hypothyroidism, and early transient ALT/AST rises can occur but typically normalize without intervention [^1177184Y] [^114tmaSj] [^112t1z6o].

> Finally, I should confirm dose-related nuances and practical counseling. Higher doses are associated with somewhat higher rates of GI adverse events and discontinuation, so starting at the weight-based dose and managing symptoms proactively is reasonable. Given the early onset of GI effects, short-term dose interruption or supportive measures can improve adherence, and patients should be counseled that diarrhea tends to improve after the first 12 weeks, which can aid persistence with therapy [^114tmaSj] [^112pJmyf].

Resmetirom (Rezdiffra) is **generally well tolerated** in MASH patients, with **gastrointestinal side effects** (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation) as the most common and usually mild to moderate [^1177184Y] [^114tmaSj]. Early, transient **ALT/AST elevations** occur in ~10–15% and typically normalize without stopping therapy [^112t1z6o] [^1122TZQw]. Serious adverse events are uncommon and similar to placebo, but **gallbladder-related events** (symptomatic gallstones, cholecystitis) and rare hepatotoxicity can occur, warranting monitoring and caution in patients with gallstone disease or cirrhosis [^114tmaSj] [^1177184Y]. Thyroid function shifts (free T4 down, TSH/T3 stable) are usually subclinical, and dose adjustments are advised with CYP2C8 inhibitors or high-dose statins [^113Hid7o] [^112t1z6o].

---

## Gastrointestinal side effects

Gastrointestinal symptoms are the **most frequently reported** side effects of resmetirom, typically occurring early in treatment and often resolving with continued use or dose adjustment [^1177184Y].

- **Diarrhea**: Occurs in approximately 24–34% of patients, typically mild to moderate, with a median duration of 15–20 days. Incidence decreases significantly after the initial 12 weeks of treatment [^1177184Y] [^112pJmyf].

- **Nausea**: Reported in 12–22% of patients, usually mild and transient [^1177184Y] [^112i2a9i].

- **Abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation**: These symptoms are reported less frequently but are generally mild and manageable [^113y6t7d] [^1122TZQw].

---

## Hepatic side effects

Resmetirom is associated with **transient elevations** in liver enzymes, particularly ALT and AST, typically occurring within the first 4 weeks of treatment [^112t1z6o]. These elevations are usually mild (less than 1.5 times baseline) and return to baseline within approximately 8 weeks without requiring discontinuation of therapy [^112t1z6o] [^116SScuE]. Rare cases of **hepatotoxicity** have been reported, including a single case of severe hepatotoxicity with jaundice (bilirubin 15 times the upper limit of normal) [^1177184Y]. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended during treatment [^113kRxoa].

---

## Gallbladder-related adverse events

Resmetirom has been associated with an **increased incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease**, including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis [^1177184Y]. Patients with pre-existing gallstones or a history of biliary colic are not contraindicated from receiving resmetirom, but caution is advised [^1177184Y].

---

## Thyroid function alterations

Resmetirom, as a selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, can cause **modest reductions in free thyroxine (FT4) levels** [^112t1z6o]. Clinical hypothyroidism is rare (approximately 1.8% of patients), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels generally remain within normal limits [^116s3Nwt]. Routine thyroid function monitoring is not required for patients without pre-existing thyroid disease, but baseline assessment is recommended [^1112h2vS] [^111vxTZP].

---

## Serious adverse events

Serious adverse events occur at rates similar to placebo in clinical trials, with no significant increase in overall incidence among patients receiving resmetirom [^1164Skao]. The most commonly reported serious adverse events include **gallbladder-related events** and rare cases of hepatotoxicity [^1177184Y].

---

## Drug interactions

Resmetirom is metabolized by **CYP2C8**, and concomitant use of CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. clopidogrel) may necessitate dose adjustments [^113Hid7o]. Additionally, resmetirom may interact with statins, requiring careful monitoring and dose adjustments to maintain cardiovascular risk management targets [^113kRxoa] [^112RUw5m].

### A perfect MASH comparing resmetirom and GLP-1 agonists for metabolic-associated steatohepatitis: what does the current evidence suggest? [^1145Bp4X]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease recently due to the rise of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. It will continue to have a major impact on health care systems globally given its association with cardiovascular disease and liver-related complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, promising pharmacotherapies have emerged to address MASLD and fibrosis, such as resmetirom and glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists. There are ongoing studies to better understand resmetirom, glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists, and other possible pharmacotherapies. We discuss the current available literature on resmetirom, glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists, their safety and efficacy among patients with MASLD. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to guide clinicians on which currently available pharmacological therapy to select for effective management of MASLD.

8 PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

The drugs that have been used in the management of MASLD with no substantial supportive evidence for continued use include vitamin E, ursodeoxycholic acid, omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, silymarin and orlistat. A farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, obeticholic acid, has some evidence to modulate bile acid synthesis and to improve insulin sensitivity, thus reducing hepatic steatosis.

Several off‐label medications such as metformin, GLP‐1 RA, sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, vitamin E, pioglitazone and ezetimibe have also been in use with levels that suggest some benefits. None of the existing anti‐hyperglycaemic agents have proven direct hepatic benefits in MASLD. However, GLP‐1 RA, pioglitazone, SGLT2i and metformin are preferred for treating hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM and MASLD as they might have additional hepatic benefits. Insulin therapy is recommended in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Promising agents that provide direct hepatic benefits include resmetirom (Table 6). Resmetirom has demonstrated improvement in hepatic fibrosisand is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NASH with fibrosis. Unlike other treatments, resmetirom does not target insulin resistance. As a partial agonist of THR‐β, resmetirom promotes lipophagy and hepatic fatty acid β‐oxidation, thereby reducing liver fat. However, resmetirom is currently unavailable in India and poses a substantial economic burden.

In India, Saroglitazar (4 mg/day), a peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor (PPAR)‐α/γ agonist, is approved for treating MASLD and MASH. Its safety and efficacy were evaluated in a 52‐week, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 3 clinical trial involving 102 adults with biopsy‐confirmed NASH (fibrosis stages 1–3) and a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of ≥ 4. The trial showed that 52.3% of patients on Saroglitazar achieved a ≥ 2 decrease in NAS, across at least two components, without worsening fibrosis, compared to 23.5% on placebo (p = 0.0427). Currently, Saroglitazar is only available in India, and more long‐term data, especially on renal and cardiovascular safety, are needed.

### Expert panel recommendations: practical clinical applications for initiating and monitoring resmetirom in patients with MASH / NASH and moderate to noncirrhotic advanced fibrosis [^1133QdYM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease affects 1 in 4 people in the United States and western Europe, with an important proportion developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the progressive subtype of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Cirrhosis caused by MASH is a leading indication for liver transplantation and the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hitherto, there have been no specific pharmacotherapies for MASH. The recent conditional approval by the Food and Drug Administration of resmetirom for the treatment of moderate or advanced MASH presents a much-anticipated therapeutic option for patients with noncirrhotic advanced MASH. Specifically, the intended population for resmetirom are patients with MASH and fibrosis stages 2 or 3. The approval of resmetirom also presents important challenges, including how to noninvasively identify patients with fibrosis stages 2–3, and how to exclude patients with more advanced disease who should not be treated until further data emerge on the use of resmetirom in this population. Herein we consider the available literature with regard to identifying the intended population for treatment with resmetirom and in proposing criteria for stopping treatment.

### Resmetirom therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: October 2024 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^113kRxoa]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Practice recommendations — on-treatment monitoring and coadministration: Hepatic function panel testing should be obtained at baseline and at periodic intervals (eg, 3, 6, and 12 months) to determine response and adverse events while on resmetirom therapy, and resmetirom should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity develops as defined by the AASLD drug-induced liver injury practice guidance. There are insufficient data to make a recommendation on monitoring after 12 months of resmetirom treatment but continued monitoring with hepatic function panel testing every 6 months is suggested. Among persons with known thyroid disease, standard laboratory monitoring (eg, TSH and free T4) per established guidelines is recommended while receiving resmetirom therapy. Resmetirom can be used concurrently with statins; however, practitioners should be aware of the maximum recommended daily dosages, including atorvastatin 40 mg/d, pravastatin 40 mg/d, rosuvastatin 20 mg/d, and simvastatin 20 mg/d, and continued attention to comorbidity management including hyperlipidemia is recommended particularly if the statin dose is modified at the outset of resmetirom therapy.

### The inherent value of treating MASH… [^115BBzb2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The authors concluded that resmetirom was not cost-effective at a $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold, adding that the conclusion was sensitive to model assumptions. We too previously shared this concern, as it reflects the variation in care practices in the United States. 5 Another assumption was that the authors chose not to include cardiovascular events in the model despite cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death among people living with MASLD, and that the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 24 weeks in the MAESTRO-NASH trial showed a significant difference between 80 mg and 100 mg of resmetirom, compared with placebo. There are other important considerations worth exploring. In the model, the authors included that patients would discontinue resmetirom at a constant rate of 21. 3%/year.

While there is likely to be an initial high resmetirom discontinuation rate, particularly among individuals who experience adverse events from drug initiation, this is unlikely to remain a recurring constant, and scenarios adjusting for differing sensitivity discontinuation rates may have been more robust. Moreover, Le et al3 assumed that resmetirom might need to be taken for life among their model's cohort, which is likely an oversimplification given the available therapies for common MASH comorbidities that can be taken in combination and may lead to improved fibrosis and treatment discontinuation. These include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes, 6 weight loss, and CVD, with combined GLP-1 receptor agonists/gastric inhibitory polypeptide agonists for T2D and obesity.

Other disease-specific pharmacological therapies, such as pioglitazone for T2D and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for CVD and T2D, may improve MASH-specific parameters and improve all-cause outcomes. Therefore, a challenge in estimating the effectiveness of resmetirom in the United States is accounting for how combination therapies contribute to improved liver health outcomes, as it is unlikely that the general population will mirror the MAESTRO-NASH trial population. This is emphasized by a recent publication7 reviewing resmetirom prescribing trends, which highlighted similar AEs but disproportionate discontinuation rates than those reported in the trial.

### AASLD practice statement on the evaluation and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children [^116quGY2]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Medications for other approved indications — resmetirom: Pediatric providers may manage patients into early adulthood generally up to 22 years of age, and patients ≥ 18 years of age may meet criteria for adult‑approved treatments; resmetirom is approved for adults (≥ 18 y) with MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (F2–F3) in conjunction with diet and exercise, has shown significant improvements versus placebo in an ongoing phase 3 trial, but safety and efficacy are not established in pediatric patients < 18 years of age.

### Similar weight loss with semaglutide regardless of diabetes and cardiometabolic risk parameters in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: post hoc analysis of three randomised controlled trials [^1173xbn2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly known as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease)is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and liver‐related morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for MASLD include other metabolic conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis)is the more severe form of the spectrum of MASLD, characterised by the presence of steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and varying degrees of fibrosis. People with MASLD and MASH are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, partially mediated by their association with type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and obesity.

Given the historic lack of approved pharmacotherapies, lifestyle changes have been the mainstay of treatment of patients with MASLD/MASH. Accordingly, current MASLD guidelines primarily recommend a reduced calorie diet and habitual exercise, aiming for a weight reduction of 7%–10% in people with obesity and MASLD/MASH. The benefits of weight loss are well established and include the reduction of steatosis and of plasma aminotransferase levels, lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease, and MASH resolution. Resmetirom is the only pharmacotherapy provisionally approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2024 for the treatment of MASH with fibrosis. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analogues, currently licensed for glycaemic control and weight loss in type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity, are now undergoing clinical trials on liver clinical outcomes (i.e. progression to cirrhosis and complications).

### Dapagliflozin and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis [^111vyqwr]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have grown in importance for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, showing proven efficacy in heart failure and chronic kidney disease. In addition to glycaemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors have improved lipid profile and blood pressure, induced modest weight loss, and offered cardiorenal protection — even in patients without diabetes.

Before this trial, evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with MASLD and MASH was limited and mostly exploratory, constrained by small sample sizes, limitations in study design, or non-histological endpoints.

After years without effective therapeutic options, two drugs from different classes have recently shown benefits and favourable safety profiles in people with MASH. Resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor β (THRβ) agonist, is the first drug approved in the US for this population. Meanwhile, semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has shown improvements in liver histology in a phase 3 trial.

As is often the case at this stage of clinical research, head-to-head comparisons are not feasible; however, all three drugs have shown encouraging treatment effects.

For the outcome of MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis, the absolute differences in response rates versus placebo were 15% for dapagliflozin, 29% for semaglutide, and 20% for resmetirom. For fibrosis improvement without worsening of steatohepatitis, the corresponding differences were 25% for dapagliflozin, 14% for semaglutide, and 12% for resmetirom. Of note, the dapagliflozin trial included younger patients who were predominantly male and of Asian descent, with a lower body mass index, a lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and less fibrosis than participants in the resmetirom and semaglutide trials.

### A pragmatic management approach for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatosis and steatohepatitis [^112trSQE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity and associated insulin resistance induce a chronic metaboinflammatory state that lead to injury and dysfunction of multiple organs resulting in a cluster of noncommunicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a histologically active form of MASLD and characterized by greater injury and inflammation and progresses to cirrhosis with greater certainty than steatosis alone. The progression to cirrhosis is characterized by increasing fibrosis. The goal of treatment of MASLD/MASH was to improve the metaboinflammatory state i.e., the root cause of the liver disease and to prevent fibrosis progression to cirrhosis whereas in those who already have cirrhosis need additional care to prevent portal hypertension-related outcomes. Fibrosis regression is thus a key objective of treatment. The recent approval of resmetirom for MASH with fibrosis and the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased awareness of these NCDs and resulted in the growing demand for liver assessment and care in obese individuals. Patients with MASLD also have multiple metabolic comorbidities which represent competing threats to life, and the care of the patient requires both assessment of the totality of the risk and a more holistic approach integrating the care of all of the threats to life. Here, we provide a pragmatic and easily implementable risk-based approach to the evaluation and management of MASLD.

MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) steatosis monitoring during resmetirom — use and predictive thresholds: quantitative assessment "should not be a requirement for initiating or continuing resmetirom therapy"; if available, "a repeat test after 52 weeks of therapy may provide useful information to assess the utility of continuing resmetirom therapy". In MAESTRO-NASH, persons "who did not have a 30% or greater reduction in steatosis on MRI-PDFF by week 52 had a histologic response rate that did not differ from that of the placebo group (approximately 10%)", and "among persons who do not achieve a 30% or greater reduction in MRI-PDFF after 1 year of resmetirom therapy, clinicians should take into account these data". Conversely, "a 30% or greater reduction (improvement) in steatosis as determined by MRI-PDFF… was associated with improved histologic outcomes compared with placebo", yet "histologic response rates were still less than 50%, which the writing group considers a positive predictive value insufficiently high to be used alone to predict histologic efficacy".

### Value-based pricing of resmetirom for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^112QTbqA]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), affects one-third of global adults. One-fifth of patients have metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplant (LT), and death. The economic burden of MASLD is substantial, driven by lost productivity and diminished quality of life. MASH is now the second leading cause of LT in the US.

In 2024, a phase 3 randomized clinical trial (RCT)demonstrated that resmetirom slowed fibrosis progression, improved MASH resolution, and decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels compared with placebo. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration approved resmetirom in March 2024, making it the first approved medication for MASH and fibrosis stages F2 and F3. As such, it is very expensive. Although prices paid by insurers are proprietary, the average annual wholesale price on the UpToDate Lexidrug database is $57 670, creating a potential barrier to patient access.

As multiple stakeholders navigate MASLD management in a cost-constrained environment, understanding the economic value of resmetirom is important. Previous analyses, assuming a drug price of $19 011/year, have produced incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from cost-saving to $53 000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and have suggested an annual drug price as high as $55 000 could be cost-effective. Such estimates depend on assumptions about treatment effectiveness and MASLD's natural history, which are evolving. To inform pricing strategies and health care policy decisions, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of resmetirom using recent data on MASLD's natural history and treatment efficacy. We also determined the price threshold at which resmetirom would be considered cost-effective in the United States.

Practice recommendations — pretreatment considerations: Resmetirom is not recommended for persons with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, concomitant uncontrolled active liver diseases, or ongoing alcohol consumption greater than 20 g/d for women or greater than 30 g/d for men. Thyroid function assessment is recommended before initiating resmetirom treatment, and for persons with untreated hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, resmetirom initiation is not recommended until thyroid function is optimized. Resmetirom initiation is not recommended for patients with symptomatic gallstone-related conditions such as acute cholecystitis.

For the prevention and treatment of MAFLD, updated guidelines have been proposed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (2023), and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (2024). The management of MAFLD is mainly characterized by lifestyle interventions such as control of caloric intake and moderate‐intensity exercise. In terms of pharmacological interventions, recently the Food and Drug Administration of the United States approved for the first time the marketing of Resmetirom, an oral selective agonist of thyroid hormone receptor β targeting the liver, which was able to significantly improve the manifestations of fatty liver pathology in patients, as well as lowering cardiovascular health‐related markers such as low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and demonstrated a favorable safety profile.

### Actions of thyroid hormones and thyromimetics on the liver [^115ijH3j]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine) are pivotal for metabolic balance in the liver and entire body. Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis can contribute to hepatic metabolic disturbances, affecting lipid metabolism, glucose regulation and protein synthesis. In addition, reductions in circulating and intrahepatic thyroid hormone concentrations increase the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease by inducing lipotoxicity, inflammation and fibrosis. Amelioration of hepatic metabolic disease by thyroid hormones in preclinical and clinical studies has spurred the development of thyromimetics that target THRB (the predominant thyroid hormone receptor isoform in the liver) and/or the liver itself to provide more selective activation of hepatic thyroid hormone-regulated metabolic pathways while reducing thyrotoxic side effects in tissues that predominantly express THRA such as the heart and bone. Resmetirom, a liver and THRB-selective thyromimetic, recently became the first FDA-approved drug for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Thus, a better understanding of the metabolic actions of thyroid hormones and thyromimetics in the liver is timely and clinically relevant. Here, we describe the roles of thyroid hormones in normal liver function and pathogenesis of MASH, as well as some potential clinical issues that might arise when treating patients with MASH with thyroid hormone supplementation or thyromimetics.

Resmetirom in MASH — adult 52‑week outcomes, dosing, and safety — Resmetirom treatment for 52 weeks met the primary endpoints of MASH resolution and/or fibrosis improvement, with MASH resolution achieved in 25.9% of patients receiving 80 mg and 29.9% of patients receiving 100 mg, compared to 9.7% of patients receiving placebo (p < 0.0001 vs placebo for both); fibrosis improvement was observed in 24.2% (80 mg) and 25.9% (100 mg) of Resmetirom-treated patients versus 14.2% of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.0002 and p < 0.0001 vs. placebo, respectively). The recommended daily dose of Resmetirom is 80 mg for individuals weighing less than 100 kg and 100 mg for those weighing 100 kg or more; it is weight-neutral, has not been tested in clinical trials involving children and is currently only approved for adult use. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, and vomiting; individuals receiving Resmetirom should be monitored for gastrointestinal side effects and thyroid hormone function, and Resmetirom is not approved for patients with cirrhosis.

### A phase 3, randomized, controlled trial of resmetirom in NASH with liver fibrosis [^1164Skao]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive liver disease with no approved treatment. Resmetirom is an oral, liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist in development for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis.

Methods

We are conducting an ongoing phase 3 trial involving adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH and a fibrosis stage of F1B, F2, or F3 (stages range from F0 [no fibrosis] to F4 [cirrhosis]). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive once-daily resmetirom at a dose of 80 mg or 100 mg or placebo. The two primary end points at week 52 were NASH resolution (including a reduction in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] activity score by ≥ 2 points; scores range from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease) with no worsening of fibrosis, and an improvement (reduction) in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score.

Results

Overall, 966 patients formed the primary analysis population (322 in the 80-mg resmetirom group, 323 in the 100-mg resmetirom group, and 321 in the placebo group). NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 25.9% of the patients in the 80-mg resmetirom group and 29.9% of those in the 100-mg resmetirom group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). Fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score was achieved in 24.2% of the patients in the 80-mg resmetirom group and 25.9% of those in the 100-mg resmetirom group, as compared with 14.2% of those in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). The change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels from baseline to week 24 was -13.6% in the 80-mg resmetirom group and -16.3% in the 100-mg resmetirom group, as compared with 0.1% in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). Diarrhea and nausea were more frequent with resmetirom than with placebo. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar across trial groups: 10.9% in the 80-mg resmetirom group, 12.7% in the 100-mg resmetirom group, and 11.5% in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Both the 80-mg dose and the 100-mg dose of resmetirom were superior to placebo with respect to NASH resolution and improvement in liver fibrosis by at least one stage. (Funded by Madrigal Pharmaceuticals; MAESTRO-NASH ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03900429.).

### Resmetirom (MGL-3196) for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112i2a9i]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterised by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular injury, and progressive liver fibrosis. Resmetirom (MGL-3196) is a liver-directed, orally active, selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist designed to improve NASH by increasing hepatic fat metabolism and reducing lipotoxicity. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of resmetirom in patients with NASH.

Methods

MGL-3196–05 was a 36-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at 25 centres in the USA. Adults with biopsy confirmed NASH (fibrosis stages 1–3) and hepatic fat fraction of at least 10% at baseline when assessed by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 by a computer-based system to receive resmetirom 80 mg or matching placebo, orally once a day. Serial hepatic fat measurements were obtained at weeks 12 and 36, and a second liver biopsy was obtained at week 36. The primary endpoint was relative change in MRI-PDFF assessed hepatic fat compared with placebo at week 12 in patients who had both a baseline and week 12 MRI-PDFF. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02912260.

Findings

348 patients were screened and 84 were randomly assigned to resmetirom and 41 to placebo at 18 sites in the USA. Resmetirom-treated patients (n = 78) showed a relative reduction of hepatic fat compared with placebo (n = 38) at week 12 (-32.9% resmetirom vs -10.4% placebo; least squares mean difference -22.5%, 95% CI -32.9 to -12.2; p < 0.0001) and week 36 (-37.3% resmetirom [n = 74] vs -8.5 placebo [n = 34]; -28.8%, -42.0 to -15.7; p < 0.0001). Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate and were balanced between groups, except for a higher incidence of transient mild diarrhoea and nausea with resmetirom.

Interpretation

Resmetirom treatment resulted in significant reduction in hepatic fat after 12 weeks and 36 weeks of treatment in patients with NASH. Further studies of resmetirom will allow assessment of safety and effectiveness of resmetirom in a larger number of patients with NASH with the possibility of documenting associations between histological effects and changes in non-invasive markers and imaging.

Regarding medical management for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to resmetirom, EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering resmetirom in patients with non-cirrhotic MASLD and documentation of either:

- advanced fibrosis

- at-risk steatohepatitis with significant fibrosis (by liver biopsy, when available, or by noninvasive panels validated for that purpose)

- risk of adverse liver-related outcomes (such as by elastography- or biomarker-defined thresholds).

### Value-based pricing of resmetirom for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^111X55Qm]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Resmetirom can slow fibrosis progression and improve resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). As the first Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic treatment for MASH and fibrosis stages F2 and F3, resmetirom is very expensive, potentially creating a financial barrier to patient access.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of resmetirom vs standard of care (SoC) over a lifetime and to determine a price threshold at which resmetirom would be cost-effective.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation used an agent-based state-transition microsimulation model with a yearly cycle and 14 distinct histologically defined health states: metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MALSD) or F0, MASH, fibrosis stages F1 to F3 with or without MASH, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver transplant, and liver-related and other-cause death. The simulated cohort included US adults who entered the model with MASH and fibrosis stage F2 or F3. The study was conducted from March to December 2024.

Exposures

Resmetirom vs SoC.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Costs (in 2023 US dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (calculated as incremental costs divided by incremental QALYs).

Results

A cohort of 200 000 patients (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [10.5] years; 89 000 [44.5%] male; 132 600 [66.2%] with MASH-F3) was simulated. Compared with SoC, resmetirom was associated with a gain of 0.26 QALYs/patient. Lifetime drug cost was $54 754, and treatment saved $18 499 in MASLD-related medical costs for a total incremental cost of $36 255 per patient. The ICER was $140 134/QALY. At willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50 000/QALY, $100 000/QALY, and $150 000/QALY, the maximal annual prices of resmetirom were $10 914, $15 406, and $19 879, respectively. The lower the discontinuation rate, the greater the cost-effectiveness and medical cost savings, but the higher the total treatment costs. Without discontinuation, the ICER would be $318 740/QALY, supporting a price between $5645 and $10 619 per year at WTP thresholds of $50 000/QALY and $150 000/QALY, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this economic evaluation, resmetirom was not cost-effective at a $100 000/QALY WTP threshold. The conclusion was sensitive to model assumptions, especially the discontinuation rate. More data on the long-term effectiveness of resmetirom on MASLD progression and non-MASLD complications would be necessary to accurately determine the economic value of resmetirom.

AASLD MASLD guidance — endocrinologic considerations with resmetirom: "13% of participants in the MAESTRO-NASH trial were receiving treatment for hypothyroidism at enrollment with thyroid hormone therapy dosages up to 75 μg/d". Exclusions included "TSH > 10 mIU/L without symptoms, or TSH > 7 mIU/L with symptoms". During therapy, "the mean plasma free T4 concentration decreased approximately 16% to 21% (up to 24% in those receiving levothyroxine)", while "TSH and T3 also changed slightly but consistently remained within the normal ranges". "Development of hypothyroidism requiring levothyroxine replacement occurred in 1.8% of participants receiving resmetirom". "The FDA integrated review of resmetirom concluded that thyroid axis function was maintained during resmetirom therapy and recommended no thyroid-specific management". Therefore, "abnormal thyroid function (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism) should be addressed before initiating resmetirom therapy, which necessitates thyroid function assessment with at least TSH level at baseline or up to 6 months prior".

### Resmetirom (Rezdiffra) [^1132Lzwa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 8 presents the Month 12 histopathology results comparing REZDIFFRA with placebo on 1) the percentage of patients with resolution of steatohepatitis and no worsening of liver fibrosis and 2) the percentage of patients with at least one stage improvement in liver fibrosis and no worsening of steatohepatitis. Two pathologists, Pathologist A and Pathologist B, independently read the liver biopsies for each patient. Both the 80 mg once daily and the 100 mg once daily dosages of REZDIFFRA demonstrated improvement on these histopathology endpoints at Month 12 compared to placebo. In a statistical analysis incorporating both pathologists' independent readings, REZDIFFRA achieved statistical significance on both histopathology endpoints for both doses.

Examination of age, gender, diabetes status (Yes or No), and fibrosis stage (F2 or F3) subgroups did not identify differences in response to REZDIFFRA among these subgroups. The majority of patients in the trial were white (89%); there were too few patients of other races to adequately assess differences in response by race.

Starting at Month 3 and through Month 12, there was a trend of greater reductions from baseline in average ALT and AST in the REZDIFFRA groups as compared to the placebo group.

Practice recommendations — determination of efficacy and futility: The following recommendations are based on data at 52 weeks after resmetirom treatment initiation, and since the MAESTRO-NASH trial is ongoing these recommendations may change when longer-term data become available. In persons whose treatment candidacy was determined by liver stiffness measurements (VCTE or MRE), a repeat measurement at 12 months of therapy is recommended to assess for treatment response, and in the absence of resmetirom-specific data the writing group suggests that improvement (or worsening) of VCTE of at least 25% or MRE of at least 20% from baseline represents a significant change beyond individual measurement variability. Continuation of resmetirom treatment in persons with significant fibrosis improvement is recommended, whereas among persons with evidence of worsening liver disease at 12 months of treatment, discontinuation of resmetirom should be considered and worsening can include consistent increase in ALT or liver fibrosis progression as assessed by NILDA. Among persons without clear evidence of liver disease improvement or worsening, the decision to continue therapy should be based on holistic assessment.

Figure 1 highlights the quality assessment of the included studies, indicating a generally low risk of bias across most domains. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment were rated as low risk in the majority of studies, ensuring methodological rigor. However, some studies had unclear risks in allocation concealment and performance bias due to incomplete reporting. Selective reporting and attrition bias were minimal, with most studies providing comprehensive data. Overall, the included studies exhibited acceptable quality, supporting the reliability of the network meta‐analysis findings (Figure 2).

The SUCRA analysis for liver steatosis resolution indicates that resmetirom was the most effective treatment for reducing liver fat content, with a SUCRA value of 82.9 and a mean rank of 4.3. Efinopegdutide (SUCRA: 63.1, mean rank: 8.0) and N‐3 (SUCRA: 57.1, mean rank: 9.1) also demonstrated strong efficacy. Other treatments such as pegozafermin (SUCRA: 52.5), semaglutide (SUCRA: 54.1) and tropifexor (SUCRA: 52.0) showed moderate effectiveness compared with placebo (SUCRA: 41.2, mean rank: 12.2). These results suggest that treatments targeting metabolic and fibrotic pathways, such as resmetirom and efinopegdutide, are particularly promising for addressing steatosis in MASLD (Figure 3A).

### Effect of dapagliflozin on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial [^11755Jey]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) is a progressive liver disease characterised by hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning, with faster fibrosis progression than metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). The condition affects more than 5% of adults and more than 30% of individuals with diabetes or obesity.MASH can progress to cirrhosis in up to 25% of individuals, and is closely associated with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

To date, therapeutic options for MASH are limited. Pioglitazone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist, and glucagon receptor agonist (ie, liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide, and survodutide) may be considered as possible treatment options, with management focused on treatment of coexisting conditions such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. In 2024, the first therapeutic drug, resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor β-selective agonist, was approved for the treatment of MASH in the USA. However, its long term safety for MASH remains uncertain.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are now widely used to treat type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, but their effects on MASH remain to be determined. SGLT2 inhibitors modulate energy homoeostasis, improve insulin resistance, and exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-fibrotic effects, which counteract the pathogenic characteristics of MASH. Several clinical studies have reported that SGLT2 inhibitors can improve liver fat content, liver enzymes, and liver stiffness in participants with MASLD or MASH. Two small clinical trials have reported inconsistent findings of SGLT2 inhibitors (ipragliflozin and tofogliflozin) on liver histological features among people with diabetes and MASLD, but no trial has been conducted among participants with biopsy diagnosed MASH. Therefore, high quality evidence is required to develop clinical guidelines for SGLT2 inhibitors in MASH treatment. We conducted a randomised, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in participants with biopsy confirmed non-cirrhotic MASH.

### Clinical insights on resmetirom: clinical indications, patient selection, and monitoring response to therapy [^117KWnCd]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The recent conditional approval by the Food and Drug Administration of resmetirom for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with significant or advanced fibrosis represents a pivotal milestone in the history of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) treatment. As the first liver-directed pharmacological therapy option for MASLD, resmetirom offers a novel approach that specifically targets liver pathology, marking a transformative step forward in managing this widespread and challenging condition. For initiating therapy with resmetirom, a liver biopsy is not required. Consequently, accurately excluding patients with less severe liver histology or cirrhosis using noninvasive tests (NITs) is essential. In addition, monitoring the therapy response should be conducted using NITs. Given the recent approval, our current clinical understanding of resmetirom is primarily informed by phase 3 clinical trials. The long-term effects of the drug should be evaluated in further studies by encouraging the use of the drug in eligible patients. This review highlights key aspects of clinical resmetirom use, including identifying the target population, monitoring therapeutic response, determining appropriate discontinuation criteria, and strategies to prevent unnecessary treatment interruptions.

### Resmetirom for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113y6t7d]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive liver disease with no approved treatment. MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 was a 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluating the safety of resmetirom in adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and presumed NASH. Patients were randomized to three double-blind arms (100mg resmetirom (n = 325), 80mg resmetirom (n = 327) or placebo (n = 320)) or open-label 100mg resmetirom (n = 171). The primary end point was incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over 52 weeks and key secondary end points were LDL-C, apoB, triglycerides (over 24 weeks), hepatic fat (over 16 and 52 weeks) and liver stiffness (over 52 weeks). Resmetirom was safe and well tolerated. TEAEs occurred in 86.5% (open-label 100mg resmetirom), 86.1% (100mg resmetirom), 88.4% (80mg resmetirom) and 81.8% (placebo) of patients. TEAEs in excess of placebo included diarrhea and nausea at the initiation of treatment. Key secondary end points included least square means difference from placebo at 80mg, 100mg resmetirom: LDL-C (-11.1%, -12.6%), apoB (-15.6%, -18.0%), triglycerides (-15.4%, -20.4%), 16-week hepatic fat (-34.9%, -38.6%), (P < 0.0001) and liver stiffness (-1.02, -1.70) and 52-week hepatic fat (-28.8, -33.9). These findings demonstrate resmetirom was safe and well tolerated in adults with presumed NASH, supporting a role for further clinical development. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04197479).

INTRODUCTION

Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, closely associated with the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes. – MASLD is an umbrella term that includes hepatic steatosis, and its inflammatory form, termed metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. The unmet need to treat MASH and its associated comorbidities has driven drug development efforts worldwide. A turning point in this journey was the recent conditional approval of resmetirom by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MASH in those with moderate to advanced fibrosis without cirrhosis.

Newer therapies are being developed that target different mechanistic pathways to address the unmet need for greater improvements in fibrosis and MASH resolution beyond what is currently achieved with resmetirom alone. Several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs in phase IIB have displayed positive results in achieving the histologic endpoints proposed by the FDA. – Improvements in liver histology using paired biopsy have been used as a surrogate indicator of clinical benefit for liver-related outcomes in the regulatory process for accelerated drug approval, pending further long-term validation. With multiple exciting new results from recent trials, there is an unmet need to understand the efficacy of different pharmacological agents for treating MASH. These data will also help determine potential future combination therapeutic approaches in MASH to further improve treatment response rates. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine and rank the efficacy of pharmacological therapies for improving histologic outcomes in MASH.

### New and emerging treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis [^1119pPtp]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a leading etiology of chronic liver disease worldwide, with increasing incidence and prevalence in the setting of the obesity epidemic. MASH is also a leading indication for liver transplantation, given its associated risk of progression to end-stage liver disease. A key challenge in managing MASH is the lack of approved pharmacotherapy. In its absence, lifestyle interventions with a focus on healthy nutrition and regular physical activity have been the cornerstone of therapy. Real-world efficacy and sustainability of lifestyle interventions are low, however. Pharmacotherapy development for MASH is emerging with promising data from several agents with different mechanisms of action (MOAs) in phase 3 clinical trials. In this review, we highlight ongoing challenges and potential solutions in drug development for MASH and provide an overview of available data from emerging therapies across multiple MOAs.

### Value-based pricing of resmetirom for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^116r27Ku]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The cost-effectiveness was sensitive to changes in treatment efficacy, particularly to the efficacy in improving MASH-F3, which changed the ICER by more than 30%. Plausible variations in the efficacy of MASH resolution changed the ICER by 20%. We assumed treatment efficacy remained stable over time and treatment had favorable effects on fibrosis and MASH even after patients moved to fibrosis stages F0 and F1. Long-term clinical trial data will confirm whether this important assumption holds. The ICER was also sensitive to changes in utility of non–MASH-F1 and F2. Because quality-of-life data for people with F1 and F2 without MASH are not available, we assumed their quality of life would be no worse than those with MASH. Further studies on quality of life for these patients are necessary to inform future cost-effectiveness analyses of MASLD treatments. Finally, disease progression could impact cost-effectiveness. At progression rates estimated from RCTs, resmetirom was more beneficial, with an ICER of $101 135/QALY. However, because patients in RCTs often have more severe disease not representative of the overall population, these progression probabilities are likely overestimated. In patients with coexisting MASLD and T2D, who were assumed to have faster disease progression than those with MASLD alone, the ICER was $86 131/QALY. This suggests that resmetirom may provide greater value in this subgroup, despite the RCT reporting similar efficacy in patients with T2D and the overall trial population — all of whom had well-controlled blood glucose. Future studies should examine whether disease progression and treatment response in patients with poorly controlled diabetes influence resmetirom's cost-effectiveness.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) — Resmetirom (Rezdiffra), a partial agonist of thyroid hormone receptor Beta (THR-β), is described as the only FDA-approved medication for MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis in adults and under accelerated approval only in adults, with weight-based dosing of ≤ 100 kg: 80 mg once daily or ≥ 100 kg: 100 mg once daily. Pediatric weight effect is listed as WEIGHT NEUTRAL and there are no pediatric studies. In adult studies (MASTRO 3 TRIAL), MASH resolution occurred in 25.9% on 80 mg and 29.9% on 100 mg, and fibrosis improvement at least 1 stage was 24.2% on 80 mg and 25.9% on 100 mg, compared to 14.2% on placebo. Adverse effects reported in > 5% include diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and dizziness, and ALT/AST increases were observed in the first 4 weeks with a mean increase less than 1.5 times baseline at 4 weeks, returning to baseline around 8 weeks after initiation.

In this economic evaluation, at a price of $19 011/year, resmetirom was not cost-effective compared with standard-of-care treatment at a $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year willingness-to-pay threshold. This conclusion was sensitive to the discontinuation rate and other model assumptions.

Meanings

These findings suggest that resmetirom does not provide good value for money at its current price; however, given the sensitivity of cost-effectiveness to the discontinuation rate and other variables, better data about patient adherence and clinical treatment efficacy are important.

### Hepatic fat reduction due to resmetirom in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is associated with improvement of quality of life [^114XKHf4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease associated with adverse clinical outcomes and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL).

Methods

Patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic NASH with hepatic fat fraction of ≥ 10% by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction were enrolled in a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of resmetirom. HRQL was assessed using Short Form-36 throughout 36 weeks of treatment.

Results

One hundred twenty-five NASH patients were enrolled (50 ± 11 years old, 50% male, 94% white, body mass index 35 ± 6 kg/m 2, 39% with diabetes mellitus). Of these, 84 patients received 80 mg of resmetirom daily, and 41 received placebo. At baseline, HRQL scores were not different from general population norms (Physical Component Summary [PCS] 47.9 ± 9.3 vs 50, Mental Component Summary 50.4 ± 10.0 vs 50; all P > .05). By treatment week 12, patients who received resmetirom experienced improvement of Bodily Pain and Short Form-6D utility scores (P < .05); no HRQL improvement was noted in placebo (all P > .05). Improvement in PCS continued up to week 36 of treatment with resmetirom, again with no improvement in placebo group (all P > .05). Adjusted for the baseline score and clinicodemographic confounders, meeting the endpoint of a decrease in proton density fat fraction of ≥ 30% by week 12 (met by 54 of 116 treatment completers; 47 of 54 on resmetirom) was independently associated with greater improvements in Physical Functioning and PCS scores at week 36 (P < .05). Patients with improvement in NASH and fibrosis on liver biopsy also showed improvement in components of HRQL.

Conclusions

Patients with NASH treated who improved their hepatic fat fraction and/or Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score on serial liver biopsy experienced improvement of HRQL. Further studies are needed to confirm long-term sustainability of that improvement.

### Thyroid hormone action and liver disease, a complex interplay [^114amUDA]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sobetirome completed phase 1 clinical trials in 2008 and demonstrated lipid-lowering effects with both single and multiple dosingwith no phase II trials being planned due to the reported elevation of liver enzymes.

Eprotirome progressed to phase 3 clinical trial but was terminated due to unexpected side effects in animal studies. Four clinical trials were conducted between 2008 and 2012 (identifier: NCT00677248, NTC00776321, NCT00593047, and NCT01410383).

In 2021, Younossi and colleagues studied 125 patients with NASH, of whom 84 were treated with 80 mg/d with resmetirom and 41 with placebo for 36. Compared to placebo, resmetirom-treated patients showed significant improvement of health-related quality of life.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo control in phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02912260), resmetirom was studied in 116 patients with NASH (fibrosis stages 1–3). Seventy-eight patients received 80 mg of resmetirom 38 patients were treated with placebo for 36 weeks. Patients treated with resmetirom (n = 78) showed a relative reduction of hepatic fat at week 12 and week 36. Biopsy performed at 36 weeks showed that histological markers of inflammation were reduced. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate and were balanced between groups, except for a higher incidence of transient mild diarrhea and nausea in the resmetirom-treated group.

Introduction

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic hepatic disorder worldwide, reaching epidemic proportions with a prevalence of 11%–37% in the adult population. MASLD initiates as excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver that progresses toward severe metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), characterized by ≥ 5% hepatic steatosis with inflammation, hepatocyte injury, and fibrosis. At advanced stages, MASH is associated with severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and end-stage liver disease, and with increased mortality rate. The global epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are important risk factors for MASH. In the United States and European Union, about 40 million people are afflicted by MASH.

Despite the increasing prevalence of MASH, until very recently no pharmacotherapies were available and it has been considered an unmet medical need. In March 2024, the FDA approved resmetirom (Rezdiffra), an oral thyroid hormone receptor β agonist, under the accelerated approval pathway, for adults with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis. Nevertheless, in the phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial, just 25%–30% of patients treated with resmetirom showed improvement of the two primary endpoints at week 52. Therefore, because of the heterogeneous nature of the disease and its high prevalence, additional safe, effective, and durable treatment modalities are needed for MASH.

Gene therapy may deliver transformative benefits for MASH patients. Multiple adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based gene therapies have been shown to provide definitive therapeutic benefit for monogenic diseases in the clinical setting. AAV vectors, derived from non-pathogenic viruses, are predominantly non-integrative and able to mediate multi-year generation of therapeutic proteins after a single administration. Such breakthroughs in genetic therapy for rare diseases have laid the groundwork for the development of AAV-based treatments for complex, polygenic, and highly prevalent metabolic diseases.

Figure 2 — Assessment for treatment outcome in patients receiving resmetirom outlines safety monitoring at 3, 6, and 12 months and a response assessment at 12 months using noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver stiffness measure (LSM) by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Worsening of NILDA with a consistent increase in ALT at 12 months leads to "Stop resmetirom". Improvement defined by VCTE ≥ 25% or MRE ≥ 20% from baseline with normalization or significant improvement in ALT leads to "Continue resmetirom". If there is a minor reduction in LSM with VCTE < 25% or MRE < 20% from baseline and/or < 30% reduction in MRI-PDFF, the algorithm advises "Re-evaluate strategy". Treatment-related adverse events are also linked to "Stop resmetirom".

### Resmetirom for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^116nTP7R]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid hormone receptor (THR)-β is responsible for regulating metabolic pathways in the liver and is frequently impaired in NASH. Patients with NASH have reduced levels of thyroid hormone activity in the liver with resultant impaired hepatic function. Resmetirom is an oral, once-daily, liver-targeted THR-β selective agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. In a randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled phase 2 serial liver biopsy trial in adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH, resmetirom-treated patients achieved a significantly greater relative reduction from baseline in hepatic fat (−32.9% versus −10.4%; P < 0.0001). Reduction in hepatic fat of ≥ 30% by resmetirom was associated with an increased rate of NASH resolution (37%) as well as improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs). After completing the phase 2 trial, resmetirom-treated patients who rolled over into a 36-week open-label extension that used higher resmetirom doses of 80 and 100 mg once daily achieved a 50% and 64% relative reduction in hepatic fat, respectively. The potential efficacy and adverse event profile of the phase 2 trials supported the selection of 80 and 100 mg resmetirom for phase 3. MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 is one of four phase 3 trials that have been initiated (MAESTRO-NASH, MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE and MAESTRO-NASH-OUTCOMES) to support an indication for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis.

To increase the overall size of the safety database, MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 was a randomized, DB, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 80 and 100 mg resmetirom versus placebo over 52 weeks of treatment in adults with NAFLD (presumed NASH) diagnosed utilizing noninvasive biomarkers and imaging (as opposed to an invasive diagnostic liver biopsy). Primary, key secondary and secondary end points from MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 are reported here.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^115L3UgU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This study provides valuable insights into the comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for MASLD, identifying resmetirom and pegozafermin as leading options for reducing steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. While most treatments demonstrated favourable safety profiles, careful monitoring is warranted for agents with higher adverse event rates. These findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches that balance efficacy and safety, tailored to individual patient characteristics. Further long‐term studies are needed to confirm the durability of these effects and to expand therapeutic options for diverse patient populations.

### Focused recommendations for the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) by advanced practice providers in the United States [^116XVbNr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has become the dominant cause of liver disease in the United States. With the growing burden of this disease in gastroenterology practices, the identification and treatment of those at risk of developing adverse outcomes (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver-related death) has become urgent. In recent years, the development of noninvasive tests (NITs) to identify "at-risk MASH" patients have provided cost-effective algorithms to identify these patients. Although treatment has historically been limited to lifestyle modification, recent FDA approval of resmetirom for noncirrhosis MASH with stages 2 and 3 fibrosis has provided a new opportunity in the United States to provide these patients with novel treatment options. Other new effective treatment regimens are on the horizon. Given that gastroenterology and hepatology practices in the United States heavily rely on advanced practice providers (APPs) to manage patients with MASLD, the APP Committee of the Global NASH/MASH Council has curated the essentials of day-to-day MASH management for our busy gastrohepatology providers and their APP colleagues. The goal of this document is to equip and mobilize more GI providers with the requisite competencies for the management of at-risk MASH, given the rapidly evolving MASH treatment landscape.

### Resmetirom therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: October 2024 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^112WLEi4]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Practice recommendations — patient selection and dosing: Resmetirom can be considered for treatment of adults with MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with F2-F3). Eligibility includes noninvasive liver disease assessment consistent with MASH with F2-F3 or historical liver biopsy demonstrating MASH with F2-F3. The recommended dosage of resmetirom is 100 mg/d for persons who weigh 100 kg or more, or 80 mg/d for persons who weigh less than 100 kg. If used concurrently with a moderate cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor (eg, clopidogrel), the recommended dosage is 80 mg/d for persons who weigh 100 kg or more or 60 mg/d for persons who weigh less than 100 kg.

### Safety and efficacy of resmetirom in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116usPbR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) affects nearly 38% of the population, potentially progressing to cirrhosis and cancer. Lifestyle changes remain the cornerstone of management, but adherence is challenging, prompting the exploration of therapeutic options. Resmetirom, targeting thyroid hormone receptors, regulates liver enzymes and fat metabolism, showing potential as a treatment for MASH. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the safety of resmetirom in MASH patients. Three randomized controlled trials with adult participants were analyzed, sourced from PubMed and the Cochrane Library until April 2024. Participants received either resmetirom or placebo, and data on adverse effects and efficacy outcomes were extracted. Statistical analyses, including risk ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CI), were performed using Review Manager (version 5.4.1) with a random-effects model. The pooled RR for serious adverse events was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.63–1.14; P = 0.28), indicating no significant difference. However, diarrhea (RR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.41–2.35; P < 0.001) and nausea (RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.31–2.28; P < 0.001) showed higher incidence. No significant differences were found for fatigue (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.77–1.84; P = 0.43) or urinary tract infections (RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.76–1.52; P = 0.69). Liver fat content, lipid profiles, and liver enzymes also showed significant improvement in the resmetirom group. Low heterogeneity across most outcomes indicated consistent findings among the studies. While resmetirom demonstrates efficacy in improving lipid and liver profiles, its increased risk of diarrhea and nausea should be considered in therapeutic decisions.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of REZDIFFRA was evaluated based on an efficacy analysis at Month 12 in Trial 1 (NCT03900429), a 54-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled patients had metabolic risk factors and a baseline or recent liver biopsy showing NASH with fibrosis stage 2 or 3 and a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of at least 4. Efficacy determination was based on the effect of REZDIFFRA on resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis and one stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis, on post-baseline liver biopsies collected at 12 months.

The month 12 analysis included 888 F2 and F3 (at eligibility) patients randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo (n = 294), REZDIFFRA 80 mg once daily (n = 298), or REZDIFFRA 100 mg once daily (n = 296), in addition to lifestyle counseling on nutrition and exercise. Patients were on stable doses of medications for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment and placebo groups. Overall, the median (Q1 to Q3) age of patients at baseline was 58 (51 to 65) years, 56% were female, 21% were Hispanic, 89% were White, 3% were Asian, and 2% were Black or African American. Median (Q1 to Q3) body mass index (BMI) was 35 (31 to 40) kg/m 2 and median (Q1 to Q3) body weight was 99 (85 to 114) kg. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 7.

### Therapeutic landscape of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) [^112YwPFs]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its severe subgroup metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) have become a global epidemic and are driven by chronic overnutrition and multiple genetic susceptibility factors. The physiological outcomes include hepatocyte death, liver inflammation and cirrhosis. The first therapeutic for MASLD and MASH, resmetirom, has recently been approved for clinical use and has energized this therapeutic space. However, there is still much to learn in clinical studies of MASH, such as the scale of placebo responses, optimal trial end points, the time required for fibrosis reversal and side effect profiles. This Review introduces aspects of disease pathogenesis related to drug development and discusses two main therapeutic approaches. Thyroid hormone receptor-β agonists, such as resmetirom, as well as fatty acid synthase inhibitors, target the liver and enable it to function within a toxic metabolic environment. In parallel, incretin analogues such as semaglutide improve metabolism, allowing the liver to self-regulate and reversing many aspects of MASH. We also discuss how combinations of therapeutics could potentially be used to treat patients.

### Health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessments in a 52-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study of resmetirom (MGL-3196) in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and fibrosis [^11554Lqz]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Resmetirom, liver-directed thyroid-hormone receptor-β agonist, received approval for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) treatment. We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with MASH treated with resmetirom.

Approach and Results

Patients with MASH/NASH without cirrhosis and with confirmed/suspected fibrosis were enrolled in a 54-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial with serial biopsy assessments at baseline and week 52 (MAESTRO-NASH, NCT03900429). HRQL was assessed using Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-NASH (CLDQ-NAFLD) and Liver Disease Quality of Life (LDQOL). Baseline HRQL score changes by treatment group (resmetirom 80 mg, resmetirom 100 mg, or placebo) and histological response (improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NAFLD activity score or resolution of MASH/NASH without worsening of fibrosis) were compared after 52 weeks. Included were 966 intention-to-treat patients: 323 received resmetirom 100 mg, 322 resmetirom 80 mg, and 321 placebo. By weeks 24 and 52, patients receiving 80 or 100 mg resmetirom experienced HRQL improvement in CLDQ-NAFLD Worry domain (mean +0.21 to +0.24, p < 0.05). At week 52, subjects who met histologic endpoints after treatment with resmetirom (100 mg and 80 mg pooled) experienced HRQL improvement in CLDQ-NAFLD Worry +0.46 (41% met minimal clinically important difference [MCID]), LDQOL domains: Role Emotional +3.0 (28% met MCID), Health Distress +8.1 (38% MCID), Stigma +3.5 (39% MCID), and total LDQOL +2.2 (35% MCID) (all p < 0.05). Similar improvements were noted in histologic responders from 100 mg or 80 mg resmetirom groups when separated-no improvements in placebo or nonresponders. Baseline F3 histologic responders had similar/more pronounced HRQL improvements.

Conclusions

Patients with MASH/NASH with fibrosis improvement or the resolution of MASH with resmetirom experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant HRQL improvements.

### Comparison of pharmacological therapies in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis for fibrosis regression and MASH resolution: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115eYJui]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In context with current literature

This network meta-analysis builds on previous meta-analyses, and provides updated estimates of the comparative efficacy of studied therapies for MASH by including new data from RCTs. In contrast to the previous study by Majzoub et al, we included only studies that utilize the endpoints currently accepted by the FDA for drug approvaland we used intention-to-treat analysis, considering the worst-case scenario (ie, each dropout as a treatment failure) for a conservative interpretation of the results.

In particular, the results of this network meta-analysis suggest that FGF21 analogs (such as pegozafermin) and glucagon and GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as survodutide and tirzepatide) may improve fibrosis and resolve MASH. However, the available evidence indicates that larger trials are needed to validate these findings before clinical use in MASH. Our data also support the efficacy of the recently approved resmetirom and provide relative efficacy of other drugs in the pipeline.

### Value-based pricing of resmetirom for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^114rHMdp]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Similar to treatments of other chronic diseases, resmetirom might need to be taken for life. One unexpected finding of our study was that the lower the discontinuation rate, the higher the effectiveness and reduction in medical cost, but also the higher the lifetime drug cost. This led to a seemingly counterintuitive finding: the higher the discontinuation rate, the more cost-effective resmetirom became. Because resmetirom rapidly improved fibrosis, while MASLD progressed slowly, lifetime treatment produced only a small incremental health benefit over shorter durations, and this did not justify the high lifetime drug cost. If no patients discontinued treatment, the price would need to be halved from our base-case estimates for resmetirom to remain cost-effective. For example, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY, the annual price would need to decrease from $19 011 to $8100. This raises an important question for future study: what is the optimal treatment duration of resmetirom?

### Resmetirom for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^1147GnZH]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Across the four treatment arms, demographic and baseline characteristics of the safety population were generally comparable (Table 1) with mean age, 56 years; female, 57%; white, 88%; and Hispanic, 34%. High percentages of patients across all four arms had metabolic risk factors including obesity with mean body mass index (BMI) 35 kg m − 2; type 2 diabetes, 49%; dyslipidemia, 88%; and hypertension, 75%. Per protocol, patients with hypothyroidism on thyroxine doses > 75 μg were enrolled in the OL 100 mg resmetirom arm (to allow for comparison with patients not on thyroxine). Patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism on thyroxine doses ≤ 75 μg were enrolled in the DB arms until the protocol was amended near the end of the randomization period to allow patients on thyroxine doses > 75 μg to enroll in the DB arms. As such, 44.4% of patients in the OL 100 mg resmetirom arm were on thyroxine at baseline compared to 10.5–11.9% in the DB arms. Consistent with the higher percentage of patients on thyroxine treatment, a higher percentage of patients in the OL arm were female. Common concomitant medications across the four arms were antidiabetes drugs (such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs), metformin, pioglitazone and sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) and drugs to manage dyslipidemia (statins, 46%). A greater proportion of patients in the OL arm were taking GLP-1 RAs (11.7%) and SGLT2 inhibitors (10.5%) at baseline compared to the three DB arms (6.0–9.3% and 4.7–9.3%, respectively). Demographic and baseline characteristics of the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (which included all randomized patients who received ≥ 1 dose of DB study drug and had a baseline and ≥ 1 post-baseline measurement) are shown in Extended Data Table 1. The demographic and baseline characteristics of the safety and mITT populations were comparable.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in adults: a review [^112n193Z]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) includes a range of liver conditions, progressing from isolated steatosis (characterized by fat accumulation in the liver without inflammation) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which involves fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver. The presence of MASLD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers.

Observations

The most common chronic liver disease worldwide, MASLD affects approximately 30% to 40% of the general adult population globally (with varying prevalence across continents), including approximately 60% to 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes and approximately 70% to 80% of those with obesity. It is typically diagnosed based on an ultrasonographic finding of hepatic steatosis, along with at least 1 of 5 features of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal overweight or obesity, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, hypertension, elevated level of plasma triglycerides, and low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) for women who consume less than 140 g/wk of alcohol (< 2 standard drinks/d) and for men who consume less than 210 g/wk (< 3 standard drinks/d) and have no other known causes of steatosis such as use of a particular medication (eg, corticosteroids, tamoxifen, or methotrexate), hepatitis C, or iron overload. Other risk factors for MASLD include older age (≥ 50 years) and male sex (male:female ratio approximately 2). The Fibrosis-4 index (a scoring system incorporating age, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (a noninvasive imaging technique) are commonly used to stage hepatic fibrosis in patients with MASLD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, followed by certain extrahepatic cancers (primarily gastrointestinal, breast, and gynecologic cancer) and liver-related complications, including cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding), and hepatocellular carcinoma. First-line treatment of MASLD involves behavioral modifications (including hypocaloric low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol) and management of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Bariatric surgery should be considered for patients with MASLD and a body mass index greater than 35. Resmetirom (a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor β-selective agonist) and subcutaneous semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) are conditionally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with MASH who have moderate to advanced fibrosis.

Conclusions

A highly prevalent condition among adults worldwide, MASLD is associated with liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers. First-line treatment includes behavioral modifications, including a weight-reducing diet, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol. Resmetirom and semaglutide are conditionally FDA-approved medications for the treatment of adults with MASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis.

### Resmetirom: the first food and drug administration-approved medication for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [^1143di4X]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the literature leading to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first medication, resmetirom, for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical studies, dosing, and adverse effects. Relevant data will be used to discuss how resmetirom impacts clinical practice.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE from database inception to May 12, 2024. Keywords included non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and resmetirom. Study selection, data extraction and all English-language studies involving the use of resmetirom for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH were included.

Data Synthesis

Resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor agonist, is administered at daily doses of either 80 mg or 100 mg. The drug was shown to provide NASH resolution as assessed by the NAFLD activity score, 80 mg-24.2%, 100 mg-25.9% compared to 14.2% with the placebo group (P < 0.001). Resmetirom, improved liver fibrosis, 80 mg-25.9%, 100 mg-29.9% compared to 9.7% with the placebo group (P < 0.001). Resmetirom's ability to improve fibrosis in patients with F2-F3 fibrosis offers valuable benefit for patients at risk of progressing to cirrhosis.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Resmetirom expands the medication options available to treat patients with NASH which can be given alongside other medications to optimize metabolic factors such as glucagon-like peptide-1 and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Resmetirom was well tolerated in studies.

Conclusion

Resmetirom serves as an attractive option in patients diagnosed with NASH with evidence of advanced fibrosis (F2-F3) in combination with exercise, diet, and other multimodal therapies targeting metabolic risk factors.

Background

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the most common chronic liver condition globally, affecting approximately 25–38% of the global population and up to 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. This disease is closely linked with components of metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The relationship creates a complex network of pathophysiological factors that not only increases liver-related complications but also raises cardiovascular and metabolic risks.

Despite the significant burden of MASH on healthcare systems, with projected increases of 63% in MASH cases by 2030, therapeutic options remain limited. The current management of MAFLD primarily involves lifestyle interventions, weight loss strategies, and treatment of associated metabolic conditions. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of resmetirom in 2024 as the first specific pharmacological therapy for MASH with liver fibrosis is a significant milestone; however, access to this treatment remains restricted, and long-term clinical outcomes data are still emerging. Overall, the therapeutic landscape for MAFLD/MASH continues to lack established pharmacological options for most patients, particularly those in the earlier stages of the disease or without advanced fibrosis. This lack of effective pharmacological options represents a critical unmet clinical need, particularly given the progressive nature of the disease and its association with increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^112DpxBA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of resmetirom observed in our network meta‐analysis aligns with findings from the MAESTRO‐NAFLD trials. In a phase 2 study, resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor‐β agonist, demonstrated significant reductions in liver fat content measured by MRI‐PDFF, with a mean relative reduction of 52.3% after 36 weeks of treatment in patients with NASH. Our analysis similarly identified resmetirom as the most effective treatment for steatosis reduction, with a mean difference of −3.86 (95% CI: −7.33 to −0.39). The consistency of these findings reinforces the robustness of resmetirom's lipid‐targeting mechanisms via selective thyroid hormone receptor β activation. Aldafermin, a recombinant FGF19 analogue, has demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in the management of NASH. In a 24‐week randomized controlled trial, aldafermin significantly reduced liver fat content compared with placebo and showed encouraging trends towards fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution. However, our NMA ranked pegozafermin, an FGF21‐based therapy, higher in terms of fibrosis improvement, suggesting that FGF21 analogues may possess superior anti‐fibrotic efficacy. Despite this, aldafermin exhibited a favourable safety profile in our analysis, as reflected by its high surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) score of 77.3. This finding aligns with its established tolerability profile in previous clinical trials, reinforcing its potential as a viable therapeutic option for NASH patients.

4.2 Implications for clinical practice

The findings of this study have important implications for the clinical management of MASLD. The demonstrated efficacy of resmetirom for steatosis and pegozafermin for fibrosis highlights their potential to become standard treatments in MASLD care. Resmetirom's ability to significantly reduce hepatic fat content and pegozafermin's robust anti‐fibrotic effects make them leading options, particularly for patients with specific therapeutic needs, such as advanced fibrosis or pronounced steatosis. However, balancing efficacy and safety is crucial when selecting pharmacologic therapies. While resmetirom and pegozafermin exhibited excellent efficacy profiles, safety considerations, particularly for treatments like efruxifermin, which showed higher rates of adverse events, must be carefully weighed. Individual patient factors, such as baseline liver condition (e.g. degree of steatosis, fibrosis stage) and the presence of metabolic comorbidities like diabetes or obesity, should also play a central role in treatment decisions.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^114armRE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of resmetirom has been well documented in the MAESTRO‐NASH and MAESTRO‐NAFLD1 phase III trials, which demonstrated significant histologic and metabolic improvements in non‐cirrhotic NASH patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis. As a liver‐specific THR‐β agonist, resmetirom effectively reduces hepatic steatosis, improves lipid metabolism and enhances fibrosis resolution when used alongside diet and exercise. These findings support its emerging role as a frontline pharmacologic therapy for MASLD.

Similarly, pegozafermin, a long‐acting glycopegylated FGF21 analogue, has shown promising results in treating metabolic disorders, particularly non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In a phase 2b trial for NASH, pegozafermin demonstrated significant improvements in fibrosis and NASH resolution compared with placebo. A phase 1b/2a study in NASH patients further confirmed its tolerability and clinically meaningful reductions in liver fat, liver function markers and circulating lipids. These results support the advancement of pegozafermin into phase 3 development for NASH.

Beyond resmetirom and pegozafermin, several other promising agents are in clinical development. Aramchol, a synthetic lipid molecule targeting stearoyl‐coenzyme A desaturase‐1 (SCD1), reduces hepatic triglyceride synthesis while promoting fatty acid β‐oxidation. This dual mechanism helps lower liver fat accumulation, making Aramchol a potential metabolic intervention for MASLD. Lanifibranor, a pan‐PPAR agonist, has also shown efficacy in modulating hepatic inflammation, steatosis and fibrosis, with encouraging results from its Phase IIb trials. Additionally, obeticholic acid (OCA), a bile acid receptor agonist, is being evaluated in biopsy‐controlled trials (NATIVE study) to assess its impact on MASLD‐related fibrosis progression.

Growing evidence suggests that metabolic‐targeting agents, such as GLP‐1 receptor agonists (e.g. semaglutide) and SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g. dapagliflozin), may offer additional benefits in MASLD management. Semaglutide has demonstrated notable efficacy in weight loss, insulin sensitivity improvement and hepatic fat reduction, with Phase 2 trials showing reductions in MRI‐PDFF and fibrosis markers. Dapagliflozin, while primarily used for glycaemic control in diabetes, has been associated with hepatic fat reduction and cardiometabolic benefits, suggesting a potential adjunctive role in MASLD management. Although neither class of drugs directly targets fibrosis, their indirect metabolic benefits could complement other MASLD‐specific therapies.

ALT-based response and treatment continuation decisions during resmetirom: "Improvement in ALT was weakly correlated with the likelihood of histologic response" in MAESTRO-NASH; prior data "included a drop in ALT ≥ 17 U/L or greater and by at least 30% from baseline". Accordingly, "normalization or significant improvement in ALT may be considered a favorable response, while resmetirom-treated persons whose ALT remains consistently elevated may be judged as nonresponders". For overall monitoring, "Using the MRE and VCTE LSM thresholds defined above, persons with fibrosis improvement as well as those with favorable ALT response could continue resmetirom therapy", whereas "Among persons with significantly worsening NILDA for fibrosis or ALT levels, discontinuation of resmetirom should be considered". If uncertainty persists, "Among persons who do not meet criteria for continuation or discontinuation after 12 months of resmetirom therapy, available data are insufficient to make a firm recommendation", and in advanced fibrosis "apparent lack of fibrosis improvement should not mandate discontinuation of resmetirom therapy"; individualized "shared decision-making with the patient is recommended".

4.4 Future research directions

To build on these findings, future research should address several key areas. Longer‐term randomized controlled trials are essential to evaluate the durability of therapeutic effects and safety profiles over extended periods, providing a clearer understanding of the benefits and risks associated with these treatments. Exploration of combination therapies targeting multiple pathways, such as metabolic dysfunction and fibrosis, may offer synergistic benefits and should be a priority in future investigations. Further safety assessments are particularly warranted for agents with higher adverse event rates, such as efruxifermin, to better characterize their risk profiles and guide clinical use. Additionally, studies focusing on diverse populations, including patients with advanced liver disease, metabolic comorbidities or varying genetic backgrounds, are necessary to ensure that treatment recommendations are applicable to the broader MASLD population.

Randomization

As specified in the protocol, the first 30 patients were enrolled in the OL 100 mg resmetirom arm (including any patients taking thyroxine > 75 μg d −1) before initiation of 1:1:1:1 randomization to the three DB arms (100 mg resmetirom, 80 mg resmetirom or placebo) or the OL 100 mg resmetirom arm. Randomization to the OL arm was discontinued when the target number of patients was achieved (1 July 2020). Thereafter, eligible patients were randomized 1:1:1 to the three DB arms (100 mg resmetirom, 80 mg resmetirom or placebo). Randomization was stratified by type 2 diabetes status (presence/absence) and by history of documented atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD; yes/no). An interactive voice and web response system was used to assign treatment. Patients and study personnel administering the study drug and performing the clinical assessments were blinded to the individual patient's treatment (resmetirom or placebo). Select individuals were not blinded to patients' treatment assignments to facilitate operations (for example, to prepare data monitoring committee (DMC) materials); these individuals were not otherwise involved in the study. Results of several laboratory tests, defined in the laboratory manual (for example, SHBG, lipids and FT4), were blinded to study personnel and investigators during the study to preserve the blind. Reporting of serious AEs that met the criteria for expedited reporting was also managed by the pharmacovigilance team to maintain the blind for the rest of the study team. In addition, certain laboratory results that could unblind the study and were not required for patient management were blinded.

Patients completing MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 were eligible to enroll in a 52-week OL extension (MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE), which will provide additional data to characterize the safety and efficacy of resmetirom in adults with NAFLD/presumed NASH. In addition to the four arms described above, the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial included three additional OL active treatment arms in patients with (1) noncirrhotic NASH, enrolled after the randomization period; (2) well-compensated (Child–Pugh A) NASH cirrhosis; and (3) moderate renal impairment. The OL arms in patients with at-risk NASH (enrolled after randomization period), well-compensated NASH cirrhosis and moderate renal impairment were completed after the main study and will be reported separately.

Concomitant therapy alongside resmetirom — regardless of resmetirom treatment status, best practice management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) should include comprehensive lifestyle modification and optimal control of comorbid metabolic conditions, and "AASLD guidance supports that in the absence of approved therapy, pharmacologic treatment with semaglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E could be considered in appropriate patients". Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists "are FDA approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity" and "reduce the risk of cardiometabolic complications in addition to their effects on glycemic control and weight loss". While "not currently approved for the treatment of MASH", phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of "liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide have demonstrated their efficacy", and "although not FDA approved for the treatment of MASH, vitamin E and pioglitazone may also improve steatohepatitis". The MAESTRO-NASH trial "notably excluded individuals who initiated or dose-modified" GLP-1 receptor agonists, thiazolidinediones, or vitamin E "within 6 months of randomization".

### Resmetirom for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113b73wo]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Markers of liver injury, additional secondary end points in the trial, were improved with resmetirom treatment. Mean baseline liver enzymes were low in this population (mean baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ~37 U l −1 (upper limit of normal (ULN) 41 U l −1)). In the subgroup of patients with ALT ≥ 30 IU l −1 at baseline, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were significantly reduced from baseline in the OL 100 mg and DB 100 mg and 80 mg resmetirom arms compared to the placebo arm at week 52 (P < 0.05 versus placebo for all) (Table 3). Figure 3 shows mean ALT, AST and GGT levels over the 52-week treatment period in patients with baseline ALT ≥ 30 IU l −1. SHBG increases reflect the degree of THR-β activation in the liver and correlate with resmetirom exposure. A time course of the level of SHBG demonstrates that SHBG gradually increased with a plateau at week 12 that seemed to correlate with a plateau in ALT/AST reduction at week 24. Lower levels of SHBG were apparent in the DB arm as compared to the OL 100-mg arm, consistent with the COVID-19-related drug kit delays that occurred in the DB arms.

### The inherent value of treating metabolic dysfunction-associated… [^113rPW28]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The authors concluded that resmetirom was not cost-effective at a $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold, adding that the conclusion was sensitive to model assumptions. There are other important considerations worth exploring. In the model, the authors included that patients would discontinue resmetirom at a constant rate of 21. 3%/year. While there is likely to be an initial high resmetirom discontinuation rate, particularly among individuals who experience adverse events from drug initiation, this is unlikely to remain a recurring constant, and scenarios adjusting for differing sensitivity discontinuation rates may have been more robust. Moreover, Le et al3 assumed that resmetirom might need to be taken for life among their model's cohort, which is likely an oversimplification given the available therapies for common MASH comorbidities that can be taken in combination and may lead to improved fibrosis and treatment discontinuation.

These include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes, 6 weight loss, and CVD, with combined GLP-1 receptor agonists/gastric inhibitory polypeptide agonists for T2D and obesity. Other disease-specific pharmacological therapies, such as pioglitazone for T2D and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for CVD and T2D, may improve MASH-specific parameters and improve all-cause outcomes. Therefore, a challenge in estimating the effectiveness of resmetirom in the United States is accounting for how combination therapies contribute to improved liver health outcomes, as it is unlikely that the general population will mirror the MAESTRO-NASH trial population. This is emphasized by a recent publication7 reviewing resmetirom prescribing trends, which highlighted similar AEs but disproportionate discontinuation rates than those reported in the trial.

Another concern with the study by Le et al3 was the assumption used to estimate the relative risk of fibrosis progression among patients with MASH-F3. The authors used the percentage of patients with a 25% or greater increase in liver stiffness between baseline and week 52 to assume disease worsening. While liver stiffness measurement is a validated and noninvasive surrogate measure of fibrosis, it can overestimate histologic staging and is affected by factors like body mass index and hepatic blood flow.

### Resmetirom therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: October 2024 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^114dAwSg]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AASLD MASLD practice guidance — noninvasive fibrosis monitoring with resmetirom is framed with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) liver stiffness measurement (LSM) thresholds: the guidance "suggests against use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis", yet "a 19% reduction in LSM by MRE is considered to reflect a true reduction in liver fibrosis", and "a 20% or greater change in kPa on MRE may be useful to define a meaningful change for improvement and, by extension, for worsening". For VCTE, "A 20% reduction in VCTE LSM or a decrease in LSM to less than 10 kPa has been proposed", but in MAESTRO-NASH "a 25% decrease in VCTE LSM overestimated histologic response", with "Forty-nine percent of participants treated with resmetirom had at least a 25% decrease in VCTE LSM compared with 26% with placebo, and only 26% who had such a decrease had histologic response compared with 26% with placebo", and "VCTE LSM is not an ideal monitor to inform decisions for resmetirom"; therefore, "the writing group suggests using a 25% decrease in VCTE LSM to assess for response to resmetirom" and "a 25% increase in VCTE LSM may define meaningful worsening".

Laboratory Abnormalities

Liver Tests

Increases in mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were observed in the first 4 weeks after initiating treatment with REZDIFFRA. In both REZDIFFRA dosage arms, the mean elevation in ALT and AST values was less than 1.5 times baseline at 4 weeks after treatment initiation. These values returned to baseline around 8 weeks after initiating treatment.

Table 2 presents the frequency of liver test elevations during Trial 1.

Thyroid Function Tests

A decrease in levels of prohormone free T4 (FT4) of mean 2%, 13%, and 17% was seen at 12 months in patients treated with placebo, REZDIFFRA 80 mg once daily, and REZDIFFRA 100 mg once daily, respectively, with minimal changes in active hormone T3 or in TSH. There were no clinical findings associated with FT4 decreases.

Additional Safety Data

The safety evaluation of REZDIFFRA also included an analysis of an additional randomized placebo-controlled safety trial which included 969 patients from a relevant patient population (placebo [n = 318], REZDIFFRA 80 mg once daily [n = 327], and REZDIFFRA 100 mg once daily [n = 324]).

Data from the safety trial was combined with data from NASH patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis at eligibility (n = 888) and data from an additional 162 patients from a relevant patient population enrolled in Trial 1. In the combined safety population (n = 2019), the median (Q1 to Q3) age of patients at baseline was 58 (50 to 65) years; 55% were female, 28% were Hispanic, 89% were White, 2% were Asian, and 4% were Black or African American.

The safety profile from this combined analysis was similar to that in Trial 1, other than the one case of hepatotoxicity in the safety trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### TERN-501 monotherapy and combination therapy with TERN-101 in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: the randomized phase 2a DUET trial [^111s3tRU]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this phase 2a study, once-daily, orally administered TERN-501 as monotherapy or in combination with TERN-101 resulted in significant and dose-dependent reductions in LFC (measured by MRI-PDFF) and fibroinflammation (measured by cT1 relaxation time) in noncirrhotic patients with presumed MASH, meeting all primary and secondary endpoints. Patients treated with 12 weeks of TERN-501 monotherapy achieved up to a 44.8% mean relative reduction from baseline in LFC (versus 4.0% for placebo). These decreases in LFC are broadly in line with those reported in phase 3 studies of the approved THRβ agonist resmetirom in patients with MASH, who achieved reductions of 40.8–49.0% over 16 weeks, and 35.4–46.6% over 52 weeks. Most patients (63.6%) receiving TERN-501 6 mg achieved LFC reductions of ≥ 30%, indicating improved odds of achieving histologic response (that is, at least a two-point reduction in the NAFLD activity score without worsening fibrosis) and MASH resolution. LFC reductions of ≥ 30% have previously been associated with fibrosis improvement — a predictive factor in long-term survival for patients with MASH. TERN-501 demonstrated a rapid onset of effect, with reductions in LFC reaching significance at week 6. Additionally, TERN-501 monotherapy led to dose-dependent, significant reductions in cT1 relaxation time. Approximately one-third of patients treated with TERN-501 6 mg experienced reductions from baseline in cT1 of ≥ 80 ms, which has previously been associated with a two-point decrease in NAFLD activity score with no worsening in fibrosis, indicative of a clinically significant improvement in MASH. As expected from the MRI-PDFF results in this study, statistically significant decreases in CAP (an assessment of liver steatosis) were observed in TERN-501 treatment groups at week 12 relative to placebo.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^117GQuRB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Metabolic‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent chronic liver condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Effective pharmacological interventions targeting liver steatosis and fibrosis are essential to improving patient outcomes. This study aims to systematically compare the efficacy and safety of various pharmacologic therapies for MASLD over 24 weeks using a comprehensive network meta‐analysis.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review and network meta‐analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacologic treatments for MASLD. The primary outcomes were changes in liver steatosis (measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction) and fibrosis (measured by magnetic resonance elastography‐derived liver stiffness measurement), with safety assessed through adverse events. A Bayesian framework was employed to integrate and compare data across treatments, generating rankings for efficacy and safety.

Results

A systematic search was conducted across databases, identifying 23 RCTs from 10 144 initial records. For steatosis reduction, resmetirom showed the most significant improvement (mean difference: −3.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −7.33 to −0.39) compared with placebo. In terms of fibrosis improvement, pegozafermin demonstrated the greatest effect (−4.85, 95% CI: −5.50 to −4.19). Most treatments showed acceptable safety profiles, with efruxifermin showing slightly higher adverse events (0.32, 95% CI: 0.06–0.70) compared with placebo.

Conclusions

This comprehensive network meta‐analysis demonstrates the varying efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for MASLD, with resmetirom and pegozafermin emerging as particularly promising treatments for steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. While most treatments exhibited favourable safety profiles, careful monitoring is warranted, particularly with efruxifermin due to its slightly elevated adverse event profile. These findings provide valuable evidence to guide clinical decision‐making in MASLD management, though longer‐term studies are needed to confirm the durability of these therapeutic effects and further establish safety profiles.

MRI-PDFF subgroup analyses demonstrated that resmetirom treatment reduced hepatic fat from baseline at week 52 in all key patient subgroups (Extended Data Fig. 1). In particular, weight loss ≥ 5% in combination with resmetirom treatment or high exposure to resmetirom measured by the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) response as described previously(defined in this study as ≥ 120% increase from baseline in SHBG, which corresponds to the upper two tertiles of the SHBG response observed with 100 mg resmetirom) was associated with greater reduction in hepatic fat. In contrast, weight gain ≥ 5% or lower exposure to resmetirom (defined as < 120% increase in SHBG) showed lower hepatic fat reduction with resmetirom. In general, 80 mg resmetirom was less effective than 100 mg resmetirom at reducing hepatic fat; however, the effect of 80 mg was similar to 100 mg in females and in patients with ≥ 120% increase in SHBG.

Main

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the hepatic manifestation of a heterogeneous, multisystem disorder associated with liver complications, increased risk of chronic kidney disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the inflammatory form of MASLD. As MASLD progresses into MASH, patients face the risk of liver fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, necessitating transplantation. MASLD and MASH are updated terminology replacing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively.

Globally, MASH is reported to affect up to 5% of people, including 37% of those with T2D and approximately one in three people classified as overweight or obese. As the prevalence of metabolic diseases increases, so too does MASH. In the United States, MASH-related cirrhosis is now the leading indication for liver transplantation in women and those ≥ 65 years of age, and, alongside alcohol-associated liver disease, is the leading indication overall –. Indeed, mortality risk in patients with MASH is associated strongly with liver fibrosis. Additionally, patients with MASH are at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Until recently, there were no approved treatments for MASH. Thyroid hormone receptor-β (THRβ) is highly expressed in hepatocytes and dysregulated in MASH. THRβ agonism promotes lipophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, and increased hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation, ameliorating MASH by decreasing the burden of lipotoxic lipids and reducing hepatic fat content, while promoting favorable effects on lipid profiles. In studies of patients with noncirrhotic MASH, pharmacological THRβ agonism resulted in MASH resolution and fibrosis regression. These data led to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of the THRβ agonist resmetirom as the first approved agent for treating adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis.

Due to the multifactorial pathophysiology of MASLD and MASH, combination approaches may be necessary to maximize response to pharmacological intervention. Although resmetirom monotherapy has demonstrated effective MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement in a phase 3 study, there remains a need for additional THRβ agonist treatment options with favorable safety and drug–drug interaction profiles, and reduced pharmacokinetic (PK) variability.

### Breakthrough in the treatment of metabolic associated steatotic liver disease: is it all over? [^115XS8ZU]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

On March 14, 2024, after more than 25 years of intense research and a long series of failures, the Food and Drug Administration approved resmetirom as first drug for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis (now Metabolic-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease - MASLD). The present review covers this difficult process, finally providing a drug to complement lifestyle intervention, that has long been the sole approved therapeutic intervention. However, the availability of a drug shown to reduce disease progression in advanced stages of diseases opens a series of questions that deserve even more intense research. How to continue ongoing trials? How to generate an appropriate use of resmetirom in the community, limiting treatment according to predefined criteria and according to individual risk assessment? How to guarantee that both hepatic and non-hepatic comorbidities are appropriately targeted? How to define cost-effective strategies that might prevent the generation of unacceptable differences within the population, given the high costs of novel drugs and the extremely high numbers of candidates to treatment? Only a close surveillance of drug use in the real world, generated by insurance databases and national healthcare system registries, might provide adequate answers to these compelling questions.

Discussion

There are currently no approved pharmacological therapies for NASH. Rather, management focuses on lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise and treatment of comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. In addition, NASH is a chronic condition which may require lifelong therapy to slow or prevent progression of the disease. The blinded, placebo-controlled data from the 52-week MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial reinforce the safety data reported from the 36-week resmetirom phase 2 NASH trial but in a larger population over a longer treatment period.

Resmetirom was well tolerated at both 80 and 100 mg once-daily doses over 52 weeks of treatment in this trial. There were no increases in serious TEAEs or notable imbalances in specific serious TEAEs in the resmetirom arms compared to placebo. Consistent with previous data, excess TEAEs were mostly gastrointestinal in nature (diarrhea and nausea) and characterized as mild or moderate at the initiation of resmetirom treatment. Diarrhea was of short duration (approximately 2 weeks) and the incidence of this TEAE was not increased relative to placebo after week 12. Few patients discontinued the study due to these TEAEs. The incidence of nausea was more frequent in females relative to placebo (with females in the placebo arm being more frequent than males in the placebo arm).

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), encompasses a spectrum of liver disorders marked by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes, in the absence of significant alcohol consumption.MASLD is strongly linked to metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, which collectively drive its development and progression. The disease ranges from simple steatosis to more severe stages, including steatohepatitis, fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis, which can significantly impair liver function and overall health. The global prevalence of MASLD is rising steadily, mirroring the increasing rates of metabolic disorders. It is estimated that approximately 25% of the global population is affected by MASLD, with the prevalence even higher among individuals with obesity or diabetes. This growing burden underscores the urgent need for targeted therapeutic interventions. MASLD is not only a leading cause of chronic liver disease but also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which remains the primary cause of mortality in these patients. Addressing liver steatosis and fibrosis is essential for halting disease progression and preventing life‐threatening complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, effective management can help mitigate extra‐hepatic complications, including cardiovascular morbidity.

Figure 7
Treatment options for common liver diseases and liver cancer. Treatment options for ALD, AH, MASLD, MASH and HCC are summarised here. AH, alcohol-associated hepatitis; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; AUD, alcohol use disorder; FGF21, fibroblast growth factor 21; GCGR, glucagon receptor; GIPR, gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor; GLP1R, glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; MALSD/MASH, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease or steatohepatitis; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; TACE, transarterial chemoembolisation; TARE, transarterial radioembolisation; THR-β, thyroid hormone receptor beta.

The association of low thyroid function with MASLD has been well documented. The thyroid produces the prohormone T4 that is intracellularly converted into the bioactive hormone T3. There are two receptors for T3: THR α and β (THR-α and THR-β). THR-β is the predominant T3 receptor in the liver. THR-β agonists have been tested for both MASLD and MASH. In March 2024, resmetirom, a THR-β selective agonist, was conditionally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of MASH. In a 52-week phase 3 trial, at least one stage improvement of liver fibrosis with no worsening MASLD activity score was achieved in 24.2% and 25.9% of patients in the resmetirom groups at doses of 80 and 100 mg, respectively, compared with 14.2% of the placebo group.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^114wJzn2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent chronic liver condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Effective pharmacological interventions targeting liver steatosis and fibrosis are essential to improving patient outcomes. This study aims to systematically compare the efficacy and safety of various pharmacologic therapies for MASLD over 24weeks using a comprehensive network meta-analysis.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacologic treatments for MASLD. The primary outcomes were changes in liver steatosis (measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction) and fibrosis (measured by magnetic resonance elastography-derived liver stiffness measurement), with safety assessed through adverse events. A Bayesian framework was employed to integrate and compare data across treatments, generating rankings for efficacy and safety.

Results

A systematic search was conducted across databases, identifying 23 RCTs from 10144 initial records. For steatosis reduction, resmetirom showed the most significant improvement (mean difference: -3.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.33 to -0.39) compared with placebo. In terms of fibrosis improvement, pegozafermin demonstrated the greatest effect (-4.85, 95% CI: -5.50 to -4.19). Most treatments showed acceptable safety profiles, with efruxifermin showing slightly higher adverse events (0.32, 95% CI: 0.06–0.70) compared with placebo.

Conclusions

This comprehensive network meta-analysis demonstrates the varying efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for MASLD, with resmetirom and pegozafermin emerging as particularly promising treatments for steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. While most treatments exhibited favourable safety profiles, careful monitoring is warranted, particularly with efruxifermin due to its slightly elevated adverse event profile. These findings provide valuable evidence to guide clinical decision-making in MASLD management, though longer-term studies are needed to confirm the durability of these therapeutic effects and further establish safety profiles.

Inclusion criteria (DB and OL noncirrhotic arms)

We only evaluated patients for study participation if they met the prescreening criteria. Patients who did not initially meet the eligibility criteria may be retested, based on investigator judgment, to determine whether they qualify to participate. Patients who met all of the following criteria were eligible to participate in the study:
Must be willing to participate in the study and provide written informed consent.
Male and female adults ≥ 18 years of age.
Female patients are eligible if they are of reproductive potential and have a negative serum pregnancy test (β-human chorionic gonadotropin), are not breastfeeding and do not plan to become pregnant during the study and agree to use two highly effective birth-control methods during the study OR if they are not of childbearing potential (surgically (bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or are naturally sterile (> 12 consecutive months without menses)). Highly effective birth-control methods include condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, hormonal and non-hormonal intrauterine device, hormonal contraception (estrogens stable ≥ 3 months), a vasectomized male partner or sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse, from the time of screening throughout the study and for at least 30 d after the last dose of study drug administration). Reliance on abstinence from heterosexual intercourse is acceptable only if it is the patient's habitual practice.
Male patients who are sexually active with a partner of childbearing potential must either be sterile (vasectomy with history of a negative sperm count at least 90 d following the procedure); practice total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred lifestyle (periodic abstinence is not acceptable); use a male condom with any sexual activity; or agree to use a birth-control method considered to be appropriate by the investigator (such as one of the methods identified above for female patients of childbearing potential) from the time of screening until 30 d after the last dose of study drug administration. Male patients must agree not to donate sperm for a period of 30 d after the last dose of study drug administration.
For suspected or confirmed diagnosis of NASH/NAFLD suggested by the historical data, they must meet one of the following criteria: FibroScan with kPa ≥ 5.5 and < 8.5; CAP ≥ 280 dB m −1 OR MRE ≥ 2.0 and < 4.0; MRI-PDFF ≥ 8% liver fat consistent with steatosis and fibrosis stage ≥ 1 and < 4. Recent liver biopsy (within past 2 years) documenting NASH/NAFLD with steatosis showing one of the following: NAS ≥ 4, steatosis ≥ 1, with fibrosis stage 0 (F0) OR with F1A/1C and PRO-C3 < 14. NAS < 4, steatosis ≥ 1, with fibrosis stage ≤ 3. NAS ≥ 4, steatosis ≥ 1, fibrosis stage ≤ 3 without ballooning. Note: following the completion of enrollment of the DB arms, patients meeting all other criteria who have a liver biopsy result from MGL-3196–11 with the following may be enrolled in the OL active treatment arm of MGL-3196–14 (100 mg dose): NAS = 3, steatosis 1, ballooning 1, inflammation 1 with F2 or F3. NAS = 3, ballooning 0 with F2 or F3. Note: if patient is F0, they must also, within the last 6 months, have a FibroScan with kPa ≥ 5.5 OR MRE ≥ 2.0 (no upper limit). Note: in patients on thyroxine > 75 μg, a FibroScan with kPa ≥ 5.5 is eligible (no upper limit). Note: in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 and < 45 (OL treatment arm). a FibroScan with kPa ≥ 5.5 is eligible (no upper limit). Note: eligibility based on meeting inclusion criterion 5 should be determined based on historic medical and laboratory (FibroScan, liver biopsy) data and should be determined before informed consent is provided and the screening visit. Note: FibroScan does not need to be repeated at screening if conducted at prescreening and/or a historical FibroScan was conducted in the previous 3 months (including study MGL-3196–11). A historic liver biopsy must not be accompanied by a significant decrease in body weight ≥ 5% since the biopsy or treatment with a new concomitant medication that might affect steatosis.
Patients must meet inclusion criterion 0 before obtaining an MRI-PDFF (unless a patient has an existing qualifying MRI-PDFF). MRI-PDFF fat fraction ≥ 8% obtained during the screening period (baseline MRI-PDFF) or a historic MRI-PDFF ≤ 8 weeks (+3 d) old at the time of randomization. Note: an eligible MRI-PDFF with fat fraction ≥ 8% must be obtained for the baseline value (does not need to be repeated if conducted in the ≤ 8 weeks (+3 d) before anticipated randomization and there has not been > 5% weight change in that interval). Patients with contraindications to an MRI-PDFF (for example, metal prosthetics, uncontrolled documented claustrophobia or where body weight exceeds the limit of the machine) examination or who are screened at an investigative site where MRI-PDFF is not available are eligible for this study if they have a FibroScan with CAP ≥ 300 dB m −1 or a CAP ≥ 280 with a historic liver biopsy showing steatosis ≥ 1. Note: if a historic liver biopsy shows steatosis of 0 and there has been no recent change in metabolic status such as weight gain, the patient is not eligible to participate unless the current MRI-PDFF is ≥ 8%.
Must be on stable, standard care dyslipidemia therapy for ≥ 30 d before randomization that can be maintained for the entire study except for noted exceptions. Statins should be taken in the evening for at least 2 weeks before randomization and continue to be taken in the evening for the duration of the study. Patients recommended for dyslipidemia therapy but who are intolerant of statins or other dyslipidemia therapy are allowed. Permitted dyslipidemia therapy includes: Rosuvastatin ≤ 20 mg daily. Atorvastatin ≤ 40 mg daily. Simvastatin ≤ 20 mg daily. Pravastatin ≤ 40 mg daily. Lovastatin ≤ 40 mg daily. Pitavastatin ≤ 2 mg daily. Ezetimibe alone or in combination with any of the above statins. Omega III fatty acids. Bile acid sequestrants (for example, cholestyramine (Questran or Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid or Flavored Colestid) and colesevelam (Welchol)) are permitted if taken at least 4 h after or 4 h before the dose of study drug. The fenofibrate dose must be stable for at least 6 weeks before randomization and is allowed for patients with a history of and/or ongoing very high TGs (> 500 mg dL −1) based on investigator discretion. Unless taking fenofibrate for a history of and/or ongoing very high TGs (500 mg dL −1), fenofibrate is excluded throughout the study. For patients on fenofibrate in which previous high TG values > 500 mg dL −1 cannot be located, the sponsor, in consultation with the investigator may review the case details to evaluate the justification for the fenofibrate indication on a case-by-case basis. Note: because lipid end points are assessed during the study, lipid therapies must be stable for the duration of the 52-week study. Lipids are blinded during the study and monitoring lipid levels at local laboratories outside the clinical trial is discouraged. Safety reasons that may result in an increase/modification in lipid therapy during the study include the occurrence of a laboratory alert for TGs > 1,000 or another acute indication for modifying lipid therapy such as a CV event. Statins and other lipid therapy may be reduced, switched to an alternative statin or cholesterol-lowering medication or discontinued secondary to AEs during the study. Note: patients already enrolled who are taking fenofibrate even if not for very high TGs may remain in the study, because there are no safety concerns in most patients taking fenofibrate. Note: other stable dyslipidemia therapies not specifically listed, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, are allowed. Note: patients with dyslipidemia therapy that was initiated < 30 d before expected randomization may be rescreened after the dyslipidemia therapy is stabilized. In the case that a lipid-lowering medication is discontinued before randomization, the patient would be able to randomize 1 week after the discontinuation.
Estimated GFR ≥ 45 (DB treatment arms) or ≥ 30 and < 45 (OL treatment arm) by the modification of diet in renal disease 6-variable (MDRD-6) formula.

4.3 Limitations

This study has several important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, there is considerable variability in sample sizes and diagnostic criteria across the included trials, which may introduce heterogeneity and affect the comparability of results. Although the Bayesian framework of the network meta‐analysis helps mitigate some of these differences, residual inconsistencies cannot be entirely excluded. One key limitation is the variability in sample sizes across the trials. Most studies had relatively small cohorts, with only 8 out of 23 RCTs enrolling more than 100 patients. This limited sample size in several trials may introduce variability in treatment effect estimates, particularly for drugs assessed in smaller trials with restricted statistical power. Additionally, substantial heterogeneity in study sample sizes across different pharmacologic agents was observed. For example, the three trials evaluating Resmetirom collectively enrolled a significantly larger number of patients compared with studies investigating other therapies. This disparity in trial size may have influenced Resmetirom's ranking and effect size estimation in the network meta‐analysis, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation when comparing treatments with smaller sample sizes. Second, the follow‐up duration in most trials was limited to 24 weeks, which restricts our ability to assess the long‐term efficacy and safety of the therapies. This is particularly relevant for chronic conditions like MASLD, where longer‐term outcomes such as sustained efficacy, fibrosis regression and late‐onset adverse events are critical. Third, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by the population diversity in the included trials. Most of the studies focused on Western and Asian populations, with limited representation from other geographic regions or ethnic groups, such as African, Middle Eastern and Latin American cohorts. This underrepresentation of certain populations may limit the applicability of the findings to a broader, more diverse patient population. Finally, another significant limitation is the variability in assessment methods across the included studies. While MRI‐PDFF and MRE‐LSM provide non‐invasive, reproducible and standardized measures of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, liver biopsy remains the histologic gold standard for diagnosing and staging MASLD. This methodological heterogeneity introduces potential challenges in comparing outcomes across trials. While efforts were made to minimize publication bias, the possibility of residual bias or unmeasured heterogeneity remains. These limitations emphasize the need for longer‐term randomized controlled trials, real‐world observational studies and more diverse, multi‐ethnic research to ensure the broad applicability and robustness of these findings.

### Global consensus recommendations for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and steatohepatitis [^11168mCc]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and steatohepatitis (MASH) are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, impaired health-related quality of life, and large economic burden. The growing burden of MASLD and MASH has led to the publication of a large number of MASLD/MASH guidelines by national and international societies. However, important differences among the recommendations have created confusion, contributing to a low rate of implementation and suboptimal management of MASLD and MASH. Creating a consensus recommendation has become more important since the approval of a partial agonist of thyroid hormone β receptor (resmetirom) for MASH treatment in the United States. We built a consensus among the most recently published recommendations for MASLD/MASH.

Methods

A comprehensive search for MASLD and MASH guidelines, guidance, or similar documents from January 2018 to January 2025 using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and society websites was conducted. Each selected document was assessed across 8 specific domains with 145 variables. Variables with < 50% concordance were used for the Delphi statement development. A supermajority of 67% was set for Delphi statement acceptance.

Results

There were 61 documents published from 2018 through January 2025. Four rounds of Delphi were conducted: 46 statements were generated for Round 1, 32 statements for Round 2, 16 statements for Round 3, and 8 statements for Round 4, whereby 100% of statements achieved a greater than 90% agreement. All final consensus recommendations were summarized in tables and algorithms.

Conclusions

Our study provides an extensive set of recommendations generated based on a comprehensive review of the most recent MASLD/MASH guidelines and a consensus-building process.

Treatment-Related Parameters

Patients in the SoC strategy had transition probabilities as described in the previous natural history section. Patients taking resmetirom had slower fibrosis progression rates and faster regression rates as well as faster rates of MASH resolution compared to SoC patients. Based on the RCT, efficacy was expressed as relative risks (RRs) of fibrosis improvement and worsening for patients with F2 and F3 separately. To estimate the RR of fibrosis worsening among patients with MASH-F3, we used the percentage of patients with a 25% or greater increase in liver stiffness between baseline and week 52. We assumed patients with fibrosis stages F0 to F2 who continued treatment had the same RRs of fibrosis improvement and worsening and applied the same RR of MASH resolution for all fibrosis stages. Treatment was assumed to continue for life unless discontinued due to adverse events or other reasons or when patients entered stage F4. If patients improved from stage F4 to F3, they would restart treatment and continue to accrue benefits as before. We aggregated data for both resmetirom dosages when estimating efficacy.

In the base case, patients discontinued treatment at a constant rate of 21.3%/year. We conducted scenario analysis with discontinuation due to adverse events only (4.3%/year). We did not model adverse events because there was no difference in serious adverse events between resmetirom vs placebo.

Costs

Costs of MASLD-related health states were based on the literature and adjusted for inflation. We assumed that stage F3 cost the same as MASH-F3, F1 or F2 cost half as much as MASH-F1 or MASH-F2, and MASL had no cost. For the base-case, drug cost was based on the manufacturer's suggested price ($19 011/year). We did not use the wholesale drug price because most insurance plans would negotiate a discount.

Methods

Model Overview

We developed an agent-based state transition model with a yearly cycle to compare the cost-effectiveness of resmetirom vs standard of care (SoC) in adults with MASH and fibrosis stages F2 or F3 (Figure 1). The model included 14 mutually exclusive health states: metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver (MASL) or F0; MASH; F1 to F3, with or without MASH; compensated cirrhosis (F4), with or without MASH; decompensated cirrhosis (DC); HCC; LT; liver-related death; and death from other causes. We simulated 200 000 patients receiving nutrition and exercise counseling with age, sex, and fibrosis stage distribution reflecting participants in the MAESTRO-NASH trial. Patients entered the model in MASH-F2 or MASH-F3 state, then transitioned between states annually until all died. Compared with SoC, the resmetirom group had increased probability of fibrosis regression and MASH resolution and decreased risk of fibrosis progression. Because resmetirom was only approved for MASH-F2 and MASH-F3, treatment was discontinued once patients developed cirrhosis or worse. Although resmetirom decreases LDL levels, its impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown. Therefore, we chose not to include CVD events in the model. Model outputs included costs and estimated effectiveness (cases of DC, HCC, LT, liver-related and all-cause deaths and QALYs). The ICER between strategies was calculated as incremental costs divided by incremental QALYs. The analysis was conducted from the payer perspective, with costs and QALYs discounted at 3%/year. Costs were presented in 2023 US dollars, adjusted for inflation using the US Consumer Price Index–Medical Care Component. The model was developed in AnyLogic University version 8 (AnyLogic Inc). We reported the study following the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards guideline. Because this study used published and deidentified data, it did not constitute human participant research, per the Common Rule.

In each cycle, people in any health state can die from nonliver causes. F0 to F4 indicates fibrosis stages 0 (no fibrosis) to 4 (cirrhosis); HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; MASL, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver; and MASH, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis.

### Thyroid hormone receptor-β analogues for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) [^116gpcmd]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The association between suboptimal thyroid function ((sub)clinical hypothyroidism or low-normal thyroid function) and the metabolic syndrome and MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) has been clearly established. Furthermore, in MASLD, intracellular thyroid hormone concentrations are low and the activation of the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) is reduced. Administration of thyroid hormone has been shown to reduce liver triglycerides by stimulating fatty acid disposal through lipophagy and beta-oxidation, and to lower LDL-cholesterol. As thyroid hormone exerts its effects in many different organs, including the heart and bone, several drug candidates have been developed as selective thyromimetics for the THR-β nuclear receptor with potent and liver-targeted activity. Importantly, these compounds have reduced affinity for the THR-α nuclear receptor and tissue distribution profiles that differ from endogenous thyroid hormones, thereby reducing unwanted cardiovascular side effects. The most advanced compound, resmetirom, is an oral drug that demonstrated, in a large phase III trial in patients with MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), the ability to reduce liver fat, decrease aminotransferase levels and improve atherogenic dyslipidaemia with a good tolerability profile. This translated into histological improvement that led to accelerated approval of this drug for active fibrotic steatohepatitis, a milestone achievement as a first MASH drug.

### Value-based pricing of resmetirom for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^1178u1UM]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this economic evaluation, we found that resmetirom was not cost-effective at a $100 000/QALY threshold, given base-case assumptions regarding its long-term benefits, discontinuation rate, and drug price ($19 011/year), but it could be cost-effective at a lower price. The conclusion was sensitive to changes in discontinuation rate, with higher rates making resmetirom more cost-effective. Further data on the drug's long-term efficacy and potential benefits on non-MASLD complications would be necessary to accurately determine the economic value of resmetirom.

For fibrosis improvement, pegozafermin emerged as the most effective treatment, with a SUCRA value of 99.9 and a mean rank of 1.0, demonstrating superior efficacy in reversing fibrosis. Resmetirom (SUCRA: 86.5, mean rank: 2.4) and pemafibrate (SUCRA: 83.7, mean rank: 2.6) also showed significant efficacy in improving liver fibrosis. Efruxifermin (SUCRA: 68.2) and semaglutide (SUCRA: 54.2) followed in efficacy, while placebo (SUCRA: 25.4, mean rank: 8.5) performed the worst (Figure 3B).

In terms of safety, placebo had the best safety profile, with a SUCRA value of 69.7 and a mean rank of 3.7. Aldafermin (SUCRA: 77.3, mean rank: 3.0) and licogliflozin (SUCRA: 72.2, mean rank: 3.5) followed closely in terms of safety. Conversely, treatments like efruxifermin (SUCRA: 14.0, mean rank: 8.7) and efinopegdutide (SUCRA: 17.9, mean rank: 8.4) exhibited higher rates of adverse events, indicating the need for closer monitoring in these therapies (Figure 3C, Supplemental Content).

### Role of resmetirom, a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist, in managing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116iT4vV]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Resmetirom, a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist, has recently been approved to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the efficiency and safety of resmetirom in treating NASH.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of resmetirom vs placebo in patients with NASH. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in hepatic fat content, liver histology, including NASH resolution, and noninvasive markers of hepatic fibrosis.

Results

Three randomized controlled trials (n = 2231) met the inclusion criteria. Compared to placebo, resmetirom achieved greater reductions from baseline in hepatic fat content assessed by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (for resmetirom 80 mg: MD -27.76% [95%CI: -32.84, -22.69]; for resmetirom 100 mg: MD -36.01% [95%CI: -41.54, -30.48]; P < .00001 for both) and FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (for resmetirom 80 mg: MD -21.45 dBm [95%CI: -29.37, -13.52]; for resmetirom 100 mg: MD -25.51 dBm [95%CI: -33.53, -17.49]; P < .00001 for both). Resmetirom 80 mg outperformed placebo in NASH resolution and ≥ 2-point nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score reduction. Moreover, resmetirom 80 mg and 100 mg were superior to placebo in cytokeratin-18 (M30) reduction. Greater reductions in liver enzymes, lipids, and reverse triiodothyronine were observed in the resmetirom arms with no impact on triiodothyronine. Nausea and diarrhea were more common with resmetirom than with placebo; other adverse events were comparable.

Conclusion

Resmetirom improves hepatic fat content, liver enzymes, and fibrosis biomarkers in NASH patients. Resmetirom generally does not affect thyroid function and is well-tolerated.

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:

Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Gallbladder-Related Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of REZDIFFRA was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that enrolled a total of 2019 patients.

Trial 1

Trial 1 included patients who had noncirrhotic NASH with stages F2 and F3 fibrosis at eligibility (n = 888) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuations

The exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) per 100 person-years (PY) for treatment discontinuation due to any adverse reaction were higher in the REZDIFFRA dosage arms: 4 per 100 PY, 5 per 100 PY, and 8 per 100 PY in placebo, REZDIFFRA 80 mg once daily, and REZDIFFRA 100 mg once daily arms, respectively. Diarrhea and nausea were the most common causes of treatment discontinuation.

Common Adverse Reactions

Table 1 displays EAIRs per 100 PY for the common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis treated in either drug arm with REZDIFFRA and were greater than that reported for placebo.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^112qDR2v]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment strategies for MASLD are multifaceted, with lifestyle changes — particularly a Mediterranean‐like diet and weight loss — serving as the foundation of management. Pharmacological interventions aim to address both metabolic abnormalities and liver‐specific pathways, with drugs such as GLP‐1 receptor agonists, PPAR agonists and FXR agonists showing promise. More recently, resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor β agonist, became the first FDA‐approved drug specifically for treating MASLD and liver fibrosis. However, the heterogeneity of MASLD poses challenges in defining universally effective treatments. Despite encouraging clinical trial results, the efficacy and safety profiles of these therapies vary, and no single treatment has been universally endorsed for all patients.

One of the major obstacles in MASLD management is the lack of comprehensive, comparative evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of available pharmacologic therapies. To address this gap, a systematic network meta‐analysis (NMA) is essential. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of various pharmacological treatments for MASLD over a 24‐week treatment period. Given the complexity of MASLD and the wide array of therapeutic options, a Bayesian NMA is employed to provide a robust comparative framework. This approach integrates both direct and indirect evidence across multiple treatment arms, allowing for a thorough evaluation of treatment outcomes. By employing a Bayesian network meta‐analysis, this study aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of pharmacologic therapies for MASLD, offering insights into their relative efficacy and safety to inform clinical decision‐making.

### TERN-501 monotherapy and combination therapy with TERN-101 in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: the randomized phase 2a DUET trial [^11229eCw]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

MASH is a multisystem disorder with a highly individualized and comorbid course in which the clinical burden is not confined to hepatic complications. Patients frequently have cardiovascular disease or risk factors such as pro-atherogenic lipid profiles. The clinical characteristics of patients in DUET were largely consistent with previous phase 2 studies in patients with MASH, and reflected an at-risk, comorbid MASH population. Most patients had obesity or other metabolic comorbidities, and were hypertensive, receiving statins or experiencing dyslipidemia at baseline. It is therefore noteworthy that TERN-501 treatment was associated with predominantly favorable, dose-dependent changes across lipid parameters, including significant decreases in ApoB and Lp(a), reductions of which are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events. Indeed, the small increases in TC and LDL-C occurring with TERN-101 therapy were mitigated by TERN-501 coadministration, supporting the lipid-lowering effects of TERN-501.

Successful pharmacological interventions for MASH must not only be well tolerated and efficacious, but also capable of integration into the clinical management of patients with a complex background of cardiometabolic comorbidity. Although interactions between resmetirom and statins have been reported, TERN-501 administration with concomitant background therapy was allowed in the DUET study, and over half (57%) of the DUET study population reported baseline statin use. Additionally, the PK profile of TERN-501 was predictable and showed low-to-moderate variability, with TERN-501 exposures in patients with MASH generally consistent with those previously observed in healthy participants, indicating that neither MASH as a disease nor concomitant therapies being used by the patients in our trial had relevant effects on plasma concentrations of TERN-501. Therefore, TERN-501 may have the potential to avoid adverse drug interactions with commonly coprescribed medication classes in MASH.

### Resmetirom for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^1133bXTt]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

For all patients randomized to resmetirom treatment, dose adjustments could be triggered by an unblinded monitor. At week 12, the resmetirom dose was reduced by 20 mg if FT4 levels decreased from baseline by ≥ 30% (to < 0.7 ng dL −1) on two consecutive visits (at weeks 4 and 8). In patients assigned to 100 mg resmetirom who were dose reduced to 80 mg at week 12, if FT4 levels continued to decrease from baseline by ≥ 30% (to < 0.7 ng dL −1), the dose was further decreased to 60 mg at week 24. After week 24, no further resmetirom dose adjustments were permitted.

A DMC, which met at least quarterly throughout the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial, evaluated the safety and key pharmacodynamic data to recommend whether the trial should continue, be modified or stopped. The DMC reviewed the unblinded safety data, including TEAEs, serious TEAEs and pharmacodynamic data. Blinded hepatic and CV adjudication committees evaluated potential liver or major adverse CV events.
