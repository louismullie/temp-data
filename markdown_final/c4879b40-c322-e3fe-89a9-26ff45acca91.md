## Question

Extremity Abscess work up?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for extremity abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and how to distinguish abscess from cellulitis. Then, I should verify when point-of-care ultrasound changes management. Next, I will consider when to obtain cultures and blood cultures. After that, I need to check which imaging modalities are appropriate for suspected deep or complicated infections. Finally, I will integrate special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm with disposition and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: diagnosis of a superficial extremity abscess is primarily clinical, characterized by a tender, erythematous, indurated fluctuant collection, often with surrounding cellulitis, and careful history and exam are usually sufficient to establish the diagnosis and guide incision and drainage as first-line therapy [^ab27a038] [^c86d6864].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound when the diagnosis is uncertain or when I need to plan drainage. Point-of-care ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting abscess and meaningfully changes management in about 10% of cases, reducing treatment failure and repeat procedures; a randomized trial showed a 13.3% absolute reduction in failure with ultrasound-guided I&D, and a meta-analysis reports sensitivity around 94–95% and specificity around 85–91%, with even stronger performance in adults and in cases with high pretest suspicion [^b38165ea] [^79b1d989]. Hold on, I should also note that ultrasound can miss early or small collections and has a learning curve, so a negative scan does not absolutely exclude abscess if clinical suspicion remains high [^79b1d989].

> I need to check when to obtain cultures. Routine Gram stain and culture are not required for uncomplicated abscesses managed in the outpatient setting, but I should obtain cultures in patients with severe local infection, systemic illness, immunocompromise, recurrent abscesses, or concern for outbreaks; if I do obtain cultures, I should send pus from the abscess cavity rather than superficial swabs to maximize yield [^8ccffc84] [^7d14c678] [^2588b2ec]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some clinicians still obtain cultures broadly, but guidelines emphasize selective use to avoid low-yield testing that rarely changes initial management in uncomplicated cases [^7d14c678].

> Next, I should review blood cultures. I initially thought blood cultures might be useful in febrile patients with large abscesses, but wait, I should double-check the data. Routine blood cultures in otherwise stable patients with skin and soft tissue infections, including extremity abscesses, have very low yield and are not recommended; they are associated with increased length of stay without improving outcomes, so I should reserve them for patients with sepsis, immunocompromise, or when there is concern for endocarditis or metastatic infection [^7d14c678] [^cbd8bef4]. I should confirm that this aligns with stewardship principles and observational data showing no benefit from routine blood cultures in upper extremity abscesses [^cbd8bef4].

> Let me consider when advanced imaging is warranted. If there is concern for deep infection such as pyomyositis, necrotizing soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis, MRI is the preferred modality because of superior soft-tissue contrast and ability to define extent, including adjacent bone and joint involvement; CT or ultrasound are acceptable alternatives if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, and ultrasound can detect subperiosteal or soft-tissue fluid collections in osteomyelitis but cannot evaluate bone marrow [^893f5934] [^7c0fe4fa] [^cc6841fd]. I should confirm that in children with suspected septic arthritis, ultrasound can identify effusions but cannot distinguish sterile from infected fluid, so diagnostic arthrocentesis remains essential when clinical suspicion is high [^39fc4f0f].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or has diabetes with a foot infection. In those scenarios, I need to maintain a lower threshold for imaging and cultures because the presentation can be atypical and complications like osteomyelitis are more common; for diabetic foot infections, plain radiographs can screen for gas, foreign body, or bone changes, with MRI pursued if suspicion for osteomyelitis persists or if surgical planning is needed [^a53cce8f]. I should also remember that in febrile neutropenia, even small skin lesions warrant aggressive evaluation, blood cultures, and early specialty input given blunted inflammatory responses [^bed0efd7].

> I will now examine special anatomic sites. For hand infections, point-of-care ultrasound can rapidly distinguish cellulitis from deep-space abscess or flexor tenosynovitis and guide timely operative management; case series and reports highlight ultrasound's utility when physical examination is equivocal, though evidence quality is low and clinical judgment remains paramount [^4d6018b3] [^943ea3b2]. For suspected anorectal abscesses, imaging is reserved for atypical presentations, occult supralevator disease, immunosuppression, or Crohn's disease, with MRI, CT, or endoanal ultrasound selected based on availability and clinical question [^082a1645] [^36727c08].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. In a typical immunocompetent patient with a superficial fluctuant extremity abscess, I should proceed directly to incision and drainage without routine labs, cultures, or imaging, using ultrasound if the diagnosis is uncertain or if I need to localize loculations for drainage; if there is systemic toxicity, immunocompromise, rapid progression, recurrent abscess, or concern for deep infection, I should obtain cultures, consider blood cultures only when there is sepsis or metastatic concern, and escalate to MRI or CT as indicated to define anatomy and plan source control [^ab27a038] [^8ccffc84] [^7d14c678] [^893f5934]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach aligns with stewardship and safety data showing reduced unnecessary testing without harm when guidelines are followed [^07601f11].

> Finally, I need to ensure disposition and follow-up are appropriate. Most patients can be managed as outpatients with wound care instructions and return precautions; hospitalization is indicated for sepsis, immunocompromise, poor adherence, failure of outpatient therapy, or when deep infection is suspected and surgical coordination is needed, and I should arrange close follow-up to reassess for recurrence or complications [^83fdbfec] [^c86d6864]. If cultures were obtained and the patient is not improving, I should review results to adjust therapy, recognizing that routine follow-up cultures are not needed for uncomplicated cases that heal as expected [^notfound].

The workup for an extremity abscess centers on **clinical assessment** to confirm fluctuance and distinguish abscess from cellulitis [^ab27a038], with **point-of-care ultrasound** used when the diagnosis is uncertain or to guide drainage [^79b1d989] [^b38165ea]. Routine labs are not required for uncomplicated cases [^notfound], but **CBC, ESR/CRP, and blood cultures** are indicated for systemic illness, immunocompromise, or suspected bacteremia [^notfound]. Obtain **pus cultures** for severe infection, immunocompromise, recurrent abscesses, or outbreaks to guide therapy and detect MRSA [^8ccffc84] [^fe302890]. Imaging (MRI or CT) is reserved for deep infection, osteomyelitis, or when the extent is unclear [^893f5934] [^39fc4f0f]. Most patients can be managed as outpatients with incision and drainage; reserve admission for systemic toxicity, immunocompromise, or failure of outpatient care [^83fdbfec].

---

## Clinical assessment

- **History**: Onset, duration, trauma, prior infections, comorbidities (diabetes, immunocompromise), recent antibiotics, and systemic symptoms (fever, chills, malaise).

- **Physical examination**: Inspect for erythema, swelling, fluctuance, warmth, tenderness, and systemic signs (fever, tachycardia, hypotension) [^ab27a038].

- **Differentiation**: Distinguish abscess from cellulitis by the presence of fluctuance and localized pus collection [^c86d6864].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Routine labs are **not required** for uncomplicated abscesses [^notfound]; obtain the following when systemic illness, immunocompromise, or severe infection is suspected:

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| CBC with differential | Suspected systemic infection, immunocompromise, or severe local infection |
| ESR/CRP | Suspected deep infection, osteomyelitis, or systemic inflammation |
| Blood cultures | Suspected bacteremia, systemic toxicity, or immunocompromise [^notfound] |
| Glucose/HbA1c | Known or suspected diabetes mellitus |

---

## Microbiological evaluation

Routine cultures are **not required** for uncomplicated abscesses [^7d14c678]; obtain cultures in the following scenarios:

- **Severe infection**: Systemic illness, immunocompromise, or failure of initial therapy [^8ccffc84].

- **Recurrent abscesses**: Evaluate for MRSA or underlying host factors [^2588b2ec].

- **Outbreaks**: Suspected clusters or public health concerns [^fe302890].

- **Specimen**: Obtain pus from the abscess cavity for Gram stain and culture [^8ccffc84].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is **not routine**; use selectively based on clinical suspicion:

- **Point-of-care ultrasound**: Differentiates abscess from cellulitis, guides drainage, and identifies loculations [^79b1d989] [^b38165ea].

- **MRI**: Suspected deep infection, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis [^893f5934] [^39fc4f0f].

- **CT scan**: Deep infection, gas-forming infections, or when MRI is contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Most patients can be managed as outpatients; **admit** for:

- **Systemic toxicity**: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, or altered mental status [^83fdbfec].

- **Immunocompromise**: HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive therapy.

- **Failure of outpatient therapy**: No improvement after appropriate outpatient care.

- **Severe comorbidities**: Uncontrolled diabetes, renal failure, or significant cardiopulmonary disease.

---

## Follow-up and recurrence evaluation

Arrange **follow-up** within 48–72 hours to assess response and wound healing. For recurrent abscesses, evaluate for **MRSA colonization**, diabetes, immunodeficiency, or hidradenitis suppurativa, and consider **decolonization** and chronic suppressive therapy if indicated [^0a15806b].

---

The workup for an extremity abscess prioritizes **clinical assessment** and **selective testing**; use ultrasound when uncertain, obtain cultures for severe or recurrent cases, and reserve imaging for deep or complicated infections. Most patients can be managed as outpatients, with admission reserved for systemic illness or immunocompromise.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^c3009c22]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^c86d6864]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: osteomyelitis [^6706968a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis can present to the emergency department as an acute, subacute, or chronic orthopedic concern. The presentation can range from subtle, as with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in the pediatric patient population, to obvious, as with the diabetic patient who presents with a foot ulcer overlying exposed bone. Accurate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, whether with antibiotics, debridement, or both, are important in helping determine the ultimate outcome in this potential orthopedic pitfall. We review here the clinical presentation, diagnostic techniques, and management options for osteomyelitis that are applicable to the emergency practitioner.

### Decreased antibiotic utilization after implementation of a guideline for inpatient cellulitis and cutaneous abscess… [^07601f11]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Broad anaerobic activity: β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, clindamycin, or imipenem-cilastatin. A, All cases; B, patients with cellulitis; C, patients with cutaneous abscess. Duration of antibiotic therapy by time period. A, All cases; B, patients with cellulitis; C, patients with cutaneous abscess. Parenteral vancomycin was suggested for empirical therapy15, 33 in addition to adjunctive use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, 34 unless contraindicated, and elevation of the affected area. 15, 33 Use of antimicrobial agents with broad aerobic gram-negative or anaerobic activity was specifically discouraged. On clinical improvement in cases in which culture data were not available, transition to oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was recommended. 15 A total course of therapy of 7 days was suggested, with longer courses reserved for cases of severe or poorly responsive disease.

8, 15, 33 To promote knowledge of, and adherence to, the guideline, we performed a multifaceted implementation strategy consisting of 4 components. All end points were specified prior to the study. The primary outcome was change in antimicrobial exposure as measured by duration of therapy and use of agents with a broad spectrum of aerobic gram-negative activity and anaerobic activity. Duration of therapy was defined as the number of calendar days that a patient received antibiotic treatment. Overall, significantly fewer patients were exposed to antimicrobial therapy with a broad spectrum of aerobic gram-negative activity, antipseudomonal activity, and anaerobic activity during the intervention period. These trends were similar when stratified by classification of cellulitis or cutaneous abscess.

We observed 45%, 36%, and 36% relative declines in the use of broad aerobic gram-negative agents, antipseudomonal agents, and broad anaerobic agents, respectively. These improvements were observed in cases of both cellulitis and abscess. We did not observe an increase in adverse clinical outcomes in such cases during the intervention period despite the more frequent use of doxycycline.

### Musculoskeletal infections in the Emergency department [^b9e878d1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Bone and joint infections are potentially limb-threatening or even life-threatening diseases. Emergency physicians must consider infection when evaluating musculoskeletal complaints, as misdiagnosis can have significant consequences. Patients with bone and joint infections can have heterogeneous presentations with nonspecific signs and symptoms. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly implicated microorganism. Although diagnosis may be suggested by physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging, tissue sampling for Gram stain and microbiologic culture is preferable, as pathogen identification and susceptibility testing help optimize long-term antibiotic therapy. A combination of medical and surgical interventions is often necessary to effectively manage these challenging infections.

Bacteremia management — Early source control and imaging are emphasized, and intravenous (IV) to oral transition is allowed with defined duration. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed; repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection; antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate when bacteremia cleared promptly and there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess, and Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

Septic arthritis in children — imaging selection and diagnostic caveats outline risk stratification and first-line tests. The Kocher criteria include "fever, leukocytosis, inability to bear weight, and elevated inflammatory markers", and "If ≥ 3 criteria are positive, the probability of septic arthritis can be > 90%". Imaging cannot distinguish infected from sterile joint fluid, and "Definitive diagnosis requires synovial fluid analysis". Ultrasonography is "usually appropriate as a first-line imaging modality" and can show effusion and hyperemia, but "False-negative studies may occur within 24 hours of symptom onset". MRI is "usually appropriate for first-line or next-step imaging" to detect adjacent infections, and predictive algorithms for MRI "have demonstrated variable sensitivity and specificity". A psoas abscess may mimic septic arthritis, and evaluation modalities include "ultrasonography, MRI, and CT", with radiologist consultation if concerned.

### Contemporary management of open extremity fractures: what you need to know [^2dff9b60]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Open extremity fractures are high-risk injuries prone to significant complications, including soft tissue loss, bone defects, infection, infected nonunion, and the necessity for limb amputation. Large-scale multicenter prospective studies from the Lower Extremity Assessment Project and the Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium have provided novel scientific insights pertinent to the timeliness and appropriateness of specific treatment modalities aimed at improving outcomes of patients with open extremity injuries. These include the imperative for early administration of intravenous antibiotics within 3 hours of injury, preferably within 1 hour of hospital admission. Unlike the proven value of early antibiotics, the time to initial surgical debridement does not appear to affect infection rates and patient outcomes. Recent evidence-based consensus guidelines from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons provide scientific guidance for preventing surgical site infections in patients with open extremity fractures and support the decision making of limb salvage versus amputation in critical open extremity injuries. Patient survival represents the overarching priority in the management of any trauma patient with associated orthopedic injuries. Therefore, the timing and modality of managing open fractures must take into account the patient's physiology, response to resuscitation, and overall injury burden. The present review was designed to provide a state-of-the-art overview on the recommended diagnostic workup and management strategies for patients with open extremity fractures, based on the current scientific evidence.

Regarding specific circumstances for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to patients with complex abscesses, SIS-E/WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to administer empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria) in the presence of systemic signs of infection, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete, or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis.

### Point-of-care ultrasound in diagnosing pyomyositis: a report of three cases [^7c3726db]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pyomyositis is a bacterial infection of skeletal muscle that often results in deep intramuscular abscesses. The absence of external dermatologic manifestations in the early stages of pyomyositis makes this a challenging diagnosis. In addition, physical examination findings can be difficult to distinguish from more common processes, such as soft-tissue cellulitis. Clinicians can fail to diagnose this serious disease in a timely manner, resulting in delayed treatment and potential clinical deterioration from sepsis. Although advanced imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide excellent detail, ultrasound (US) can also be used to detect this disease. US can be performed expeditiously at the bedside and is less expensive than CT or MRI. It allows the clinician to examine the deeper tissue planes of muscle, in which purulent fluid collections will develop as pyomyositis advances.

Case Report

Three patients presenting with leg pain were evaluated with point-of-care (POC) US and diagnosed with pyomyositis. The early diagnosis of this condition prompted rapid treatment with administration of appropriate antibiotics and involvement of orthopedic surgery. Aspiration of fluid allowed for detailed fluid analysis and bacterial cultures. Additional diagnostic imaging was performed, confirming the initial US diagnosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? POC US can be helpful in identifying and further delineating intramuscular abscesses and can subsequently lead to expedited and appropriate care in patients who present with extremity pain, but lack significant dermatologic changes.

### Abscess incision and drainage with or without ultrasonography: a randomized controlled trial [^b38165ea]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

We hypothesize that clinical failure rates will be lower in patients treated with point-of-care ultrasonography and incision and drainage compared with those who undergo incision and drainage after physical examination alone.

Methods

We performed a prospective randomized clinical trial of patients presenting with a soft tissue abscess at a large, academic emergency department. Patients presenting with an uncomplicated soft tissue abscess requiring incision and drainage were eligible for enrollment and randomized to treatment with or without point-of-care ultrasonography. The diagnosis of an abscess was by physical examination, bedside ultrasonography, or both. Patients randomized to the point-of-care ultrasonography group had an incision and drainage performed with bedside ultrasonographic imaging of the abscess. Patients randomized to the non-point-of-care ultrasonography group had an incision and drainage performed with physical examination alone. Comparison between groups was by comparing means with 95% confidence intervals. The primary outcome was failure of therapy at 10 days, defined as a repeated incision and drainage, following a per-protocol analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed to control for study variables. Our study was designed to detect a clinically important difference between groups, which we defined as a 13% difference.

Results

A total of 125 patients were enrolled, 63 randomized to the point-of-care ultrasonography group and 62 to physical examination alone. After loss to follow-up and misallocation, 54 patients in the ultrasonography group and 53 in the physical examination alone group were analyzed. The overall failure rate for all patients enrolled in the study was 10.3%. Patients who were evaluated with ultrasonography were less likely to fail therapy and have repeated incision and drainage, with a difference between groups of 13.3% (95% confidence interval 0.0% to 19.4%). Abscess locations were predominantly torso (21%), buttocks (21%), lower extremity (18%), and axilla or groin (16%). There was no difference in baseline characteristics between groups relative to abscess size, duration of symptoms before presentation, percentage with cellulitis, and treatment with antibiotics.

Conclusion

Patients with soft tissue abscesses who were undergoing incision and drainage with point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrated less clinical failure compared with those treated without point-of-care ultrasonography.

### Utility of routine blood cultures for upper extremity abscesses [^cbd8bef4]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are often admitted by the emergency department for intravenous antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage of abscesses if necessary. As part of the initial diagnostic workup, blood cultures are routinely drawn at our institution in patients with SSTIs. This study seeks to identify the utility of performing blood cultures in patients with upper extremity abscesses as it relates to the number of incision and drainage (I&D) procedures performed, patient readmission rates, and length of hospital stay.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of 314 patients aged 18 to 89 years who underwent 1 or more I&D procedures of upper extremity abscesses were included in the study. Patient demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory values, wound and blood culture results, number of I&D procedures performed, length of stay, and readmission rates were evaluated.

Results

Increasing age and white blood count were associated with an increased number of I&Ds performed. Obtaining blood cultures, whether positive or negative, was associated with increased length of stay. There was no association between obtaining blood cultures and number of procedures performed on multivariable analysis. Positive blood cultures were associated with increased readmission rates.

Conclusions

Routinely obtaining blood cultures in patients with upper extremity abscesses may not be beneficial. Obtaining blood cultures is not associated with an increased number of I&D procedures or readmission rates. Furthermore, obtaining blood cultures, regardless of positivity, is associated with increased lengths of hospital stay.

### Cerebral abscess presenting as a complex febrile seizure [^39a51868]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no standardized approach to the management of complex febrile seizures in children and there are no published practice guidelines for the procurement of neuroimaging. Presented is a 2-year-old female patient who experienced a 3- to 5-minute episode of staring and unilateral mouth twitching associated with high fever. On initial presentation, the patient appeared well and had a normal neurological examination. No focus of infection was identified, and she was diagnosed with complex febrile seizure. The patient was discharged home with close neurology and primary care follow-up but returned the following day with altered mental status, toxic appearance, and right lower extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed left-sided cranial empyema and the patient was managed with antibiotics and surgical drainage. A literature review to answer the question "Do children with complex febrile seizures require emergent neuroimaging?" yielded a small number of retrospective reviews describing the utility of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture in the work-up of febrile seizures. Current evidence indicates that neuroimaging is not indicated in an otherwise healthy child who presents with complex febrile seizure if the patient is well appearing and has no evidence of focal neurological deficit on examination. As this case demonstrates, however, serious conditions such as meningitis and brain abscess (though rare) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex febrile seizure and physicians should remain aware that the need for neuroimaging and/or lumbar puncture may arise in the appropriate clinical setting.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: policy statement [^39fc4f0f]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Musculoskeletal infections — Although radiographs are insensitive for the detection of acute bone infections, they may be considered as an initial examination to evaluate for other pathologies such as trauma or malignancy. If there is high clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis, MRI should be considered as the diagnostic test of choice, given its accuracy for diagnosis and ability to detect concomitant adjacent infections, and it is best that such imaging is performed at the institution where definitive care will be delivered. Ultrasonography is an appropriate diagnostic modality to identify joint effusions; however, it cannot distinguish between sterile joint fluid and septic arthritis, therefore a definitive diagnosis requires synovial fluid analysis, and MRI may be helpful in patients in whom there is clinical suspicion for concomitant osteomyelitis.

### The utility of ultrasound for diagnosing purulent infections of the upper extremity [^32ec686b]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to determine the test characteristics of formal ultrasound when used to diagnose upper extremity soft tissue abscess in the setting of suspected infection.

Methods

We completed a retrospective chart review of all patients who had formal ultrasounds at our institution for the indication of diagnosing upper extremity abscess between July 2010 and July 2013. Using presence of purulence as the gold standard for diagnosis of abscess, we calculated the test characteristics of ultrasound. We then performed a series of logistic regression models with ultrasound being the independent variable of interest.

Results

Using search criteria consistent with upper extremity abscess, we identified 512 patients who underwent ultrasound examinations during our study period. Of these, 178 met the enrollment criteria. Ultrasound reports revealed 110 negative findings, 37 definitively positive findings, and 31 ambiguous findings. Forty-four patients had a final diagnosis of abscess, and 15 of these patients had negative or ambiguous ultrasounds. The sensitivity of definitively positive ultrasound was 65.9%. The specificity was 94.0%. Positive predictive value (PPV) of a definitively positive ultrasound result was 78.4%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of a definitively negative result was 90%. Logistic regression demonstrated a statistically significant association between definitively positive ultrasound and abscess, but no association between ambiguous ultrasound and abscess after adjustment for significant covariates.

Conclusions

Ultrasound is not a sensitive method to detect the presence of abscess in the setting of upper extremity infection. However, in this population of patients with suspected abscess, the negative predictive value was high with and without the inclusion of ambiguous results, suggesting reasonable utility of ultrasound as a rule-out test.

### Bedside ultrasound in the diagnosis of complex hand infections: a case series [^4d6018b3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The red, swollen, infected hand can be a diagnostically challenging presentation in the emergency department (ED). Hand infections are a relatively uncommon ED complaint, and diagnoses may range from simple cellulitis to deep space abscess, and even to suppurative flexor tenosynovitis. The accurate differentiation of these clinical entities is of paramount importance to healing and recovery of function.

Case Series

In this case series, we review 4 patients with similar presenting complaints of a red, swollen hand, but with much different diagnoses and eventual treatment strategies. We describe how ultrasound was used to assist in making the diagnosis and initiating the most appropriate therapy. Finally, we review techniques for sonographic evaluation of the hand and provide imaging tips to improve visualization and accurate diagnosis. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Bedside ultrasound may allow for a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of various hand infections when diagnosis by physical examination is unclear.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

Question 4: Are There Preferred Antibiotics With Which to Treat Osteomyelitis?

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of infected fluid collections [^db0e6018]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infected fluid collections are common and occur in a variety of clinical scenarios throughout the body. Minimally invasive image-guided management strategies for infected fluid collections are often preferred over more invasive options, given their low rate of complications and high rates of success. However, specific clinical scenarios, anatomic considerations, and prior or ongoing treatments must be considered when determining the optimal management strategy. As such, several common scenarios relating to infected fluid collections were developed using evidence-based guidelines for management. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^9cad1943]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — diagnosis and microbiology emphasize polymicrobial involvement and tissue-based confirmation. Numerous different anaerobic and aerobic organisms can be cultured from the involved fascial plane, with an average of 5 pathogens in each wound, and most originate from bowel or genitourinary flora. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show edema along the fascial plane, but sensitivity and specificity are ill defined, and in practice, clinical judgment is the most important element in diagnosis. A definitive bacteriologic diagnosis is best established by culture and Gram stain of deep tissue obtained at operation or by positive blood cultures; Gram-positive cocci in chains suggest Streptococcus and large gram-positive cocci in clusters suggest S. aureus. If there is no necrosis on exploratory incision, the procedure can be terminated with very little risk or morbidity, and while biopsy for frozen section analysis may be used, gross inspection usually suffices and biopsy alone may produce a false-negative result.

### Point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of Skin and soft tissue abscesses: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^79b1d989]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Skin and soft tissue infections are a common chief complaint in the emergency department. Research has shown that clinical examination alone can be unreliable in distinguishing between cellulitis and abscesses, a distinction that is important because they each require different treatments. Point-of-care ultrasonography has been increasingly studied as a tool to improve the diagnostic accuracy for these skin and soft tissue infections. The primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for abscesses. Subgroup analyses are performed for adult versus pediatric patients and high suspicion versus clinically unclear cases. Secondary objectives include the percentage of correct versus incorrect changes in management and reduction in treatment failures because of point-of-care ultrasonography.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were assessed from inception to July 26, 2019, for all prospective studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for evaluation of skin and soft tissue abscesses. Data were dual extracted into a predefined work sheet and quality analysis was performed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Diagnostic accuracy was reported as sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

We identified 14 studies comprising 2,656 total patients. Point-of-care ultrasonography was 94.6% sensitive (95% CI 89.4% to 97.4%) and 85.4% specific (95% CI 78.9% to 90.2%), with an LR+ of 6.5 (95% CI 4.4 to 9.6) and LR- of 0.06 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.13). Among cases with a high pretest suspicion for abscess or cellulitis, point-of-care ultrasonography was 93.5% sensitive (95% CI 90.4% to 95.7%) and 89.1% specific (95% CI 78.3% to 94.9%), with an LR+ of 8.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 18.1) and LR- of 0.07 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.12). Among cases that were clinically unclear, point-of-care ultrasonography was 91.9% sensitive (95% CI 77.5% to 97.4%) and 76.9% specific (95% CI 65.3% to 85.5%), with an LR+ of 4.0 (95% CI 2.5 to 6.3) and LR- of 0.11 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.32). Among adults, point-of-care ultrasonography was 98.7% sensitive (95% CI 95.3% to 99.8%) and 91.0% specific (95% CI 84.4% to 95.4%), with an LR+ of 10.9 (95% CI 6.2 to 19.2) and LR- of 0.01 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.06). Among pediatric patients, point-of-care ultrasonography was 89.9% sensitive (95% CI 81.8% to 94.6%) and 79.9% specific (95% CI 71.5% to 86.3%), with an LR+ of 4.5 (95% CI 3.1 to 6.4) and LR- of 0.13 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). Point-of-care ultrasonography led to a correct change in management in 10.3% of cases (95% CI 8.9% to 11.8%) and led to an incorrect change in management in 0.7% of cases (95% CI 0.3% to 1.1%).

Conclusion

According to the current data, point-of-care ultrasonography has good diagnostic accuracy for differentiating abscesses from cellulitis and led to a correct change in management in 10% of cases. Future studies should determine the ideal training and image acquisition protocols.

### Ultrasound-guided diagnosis of femoral osteomyelitis and abscess [^22efb644]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are common disease presentations to the pediatric emergency department, and rapid and accurate identification of potentially serious skin and soft tissue infections is critical. In cases of atraumatic musculoskeletal pain with systemic complaints, a bacterial etiology must be ruled out. Point-of-care ultrasonography is increasingly common in the pediatric emergency department and assists in rapid and accurate identification of a variety of disease processes. We present a case of a 14-year-old adolescent boy with atraumatic right knee pain to illustrate the benefits of point-of-care ultrasonography in the timely diagnosis of musculoskeletal and soft tissue pathology. Moreover, we describe the use of ultrasound in procedural guidance of deep-space fluid aspiration, with an eventual diagnosis of femoral osteomyelitis. Ultrasonographic techniques and the emergent work-up and management of osteomyelitis are reviewed.

### Utility of total lower extremity radiography investigation of nonweight bearing in the young child [^be113f18]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this work was to determine the utility of total lower extremity radiographs versus dedicated tibia radiographs in the evaluation of the young child presenting with nonweight bearing without localizing signs.

Methods

This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective review of 263 consecutive patients between the ages of 9 months and 4 years who were referred for total lower extremity radiography between September 29, 2001, and November 7, 2006. Among these, a total of 133 study subjects met inclusion criteria of presentation with nonweight bearing without localizing signs or history of previous trauma. The control population was selected from 1089 consecutive patients between the ages of 9 months and 4 years evaluated from January 5, 1999 and December 8, 2006, who had only tibia radiographs at presentation. From this group, a final control population of 128 patients was selected with similar presentation of nonweight bearing without localizing signs or history of previous trauma. Causes of nonweight bearing were recorded for both groups based on radiograph findings and additional studies performed during workup.

Results

At initial presentation, fractures were present in 13 study patients (9.8%) and in 23 control patients (17.9%). Total fractures (when including follow-up) were present in 14 study patients (10.5%) and in 26 control patients (20.3%). Fractures were located in the tibia alone in 100% of patients in the study group. Extratibial fracture (metatarsal) was present in 1 patient in the control group (0.7%). Among the study group, additional diagnoses included rickets (n = 1), cerebellar ataxia (n = 1), and discitis with epidural abscess (n = 1).

Conclusions

Our study findings indicate that the diagnostic value of total lower extremity radiography is similar to dedicated tibia radiography in the workup of the nonweight-bearing young child without trauma history or localizing signs. Radiation and cost savings can be realized by reserving additional radiographs for patients with high clinical suspicion and normal findings on dedicated tibia radiography.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^ab27a038]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Current understanding

A skin abscess is an isolated collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues. Uncomplicated skin abscesses are collections of pus within the skin structures and are usually caused by bacterial infections. Careful history and clinical examination are usually sufficient to diagnose a skin abscess. Skin abscesses present as single or multiple tender, erythematous, indurated nodules, often surrounded by an area of erythema or swelling. Fluctuance beneath the skin often indicates a fluid filled cavity. There may be a pustule at the area where the abscess is closest to the skin or spontaneous drainage of pus. The use of point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate an abscess from other soft tissue infections in the emergency department.

Skin infections are common. More than 4% of people seek treatment for skin infections annually in the United States. In European countries, it may be less common: in Belgium and the Netherlands about 0.5–0.6% visit their general practitioner with bacterial skin infections each year.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Imaging approach for suspected pediatric ABA — role of MRI: The presumptive diagnosis of ABA can usually be made by a combination of clinical examination, laboratory tests and ultrasound without advanced imaging by MRI, and obtaining an MRI routinely in all children presenting with suspected ABA does not appear necessary; however, if plain radiographs and ultrasound have not provided sufficient information to determine need for joint aspiration or arthrotomy, then the advanced imaging modality of choice is MRI, which may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, determining the extent of infection, identifying abscesses requiring surgical intervention, and distinguishing transient nonbacterial synovitis or other inflammatory arthritis from ABA.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^fdbd30e4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), to develop questions on seven main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology (retained anorectal bodies, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, complicated hemorrhoids, acute anal fissure, anorectal abscess, bleeding anorectal varices, complicated anorectal prolapse). Leading specialists in the field then were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and November 2019 and a systematic review of the available literature. They were asked to focus their search to provide evidence-based answers to every question with immediate practical application and to summarize them in statements. Furthermore, the references were kept up to date and the last literature search was performed in January 2021. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES - AAST - WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies held in Parma, Italy, on December 12, 2019, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES - AAST panelists was reached. An international expert panel discussed the different issues in subsequent rounds. At each round, the manuscript was revised and improved. The final version about which agreement was reached resulted in the present manuscript. All the members contributed to the development of the manuscript.

The questions were created according to the PICO criteria, and the following guidelines adopt the GRADE methodology.

Topics and questions

For clarity, we report the seven topics together with the relative questions. The statements are summarized in Table 1.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^08fdd4c0]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for suspected acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) with concern for adjacent infection — In children with suspected ABA requiring further imaging to assess extent of inflammation and infection, including adjacent osteomyelitis and pyomyositis, the guideline states "we suggest performing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study rather than other imaging modalities (eg, computerized tomography (CT) or bone scintigraphy) (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". Children at higher risk for adjacent osteomyelitis are described as having "more than 3 or 4 days of symptoms prior to presentation, S. aureus infection, and marked elevation of CRP", though "these risk factors require further validation". The page adds that MRI "may provide anatomic detail needed to define the extent of infection in and around the infected joint including identification of adjacent osteomyelitis and soft tissue abscesses".

### How do you treat an abscess in the era of increased community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? [^118f47d7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the era of increased prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there have been a number of questions and several recent studies that address the clinical management of uncomplicated abscesses in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

We examine the historical and clinical predictors for MRSA in patients with an uncomplicated abscess and review the evidence behind the use of wound cultures, decolonization, antibiotics, irrigation, and packing after incision and drainage. We found that current recommendations and treatment guidelines are often based on limited data, expert opinion, and anecdotal experience.

Conclusion

In light of the data currently available, antibiotics and decolonization should be used selectively, not routinely, for treatment of most uncomplicated abscesses. Wound cultures are generally not necessary in the ED, and all patients should be given return precautions for worsening symptoms.

### 'Dot in circle sign': a characteristic finding in ultrasound and MR imaging of soft tissue mycetomas [^5a222436]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Demonstration of the causative organism by biopsy and microbial culture is often difficult and necessitates repeat biopsy leading to delayed diagnosis and increased patient morbidity. Characteristic MRI and ultrasound features can lead to early diagnosis and prompt therapy. Depending on the extent of the disease, patients with only soft tissue involvement can be managed with antimicrobial therapy alone. Bone involvement would require surgical intervention with partial resection or amputation.

Learning points

A diagnosis of mycetoma is to be considered in the list of differential diagnosis for patients with long-standing, painless swelling of the extremities from endemic areas, even in the absence of multiple draining sinuses.
'Dot in circle' sign is a characteristic ultrasound and MR imaging finding for the diagnosis of mycetoma.
Inclusion of MRI in the workup of patients with suspected mycetoma can aid in early diagnosis, as well as assess the extent of disease thereby aiding in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^1d382c02]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower‐limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovidand Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower‐limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high‐quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic?

Diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.
Approximately one in three patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis do not have cellulitis and are given another diagnosis on discharge. Consequently, this results in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.
There are no diagnostic criteria available for lower‐limb cellulitis in the U.K.

What does this study add?

This systematic review has identified a key research gap in the diagnosis of lower‐limb cellulitis.
There is a current lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^b9e4b037]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, CT, MRI, and EUS could have a role in the diagnosis of perianal abscesses, with the principal aims of excluding related conditions and correctly determining the regional anatomy and extent of the disease; the choice of the appropriate imaging investigation should take into account multiple factors, such as patient's past medical history, clinical presentation, local availability of resources, and skills. After the resolution of the acute phase, routine imaging after incision and drainage of the anorectal abscess is usually not required. An imaging follow-up is otherwise suggested in cases of recurrence, in the presence of suspected IBD and when there is evidence of a fistula and/or non-healing wound.

1.C - In patients with an anorectal abscess, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with anorectal abscess, we recommend a surgical approach with incision and drainage (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

In patients with anorectal abscess, we suggest to base the timing of surgery on the presence and severity of sepsis (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In fit, immunocompetent patients with a small perianal abscess and without systemic signs of sepsis we suggest considering an outpatient management (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

The primary treatment of anorectal abscesses remains surgical drainage, with the timing being dictated by the severity and nature of any sepsis. In general, the incision should be kept as close as possible to the anal verge to minimize the length of a potential fistula, while still providing adequate drainage and avoiding sphincteral damage. It is important to stress the high rate of recurrence after drainage, which can be as high as 44%. The risk factors associated with recurrence are inadequate drainage, loculations, horseshoe-type abscess, and time from disease onset to incision. The high recurrence rate and the associated risk factors emphasize the need for a complete and accurate drainage of the abscess. A recent randomized prospective study on needle aspiration treatment vs. incision and drainage of acute simple perianal abscess emphasized the importance of a complete drainage of the perianal abscess, with recurrence rates of 41% following needle aspiration compared to 15% after incision and drainage.

Further analyses are also necessary to delineate the lack of improvement in the proportion of lower limb XRs performed. The available data obtained was not sufficiently granular to allow for the specific reasons leading to this lack of improvement to be identified. Anecdotal evidence and discussion with experienced senior physicians suggested the possibility of undifferentiated clinical presentations confounding the initial diagnostic impression in some patients who were ultimately diagnosed with lower limb cellulitis, leading to lower limb XRs being performed even with the availability and awareness of management guidance. For example, a physician could diagnose a patient presenting with a painful red forefoot with cellulitis, gout or a fracture and subsequently order a limb radiograph to narrow the differential diagnoses. It is also unclear what factors led to week-to-week variation in the proportion of patients with investigations performed within the individual pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. This lends itself to the potential for further evolution of this quality improvement initiative and further data analytics.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections

11) A rapidly progressive soft tissue infection should be always treated aggressively as a necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C)

12) Both CT and MRI may be useful for diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. However MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency situations. (Recommendation 2 C).

13) In unstable patients, ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (Recommendation 2 C).

Management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

14) Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock caused by NSTI require early source control, antimicrobial therapy, and supportive treatment (Recommendation 1 C).

Source control in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

15) Surgical source control must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process caused by NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

Hyperbaric oxygen in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

16) Although the benefit of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy remains controversial, it may be considered where it is available (Recommendation 2 C).

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of deep space hand infection [^943ea3b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Point-of-care ultrasound is emerging as an important imaging modality for characterizing soft-tissue infections and provides advantages over physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Case Report

A 30-year-old man presented to the emergency department with extensive left upper extremity cellulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left arm was preliminarily interpreted as soft-tissue swelling without evidence of deep-space infection. Point-of-care ultrasound revealed pockets of fluid with sonographic fluctuance tracking along the tendon sheath that were concerning for deep abscesses. Based on the ultrasound findings, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room, where multiple left hand and wrist loculated deep-space abscesses were decompressed. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report highlights the significant advantages and easy-to-learn findings present in point-of-care ultrasound of musculoskeletal infections.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

CT scan and ultrasound studies are also useful (strong, moderate). 31. Cultures of blood and abscess material should be obtained (strong, moderate). 32. Vancomycin is recommended for initial empirical therapy. An agent active against enteric gram-negative bacilli should be added for infection in immunocompromised patients or following open trauma to the muscles (strong, moderate). 33. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillin (eg, nafcillin or oxacillin) is recommended for treatment of pyomyositis caused by MSSA (strong, moderate). 34. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed (strong, high). 35. Repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection (strong, low). 36. Antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate for patients whose bacteremia cleared promptly and those with no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess. Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: technical report [^7c0fe4fa]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Soft tissue infections — pyomyositis imaging selection and performance: In general, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) with contrast, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast are all useful in the detection and evaluation of soft tissue infections, but radiographs are insensitive. MRI is the preferred modality for suspected pyomyositis because of high sensitivity and the ability to identify associated osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases specifically recommend MRI with IV contrast for suspected pyomyositis, and CT and ultrasonography are considered helpful if MRI is not available. Ultrasonography may show increased muscle volume and echogenicity with hypoechoic septa and hyperemia during the invasive stage, which can progress to a discrete abscess in the suppurative phase.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^453dfbc1]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Lower limb cellulitis is a frequently encountered condition in the acute hospital setting, yet many patients with only mild lower limb cellulitis undergo unnecessary collection of blood cultures and X-ray imaging. This leads to increased healthcare costs and prolongation of the length of hospitalisation.

A retrospective review of electronic medical records was performed to determine the frequency of blood cultures and lower limb X-rays performed for patients with lower limb cellulitis presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine and admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine, in a national tertiary hospital.

Quality improvement methods were implemented to increase accessibility to and awareness of lower limb cellulitis management guidance among clinical staff, to empower appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis. The percentage of patient encounters with blood cultures performed subsequently improved from a baseline median of 73.3% to a post-intervention median of 52.3%, with direct healthcare cost savings and additional ancillary beneficial effects for patients and healthcare staff. However, no reduction in the frequency of imaging performed was observed, for which the opportunity arises for further root-cause analyses and intervention.

Encouraging small changes in individual clinicians' routine daily clinical practice through quality improvement initiatives results in significant impacts when multiplied across healthcare staff and departments. Initiatives implemented need to be accessible, realistic and pragmatic to maximise real-world on the ground effects and facilitate a sustained impact.

### Inpatient management of diabetic foot disorders: a clinical guide [^a53cce8f]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Medical management of infection

More than half of DFUs are clinically infected at the time of presentation. Recognizing the presence of infection in a DFU is crucial because infection is often the immediate precipitating event for a lower extremity amputation. Infection is diagnosed clinically by the presence of at least two signs or symptoms of inflammation or purulent secretions. Diabetic foot infections (DFI) should be classified according to their severity, using one of the similar validated systems devised by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (Table 3).

Table 3
Diabetic Foot Infection Classification Schemes: IDSA/International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot

Hospitalization is rarely required for mild infections and for only some of the patients with a moderate infection (defined as those with > 2 cm surrounding erythema or infection that penetrates deeper than the subcutaneous tissue). Hospitalization is appropriate when a moderate infection is accompanied by limb ischemia or not responding to outpatient treatment. Patients with severe (grade 4) infections (those accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, or severe metabolic perturbations) should be hospitalized. The most recent guidelines of the IDSA define severe infection as the presence of local infection associated with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. (Table 3) Although patients with diabetes can present with systemic signs of infection (fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, malaise, loss of glycemic control, etc.), they may not mount a robust systemic response. Correction of an abnormal white blood cell count or hyperglycemia should be tracked during hospitalization to help monitor the response to treatment. In most studies hyperglycemia is associated with poor wound healing and it is likely that its correction would increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. Plain film radiographs of the foot and ankle should be obtained to assess for bone destruction, deformity, foreign body, or soft tissue emphysema. The presence of soft tissue gas on radiographs, abscess or extensive gangrene should alert the team that prompt surgical intervention is required (Figs. 2 and 3).

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

Surgical site infection — procedural management and systemic therapy indicate that suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections associated with a significant systemic response, such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5°C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/mL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low).

AV access infection — epidemiology and diagnostic evaluation — reports that arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) have a "median infectious complication rate of 0.11/1,000 days" and a "positive blood culture rate of 0.08/1,000 days". In the upper extremity, "Skin organisms S aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis account for 70% to 90% of AV access infections", with "a higher incidence of Gram-negative organisms in lower-extremity AV accesses". AV access infection "may be polymicrobial, with a variety of causative organisms, including fungi". For diagnosis, "The physical examination and routine laboratory studies are usually sufficient to establish the diagnosis", while Doppler ultrasound "can detect the source of bacteremia, presence of any aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms, document the presence of fluid around the vein/nonautogenous access, and help determine the extent of the infection", and "can differentiate the type of fluid around the AV access (ie, hematoma vs seroma vs abscess)". Other imaging "can be used, including CT, PET, indium scans, and technetium scans, although they are rarely necessary and not as universally available", and "PET and nuclear medicine scans may help exclude an occult infection in a thrombosed, nonfunctional AVG".

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^740c88e9]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Infection is similarly an important risk factor for wound healing failure and, in the case of DFUs, for subsequent lower extremity amputation. Even excessive bioburden can inhibit normal progression to wound healing. While acutely infected wounds are easily diagnosed, neuropathy can mask the presence of deep infections or abscess. Hence, clinical suspicion must remain high when insensate patients complain of pain or flu-like symptoms. Once diagnosed, infection complicating chronic wounds must be treated aggressively. This includes thorough debridement, surgical drainage of abscesses, debridement of infected bone, and tissue culture-guided antimicrobial therapy. As previously mentioned, clinically noninfected ulcers should not be cultured nor treated with systemic antimicrobial therapy. However, if osteomyelitis is suspected, bone culture, followed by specific antimicrobial therapy (and perhaps surgery), is warranted for this recalcitrant infection.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^7d14c678]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections — culture indications and specimen approach emphasize that for the common forms of SSTIs, cultures are not indicated for uncomplicated infections (cellulitis, subcutaneous abscesses) treated in the outpatient setting, and whether lesion or tissue cultures are beneficial in managing cellulitis in the hospitalized patient is uncertain and the sensitivity of blood cultures in this setting is low; cultures are indicated for the patient who requires operative incision and drainage because of risk for deep structure and underlying tissue involvement. In this section, cutaneous infections, involving skin and soft tissue, have been expanded and categorized as follows: trauma-associated, surgical site, burn wound, fungal, viral, human and animal bites, and device-related, and although S. aureus, especially MRSA, and S. pyogenes are the causative agents in the majority of these infections, other microorganisms, including fungi and viruses, are important and require appropriate medical and therapeutic management. At minimum, a Gram stain should be performed to assess and characterize indicators of surface contamination or infection combined with a description of morphotypes.

### Hand infections [^57fae849]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Hand infections are commonly seen by orthopedic surgeons as well as emergency room and primary care physicians. Identifying the cause of the infection and initiating prompt and appropriate medical or surgical treatment can prevent substantial morbidity. The most common bacteria implicated in hand infections remain Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species. Methicillin-resistant S aureus infections have become prevalent and represent a difficult problem best treated with empiric antibiotic therapy until the organism can be confirmed. Other organisms can be involved in specific situations that will be reviewed. Types of infections include cellulitis, superficial abscesses, deep abscesses, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. In recent years, treatment of these infections has become challenging owing to increased virulence of some organisms and drug resistance. Treatment involves a combination of proper antimicrobial therapy, immobilization, edema control, and adequate surgical therapy. Best practice management requires use of appropriate diagnostic tools, understanding by the surgeon of the unique and complex anatomy of the hand, and proper antibiotic selection in consultation with infectious disease specialists.

Early involvement of an infectious diseases specialist, a surgeon, and a dermatologist may result in improved outcome. Initial clinical impressions should be supplemented with a systemic approach to enhance diagnosis and management. Blood cultures are critical, and at least 2 sets should be obtained. Radiographic imaging should be performed as clinically indicated and can help define extent of disease; chest/sinus imaging may identify silent pulmonary or sinus infection with dissemination. The most specific method is biopsy or aspiration of lesions for histological, cytological, and microbiological evaluation.

Learning points

Delay in the diagnosis of soft tissue infection can lead to catastrophic consequences, such as contiguous spread of infection to bone and fistulisation, even in immunocompetent patients.
Since the key of successful management of osteomyelitis is early diagnosis, physicians must keep high suspicion in patients with persistent pain after trauma.
Acute osteomyelitis may respond to antibiotics alone and the duration of treatment should be guided by clinical evolution.

### Practice advisory for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^7d563918]. Anesthesiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Neuraxial techniques — management of infectious complications specifies that appropriate antibiotic therapy should always be administered at the earliest sign or symptom of a serious neuraxial infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases should be considered, and if an abscess is present, surgical consultation should be obtained to determine whether percutaneous drainage of the abscess or surgery (e.g., laminectomy) is warranted.

### Should we wait for development of an abscess before we perform incision and drainage? [^06c58f1c]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Deep neck infections are infections (either abscess or cellulitis) that are within the potential spaces and fascial planes of the head and neck. Deep neck infections should not be ignored, and no surgeon should underestimate the necessity of appropriate and timely treatment of deep neck infections due to the serious and potentially life-threatening nature of these infections. This article discusses and reviews the literature with regard to a question that has long been debated in the surgical literature, "Should we wait for the development of an abscess before performing incision and drainage?"

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" persist and can be useful in describing SSTIs as reported by Napolitano.

Uncomplicated SSTIs carry low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are improperly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to the most probable pathogen and local resistance patterns in impetigo, erysipelas, or mild cellulitis with drainage and debridement or simple surgical drainage in skin abscess.

Complicated SSTIs are associated with high risk for life-threatening infection. In patients who have complicated SSTIs, it is of paramount importance to initiate appropriate and adequate broad-spectrum initial empiric antibiotic therapy and to consider the need for surgical intervention for drainage and/or debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2: patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or are systemically well, but have a comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3: patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4: patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example necrotizing fasciitis.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: the role of imaging in diagnosis [^0c31d337]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, because of some similarity to other inflammatory conditions regarding their clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. The latter may lead to elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, and higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand, and emphasizes the key points that assist in the differentiation of the two broad clinical categories of infections versus inflammatory causes.
