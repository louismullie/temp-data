## Question

why there is joint pain in henoch schonlein purpura

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why joint pain occurs in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgA vasculitis) and how to explain the pathophysiology and clinical features. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental disease mechanism and whether IgA immune complex deposition explains joint symptoms. Then, I should verify the specific vascular targets in synovial tissue and how vasculitis translates into pain and swelling. Next, I will examine the inflammatory cascade and mediators that amplify nociception. After that, I need to check the clinical pattern of joint involvement and timing relative to the rash. Finally, I will consider triggers, differential points, and how treatment response supports the mechanistic model, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements about steroids and renal outcomes as I go [^117TaJ58] [^111tCrJ4].

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism. HSP is a systemic small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis driven by IgA-dominant immune complex deposition in capillaries, venules, and arterioles, which activates complement and recruits neutrophils, producing tissue injury and inflammation; this framework applies to skin, gut, kidney, and synovium alike, so joint symptoms are mechanistically expected rather than exceptional [^117TaJ58] [^111tCrJ4] [^113duybs].

> Wait, let me verify the synovial target. The synovium is richly vascularized, and in HSP, IgA immune complexes deposit in small vessels within the synovium, initiating a leukocytoclastic vasculitis that injures endothelium, increases permeability, and drives an inflammatory exudate; clinically, that manifests as arthralgia or non-deforming oligoarthritis, most often in large weight-bearing joints such as the knees and ankles, consistent with the distribution of synovial microvasculature and biomechanical stress [^111tCrJ4] [^112fN8Lj] [^113AqCDN].

> I will now examine the inflammatory cascade that converts vasculitis into pain. Immune complex–mediated complement activation (notably C3a/C5a) and neutrophil recruitment release proteases, reactive oxygen species, and cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF), which sensitize nociceptors and lower pain thresholds; endothelin-1 may also be elevated in acute HSP and contribute to vasoconstriction and ischemic pain amplification, aligning with the rapid onset and intensity of joint pain seen clinically [^116Q9Rdx] [^112Sguwx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the clinical pattern without checking the data. Joint symptoms in HSP are typically acute, migratory, and oligoarticular, favoring large lower-extremity joints; they can precede the rash by days, occur concurrently, or follow shortly thereafter, and they are usually self-limited and non-deforming, resolving within days, which fits a vasculitic rather than a destructive arthropathy model [^112fN8Lj] [^112bsKFQ] [^117TaJ58].

> But wait, what about triggers and context that make joints particularly vulnerable? Upper respiratory infections, especially streptococcal pharyngitis, commonly precede HSP, and seasonal clustering in autumn and winter mirrors infectious patterns; mechanical loading of large joints may exacerbate microvascular injury and inflammation, plausibly explaining the predilection for knees and ankles and the occasional worsening with weight bearing or activity [^114qVYv5] [^112h9WKs] [^112fN8Lj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought steroids prevent renal disease in HSP; let me reconsider and verify. Early prednisone reduces the intensity and duration of abdominal and joint pain and may hasten resolution of extrarenal symptoms, but randomized and systematic review data show no consistent benefit in preventing persistent renal disease, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize symptomatic benefit rather than renal prophylaxis; still, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect on joints is clinically meaningful and supports the inflammatory vasculitis model of joint pain in HSP [^112qgJWC] [^1169zjMc] [^117TaJ58].

> Next, I should review how treatment response informs mechanism. NSAIDs and short courses of glucocorticoids improve joint symptoms by dampening cytokine-driven inflammation and vasculitic injury, while disease-modifying agents are reserved for refractory or steroid-dependent courses; this pattern reinforces that joint pain in HSP reflects a reversible inflammatory vasculopathy rather than structural joint destruction [^111tCrJ4] [^112Qmv9x] [^1114EerP].

> I need to ensure the differential is considered. Transient, non-deforming oligoarthritis with palpable purpura and normal platelets points away from rheumatoid arthritis and toward IgA vasculitis; when the rash is absent early, HSP can mimic infection-related arthralgia or mechanical injury, but the subsequent emergence of purpura and the migratory, self-limited pattern should prompt reconsideration and alignment with EULAR/PRINTO/PRES classification criteria that include arthritis or arthralgia as a major feature alongside purpura [^113cAoFx] [^117TaJ58].

> Let me synthesize the causal chain to be sure nothing is missing. Infectious or other antigenic triggers in a genetically susceptible host lead to aberrant IgA1 responses and immune complex formation; these complexes deposit in synovial small vessels, activate complement, recruit neutrophils, and unleash proteases and cytokines that injure endothelium, increase vascular permeability, and sensitize nociceptors, producing acute, migratory, oligoarticular pain and swelling that characteristically resolve without permanent joint damage, which is why joint pain in HSP is best understood as a direct consequence of IgA-mediated small-vessel vasculitis within the synovium [^111tCrJ4] [^1155jYKe] [^117TaJ58].

---

Joint pain in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is caused by **IgA immune complex deposition** in small vessels of the synovium, triggering a **leukocytoclastic vasculitis** that leads to inflammation, swelling, and pain [^117TaJ58] [^111tCrJ4]. This is typically transient and non-deforming, most often affecting large weight-bearing joints such as the knees and ankles, and usually resolves within days without permanent damage [^112fN8Lj] [^1164yFZa]. The joint symptoms are part of the systemic immune response and often occur with or shortly after the rash, reflecting the underlying vasculitic process [^112bsKFQ].

---

## Pathophysiology of joint pain in HSP

The **key mechanism** is IgA immune complex deposition in synovial blood vessels, which activates complement and recruits neutrophils, causing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with endothelial injury, increased vascular permeability, and an inflammatory infiltrate that produces joint swelling and pain [^111tCrJ4] [^111czBZS].

---

## Clinical characteristics of joint involvement

- **Frequency**: Joint symptoms occur in ~75% of HSP cases, making them the second most common manifestation after skin lesions [^116SMgWa] [^113AqCDN].
- **Distribution**: Large weight-bearing joints are most commonly affected, particularly the knees and ankles; elbows, wrists, and small joints are less frequent [^112fN8Lj] [^1164yFZa].
- **Nature**: Joint symptoms are typically acute, transient, and non-deforming, with pain often accompanied by swelling and limited range of motion [^112fN8Lj] [^1164yFZa].
- **Course**: Joint symptoms usually resolve within days without permanent damage, though they may recur with disease flares [^112fN8Lj] [^1164yFZa].

---

## Triggers and contributing factors

Infections — especially upper respiratory infections — are common triggers, and HSP shows seasonal peaks in autumn and winter that align with infection patterns [^114qVYv5] [^113jZzDx]. Genetic predisposition may influence susceptibility and severity, though specific genes remain under study [^113duybs] [^1163sHop].

---

## Management of joint pain in HSP

- **Supportive care**: NSAIDs are first-line for pain and inflammation in the absence of contraindications (e.g. renal impairment, GI bleeding) [^111tCrJ4] [^1164yFZa].
- **Corticosteroids**: Short courses (e.g. prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks with taper) are effective for severe joint or abdominal pain, but do not prevent renal disease or alter long-term outcomes [^112qgJWC] [^117TaJ58].
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up is essential to assess for renal involvement and recurrence, as joint symptoms often coincide with systemic disease activity [^117TaJ58] [^112bsKFQ].

---

Joint pain in HSP reflects IgA-mediated small-vessel vasculitis in the synovium, producing transient, non-deforming arthritis that typically resolves spontaneously; management is supportive, with NSAIDs and short steroid courses for severe symptoms, and vigilance for renal complications [^111tCrJ4] [^117TaJ58].

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^114p11kM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an update on recent advances in the genetic susceptibility, pathogenesis and treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

Recent Findings

Recent work has advanced our understanding of the genetic susceptibility and pathogenesis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, but there are still significant gaps in our knowledge. Information concerning the most effective treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura has begun to emerge. Corticosteroid therapy reduces the duration and severity of abdominal and joint pain, but corticosteroids do not prevent the development of nephritis, or alter the natural history of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. The most effective treatment for severe nephritis remains unclear despite multiple, mostly retrospective reports investigating a variety of drugs.

Summary

Despite recent progress, our understanding of the genetic susceptibility, pathogenesis and treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura remains incomplete. Further research is necessary in order to clearly define the genetic susceptibility and the pathogenesis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Multicenter clinical trials are needed to determine the most effective treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, particularly for patients with severe nephritis.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^116SMgWa]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an acute, systemic, immune complex-mediated, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. It is characterized by a triad of palpable purpura (without thrombocytopenia), abdominal pain, and arthritis. Most patients have an antecedent upper respiratory illness. More than 90 percent of Henoch-Schönlein purpura cases occur in children younger than 10 years; however, adults with this condition are more likely to experience complications than children. All patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura develop a purpuric rash, 75 percent develop arthritis, 60 to 65 percent develop abdominal pain, and 40 to 50 percent develop renal disease. Because Henoch-Schönlein purpura spontaneously resolves in 94 percent of children and 89 percent of adults, supportive treatment is the primary intervention. Oral prednisone at 1 to 2 mg per kg daily for two weeks has been used to treat abdominal and joint symptoms. A meta-analysis found that corticosteroid use in children reduced the mean time to resolution of abdominal pain and decreased the odds of developing persistent renal disease. Early aggressive therapy with high-dose steroids plus immunosuppressants is recommended for patients with severe renal involvement. Long-term prognosis depends on the severity of renal involvement. End-stage renal disease occurs in 1 to 5 percent of patients.

Joint symptoms

Most children developed joint symptoms simultaneously with rashes or within 11 days of appearance of the rash. Forty-six cases (65%) developed joint symptoms after having had the rash for 1 to 3 days. Nineteen cases (27%) experienced the symptoms between 4 and 7 days, while four cases (6%) experienced symptoms in the period between 8 and 11 days.

The joint manifestations included arthritis and arthralgia. Some children had sudden onset of symptoms during resting state. The arthralgia was worsened on extra weight bearing. A total of 71 (100%) patients had arthralgia and discomfort, including 59 patients (83%) with joint swelling, three patients (4%) limited mobility in the absence of swelling; nine patients (13%) had arthralgia only. Distending pain (pain accompanied by a distending sensation) was reported in 29 cases (41%), sore pain (pain with sore and tired discomfort) in 22 cases (31%), hot pain (hot and painful) in 13 cases (18%) and seven cases had indescribable nature of pain (10%). Multiple joints were often involved (Fig. 5), and the pain was migratory and recurring in nature. In 46 cases (65%), the joint involvement was unilateral, while 25 cases (35%) had bilateral involvement. A total of 26 cases (37%) experienced recurrence; 11 cases (15%) recurred within 1 month, seven cases (10%) recurred within 1 to 3 months, five cases recurred (7%) within 3 to 6 months, three cases (4%) relapsed in 6 to 17 months. Joint symptoms occurred simultaneously or successively with rash during relapse. Thirteen patients (18%) relapsed on more than two occasions. However, the recurrence rate of joint involvement was relatively low as compared to that of rash. Joint symptoms usually improved within 1 to 5 days (median, 3 days); 29 cases improved within 1 to 2 days (41%), 37 cases (52%) in 3 to 4 days and five cases (7%) improved in 5 days.

### Early prednisone therapy in Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112qgJWC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of early prednisone therapy in preventing renal and treating extrarenal and renal symptoms in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) in a placebo-controlled trial.

Study Design

A total of 171 patients (84 treated with prednisone and 87 receiving placebo) were included and followed up for 6 months. The endpoints were renal involvement at 1, 3, and 6 months and healing of extrarenal symptoms. The analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Results

Prednisone (1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, with weaning over the subsequent 2 weeks) was effective in reducing the intensity of abdominal pain (pain score, 2.5 vs 4.8; p = 0.029) and joint pain (4.6 vs 7.3; p = 0.030). Prednisone did not prevent the development of renal symptoms but was effective in treating them; renal symptoms resolved in 61% of the prednisone patients after treatment, compared with 34% of the placebo patients (difference = 27%; 95% confidence interval = 3% to 47%; p = 0.024).

Conclusions

The general use of prednisone in HSP is not supported, but patients with disturbing symptoms may benefit from early treatment, because prednisone reduces extrarenal symptoms and is effective in altering (but not preventing) the course of renal involvement.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^112A9HTQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis was usually straightforward in patients presenting with skin purpura as the initial symptom. In the present study, 90% of the children developed skin manifestations at the outset. Most commonly, the rash first appeared in the lower limbs and foot; and gradually spread to other limbs. High relapse rate (73%) was observed within 3 months and subsequently the recurrence rate gradually declined, which might be due to the gradual weakening of the aberrant immune response. In previous studies, rash has been reported to be occurring mainly in lower limbs and buttocks. Most children have been reported to develop a recurrent rash within 12 months, with lesions relapsing one to five times, and late recurrence being associated with milder symptoms that usually lasted for a short duration.

Seventy-one children had varying degrees of joint involvements, which occurred with rash in most patients or after rash with no specific clinical manifestations. Patients with joint symptoms as initial manifestations were easily confused with rheumatoid arthritis, sprains and etc. However, anti-infection treatment was effective, which also confirmed HSP with joint symptoms were associated with infection. Pain, swelling and other symptoms sometimes did not occur simultaneously, mostly occurred as acute arthritis with different nature of pain. Similar to other studies, we also found that the joint symptoms frequently occurred in weight bearing large joints with knee and ankle joints being the most likely to be affected, since these joints move more and they are more vulnerable to injuries. In our study, joint symptoms could relapse with rash, mostly unilateral, but Trapani et al. reported that the rash could also be symmetrical.

### A dirty cause of vancomycin-mediated henoch-schonlein purpura: oxygen tubing is not a foley [^112Lx5ap]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 59-year-old male presented with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia from a prostatic abscess and was treated with vancomycin. Two weeks into his treatment course, he developed severe joint pains, abdominal pain with bloody, mucinous stools and a diffuse palpable purpuric rash on his extremities. Biopsy of the rash showed IgA immune-complex deposition consistent with Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura. After treatment with glucocorticoids, his symptoms resolved completely. Vancomycin is an extremely commonly used antibiotic with certain well-known adverse effects. Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura, a vasculitis involving abdominal pain, arthralgias and palpable purpura, is a much less common side effect, as seen in this patient. Given that vancomycin is widely used internationally, clinicians should be aware of the risks entailed by its use.

### Incidence and risk factors for recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children from a 16-year nationwide database [^113BaviG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common systemic vasculitis in children. The incidence of HSP in children is approximately 6–22 per 100,000 person-years, which is higher than that in adult (3.4–14.3 per 100,000 person years). Most HSP symptoms, such as temporarily palpable purpura, gastrointestinal (GI) pain, and joint pain, are self-limited; however, intestinal obstruction, central nervous system involvement, and severe nephritis can also occur. The prognosis of HSP is generally good, but recurrence is common among children (recurrence rate, 2.7%–66.2%). Various predictors for recurrence, including greater joint and gastrointestinal involvement at diagnosis, history of infection, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, steroid treatment, and renal manifestations, have been identified but they are inconsistent.

Glucocorticoids used for HSP treatment do not prevent renal disease; therefore their use is controversial. However, early treatment with glucocorticoids in HSP children may reduce the intensity or mean resolution time of joint or abdominal pain. Additionally, glucocorticoids should be tapered slowly to prevent the relapse of symptoms. Although previous literature has mainly focused on the risk factors for renal involvement and long-term complications in patients with HSP, no standard protocol or long-term follow-up studies are available to clarify the impact of steroid on the clinical course or subsequent recurrence of HSP.

Furthermore, the few studies that focused on the average time to second episode of recurrence revealed discrepant results (range, 1–13.5 months). Little is known regarding the third episode of recurrent HSP, and the long-term disease-free rate. However, these data are important in the decision making for adequate follow-up time. To clarify these aspects, data from a nationwide, population-based claims database, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), were used to investigate the mean duration between first and second HSP episodes, risk factors for recurrence, and the real-world use of steroids in patients with HSP.

### Partial response to anakinra in life-threatening Henoch-Schönlein purpura: case report [^116jMY4q]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common form of childhood vasculitis affecting 10–20 per 100,000 children annually. It occurs most frequently in children between the ages of 2 and 11 years. HSP produces a broad array of clinical features resulting from widespread IgA deposition in the walls of small vessels. Purpura of the skin, joint pain and swelling, gastrointestinal symptoms, and renal involvement are the most common manifestations with frequencies of 100%, 75%, 50–75%, and 40–50% of the patient population, respectively. Less often, neurologic complications, pulmonary hemorrhage, and testicular vasculitis may occur. Of these, glomerulonephritis remains the strongest indicator of poor prognosis. Most series show that 1–7% of children with HSP glomerulonephritis will develop chronic renal failure. Although reports describe the use of oral and parenteral corticosteroids, pulse methylprednisolone, dapsone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and plasmapheresis, researchers still lack strong evidence that confirms the superiority of any treatment regime in preventing tissue damage. A recent metanalysis supports the use of glucocorticoids during acute disease, however.

### Is there a crossroad between infections, genetics, and Henoch-Schönlein purpura? [^1163sHop]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common systemic vasculitis in childhood, characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin A deposits in the small vessels of skin, gastrointestinal tube, joints and kidneys. Although there have been great efforts made in elucidating its pathogenic mechanisms, Henoch-Schönlein purpura etiology remains unknown: the basic scene comes across an abnormal inflammatory process deriving from immune reactions to various antigenic stimuli, which might be bacterial, viral, or parasitic agents, in a genetically prone individual. Then, a peculiar immune complex deposition in the vascular walls and overproduction of different proinflammatory molecules elicit different clinical signs, which might be differentiated according to either a specific trigger or a specific genetic make-up. The aim of this review is to make a critical appraisal of the last 15years' medical literature concerning the relationship between infections, genetics, and Henoch-Schönlein purpura in pediatrics.

Mean duration between first and second HSP episodes

The mean duration between first and second HSP episodes was 9.21 months (Fig. 2a); 47.0% patients with second HSP did not have a third HSP episode. The average time between the second and third HSP episodes was 6.77 months (Fig. 2b).

Fig. 2
Kaplan-Meier analysis. a, at the end of the 16-year cohort, 83.6% of patients remained free of a second HSP episode. The mean time between the first and the second HSP episodes was 9.21 months. b, among patients with second HSP, 47.0% of patients remained free of the third HSP episode. The average time from the second to the third HSP episode was 6.77 months

Influence of age, clinical course, and steroid on the incidence of secondary HSP

Table 2 lists the hazard ratios for recurrent HSP obtained from univariate Cox proportional analysis. Compared with patients aged < 6 years, patients aged 7–12 years were more likely to have a second HSP episode. Recurrent HSP episodes were more likely to occur in those with underlying allergic rhinitis and renal involvement during the first HSP episode. Compared with patients who did not use steroids, patients who underwent steroid therapy for 14 days after the HSP diagnosis (late initiation) were more likely to have HSP recurrence. Furthermore, patients who used steroids for > 10 days had a higher likelihood of experiencing a second HSP episode. Joint pain and gastrointestinal symptoms during the first HSP course were not associated with a second HSP episode. Income levels and other comorbidities had no significant impact on the incidence of secondary HSP.

### Rituximab treatment for chronic steroid-dependent henoch-schonlein purpura: 8 cases and a review of the literature [^112VqVwb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by non-thrombocytopenic purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. It affects approximately 1 in 5000 children annually and accounts for about half of all childhood vasculitides in the United States. Typically, HSP is self-limited requiring only supportive care, but more severe cases may require corticosteroid (CS) treatment. Rarely, a subset of these patients has persistent rash, arthritis, abdominal involvement, or renal disease despite treatment with CS, or has disease recurrence on CS tapering. Frequency of disease relapse is not well-documented in children, but may be as high 30–40%, often occurring within 1–2 months following diagnosis. CS remains the standard treatment for symptomatic HSP. A small subset of patients are unable to wean off CS and subsequently require long term CS or additional steroid-sparing agents for disease control.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^111jbYGA]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

To summarize, HSP with joint involvement most commonly occurred in school-aged males during fall and winter seasons. Upper respiratory tract infection was the predominant triggering factor. Gastrointestinal symptoms, raised D-dimer levels and scrotal involvement were found to be independently associated with renal involvement. Rational use of corticosteroids significantly alleviated the symptoms, with no long-term adverse effects being observed during follow-up. The present study does not answer questions including why some patients experienced joint involvement and others suffered from gastrointestinal damage and how to explain the increase of D-dimer occurred only in some patients and others did not.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgA vasculitis): rapid evidence review [^117TaJ58]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura, now called immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, is a systemic, immune complex-mediated, small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis characterized by nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura, arthritis, and abdominal pain. It is the most common vasculitis in children but can also occur in adults. Diagnostic testing is required only to exclude other etiologies of purpura, to identify renal involvement, and, if indicated, to determine its extent with biopsy. Imaging or endoscopy may be needed to assess organ complications. IgA vasculitis spontaneously resolves in 94% of children and 89% of adults, making supportive treatment the primary management strategy. However, a subset of patients experience renal involvement that can persist and relapse years later. Additional complications can include gastrointestinal bleeding, orchitis, and central nervous system involvement. Systematic reviews have shown that steroids do not prevent complications and should not be used prophylactically. However, randomized trials have demonstrated success with high-dose steroids, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate in treating glomerulonephritis and other complications. Long-term prognosis depends on the extent of renal involvement. Six months of follow-up is prudent to assess for disease relapse or remission.

### The diagnosis and classification of Henoch-Schönlein purpura: an updated review [^1157aRjV]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a common childhood systemic vasculitis with clinical characteristics of cutaneous palpable purpura, arthralgia/arthritis, bowel angina, and hematuria/proteinuria. HSP is identified mainly based on the above presentations. Combined with pathohistological findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) and IgA-immune deposits in vessel walls and/or glomeruli increase the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. However, considering the accessibility of biopsy and some patients with atypical presentations, there are still medical unmet needs in HSP diagnosis. This article reviews the diagnosis of HSP including the aspects of classification criteria, differential diagnosis, and some laboratory findings as the biomarkers with diagnostic potential.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^116WQjRC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain, vomiting and gastrointestinal bleeding are the most common symptoms in patients with HSP. The reported incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be as high as 34 to 75%. However, some reports have indicated gastrointestinal bleeding as the most common symptom while in some other reports pain was the most common symptom. In our study, 56% of all patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, with abdominal pain being the most common, followed by vomiting and gastrointestinal bleeding. The pain was often periumbilical or in the upper abdomen as presented as paroxysmal colic.

In our study, 11% of children had abdominal pain or arthralgia as the initial clinical presentation, which resulted in misdiagnosis. Although it was lower than previously reported, in 15 to 25% of patients, joint symptoms appeared one week prior to the rash. Ten to 20% of these patients have been reported to present with abdominal pain two weeks prior to the appearance of rash. Our experience suggests that if children with abdominal pain or arthralgia are admitted and develop rash a few days later, the diagnosis of HSP should be considered. Thus, it is important for the health care professionals to have adequate knowledge about HSP so as to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures in such cases.

Renal function is a key determinant of prognosis in HSP patients. Twenty to 54% of HSP children may develop renal involvement. Similar to that reported by Trapani et al. 52% children in our study had renal involvement Although the exact mechanism of pathogenesis is not clear, previous studies have implicated IgA-containing immune complex deposition in glomerular basement membrane. The main pathological changes include mesangial proliferative changes, with varying degrees of segmental necrosis and glomerular crescent formation Earlier studies have shown that HSP nephritis (HSPN) is mostly seen within 1 month, with some cases occurring within 6 months, and a few cases appearing after 1 year. Among these cases, 1 to 2% of patients may develop irreversible kidney damage In the present study, 76% cases developed HSPN within 1 month, with most occurring within 2 weeks. There were no cases of end-stage renal disease observed during the 3-year follow up period. The prognosis for HSPN is good.

The clinical calculator "EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for Henoch-Schönlein purpura" for IgA vasculitis.

The EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a diagnostic tool developed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO), and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES). This calculator is specifically designed for the pediatric population, as HSP is primarily a disease of childhood.

The EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for HSP is used to establish a diagnosis of HSP, a type of vasculitis that affects small blood vessels, typically presenting with palpable purpura, arthritis or arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. The criteria include mandatory and additional criteria, and a diagnosis of HSP is made when the mandatory criterion (palpable purpura or petechiae, not related to thrombocytopenia) is present along with at least one of the additional criteria.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of HSP, which can help guide appropriate treatment and management strategies. It can also help differentiate HSP from other conditions that may present with similar symptoms.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the EULAR/

This tool helps assess if someone meets the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO), and Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) criteria for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), a condition characterized by a small-vessel vasculitis. To determine this, you consider specific clinical signs and symptoms:

Inputs entail selecting from these criteria:

- Purpura or petechiae predominantly on the lower limbs, which is not linked to thrombocytopenia
- Sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, possibly with intussusception or gastrointestinal bleeding
- Biopsy indicating leucocytoclastic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis with IgA dominance
- Sudden onset arthritis, where there is joint swelling or pain limiting motion
- Sudden onset arthralgia, where there is joint pain but no swelling or motion restriction
- Proteinuria surpassing 0.3 g/24 hours or a specified albumin/creatinine ratio in a morning urine spot test
- Hematuria or red blood cell casts identified through urinary analysis

The computation follows this logic:

- Confirm if purpura or petechiae with lower limb predominance is present.
- Check for at least one additional symptom or finding from the other criteria indications.

To meet the criteria for HSP, the individual must have purpura or petechiae primarily on the lower limbs and at least one other clinical sign from the list. If both are present, it concludes with "Meets criteria for Henoch-Schönlein purpura". Otherwise, it suggests "Criteria not met".

This evaluation is crucial for healthcare professionals to decide on further investigations and make management decisions for patients suspected of having HSP.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^114FZsc9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Patient characteristics

A total of 71 patients with HSP who attended the Department of Dermatology at Dongying Hospital, Shandong Province, between January 2010 and March 2012 were included in this study. The patients were evaluated retrospectively. The diagnosis of HSP was based on European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) endorsed consensus criteria for HSP classification. All cases developed skin purpura, acute arthritis or acute arthralgia, accompanied with: (1) abdominal pain: diffuse colicky pain. Some patients had gastrointestinal bleeding and emesis. (2) histopathology: proliferative glomerulonephritis with predominant IgA deposit or typically leucocytoclastic vasculitis with predominant IgA deposit. (3) renal involvement: proteinuria > 30 mmol/mg of urine albumin/creatinine ratio on a spot morning sample or > 0.3 g/24 h; presence of red blood cell casts or haematuria; red blood cells casts in the urinary sediment or > 5 red blood cells/high power field or ≥ 2+ on dipstick. Arthritis was defined as arthralgia with limited movement or joint swelling. Arthralgia was defined as joint pain without joint limited movement or swelling.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age < 14 years old; (2) no history of allergic or hematological disorders; (3) not diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, renal or any other immunological disorders; (4) no active infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B and other contagious diseases. The exclusion criteria were: (1) patients with incomplete information; (2) patients unable to comply with the treatment; (3) patients with severe heart, liver, lung, kidney or other organ system diseases.

A total of 131 HSP patients were admitted to our hospital between January 2010 and March 2012. Of these, 79 cases of HSP had joint involvement and were thus considered for inclusion in this study. Among them, two patients were found to be older than 14 years old (41 and 16 respectively), one case had hypothyroidism, and four patients had incomplete data (of these, one was admitted to another hospital, and three patients were lost to follow up). Thus, a total of 71 cases were finally included in the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Dongying Hospital.

### Successful treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura-associated hematochezia in a child with hemophilia A: a case report [^1149HVUW]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The challenges in the hemophilic children are different from those in adults. Early and long-term prophylaxis in children with hemophilia is the most effective method of forestalling bleeding and either preventing or reducing joint damage, and increasing the patients' quality of life and life expectancy. Hemophilia A is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of coagulation FVIII. Such patients, if not optimally treated, encounter recurrent bleeding episodes causing cumulative damage and, commonly, arthropathy. Coagulation FVIII, as a coagulation replacement factor, has been used to treat and prevent hemophilia A for decades. It can prevent hemophilia A patients from bleeding symptoms, joint dysfunction and abnormal, massive postoperative bleeding caused by the disease. FVIII is an important coagulation factor in the endogenous coagulation pathway. As a cofactor of coagulation factor IXa, FVIII participates in the activation of coagulation factor X and forms an endogenous coagulation pathway. Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the serious complications of hemophilia. The most common cause of abdominal bleeding in hemophilia is gastrointestinal mucosal bleeding. Diagnostic imaging is necessary to differentiate between various causes of abdominal bleeding. At this time, prophylactic dosing is mostly based on the Swedish regimen of 25 IU/kg thrice weekly or every other day in pediatric patients.

HSP is a systemic vasculitis involving small blood vessels, most notably the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and glomeruli, accompanied by arthralgia or arthritis. While the exact cause of HSP remains unknown, several studies have reported infections and imbalance of immune and genetic factors as causes of HSP. HSP can lead to severe complications, such as intussusception, gastrointestinal bleeding, or end-stage renal disease, although it is considered a self-limiting disease. Treatment of HSP includes controlling the acute symptoms and influencing factors of prognosis, such as acute joint pain, abdominal pain and renal damage.

Symptomatic or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, such as rectal bleeding, melena, and hematemesis, is observed in 50% of children with HSP. Glucocorticoids can quickly relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and shorten the duration of abdominal pain. Corticosteroids, given early in the course of illness, seem to produce consistent benefits for gastrointestinal bleeding, in children suffering from HSP. Remarkably, our patient also had congenital malrotation of the intestine, which could increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^113tmk4y]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

HSP has been reported to occur most frequently at age of 4 to 7 and it has also been reported to onset at around 6 to 10 years old. Although most studies have shown a male preponderance, but there are reports where greater number of females has been found to be affected. In the present study, most of the cases of HSP with joint symptoms occurred between 6 to 11 years of age, more often in school-age children than in preschool children, and more in boys than in girls. This may be due to increased exposure to various allergens and a higher chance of contracting infection; especially in boys as they are generally more active than girls. Infection has been previously reported as the major predisposing factor for HSP, with most of the cases being reported in winter, fall and spring. Our data showed that respiratory tract infection was the major predisposing factor, with upper respiratory tract infection accounting for 32% cases and lower respiratory tract infection accounting for 17% cases. In this study, HSP was observed onset around all seasons with autumn and winter seasons being the most common. This may be due to dramatic seasonal temperature changes and children were prone to respiratory infections. Disease onset due to strenuous exercise was less common compared with previous report.

### Clinical course of extrarenal symptoms in henoch-schonlein purpura: a 6-month prospective study [^112bsKFQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the extrarenal symptoms and clinical course of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP).

Design

A prospective national multicentre trial with 6-month follow-up. Patients A total of 223 newly diagnosed paediatric HSP patients.

Results

Purpura was the initial symptom in 73% of the patients and was preceded by joint or gastrointestinal manifestations in the rest by a mean of 4 days. Joint symptoms, abdominal pain, melena, nephritis and recurrences occurred in 90%, 57%, 8%, 46% and 25% of the patients, respectively. Orchitis affected 17/122 (14%) of the boys. Seven patients developed protein-losing enteropathy characterised by abdominal pain, oedema and serum albumin under 30 g/l, and an additional 49 patients had subnormal albumin levels without any proteinuria. Positive fecal occult blood (26/117, 22%) and α1-antitrypsin (7/77, 9%) suggested mucosal injury even in the patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. HSP was often preceded by various bacterial, especially streptococcal (36%) and viral infections. Previous streptococcal infection did not induce changes in the level of complement component C3. Recurrences were more frequent in patients > 8 years of age (OR 3.7, CI 2.0 to 7.0, p < 0.001) and in patients with nephritis (OR 4.6, CI 2.3 to 8.9, p < 0.001). Patients with severe HSP nephritis had more extrarenal symptoms up to 6 months. There was no difference in the clinical course between the prednisone-treated and non-treated patients during the 6-month follow-up.

Conclusions

Serum albumin is often low in HSP patients without proteinuria, due to protein loss via the intestine. Although corticosteroids alleviate the symptoms, they seem not to alter the clinical course of HSP during 6 months of follow-up.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura in two brothers imprisoned in the same jail: presentation two months apart [^117QXAp1]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

We present two brothers who came to us with similar complaints within a two-month interval and who were diagnosed as having Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Interestingly, the two brothers were prisoners in the same jail. In addition, we shall review the small number of familial Henoch-Schönlein purpura cases that have been reported in the literature to date. Our two patients exhibited arthritis and/or arthralgia, purpuric skin lesions, abdominal pain and hemiaturia, and were treated with steroids. We did not detect the presence of any inciting agent and hypothesize that an undefined factor present in the shared environment might have triggered the disease in two subjects with a similar genetic background.

### Acute penile pain and swelling in a 4-year-old child with Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^112XCXMx]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis found in children. It usually affects the small vessels of the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract and, more rarely, kidneys, brain, lungs and genitalia. Apart from classical presentation with purpuric rashes around buttocks and lower extremities, features such as arthralgia, abdominal pain, haematuria and proteinuria as well as scrotal swelling have been described in the literature. Penile involvement is rare and is not commonly described. We describe a child with HSP who developed penile involvement. We review the literature of all the cases reported in detail, in order to highlight useful clinical presentation, management and prognosis of this rare manifestation.

### Common seasonal pathogens and epidemiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura among children [^114qVYv5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis in adults, is the most common type of vasculitis in children, affecting mainly small blood vessels and caused by the deposition of immune complexes. It typically affects the skin and less frequently the digestive system, joints, and kidneys. The exact cause and underlying mechanisms of HSP are not fully understood, but it is believed to result from an abnormal inflammatory response triggered by antigenic stimuli, particularly infectious agents, in individuals with a genetic predisposition.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is more frequent during the autumn and winter months in Western countries and is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. Several seasonal viruses and bacterial infections have been associated with childhood HSP. However, differentiating the specific associations of these pathogens with the onset of HSP remains a challenge due to their overlapping seasonal patterns. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to a marked reduction in the circulation of infectious pathogens in the pediatric population as a result of international nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing and mask wearing. Subsequently, after these NPIs were relaxed in the spring of 2021, unusual outbreaks of viral and bacterial pathogens were reported in France and other countries. Given the suspected role of seasonal pathogens in the pathophysiology of HSP, we hypothesized that these unprecedented changes in the circulation of seasonal pathogens after the implementation and then relaxation of NPIs would represent a unique opportunity to better identify the role of individual seasonal pathogens in the epidemiology of HSP. In this study, our primary goals were to investigate the association of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic–related NPIs with the incidence of HSP among children and to assess the proportions of HSP cases that might be associated with specific seasonal viral and bacterial pathogens.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children: not only kidney but also lung [^111g3Q4z]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as anaphylactoid purpura or, most recently, IgA Vasculitis (IgAV), is the most common leukocytoclastic systemic small-vessel vasculitis in childhood. It is usually characterised by non-thrombocytopenic purpura, with typical purple, non-blanching papules, localised primarily on the lower extremities and buttocks. It can also be associated with abdominal discomfort, joint symptoms such as arthritis or arthralgia of large joints of the lower extremities, and risk of renal involvement.

The range of clinical manifestations of HSP is very broad, varying from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI) of various degrees up to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with significant risk of chronic renal impairment. Other possible organ involvement includes cerebral vasculitis, ureteral or bladder disease, and scrotal, penile or testicular hemorrhage.

Piram et al. in a review published in 2013, estimated the annual incidence of HSP in children to be between 3 and 26.7/100,000, demonstrating that it occurs two to 33 times more frequently in infants than in adults.

HSP is usually a self-limiting disease with an average duration of 4 weeks; it can have a remitting-relapses course especially within 3 months after initial resolution and rarely, when complicated, it can be fatal.

Although the etiology remains unknown, a possible link between genetic predisposition and environmental factors are considered crucial for the pathogenesis of HSP.

The diagnosis of HSP is based on clinical findings. The diagnostic criteria for HSP were recently revised by various study groups (EULAR European League Against Rheumatism, PRINTO Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation and PRES Pediatric Rheumatology European Society), and are listed in Table 1.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^113AqCDN]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common form of vasculitis in children. The condition has been known for nearly 200 years. The estimated annual incidence of HSP in China is 14.06 cases per 100,000 children with an increasing trend observed over successive years, however, this rising trend has recently tapered, possibly due to changes in social, economic, health, and environmental conditions. Factors triggering HSP include infections (mainly upper respiratory infection), drugs, food, insect bites and vaccination. Physical conditions, such as exposure to cold are also known to be environmental triggers for the disease onset. The pathogenesis of HSP is related to aberrant deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes, which typically affects skin, gut, joints and glomeruli. Among these, complications resulting from kidney lesions are the most severe. Isolated microscopic haematuria and minimal proteinuria are common occurrences in children, with nephrotic syndrome and renal dysfunction also being observed occasionally. The prognosis is, to a large extent, dependent on the severity of renal involvement.

However, the incidence of joint involvement in HSP patients could be as high as 78%, which is the second most common feature after dermal manifestations. Joint manifestations in HSP tend to be neglected due to their mild nature. Moreover, atypical cases are liable to be misdiagnosed and mistreated. With the incidence increasing, investigation of every potential case and assessment of renal involvement in these patients is important for the successful management of HSP. With the aim of expanding our knowledge about HSP with joint involvement, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics, prognosis and kidney damage in these HSP patients with joint involvement.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and hematuria. It is the most common form of vasculitis affecting children. The skin manifestations typically present as palpable purpura over the buttock and the lower extremities, but bullous lesions are particularly rare in children. We report a case of HSP presented as painful bullae on both lower limbs.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^1159FCdh]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical outcomes

The patients were followed up for 3 years. Fifty-two cases (73%) had recurrence of rash. Kidney symptoms, joint symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms were recurred in 29 cases (41%), 26 cases (37%) and 14 cases (20%), respectively. Recurrence of abdominal pain, arthralgia and other symptoms tended to last for a short time. Some children experienced recurrence after withdrawal of treatment, episodes of upper respiratory tract infection or strenuous activity. Among the 37 cases of HSP nephritis, 19 cases (27%) of proteinuria and urine occult blood turned negative within 1 week to 1 month of incidence, of which urine abnormality was detected in 13 cases (18%) during first the 2 weeks; in another 15 cases (21%) urine became normal within 1 month to 1 year and a half; in three cases (4%) microscopic hematuria, and proteinuria continued to persist in small amounts.

On univariate analysis, gastrointestinal symptoms, increased levels of CRP and D-dimer and scrotal involvement were found to be significantly associated with renal impairment in HSP children with joint manifestations (Table 2). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, scrotal involvement, gastrointestinal symptoms, raised D-dimer levels were independently associated with renal impairment in these children (Table 3).

### Hemorrhagic bullous lesions in Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a case report and review of the literature [^113kLNk7]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is one of the most common forms of vasculitis in childhood. It is characterized by cutaneous purpura, arthritis, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and renal involvement. Classification criteria of HSP were recently proposed by EULAR/PRINTO/PRES. They include purpura (commonly palpable and in crops) or petechiae, predominantly over the lower limbs and with at least one of the four following criteria: (1) diffuse abdominal pain; (2) biopsy revealing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with predominant IgA deposition; (3) arthritis or arthralgia; and (4) renal involvement, including proteinuria or hematuria. HSP is a potentially self-limiting illness, but recurrence has been reported in approximately 30% of patients. The incidence of HSP ranges from 6.7 to 22 per 100,000 children. Vanesa et al. reported that the most common symptoms of recurrence episodes in the first months after the first episode are abdominal pain and joint manifestations. HSP occurs mostly between the ages of 5 and 15, and the reported mean ages range from 4 to 7 years. The dermatologic manifestations are usually palpable purpura and petechiae. Some lesions, such as urticarial or erythematous maculopapular lesions, may also be found. The skin rash is usually present on pressure-bearing sites, especially the lower extremities and buttocks. Hemorrhagic bullae and vesicles are unusual manifestations. In this study, we present a 15-year-old male with bullous HSP and review 39 cases reported in the literature since 1985.

### Interventions for preventing and treating kidney disease in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) [^1169zjMc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis of childhood but may occur in adults. This small vessel vasculitis is characterised by palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis or arthralgia and kidney involvement. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of different agents (used singularly or in combination) compared with placebo, no treatment or any other agent for: (1) the prevention of severe kidney disease in patients with HSP without kidney disease at presentation; (2) the prevention of severe kidney disease in patients with HSP and minor kidney disease (microscopic haematuria, mild proteinuria) at presentation; (3) the treatment of established severe kidney disease (macroscopic haematuria, proteinuria, nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome with or without acute kidney failure) in HSP; and (4) the prevention of recurrent episodes of HSP-associated kidney disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 13 July 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions used to prevent or treat kidney disease in HSP compared with placebo, no treatment or other agents were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently determined study eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Thirteen studies (1403 enrolled patients) were identified. Risks of bias attributes were frequently poorly performed. Low risk of bias was reported in six studies (50%) for sequence generation (selection bias) and in seven (58%) for allocation concealment (selection bias). Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) and of outcome assessment (detection bias) was at low risk of bias in three studies. Five studies reported complete outcome data (attrition bias) while eight studies reported expected outcomes so were at low risk of reporting bias. Eight studies evaluated therapy to prevent persistent kidney disease in HSP. There was no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease any time after treatment (5 studies, 746 children: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32), or at one, three, six and 12 months in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation of HSP compared with placebo or supportive treatment. There were no significant differences in the risk of persistent kidney disease with antiplatelet therapy in children with or without kidney disease at entry. Heparin significantly reduced the risk of persistent kidney disease by three months compared with placebo (1 study, 228 children: RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.55); no significant bleeding occurred. Four studies examined the treatment of severe HSP-associated kidney disease. Two studies (one involving 56 children and the other involving 54 adults) compared cyclophosphamide with placebo or supportive treatment and found no significant benefit of cyclophosphamide. There were no significant differences in adverse effects. In one study comparing cyclosporin with methylprednisolone (15 children) there was no significant difference in remission at final follow-up at a mean of 6.3 years (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.54). In one study (17 children) comparing mycophenolate mofetil with azathioprine, there was no significant difference in the remission of proteinuria at one year (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.03). No studies were identified which evaluated the efficacy of therapy on kidney disease in participants with recurrent episodes of HSP.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no substantial changes in conclusions from this update compared with the initial review. From generally low quality evidence, we found no evidence of benefit from RCTs for the use of prednisone or antiplatelet agents to prevent persistent kidney disease in children with HSP. Though heparin appeared effective, this potentially dangerous therapy is not justified to prevent serious kidney disease when fewer than 2% of children with HSP develop severe kidney disease. No evidence of benefit has been found for cyclophosphamide treatment in children or adults with HSP and severe kidney disease. Because of small patient numbers and events leading to imprecision in results, it remains unclear whether cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil have any roles in the treatment of children with HSP and severe kidney disease.

### Recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura with bullous rash and pulmonary nodules [^116XYhu7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura is an IgA-mediated leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving small vessels. It affects approximately 10–20 children per 100,000 each year, with recurrence in approximately one-fifth to one-fourth of cases. The characteristic initial presentation of palpable purpura with a lower extremity predominance is typically followed by gastrointestinal manifestations, renal involvement, and/or joint pain.

While not common, HSP can also present with bullous rash, with an estimated prevalence of less than 2% in pediatric HSP patients. Similarly rare, the prevalence of HSP with pulmonary involvement is approximately 0.8 to 5%. The combination of both bullous rash and pulmonary nodules in a single patient diagnosed with HSP has not been reported in the literature to date. Treatment with corticosteroid is effective in HSP patients with these atypical manifestations.

Methods

Patient selection

The present retrospective study included a total of 2074 children with HSP between January 2015 and December 2019 in Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. The diagnosis was dependent on EULAR criteria for HSP classification. All cases developed purpura that consisted of the characteristic skin lesions 2–10 mm in diameter, simultaneously accompanied with at least one of the 4 following clinical manifestations: (1) abdominal pain: diffuse abdominal colicky pain with acute onset assessed by history and physical examination, also including intussusception and gastrointestinal bleeding. (2) Histopathology: typically leucocytoclastic vasculitis with predominant IgA deposit or proliferative glomerulonephritis with predominant IgA deposit. (3) Arthritis or arthralgias: arthritis of acute onset defined as joint swelling or joint pain with limitation on motion. Arthralgia of acute onset defined as joint pain without joint swelling or limitation on motion. (4) Renal involvement: proteinuria: > 0.3 g/24 h or > 30 mmol/mg of urine albumin/creatinine ratio on a spot morning sample; hematuria or red blood cell casts: > 5 red blood cells/high power field or red blood cells casts in the urinary sediment or ≥ 2+ on dipstick. The exclusion criteria were: (1) patients with incomplete information; (2) patients unable to comply with the treatment and (3) patients with severe heart, liver, lung, kidney or other organ system diseases. According to the report of Reamy et al. treatment principles for HSP were adopted in the present study. Anti-infectious agents were recommended for those who suffered from an infection. Relapse/recurrence was defined when a patient previously diagnosed with HSP and asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks after treatment, presented again a new flare of cutaneous lesions or other systemic manifestations of the vasculitis.

### Unusual presentation of henöch-schonlein purpura [^111W952F]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We present a rare case of a 4-year-old boy with newly diagnosed Henöch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) affecting the scrotum and penis. The patient presented to the emergency department with palpable purpura symmetrically distributed over the lower limbs. This was associated with arthritis of the right knee, abdominal pain and scrotal swelling. These symptoms were preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The patient was initially treated with empirical oral antibiotics for epididymitis and was discharged. He subsequently re-presented 12 days later with penile swelling, erythema and tenderness. An ultrasound scan of the penis revealed grossly oedematous subcutaneous tissue with normal penile architecture. His symptoms resolved spontaneously and the patient remains under close follow-up by the paediatric team for further sequelae of HSP.

### Azathioprine therapy for steroid-resistant Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of 6 cases [^112Qmv9x]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in children. The peak incidence is 3 to 10 years of age. The disease is characterized by the tetrad of palpable purpura, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal manifestations. Most cases recover spontaneously, and care is usually supportive, including bed rest, hydration, and pain relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen. Although corticosteroid use is controversial, it may result in accelerated resolution of symptoms; however, long-term use is usually limited due to adverse events. Rarely, a subset of these patients has persistent rash, arthritis or abdominal involvement despite treatment with glucocorticoids or has recurrent disease during glucocorticoid tapering. There is a paucity of literature regarding therapy of such recalcitrant patients without renal involvement, although there are a handful of case reports using methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, azathioprine, colchicine and dapsone. In this case series, we report the successful use of azathioprine as a disease modulator in 6 patients (Table 1) with recalcitrant disease, without significant renal involvement, from two academic medical centers.

### The immunobiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^113duybs]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a common but enigmatic systemic small vessel vasculitis that primarily affects children. Although the etiology of this disease is unknown, there are tantalizing clues on the natural history and immunopathogenesis. This article reviews these clues including aspects of disease-associated pathogens, immune regulation, with a focus on IgA, and finally the immunogenetic background of host. We also present a hypothetical model for the development of HSP and submit that this paradigm will be a generic one for similar vasculopathies.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^111SJqs4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although joint involvement is the second most common clinical manifestation after skin involvement in patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), it has not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to profile the clinical characteristics and identify the potential risk factors for kidney damage in HSP patients having joint involvement.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 71 cases of HSP patients with joint involvement who attended our hospital between January 2010 and March 2012 and analyzed their epidemiological profile, clinical characteristics, follow-up findings (up to three years) and overall prognosis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with renal symptoms in HSP patients with joint involvement.

Results

Average age of patients was 8.55 ± 2.13 years with male to female ratio at 1.29:1. The peak age of disease onset was six to 11 years. The most common triggers included upper respiratory infection, vigorous physical activity, and autumn and winter seasons. Forty cases (56.35%) had gastrointestinal involvement and 37 (52.11%) had kidney damage; gastrointestinal system, scrotal involvement, and increased D-dimer levels were significantly associated with kidney injury (P < 0.05) by multivariate analysis. Glucocorticoid therapy was effective in alleviating symptoms.

Conclusion

Gastrointestinal symptoms, scrotal involvement, and increased D-dimer are the potential risk factors for kidney damage in HSP patients having joint involvement. Rational use of corticosteroids was probably responsible for the good clinical outcomes.

### Effects of corticosteroid on Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a systematic review [^1111j3B3]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

No consensus exists among general pediatricians or pediatric rheumatologists regarding whether corticosteroid therapy ameliorates the acute manifestations of Henoch-Schönlein purpura or mitigates renal injury. Therefore, we sought to synthesize the reported experimental and observational data regarding corticosteroid use.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis based on a comprehensive review of the literature in the Medline database (1956 to January 2007) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. On the basis of reported outcomes among patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura who were treated at diagnosis with corticosteroids compared with patients treated with supportive care only, we calculated odds ratios for the resolution of abdominal pain, the need for surgical intervention secondary to severe pain or intussusception, the likelihood of Henoch-Schönlein purpura recurrence, and the development of transient or persistent renal disease.

Results

Of 201 articles retrieved from the initial literature search, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Corticosteroid treatment did not reduce the median time to resolution of abdominal pain but did significantly reduce the mean resolution time and increased the odds of resolution within 24 hours. Early corticosteroid treatment significantly reduced the odds of developing persistent renal disease. In addition, although the results were not statistically significant, the prospective data suggest reduced odds of both surgical intervention and recurrence.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids, given early in the course of illness, seem to produce consistent benefits for several major clinically relevant Henoch-Schönlein purpura outcomes.

### Acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^115dfsG8]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old man was admitted with progressive tetraparesis with hypoesthesia. He also presented with purpura in both legs. After admission, joint pain, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and renal dysfunction developed. A nerve conduction study revealed reduced amplitude of the motor and sensory nerve action potential, with normal conduction velocity. A skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis, indicating Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). After administration of corticosteroids, the symptom completely disappeared. The present case is the first report in Japan of HSP associated clinically and electrophysiologically with confirmed acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy. Common pathogenesis might have a role for development for two distinct disorders.

HSP IgA vasculitis (Henoch–Schönlein purpura)

IgA vasculitis is the new term for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), and is the commonest systemic vasculitis in childhood. For the purposes of this review, however, we will use the term HSP since that is the term used in the paediatric classification criteria, and the one most paediatricians are familiar with. It is defined in the latest Chapel Hill nomenclature (2012) as: vasculitis with IgA1-dominant immune deposits affecting small vessels (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles); often involving skin, gastrointestinal tract and frequently causes arthritis; and associated with glomerulonephritis which is indistinguishable from IgA nephropathy. Classification criteria (Ankara 2008) are: palpable purpura in a predominantly lower limb distribution with at least 1 of 4 of: diffuse abdominal pain; any biopsy showing IgA deposition (mandatory criterion if rash is atypical); arthritis and/or arthralgia; haematuria and/or proteinuria. HSP has a variable and often relapsing course without specific laboratory findings, with a third of children having symptoms up to two weeks; another third up to 1 month; and recurrence of symptoms within 4 months of resolution in the remaining third. Henoch–Schönlein nephritis (HSN) accounts for 1.6–3% of all childhood cases of end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in the UK. Generally speaking, HSP is a more severe illness in adults than in children.

Therapeutic advances

There is a very poor evidence base to guide the management of HSP, particularly for those with the severe forms of HSP nephritis (HSPN), and thus very few true therapeutic advances. Early morbidity in the disease is due to GI involvement; late morbidity and the most important overall determinant of poor outcome is renal involvement. In children the management of HSP is mainly conservative because the extra renal manifestations are usually self-limited. Arthritis responds well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Severe skin lesions and gastrointestinal involvement could require a short course of an oral corticosteroid. Controlled studies have shown that corticosteroids do not prevent renal disease. Despite that, patients with severe renal involvement usually do require corticosteroids combined with other immunosuppressive agents, and sometimes anti-proteinuric and antihypertensive agents.

### Acute genitourinary swelling and erythema as presenting symptoms of henoch-schonlein purpura [^112BUunH]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) may present in a variety of ways, most commonly with joint pain or the distinctive palpable purpura. Genitourinary manifestations of HSP are less common and may precede the classic signs and symptoms of HSP, making the diagnosis difficult. We report a case of a 19-month-old boy with penile and scrotal erythema and swelling at presentation who was later diagnosed with HSP.

### A child with henoch-schonlein purpura secondary to a COVID-19 infection [^114soDJY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a common IgA-mediated small vessel vasculitis of childhood that affects several systems. It is characterised by a tetrad of dermatological, abdominal, joint and renal manifestations. HSP can occur secondary to upper respiratory tract infections, medications, vaccinations and malignancies. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus from the Beta-Coronaviridae family, and often presents as a respiratory infection with symptoms ranging from a mild common cold-like illness to severe pneumonia. It has also been reported to exhibit extrapulmonary manifestations, including but not limited to cardiac, thrombotic, hepatocellular and dermatological complications. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy who presented with clinical features of HSP, with detailed history that revealed a recent recovery from a COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection, indicating a possible correlation between the two.

Table 4
Streptococcal infection in Chinese patients with HSP from different administrative areas

In general, arthritis/arthralgia serves as the most frequent clinical manifestation of HSP besides purpura, followed by abdominal pain and renal involvement respectively. In a 5-year retrospective study conducted by Mao et al. from 2009 to 2013, purpura, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal involvement occurred in 100, 57.8, 49.9 and 49.8% of Chinese patients with HSP, respectively, which was consistent with our finding. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies about the association of streptococcal infection with clinical manifestations in HSP patients have been reported to date. On this background, the present study focused on this issue, and found that 43.0, 32.1 and 29.3% of cases manifested arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal involvement in 393 HSP patients triggered by streptococcal infection, respectively; thus, streptococcal infection seems no influence on the clinical manifestations of HSP. Multisystem involvement in HSP patients triggered by streptococcal infection may be attributed to antigenicity of different bacterial components of streptococcus through mediating host immune dysfunction. More specifically, the hyaluronic acid capsule stimulates antibody cross-reactivity against joint tissues; streptococcal M-protein specific T-cells are transmigrated into heart tissue through its interaction with the heart endothelium, which results in the endothelial cell activation and inflammatory process aiming to cardiovascular system; in addition, streptococcal M protein and carbohydrate antigen (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine) share antigenic epitopes with human cardiac myosin and laminin on heart valves.

BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is one of the most common systemic vasculitis in childhood, which often invades the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, joints, kidneys, a ccounting for an incidence of about 6–24/100,000 per year. HSP occurs to males more than to females, and the ratio between boys and girls is approximately 1.4:1. It is commonly observed in preschool and school-age children, and its peak incidence is observed between 2 and 6 years age-group, and 90% of the patients below10 years age. Among them, about 50 to 75% of children had GI symptoms, and may also have refractory abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and may be accompanied by complications such as intestinal obstruction, intussusception and intestinal perforation and others in some severe cases, which in turn affected the early prognosis and remains difficult to treat. About 20 to 60% of the patients have renal involvement, which is known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), and the severity of renal involvement affects the long-term prognosis of children with HSP. The manifestations of HSPN vary from asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria to nephritis syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Renal biopsy is recommended if proteinuria occurs in children with HSPN.

Results

Eight patients diagnosed with HSP and treated with RTX met the inclusion criteria for this study. There were five males and three females (ages 2 months to 16 years at disease onset), seven of whom were Caucasian and one of whom was Hispanic (Table 1). All had non-thrombocytopenic purpura and renal (hematuria and/or proteinuria) involvement, seven had gastrointestinal involvement (severe cramping abdominal pain, hematochezia, or associated iron deficiency anemia), and two had arthritis, defined as swelling within a joint or limitation in the range of joint movement with joint pain or tenderness. Six of the eight had renal biopsies confirming IgA nephropathy, ranging from WHO Class I to III/IV (Table 1). None of these eight HSP patients had severe, life-threatening or central nervous system disease, although all of them had varying degrees of non-progressive renal involvement, including one on dialysis. In addition, prior to RTX, seven of the eight children had significant gastrointestinal distress, frequently triggering re-hospitalization (Table 1).

Demographics of Sample Cohort

AZA azathioprine, CS corticosteroid, CTX cyclophosphamide, GI gastrointestinal, IVIG intravenous immunoglobulin, MMF mycophenolate mofetil, MTX methotrexate, DMARD disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug

Six of the children required long term daily oral CS therapy for ≥ 6 weeks. Six failed to respond to immunomodulatory therapy in the absence of daily oral CS treatment, and one failed DMARD therapy but was not on daily CS therapy. Patient 5 received RTX prior to trial of DMARDs due to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis while on daily CS therapy. Patients received conventional DMARDs for at least one month prior to RTX (Table 1). The median oral CS burden prior to first RTX infusion was 0.345 mg/kg/day (range 0–1.28). Median oral CS burden was zero mg/kg/day at 6 months (range 0–0.5; p = 0.078), 1 year (range 0–0.2; p = 0.0625), and 2 years (range 0; p = 0.03) following initial RTX infusion (Table 2).

### Pneumatosis intestinalis associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^114zaBuE]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis in children. It is a disorder of the inflammatory cascade leading to immunoglobulin A deposition and leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels of skin, kidneys, joints, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A wide variety of GI manifestations are seen in ∼50% to 75% of patients with HSP. Diffuse colicky abdominal pain is the most common GI symptom. The small bowel is the most frequently involved GI site. Intussusception is rare but is the most common surgical complication. We report the case of a 2-year-old girl with a 5-day history of abdominal pain followed by a palpable purpuric rash. Her urinalysis, complete blood cell count, and tests of renal function were normal. An acute abdominal series was unremarkable initially, and abdominal ultrasound imaging showed ascites and thickened small bowel loops. She was diagnosed with HSP. The abdominal pain worsened, and an abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated distal small bowel wall thickening and pneumatosis intestinalis in the descending colon. She was started on total parenteral nutrition and antibiotics and placed on bowel rest. She was given 2 mg/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin. Her abdominal pain gradually improved over the next week, and a repeat computed tomography scan showed significant improvement of the small bowel wall thickening and pneumatosis. The purpuric rash improved, and her abdominal pain resolved. We report a case of HSP and pneumatosis intestinalis, an association that has not been reported previously.

Influence of streptococcal infection to the therapeutic response of HSP

The remission of main symptoms among the streptococcal infectious group, the other infectious group and the non-infectious group are presented in Table 2. Significant differences in the remission of purpura and renal involvement were noted among the above three groups. More specifically, the remission rate of purpura and renal involvement were significantly higher in the streptococcal infectious group than that in the non-infectious group (p < 0.05), but significantly lower than that in the other infectious group (p < 0.05). The duration time of purpura and renal involvement were significantly higher in the non-infectious group than that in the streptococcal infectious group and the other infectious group (p < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were observed between the streptococcal infectious group and the other infectious group (p > 0.05). In addition, there were no significant differences among the three groups with respect to the remission of arthritis/arthralgia and abdominal pain (p > 0.05).

### Bullous Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children: a report of 6 cases and review of the literature [^115wyuZp]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis occurring in childhood. Clinical presentation involves the classic tetrad of abdominal pain, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, arthritis, and renal involvement. Dermatological manifestations of HSP are characteristic of the condition and consist of palpable purpura and edema of the lower extremities and buttocks. The clinical spectrum of HSP is highly variable; however, vesicles and bullae have rarely been reported as the presenting feature. To date, there are 14 case reports of bullous HSP in the literature in English. The authors report 6 additional cases of bullous HSP, including a recurrent case, presenting to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^111aMJuJ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Our multivariate analysis, scrotal involvement, gastrointestinal symptoms and raised D-dimer levels significantly correlated with kidney damage. Compared to patients without these above risk factors, presence of these factors was associated with 38.42 times, 5.08 times, 4.09 times higher incidence rates, respectively. Tabel et al. also reported scrotal involvement as a risk factor for renal impairment. A study Elmas et al. also showed an association of gastrointestinal symptoms with kidney damage. Yilmaz et al. reported that D-dimer levels in HSP patients with renal damage were significantly higher than in those without renal involvement. Similar findings were also reported by another study.

In the present study, HSP patients with joint symptoms readily responded to methylprednisolone treatment. No long-term side effects were observed and treatment compliance of patients tended to be good. Not only the effect of glucocorticoids on joints and abdominal symptoms in HSP has been confirmed, but other studies have also reported its role in preventing kidney disease. With timely glucocorticoids in optimal dosage, adverse reactions tend to be reversible. Titrating the dose to the severity of the symptoms appears to be the key paradigm in successful management of children with HSP. One of the limitations of this study is the relatively small sample size due to availability of patients. The sample collection process lasted for 3 years. Due to limitation by experience and time and space, the present study does not allow conclusions about therapeutic approaches, which should be made from prospective controlled studies.

### Henoch-schonlein purpura associated with HLA-B27 positive axial spondyloarthritis in a young man [^1147sdc9]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Axial spondyloarthropathies are characterised by bilateral sacroiliitis, asymmetric oligoarthritis, association with the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, enthesitis and dactylitis. Although IgA nephropathy has a well-documented association with seronegative spondyloarthropathies, the association with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) has been documented only in few case reports. The present case is that of a 26-year-old man who presented with fever, lower limb arthritis, abdominal pain, palpable purpura over the buttocks and lower limbs, and clinical features of sacroiliitis. His blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor was negative. CT scan of the sacroiliac joints confirmed sacroiliitis. Skin biopsy revealed neutrophilic small vessel vasculitis. HLA-B27 was positive in blood. A diagnosis of HSP with HLA-B27 positive axial spondyloarthritis was made. HSP can be associated with HLA-B27 positive axial spondyloarthritis and has to be considered while evaluating for causes of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis in such patients.

### A case series on recurrent and persisting IgA vasculitis (henoch schonlein purpura) in children [^111ztK6P]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

IgA vasculitis (IgAV, formerly Henoch Schonlein purpura, HSP) is the most common vasculitis encountered in childhood with an estimated incidence of 27.2 per 100,000 children in the U.K. It usually presents as a purpuric non-blanching rash most commonly on the lower limbs, although it may extend to the upper limbs and the trunk, and more rarely to the face. During the acute phase, it is accompanied by musculoskeletal involvement in about 80% of patients, in the form of arthralgia and/or oligoarthritis, and gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in up to 75% of patients, which usually presents as colicky abdominal pain that can sometimes precede the rash. Renal involvement (nephritis, IgAVN) is also common in up to 50% of patients with varying degrees of severity. IgAV is a small vessel vasculitis whose pathophysiology remains largely unknown. It is thought to be due to galactose deficient IgA1 immune deposits, although their involvement in non-renal manifestations of the disease remains unclear.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura in adults: outcome and prognostic factors [^116K7ZGC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura nephritis (HSPN) has been extensively studied in children but, its natural history in adults is much less known. A cohort of 250 adults suffering HSP was retrospectively analyzed for a median follow-up period of 14.8 yr. All patients had biopsies consistent with HSP (predominant IgA mesangial deposits) associated with purpura, bowel angina, and/or abdominal pain. At presentation, palpable purpura was present in 96% of patients, and arthritis was reported in 61%, and gastrointestinal involvement in 48%. Thirty-two percent of the patients showed renal insufficiency (Creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 50 ml/min), usually associated with proteinuria (99%) and/or hematuria (93%). Endocapillary glomerulonephritis was the most frequent lesion on renal biopsy (61%). At the end of follow-up, patient survival was only 74%. The first cause of death was carcinoma (most of them of respiratory or digestive tract). Regarding renal function, 11% of patients reached end-stage renal failure, 13% exhibited severe renal failure (CrCl < 30 ml/min), and 14% moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl < 50 ml/min). Clinical remission defined as the absence of proteinuria, hematuria, and a normal renal function was achieved in only 20%. This is a retrospective study; therefore, it is not possible to demonstrate any steroid and/or cyclophosphamide efficacy in diminishing the incidence of renal insufficiency. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that renal function impairment and proteinuria level at presentation and, on renal biopsy, the degree of interstitial fibrosis, percentage of sclerotic glomeruli, and presence of glomeruli with fibrinoid necrosis were associated with a poor renal prognosis. The data indicate that clinical presentation of HSPN in adults is severe and its outcome relatively poor, worse than in children. Identification of clinical and histologic prognostic factors may permit the design of appropriate therapeutic prospective studies.

### Hemorrhagic bullous lesions in Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a case report and review of the literature [^112Xd4Fe]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common type of vasculitis during childhood. It is an immune-mediated vasculitis which is associated with IgA deposition, but its pathogenesis is unknown. Our patient met the criteria of HSP. Typical skin manifestations of HSP include palpable purpura and petechiae. However, erythematous maculopapules and urticarial lesions have also been reported. Hemorrhagic bullous and ulcerative lesions are rare in pediatric patients, and the diagnosis of bullous HSP can be challenging. The bullous lesions that occur in children include erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, epidermolysis bullosa, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, linear IgA dermatosis, bullous systemic lupus erythematosus, bullous impetigo, eczema herpeticum, and dermatitis herpetiformis. However, bullous lesions are relatively common in adult HSP, reportedly occurring in 16% to 60% of cases.

We searched PubMed for studies published from 1985 to February 2016, using the keywords "bullous" and "Henoch-Schönlein purpura". We also scanned the references of all search results for additional studies and identified only 39 patients (including our patient) who presented with hemorrhagic bullae (Table 1). One patient reported by Abdel-al et al. was excluded due to missing data. Table 2 lists the main characteristics of these 38 patients with bullous HSP. The male to female ratio was 1:1, and the mean age at the diagnosis of bullous HSP was 8.2 years (range, 3–15 years). The most common systemic symptom was joint involvement (63.2%), followed by gastrointestinal involvement (60.5%), and renal involvement (39.5%). Orchitis is a complication of HSP, and one patient who had scrotum pain underwent surgery. Recurrence only occurred in two patients.

### Hemorrhagic bullous lesions in Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a case report and review of the literature [^111bF7zL]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a common vasculitis in childhood characterized by purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain and renal involvement. However, bullous HSP is a rare cutaneous manifestation, and a few cases have been reported.

Case Presentation

Herein, we report a 15-year-old male with bullous HSP who presented with severe abdominal pain and hemorrhagic bullous lesions over his lower extremities. He was treated with corticosteroid, after which the symptoms improved dramatically. No recurrence was noted after follow-up, though scarring was present. We also reviewed the literature related to bullous HSP and identified 39 cases, most of whom were treated with corticosteroids.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be aware of the atypical types of HSP, including bullous HSP. Most patients with bullous HSP have a good prognosis.

Although Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) can occur at any age from infancy to adulthood, it is overwhelmingly a disease of childhood. Indeed, HSP is the most common vasculitis syndrome affecting children. The clinical features of HSP have been well documented, and the diagnosis is generally not difficult. However, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of HSP. This article briefly reviews the clinical aspects of HSP and new information concerning therapy. The major focus of this review is recent information concerning abnormalities of immunoglobulin A1 glycosylation and the role of aberrantly glycosylated immunoglobulin A1 in the pathogenesis of HSP.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura: another COVID-19 complication [^112y44mr]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Whether affecting children or adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) can have multi-organ involvement mediated by an inflammatory cascade. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is one of the key components of the inflammatory cascade that can lead to endothelial injury and inflammation. IgA vasculitis or Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) has been rarely reported in the context of COVID-19. In this report, we highlight a case of HSP occurring 2 days after diagnosis of COVID-19 in a 16-year-old boy, who presented with palpable purpura of the lower extremities and buttocks, diffuse abdominal pain, hemoptysis, and hematochezia. He was treated with oral prednisolone with rapid clinical improvement.

The ratio of ILC1/ILCs and ILC3/ILCs in HSP patients are restored after treatment

Sixteen patients underwent routine therapy (infection control, vitamin C supplementation, loratadine, dipyridamole), combined with methylprednisolone merely during acute abdominal pain and joint pain periods, for 7–10 days. There were no changes in ILCs/Lymphocytes and ILCs/PBMC before and after treatment (P = 0.833 and P = 0.940, respectively) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S 2). As shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S 2, ILC1s were significantly decreased (P < 0.001), and ILC3s were increased (P = 0.033), while there were no significant changes in ILC2(P = 0.143). In addition, ILC1/ILC3 was significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.001), while there were no differences in the ratio of ILC1/ILC2 before and after treatment (P = 0.460).

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also named immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV), accounts for almost 58.0% of pediatric primary vasculitis and exhibits non-thrombocytopenic purpura with several main features, including abdominal pain, histopathology (leukocytoclastic vasculitis with predominant IgA deposits on skin biopsy), arthritis or arthralgia, renal involvement. Based on the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria, HSP is defined by purpura or petechiae (mandatory) with lower limb predominance and at least one of main features simultaneously. According to a latest epidemiological study in Taiwan, China, the annual incidence rate of HSP was 9.6 per 100,000 children with the peak age < 6 years old. Generally speaking, HSP is a self-limited condition that lasts an average of 4 weeks, whereas 40–50% of patients undergo renal involvement and aggravate the long-term prognosis of HSP. HSP nephritis (HSPN) develops into end stage in up to 5.1% of patients, and is associated with several risk factors, such as persistent purpura (OR = 4.0), severe bowel angina (OR = 3.4) and elevated antistreptolysin O (ASO, OR = 2.2). The pathogenesis of HSP is still unclear, whereas it may be ascribed to genetic and infectious factors. A retrospective study encompassing 349 Spanish HSP patients and 335 sex ethnically matched controls by López-Mejías et al. identified that HLA-B✱41:02 was subjected to a 5.5-fold increase in HSP patients as compared with controls and was related to the susceptibility to HSP (OR = 5.8). Based on the data from 11 studies containing 783 HSP patients, Xiong et al. indicated that helicobacter pylori (HP) was detected in 48.2% of patients, which may promote the elevations of serum IgA, C3 and cryoglobulins.

### IgA vasculitis (henoch-schönlein purpura) as the first manifestation of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: case-control study and systematic review [^114QDYfQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

IgA vasculitis, formerly Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is the most frequent vasculitis in childhood; it is a systemic vasculitis of small vessels. The estimated annual incidence is 20.4 per 100,000 children/year though it varies depending on the group of age studied. Aalberse, et al. reported a general incidence of 6.1 per 100,000 children/year, while in the age group between 4 and 7 years-old, the incidence is 70.3 per 100,000 children/year. It is frequently reported in the literature a distinction by group of age, one study including 120 children with IgA vasculitis (HSP) found that children under 10-years represented the 88.3% from the total, another study of 107 children, reported that 73% of them were ≤ 10-years and, in a smaller study of 78 patients the percentage of subjects under 10-years reached 90%. In the same articles cited, we observed a discrete but consistent propensity for male patients, 78 out of 120 (65%), 61 of 107 (57%), and 46 from 78 (59%) were male children.

The classic clinical features of IgA vasculitis (HSP) comprise non-thrombocytopenic purpuric skin rash, abdominal pain, arthralgia or arthritis, and renal involvement, usually with a self-limiting disease course. Skin involvement is the mandatory criterion in patients with IgA vasculitis (HSP); nevertheless, this is a non-pathognomonic sign of the disease. About 10% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can present with cutaneous vasculitis. SLE is a multisystem chronic autoimmune disease antibody-mediated with unpredictable clinical course; usually leading to more severe disease than IgA vasculitis (HSP). There are few reports in which IgA vasculitis (HSP) and juvenile SLE (jSLE) are somehow associated.

Herein we describe 15 cases with an initial diagnosis of IgA vasculitis (HSP) who, after a variable period, were diagnosed with jSLE. We hypothesize that these children are demographically different from those children with only IgA vasculitis (HSP) in terms of age and gender.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), a systemic small-vessel vasculitis syndrome, typically occurs in children and causes purpuric skin lesions accompanied by various presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, arthritis, and nephritis. The severity of symptoms and the order of their appearance differ among patients. Gastrointestinal manifestations occur in two-thirds of patients and vary from mild abdominal pain to colicky features.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) has been reported by only a limited number of authors, with different clinical features during the course of HSP. Most cases of HSP pancreatitis are mild in clinical characteristics but can evolve into hemorrhage, necrosis and pseudocyst. As a complication, AP can be diagnosed on the basis of a high level of serum amylase in HSP patients with abdominal pain. In cases with epigastric tenderness, routine serum and urine amylase evaluations may reveal pancreatic involvement in HSP. We herein retrospectively reviewed 13 cases of HSP patients with AP among 3212 HSP patients and analyzed symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, imaging findings, treatment and their prognosis.

### Life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding due to a jejunal lesion of Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^11265Pmy]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

The case of a 56-year-old patient with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) and fulminant gastrointestinal bleeding is reported. The patient was admitted to hospital because of palpable purpura on both legs, painful joints and diffuse abdominal pain. Suspected HSP was histologically proven and treated with prednisolone. Despite recovery, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, with melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 11.2 to 4.2 g/dl, occurred 30 days after medication was started. Immediate endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed no signs of bleeding whereas colonoscopy showed fresh blood and blood clots in the terminal ileum and the colon. Since the bleeding source could not be detected endoscopically, mesenteric angiography was performed, demonstrating active bleeding from a jejunal artery. Thereafter the bleeding source was located by intraoperative peroral enteroscopy and treated by resection of a short segment of jejunum.

### Acute pancreatitis as initial manifestation of adult Henoch-Schönlein purpura: report of a case and review of literature [^116nYajx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain observed in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is usually attributed to edema and hemorrhage in the small bowel wall, secondary to a small-vessel vasculitis. Pancreatitis secondary to HSP is extremely rare. Here we report a 53-year-old man presented with acute pancreatitis that developed into characteristic rashes seen during HSP at the second day of the clinical onset, together with arthritis and glomerulonephritis. HSP is a rare and benign cause of acute pancreatitis. This complication can occur as an initial manifestation of HSP. Elevated serum amylase level can be considered as the early diagnostic tool for HSP pancreatitis. The patients with HSP who have abdominal pain as their chief complaint should be evaluated for pancreatitis, by routine serum amylase and abdominal computed tomography scan, to plan the specific treatment and avoid unnecessary surgery.

### Koebner's phenomenon in childhood Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of two cases [^116FQT12]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Koebner's phenomenon occurs rarely in connection with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). We report two children with HSP who developed Koebner's phenomenon on the second day after the onset of rash. The first was an 11-year-old girl with rheumatic heart disease who presented with abdominal pain for 1 month and subsequently developed rash and nephritis. The second patient was a 7-year-old girl who presented with rash and polyarthritis. To the best of our knowledge, Koebner's phenomenon in childhood HSP has not been reported.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura with joint involvement: analysis of 71 cases [^113jZzDx]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Characteristics of patients

A total of 71 cases including 40 males and 31 females were included. The ratio of male to female was 1.29:1. The average age was 8.55 ± 2.13 years and median age was eight. Sixty- one cases (86%) had peak age for disease onset between six and 11 years, with male to female ratio of 1.22:1 (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, disease onset occurred during all the seasons, with the highest incidence being reported during autumn and winter seasons (70%). Respiratory tract infection was the most frequent predisposing factor followed by vigorous exercise, with 66 cases (93%) being aware of the trigger factors (Fig. 3).

Clinical manifestations

Main clinical features of the 71 HSP children were summarized in Table 1. All 71 cases had typical skin manifestations such as petechiae and ecchymosis. In 64 cases (90%), skin symptoms were the initial manifestations. Skin rash was most commonly observed in the lower limbs and foot, followed by thigh, upper limbs, abdomen, waist-hip, scrotum and face. Twenty-seven cases (38%) had rash in more than three affected areas (Fig. 4).

### Revisiting clinical differences between hypersensitivity vasculitis and Henoch-Schönlein purpura in adults from a defined population [^116BqaGc]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV) and Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) are the most common entities included within the category of cutaneous vasculitis (CV). Palpable purpura and histological changes characterised by the presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are common in both conditions. Therefore, considerable overlap between them is often seen. It is especially true when the CV occurs in adults. To further establish clinical differences between these two conditions, in the present study we assessed the main clinical differences between HV and HSP in a wide and unselected series of adults with CV from a defined population.

Methods

We reviewed the clinical records of 297 consecutive adults (age > 20 years) seen at a single centre between January 1975 and December 2012 that were classified as having HSP or HV according to the criteria proposed by Michel et al. (J Rheumatol 1992; 19: 721–8).

Results

Based on the inclusion criteria, 102 adult patients (71 men/31 women) were classified as HSP and 195 (104 men/91 women) as HV. The mean age was similar in both groups (55.8 ± 16.5 years in HSP and 56.8 ± 18.3 years in HV). Precipitating events, usually an upper respiratory tract infection and/or drug intake, were more frequently observed in HV. Both at the beginning of the disease and when the CV was established clinical manifestations were more frequent in patients with HSP than in those with HV. It was the case for gastrointestinal (57.4% vs. 6.8%; p < 0.001), joint (51.5% vs. 36.6%; p = 0.01) and renal involvement (86.3% vs. 18.3%; p < 0.001). Corticosteroid (56.7% vs. 22%; p < 0.001) and cytotoxic drug (19.4% vs. 3.2%; p < 0.001) use was also more common in patients with HSP. After a median follow-up of 15.5 (interquartile range- IQR; 3–37) months in HSP and 4 (IQR; 2–12) months in HV, the outcome was better in HV than in HSP. In this regard, complete recovery (72.6% vs. 85.4%; p = 0.01) was more commonly observed in HV while residual renal involvement (15.3% vs. 4.2%; p < 0.001) was more common in HSP. The disease relapsed in 35.3% of patients with HSP and in 24.4% with HV (p = 0.07).

Conclusions

Our results confirm the claim that these two diseases presenting with similar cutaneous involvement are certainly two separate entities with greater systemic involvement and less favourable outcome in HSP.

### Incidence and risk factors for recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children from a 16-year nationwide database [^111rxnZT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Ours was the first study to describe the incidence of recurrent HSP, and added evidence of increased associations of recurrent HSP and allergic rhinitis, renal involvement, and steroid treatment for > 10 days. These results can be considered observations from real-world conditions. Patients with the aforementioned clinical features were suggested to receive longer periods of follow-up than previously suggested for the early identification and management of recurrent HSP. In those with a second HSP episode, perhaps 6 more months of monitoring is also suggested for the early recognition of a third HSP recurrence. Further study is needed to clarify the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of these associations.

### Self-limiting recurrent bullous henoch-schonlein purpura with lupus anticoagulant [^114F6Nqa]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common acute systemic vasculitis of childhood with an incidence of approximately 1:10,000. It commonly presents with skin, gastrointestinal tract, joints and renal system signs and symptoms. We present a case of recurrent self-limiting HSP with lupus anticoagulant presenting with haemorrhagic bullous skin lesions and scrotal swelling. The initial presentation resolved within 4 weeks but over the next 6 months, a few self-limiting but milder skin lesions occurred. Some institutions have advocated the use of steroids in these cases but our case showed that the use of steroids may not be required. This atypical presentation of HSP led to unnecessary investigations that this case report aims to prevent in the future by raising its awareness.

### Gangrenous appendicitis in a child with henoch-schonlein purpura [^111ZyrAo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is common feature of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, which may mimic appendicitis, leading to unnecessary laparotomy. Accordingly, the diagnosis must be confirmed by ultrasonography or computed tomography scan before laparotomy is performed. The authors report a case of simultaneous occurrence of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and gangrenous appendicitis in an 18 year-old boy. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain, cramps, and mild dehydration. He also complained of small reddish purple on his lower limbs, bilateral knee pain, low-grade fever, as well as bloody stools. The symptoms subsided completely. Eight days later, he returned with nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, abdominal cramps, and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. Abdominal ultrasound evaluation was performed to rule out an intussusception but demonstrated appendiceal dilatation with a possible appendicolith without any evidence of intussusception. A laparotomy was undertaken, and appendectomy was performed for gangrenous appendicitis. Simultaneous occurrence of Henoch-Schonlein purpura and acute appendicitis is rarely observed. Clinical features of the patients may mislead the clinicians, resulting in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. The use of ultrasonography and computed tomography scan would confirm the diagnosis before surgery.

### Use of wireless capsule endoscopy in the management of severe henoch-schonlein purpura [^113BENG4]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a multisystem vasculitis that primarily affects children. Characteristic symptoms include purpura of the lower extremities and buttocks, abdominal pain, arthralgias, and hematuria. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in approximately 50% of children and, although often self-limiting, can be significant. Wireless capsule endoscopy has been found to be safe and effective for children over 10 years of age. It is now the preferred imaging modality for evaluating gastrointestinal bleeding from the small intestine. Here we report an unusual case of chronic Henoch-Schonlein purpura vasculitis, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract, in which wireless capsule endoscopy was helpful in evaluating and directing treatment options.

### IgA vasculitis (henoch-schönlein purpura) as the first manifestation of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: case-control study and systematic review [^111iQYT2]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

There are only four case-reports published in the medical literature in which the association between IgA vasculitis (HSP) and jSLE is present. The case described by Al-Attrach is particularly interesting due to the similarity to our cases. The patient was a 12-year-old girl diagnosed with IgA vasculitis (HSP) based on skin, joint, abdominal, and renal affection, after 5 months on treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil, she attained withdrawal of medications. One month later, she developed pleural and pericardial effusion, increase of proteinuria and positive ANA and ds-DNA antibodies; she was then diagnosed with jSLE. There was also a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with lupus, who after 3 months, returned to the hospital with abdominal pain and purpuric rash. The other two cases were two 13-years-old boys with purpura and nephritis. One of them also developed serositis; the autoantibodies were negative in both cases; as a result, one case was reported as IgA vasculitis (HSP) with lupus-like nephritis, and the other one as ANA-negative SLE and full-house nephropathy.

The origin of this research was a 7-year-old girl attended in 2006, she was diagnosed with appendicitis and underwent surgery, which showed a swollen small intestine with leukocytoclastic vasculitis on the biopsy. She continued with abdominal pain, and a few days later a skin rash appeared over her lower extremities, it was palpable purpura; she developed proteinuria and hematuria and was diagnosed with IgA vasculitis (HSP). Despite steroid treatment for several weeks, she presented seizures and the worsening of proteinuria. The suspicion of SLE rose, the renal biopsy was compatible with lupus nephritis class II-b (WHO classification), ANA and ds-DNA autoantibodies were positive, thus confirming jSLE diagnosis (case not included in this case series).

On the topic of autoantibodies in IgA vasculitis (HSP), some articles discuss the importance of the positivity of anti-nuclear antibodies, one of them refers to the persistence of the ANA for as long as 6 years regardless of disease activity. The other study questions the relevance of ANA in the setting of IgA vasculitis (HSP), arguing that up to 18% of healthy children may have positive ANA.

### Atypical presentation of Henoch-Schönlein purpura with parotitis in a young child [^117KnE1H]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis, is the most common vasculitis in children, characterised by palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthralgia and renal involvement. Here, we present a case of a young boy who was clinically diagnosed as HSP. The child further developed parotitis, which is a very rare association in HSP with very few reported cases. This case highlights the uncommon association of self-resolving parotitis among children with HSP.

### Henoch-schonlein purpura [^1164gbRZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to educate the reader about the one of the most common vasculitides of childhood: Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Although the disease has been described for over a century, the etiology has yet to be discovered. Adult-onset Henoch-Schonlein purpura is unusual, but through case studies, this review examines some of the common manifestations of this presentation of disease. Long-term outcome studies are still defining how this disease affects a small but significant percentage of patients afflicted with Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

Recent Findings

This article will summarize recent work in molecular biology and genetics evaluating predisposing factors in the development of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Further illustrations of the various complications of Henoch-Schonlein purpura will be reviewed. Recent long-term studies of outcomes of patients with renal disease from Henoch-Schonlein purpura will be summarized.

Summary

After reading this review, the clinician will be able to elucidate the manifestations of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, determine appropriate treatment of the disease, and, most importantly, give the patient information about long-term consequences of Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

### Partial response to anakinra in life-threatening Henoch-Schönlein purpura: case report [^112Sguwx]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is typically a benign and self-limited systemic vasculitis. Perhaps because it does not frequently cause permanent damage, its pathogenesis remains relatively poorly understood. IgA deposition in vessel walls is a consistent pathologic finding, and is the hallmark of the disease. The triggers that promote the IgA production and tissue deposition, those that determine why some individuals get the disease while most do not, and those that dictate why the disease can be life-threatening in a minority of affected children are not known.

A variety of therapeutic agents that target specific inflammatory cytokines are available for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Biologic agents including soluble receptors and monoclonal antibodies that block the action of a variety of cytokines including tumor necrosis alpha, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 have been used with variable success in Kawasaki disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) and other severe forms of vasculitis. Experimental evidence suggests inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF and IL-6 are involved in the pathogenesis of HSP. Reports over the last 3 decades suggest that autoinflammatory diseases characterized by high interleukin-1 production such as familial Mediterranean fever may be associated with an increased incidence of HSP, and with more severe disease, making IL-1 an potential target in refractory disease.

Lead by data supporting an important role for IL-1 in HSP pathogenesis, we present a case that may indicate a direction for future research into novel therapies for severe Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

### Post-streptococcal small-vessel vasculitis in a 16-month-old with associated intussusception and hypertension: henoch schönlein purpura? [^112erEFi]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Henoch Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis, is a systemic small-vessel vasculitis typically occurring in children 3–15years of age, with peak incidence at 4–6years. It is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including palpable purpura, arthralgias or arthritis, abdominal pain including intussusception, and renal involvement. We report a patient with these clinical findings whose IgA immunofluorescence was negative but with a presumptive diagnosis of HSP at 16months of age, significantly younger than the classic population. This condition rarely affects this age group, and we highlight the importance of considering vasculitis in children of all ages, as a failure to diagnose could lead to insufficient long-term monitoring, particularly regarding renal function.

### Performance in adults of the EULAR / PRINTO / PRES (ankara 2008) classification criteria for IgA vasculitis [^1114dsc9]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

IgA vasculitis (IgAV), formerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), is the most common systemic vasculitis in childhood. IgAV is characterised by IgA1-dominant immune deposits affecting small vessels, predominantly capillaries, venules or arterioles. IgAV is less common in adults, with an estimated incidence of 1.3 per 100 000, compared with an annual incidence of 29.9 per 100 000 in children. IgAV primarily affects the skin, gastrointestinal tract and joints but can also result in glomerulonephritis.

The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for HSP (IgAV) were derived using data from 85 adult patients with IgAV and were never validated. These classification criteria required the presence of at least two of the following: (1) age ≤ 20 years at disease onset, (2) palpable purpura, (3) acute abdominal pain and (4) a biopsy showing granulocytes in the walls of small arterioles/venules. However, these criteria rely on non-specific features and do not address the importance of IgA in the pathogenesis of disease. Furthermore, the criteria were derived from a cohort in which 64% of patients were children.

Table 2
Main characteristics of the 38 patients with bullous HSP

HSP is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects small vessels, and the characteristic histological finding is neutrophil infiltration around papillary and dermal vessels. The deposition of IgA (especially IgA 1) and C3 was commonly noted in direct immunofluorescence studies. Not all of the patients had IgA deposition, however, and of the 19 patients who underwent skin biopsies, only 12 (63%) had IgA deposition. The timing of biopsy may affect the finding of IgA deposition, and early biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis. Immunoreactants, including IgA and C3, are destroyed within 48 h. Our patient was also negative for IgA deposition, but positive for C3 deposition around the vessel walls in the dermis. Skin biopsy was performed after 48 h of appearance in our patient, so that might have led to the false-negative result on direct immunofluorescence. The leukocytoclastic vasculitis is usually limited to the upper layer of the dermis, but one study reported that the leukocytoclastic vasculitis extended to the deeper layer of the dermis and resulted in scar formation. Our patient had scarring, and histopathology showed the deeper layer of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue had been affected.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in adult IgA vasculitis (henoch-schönlein purpura): updated picture from a French multicentre and retrospective series of 260 cases [^116Byuhb]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the clinical presentation, treatments and prognosis of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in adult IgA vasculitis (IgAV).

Methods

Data from 260 adults with IgAV included in a French multicentre retrospective survey were analysed. Presentation and outcomes of patients with (GI+) and without (GI-) GI involvement were compared.

Results

One hundred and thirty-seven (53%) patients had GI involvement. Initial manifestations were abdominal pain in 99%, intestinal bleeding in 31%, diarrhoea in 26% and acute surgical abdomen in only 4%. Abdominal imaging revealed thickening of intestinal wall in 61%, and endoscopies revealed abnormalities in 87%, mostly mucosal ulcerations. GI+ vs GI- patients were younger (46 ± 18 vs 54 ± 18years; P = 0.0004), had more constitutional symptoms (43% vs 23%; P = 0.0005) and joint involvement (72 vs 50%; P = 0.0002), and higher CRP levels (3.7 vs 1.9mg/dl; P = 0.001). Clinical response and relapse rates were comparable between groups, and all causes mortality (2 vs 4%) and IgAV-related mortality (1% vs 2%) as well. GI-related deaths were due to intestinal perforation and mesenteric ischaemia.

Conclusion

GI involvement is frequent in adult IgAV. GI involvement is frequent in adult IgAV. Mortality is not uncommon but does not seem to be specifically related to GI. Immunosuppressants should not be preferred as first-line therapy for GI+ patients but may be required in case of acute surgical abdomen.

### Hemoperfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins for refractory gastrointestinal involvement in pediatric Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^114LCb8P]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV), also called Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), is one of the most commonly seen vasculitis in children. The reported incidence varied from 6 to 24 per 100,000 children younger than 17 years with a peak incidence at 4–6 years of age, depending on the ethnic background. In Asia, the incidence could be as high as 56–70 per 100,000 children. The major clinical manifestations are as followed: purpura, arthralgia/arthritis, abdominal pain and renal diseases. It is reported that 31–66.7% patients have the complaints of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, manifesting as paroxysmal umbilical pain, hematemesis, and hematochezia. Some patients can even progress to severe GI complications, such as intussusception, intestinal perforation and hemorrhagic enteritis. Although HSP tends to be self-limiting, it still can develop some long-term complications. Approximately 20–60% of the HSP patients have kidney involvement, finally progressing to HSP nephritis (HSPN). Furthermore, permanent renal injury is reported in one-fifth of children with nephritic or nephrotic features. A meta-analysis showed abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and severe bowel angina in HSP were among the potential risk factors of HSPN. Indeed, more evidence supported that severe GI symptoms in early stage were related to the poor long-term renal prognosis of HSP patients, though the mechanism is not fully understood.

### Facial edema as the initial presentation of henoch-schonlein purpura in a 5-year-old boy [^117Dur6M]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The appearance of nonthrombocytic purpura is an important clue for the diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). However, this classic skin lesion may be preceded by other symptoms such as abdominal pain and arthralgia, and the diagnosis may be delayed. Facial edema as a manifestation of HSP is typically observed in children younger than 2 years. We report a 5-year-old boy with facial edema at presentation; until 3 days later, the boy returned because of abdominal complication (intussusception) and developed purpura, the diagnosis of HSP was established.

### Azathioprine therapy for steroid-resistant Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of 6 cases [^112xfkYM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Patient 4 is a 9-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with HSP six weeks prior to presentation. He initially had partial improvement on prednisone 1 mg/kg/day but then developed worsening symptoms with his prednisone wean. His palpable purpuric rash was most prominent on his bilateral distal lower extremities but was also present mildly on his buttocks, abdomen, and arms. He complained of arthralgias, testicular pain, and mild abdominal pain with normal bowel movements without hematochezia, mucous or signs of intussusception. Prednisone was increased back to 1 mg/kg/day with improvement of symptoms. A second but slower prednisone taper resulted in the return/worsening of symptoms again at 0.5 mg/kg/day. Azathioprine was added 3 months after disease onset, with successful tapering off of prednisone and no return of symptoms for the last 6 months. Laboratory evaluation showed ESR 11, CRP 0.8 mg/dL, urinalysis without proteinuria or hematuria, Cr 0.44 mg/dl, Hb 13.5 g/dL, normal immunoglobulin A (IgA), normal complement levels, and negative ANA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, ANCA, rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies. Skin biopsy was not obtained.

Patient 5 is a 9 year old Asian male with recurrent HSP over 4 years with manifestations of palpable purpura, abdominal pain with hematochezia but without intussusception, intermittent mild hematuria and proteinuria, and testicular pain with swelling. Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for ESR 23, CRP 8.3 mg/L, urinalysis without proteinuria but with brief intermittent hematuria, Cr 0.4, Hb 13.4 g/dL, normal IgA and complement levels, and negative ANA and ANCA antibodies. Skin biopsy was suggestive of leucocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition typical of HSP. Renal biopsy was not performed. Azathioprine 1 mg/kg/day was added to prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day due to the recurrent nature of his symptoms and the lack of a sustained response to glucocorticoids. The addition of azathioprine resulted in dramatic improvement of all symptoms, and tapering of prednisone was successful. Azathioprine was used for 21 months total prior to discontinuation, and the patient has currently sustained remission for 3.5 years off azathioprine and glucocorticoids.

### IgA vasculitis (henoch-Shönlein purpura) in adults: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects [^116LY648]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is an immune complex vasculitis affecting small vessels with dominant IgA deposits. Clinical manifestations mainly involve cutaneous purpura, arthralgias and/or arthritis, acute enteritis and glomerulonephritis. IgA vasculitis is more common among children than adults, with more severe disease in adults. Gastrointestinal and renal involvements represent the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in adults. Factors associated with long-term end-stage renal disease (ESRD) include baseline renal function impairment and baseline proteinuria > 1 or 1.5 g/day, and on renal biopsy degree of interstitial fibrosis, sclerotic glomeruli and fibrinoid necrosis. Management of IgA vasculitis in adults is rendered difficult for clinicians because of the absence of correlation between initial presentation and long-term renal outcome, and the possible occurrence of spontaneous remission in patients with severe presentation or, in contrast, possible evolution to ESRD in patients with mild symptoms. Treatment is often symptomatic because disease course is usually benign. Treatment of severe involvement, including severe gastrointestinal complications or proliferative glomerulonephritis, remains controversial, with no evidence that corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents improved long-term outcome. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials are thus needed to analyze the benefit-risk ratio of such treatments.

### Clinical impact of endocapillary proliferation according to the oxford classification among adults with Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^112viLGY]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a form of small vessel vasculitis. According to the European League Against Rheumatism/Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization/Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (EULAR/PRINTO/PRES) classification criteria, the diagnoses of HSP confirmed by the presence of purpura and one of the following manifestations: abdominal pain, arthralgia, renal insufficiency, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis with predominant IgA deposits. About 70–80% of adult patients with HSP develop nephritis (HSPN) manifesting as proteinuria, hematuria, or renal insufficiency. Although, the clinical features of HSPN are different from those of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the histological and immunofluorescence findings of the two diseases are indistinguishable. Additionally, the glycosylated IgA1 is elevated in both IgAN and HSPN. Thus, it is believed that HSPN and IgAN have common pathogenic mechanisms.

The incidences of IgAN and HSPN are higher among Asian people. In the UK, the annual incidence rates of HSP among black people were lower than those among Asian people. In multinational research, IgAN and HSPN are more common in Asia and Europe, while less common in the United States and Latin America among biopsy-proven kidney diseases. In China, HSPN was the second-most frequently identified disease among biopsy-proven secondary glomerular diseases. Additionally, the length of hospital stay was longer among Asian people than among Caucasians. Thus, HSPN is more common and severe disease among Asians in comparison to other populations.

The renal prognosis of HSPN in adults is worse than that in children, and approximately 10% of adults with HSPN reach end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 15 years. Clinical findings identified as risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) include old age, impairment of renal function, and massive proteinuria at the time of HSPN diagnosis. According to the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC) classification, the degree of crescent formation predicts renal prognosis. Although, ISKDC classification is associated with renal prognosis in children with HSPN, the same association was not observed in adults with HSPN.

### A case of henoch-schonlein purpura with dilated coronary arteries [^115x86GH]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) is one of the most common vasculitides of childhood, with 10–20 cases per 100,000 children. It frequently occurs following an infectious trigger and involves IgA and C3 deposition in small vessel walls. HSP is characterized by palpable purpura plus IgA deposition on biopsy, arthritis/arthralgia, renal involvement (hematuria and/or proteinuria), and/or abdominal pain. It is not generally recognized as a cause of dilated coronary arteries.

Case presentation

We describe the first reported case of HSP presenting with dilated coronary arteries. This patient is a nine-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male who presented with 1 week of petechiae on his lower legs, knee and ankle arthritis, and abdominal pain without fever, consistent with HSP. An echocardiogram revealed coronary dilation, including the left main (5.32 mm, Z score + 4.25) and left anterior descending (LAD) (3.51 mm, Z score + 2.64) coronary arteries. He received high dose aspirin, IVIG, and infliximab with normalization of the LAD. Skin biopsy revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with positive IgA staining. He was Rhinovirus/Enterovirus positive with Group A Streptococcus on throat culture.

Conclusion

Cardiac findings, while rare, can exist in HSP. Coronary dilation appeared to respond to our hospital protocol's Kawasaki Disease (KD) therapy, possibly indicating an overlap in HSP and KD pathophysiology. This case, along with prior reports of dilated coronaries in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), highlights the importance of considering other sources of systemic inflammation, in addition to KD, when coronary dilation is identified. The appropriate therapy, follow-up, and prognosis for our patient are not clear, as further studies are needed to determine the natural course of these findings.

### An unusual case of abdominal pain in a geriatric man [^114LBdZU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunoglobulin A vasculitis, historically known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is a rare form of autoimmune-induced vasculitis most common in children. This disease is characterized by a purpuric rash, arthritis, digestive tract complication, and renal inflammation (Hopkins).

Case Report

We present the case of a 78-year-old man in the emergency department with findings of weakness, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea for 3 days and a new-onset bilateral lower extremity rash. Diagnostic imaging and labs diagnosed this patient with immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV) with associated acute kidney injury and abdominal mesenteric edema. Why Should an Emergency Physician be Aware of This? Recognition of IgAV by emergency physicians and assessment of multiple organ involvement is critical to expedite treatment and minimize complications. Particularly, physicians should consider and recognize the increased severity and different presentation of IgAV in adults in comparison with the more widely known manifestation in children.

### The characteristics of video capsule endoscopy in pediatric Henoch-Schönlein purpura with gastrointestinal symptoms [^117Kdgas]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic small-vessel vasculitis that often affects children and occasionally affects adults. It is named Ig A vasculitis as well. It is more common in the Asian population than the Western population. HSP mainly involves the small vessels of skin, joints, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and kidney. About 50% to 85% of the HSP patients have GI symptoms. GI symptoms include acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematochezia or melena, and diarrhea. However, endoscopic evaluations are not performed in all HSP patients with GI symptoms. Among the patients with GI symptoms, there is a rare portion of patients without skin manifestations, who may benefit from endoscopy evaluation. HSP most affects the descending part of the duodenum in adult patients, and the typical findings of endoscopy of HSP are erythema, petechia, erosion and ulceration. Although esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is useful in the diagnosis of the majority HSP patients affect GI tract, these patients may benefit from video capsule endoscopy (VCE) examination to evaluate the mucosa of small bowel.

There are several reports previously published that detailed the endoscopy findings of child and adult HSP. However, there is no report focuses on the diagnosis value of VCE in pediatric HSP patients. Here we report a cohort of pediatric HSP patients who had a VCE examination. All the patients are diagnosed with HSP and had GI symptoms. We summarize the clinical and VCE findings of these patients in this article.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a child with henoch-schonlein purpura [^113Qx1Hn]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis that affects the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems and the kidneys. The disease primarily affects children, but may occur in elderly children with allergic purpura and also in adults. Central nervous system involvement may be the first sign; however, it is rarely encountered. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical syndrome of encephalopathy, headache, visual disturbance and seizures. Its radiological signs can be observed in grey and white matter at the posterior region of the cerebral hemispheres. HSP should be considered in children with PRES in the presence of rash, joint and gastrointestinal symptoms. We reported a 5-year-old patient who developed acute renal failure and PRES by reason of HSP.

### Endothelin 1 levels in relation to clinical presentation and outcome of henoch schonlein purpura [^116Q9Rdx]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a well known systemic small vessel vasculitis characterized by major manifestations; arthritis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, abdominal pain and renal disease. The latter is of major concern since it may result in lifelong problems. Although the pathogenesis of HSP remains largely unknown there is strong evidence that IgA has a pivotal role given the increased serum IgA concentrations, IgA with concomitant circulating immune complexes and IgA deposition in vessel walls and renal mesangium have been observed during the course of the disease. Furthermore, activation of the alternative pathway of complement and cytokine abnormalities has also been implicated as having a role in HSP pathogenesis.

Endothelins (ETs) were first found by Yanagisawa et al. in 1988 and 3 isoforms of this peptide, ET-1, ET-2, ET-3, have been isolated. Their biological activities cover a wide spectrum which includes regulation of hormones and neurotransmitter, cellular growth and proliferation, bronchoconstriction, natriuresis and water diuresis (4). Urine contains higher concentrations of ET compared to those of plasma which is mainly derived from the in situ production by the kidneys.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and its concentrations in plasma are increased markedly in a number of pathologies, such as ischemia induced damage and reperfusion, vasculities of various types, congestive heart failure, systemic inflammatory response seen in septic shock syndrome and similar pathology. In a study by Muslu A et al. it was shown that ET-1 plasma levels were significantly higher in HSP patients during the acute phase compared to levels in remission but also to levels in healthy controls.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ET-1 levels in plasma and urine are related to the severity of the clinical presentation and the outcome of HSP.

Genetic classification with clinical and imaging findings

Familial Mediterranean fever

Underlying gene defect

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease with an autosomal recessive inheritance. Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene mutation encoding pyrin are found in almost all patients with FMF, leading to excess inflammation through increased IL-1β production. It is prevalent among eastern Mediterranean populations, mainly non-Ashkenazi Jews, Armenians, Turks, and Arabs.

Clinical information

Clinically, FMF usually has a childhood onset with a mean age of 9.6 ± 8.6 years. It is characterized by recurrent fever attacks which last for 1–3 days and resolve spontaneously associated with polyserositis. In a study of 2838 Turkish FMF patients, the symptoms of patients were fever (92.5%), peritonitis (93.7%), arthritis (47.4%), pleurisy (31.2%), amyloidosis (12.9%), and non-amyloid glomerular disease (0.8%). The arthritis in FMF patients typically presents as an acute onset of mono- or oligoarthritis predominantly involving the large joints of lower extremities more than those of upper extremities. The arthritis can last for several days leaving no permanent joint damage. Prolonged myalgia, exercise-related leg pain, and sacroiliitis have been reported related to FMF. Myalgia in FMF usually involves a single muscle group featuring pain and enlargement of the affected muscle.

In a study of 38 patients with FMF, it was reported that FMF was associated with other diseases in a few patients such as polyarteritis nodosa (in 2 patients), multiple sclerosis (in 1 patient), and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (in 1 patient). In a small cohort of 33 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, it has been found the rate of disease-causing MEFV mutations and FMF disease is higher in patients with Crohn's disease compared to the rest of the Turkish population. Over the years, it has been found that FMF can be associated with Henoch-Schonlein purpura, polyarteritis nodosa, and seronegative spondyloarthropathy and these are more common among patients with FMF compared to the rest of the normal population.

### Periumbilical purpura prior to gastrointestinal involvement in Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^111nwzdE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis involving the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. While HSP is traditionally considered a disease of children, it also occurs in adults. In both populations, acute gastrointestinal complications and chronic renal involvement are major predictors of mortality. While it has been previously demonstrated that truncal lesions in HSP are associated with underlying renal involvement, a significant proportion of cases with gastrointestinal involvement also have associated truncal lesions. It is unclear at this time whether or not the association of truncal involvement with visceral disease is related to an increased burden of circulating immune complexes or a more specific mechanism. We describe a report of periumbilical purpura antecedent to gastrointestinal involvement in an adult with HSP.

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

is caused by renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), sepsis or renal toxin, which causes cell death in renal tissue, physical obstruction of the tubule lumen, and impair renal filtration function. An important pathological feature of acute kidney injury is renal tubular obstruction caused by debris of dead tubule epithelial cells.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN)

is the deposition of abnormal IgA in the glomerulus and the formation of immune complexes with variable IgG and IgM and complement 3 (C3) in the mesangial of the glomerulus. It progresses to IgM/IgG/complement codeposition and leads to chronic inflammation and glomerular damage with a poor prognosis.

IgA vasculitis is an acute leukocyte fragmentation vasculitis of small blood vessels, mainly characterized by purpura, joint pain, abdominal pain and nephritis. Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is one of the most important complications of IgA vasculitis with a good prognosis.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

is a life-threatening syndrome consisting of respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar damage caused by local and systemic immune activation disorders, resulting in pulmonary vascular, parenchyma and alveolar damage.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

is a complex and common, frequently occurring neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons, progressive degeneration of limbs leading to muscle atrophy and paralysis, and finally death 3 to 5 years after onset.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation and demyelination, resulting in white matter plaque lesions and neuron damage/loss in the central nervous system (CNS). Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common course of disease and may transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) characterized by progressive neurological dysfunction.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

is a common systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease, characterized by joint pain and swelling that can seriously impair physical function and quality of life.

Osteoarthritis (OA)

is the most common type of arthritis and the leading cause of disability worldwide. It tends to occur in middle age or due to injury or obesity. OA occurs with the onset of symptoms, including swelling of the joints, fluid accumulation in the joints and limited movement in the later stages of the disease, leading to deformity and loss of joint function.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

is a systemic autoimmune disease with vascular lesions. Its clinical manifestations vary from mild cutaneous and mucosal diseases to multiple organ involvement.

### Atypical henoch-schonlein purpura? Consider polyarteritis nodosa! [^111V7ZAo]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We describe the case of a previously healthy 12-year-old boy admitted to a tertiary paediatric centre with the clinical diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Symptoms on admission included a generalised rash, colicky abdominal pain, hypertension, proteinuria and fresh rectal bleeding. Abdominal pain and distension worsened and serial ultrasounds suggested bowel ischaemia. He underwent repeat laparotomy and bowel resection, with slow improvement after the second laparotomy. The severity of systemic involvement (gastrointestinal, cardiac, renal and skin) made the initial diagnosis of HSP questionable. Immunohistochemistry of skin biopsies was negative for HSP. Histopathology of the bowel specimen revealed features of necrotising small and medium vessel vasculitis in keeping with polyarteritis nodosa.

1 that occurs twice as often in males as in females. It has an incidence of 14 cases per 100, 000 people and occurs most frequently in the spring and fall. 2 Henoch-Schönlein purpura may present as a triad of symptoms: a palpable purpuric rash on the lower extremities, abdominal pain or renal involvement, and arthritis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause characterized by IgA-dominant immune complexes in smaller venules, capillaries and arterioles. It represents a diffuse vasculitis that is secondary to hypersensitivity. The disorder appears to represent a variety of leukocytoclastic angiitis initiated by deposition of immune complexes and can occur in response to infectious agents such as group A streptococci, Mycoplasma, Epstein-Barr virus and Varicella virus. Parvovirus B19 and. Abdominal Pain The second most frequent symptom of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is abdominal pain, which occurs in up to 65 percent of cases.

The most common complaint is colicky abdominal pain, which may be severe and associated with vomiting. Stools may show gross or occult blood; hematemesis may also occur. The pain may mimic that of an acute abdomen. Severe cases may proceed to intussusception, hemorrhage and shock. Younger children are less likely to exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms. 11 Endoscopic evaluation often shows mucosal erosions and swelling.
3. Joint Involvement The third symptom of the triad is arthritis characterized by warmth, tenderness and swelling of the joints, particularly the large joints. The ankles and knees are most frequently affected; however, the elbows, hands and feet may also be involved. Joint symptoms occur in 70 percent of cases, are transient and leave no permanent deformity. 12 Joint symptoms may precede the rash in 25 percent of cases.
3. Diagnosis Diagnosis is not difficult if the classic triad of rash, gastrointestinal complaints or hematuria, and arthritis is present.

The American College of Rheumatology. Treatment There is no specific treatment for Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Bed rest and supportive care, such as assuring adequate hydration, are helpful. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve joint and soft tissue discomfort. Corticosteroids have some use in patients with severe abdominal pain. However, corticosteroids are not recommended for treatment of rash, joint pain or renal disease alone.
