## Question

Treatment for gram negative bacilli in the urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat gram-negative bacilli in the urine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this represents asymptomatic bacteriuria or a true urinary tract infection. Then, I should classify the clinical syndrome as uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, or complicated UTI. Next, I will assess severity and risk factors for resistance, including ESBL, CRE, and DTR Pseudomonas. After that, I will select empiric therapy and then de-escalate based on culture and susceptibilities. Finally, I will determine duration, consider source control, and apply stewardship principles throughout, making sure I verify each step against guidelines and key trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm whether this is asymptomatic bacteriuria versus symptomatic UTI, because treatment of ASB is generally discouraged except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma, and overtreatment drives harm without benefit. I should double-check that there are truly no urinary symptoms and no systemic features suggesting infection before proceeding down the ASB pathway, and if ASB is present, I should avoid antibiotics and document the rationale clearly [^6df2fa6d] [^b49ee99b] [^b2a79a19].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. If there are symptoms or systemic features, I need to classify the syndrome next: uncomplicated cystitis in nonpregnant women, pyelonephritis, or complicated UTI, which includes males, pregnant patients, immunocompromised hosts, structural or functional urinary abnormalities, indwelling devices, or recent urologic instrumentation. This classification will drive both empiric choices and duration, so I should verify the category carefully before choosing therapy [^8144d778] [^e6fdfc78].

> I will now examine severity and risk factors for resistant gram-negative pathogens, because this shapes empiric coverage. I need to check for recent healthcare exposure, prior resistant organisms, recent fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin use, travel to regions with high ESBL prevalence, and local antibiograms. Critically ill patients or those with sepsis warrant broader empiric coverage pending susceptibilities, and I should confirm that I am aligning with IDSA's severity-based approach and local resistance data [^e6fdfc78] [^868445cc].

> For uncomplicated cystitis, let me think about first-line options with low resistance and favorable safety. Nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are preferred if susceptible, with fosfomycin as an alternative, and I should avoid fluoroquinolones when possible due to collateral damage. Wait, I initially thought to include beta-lactams broadly, but I should correct that: beta-lactams are less effective for cystitis and should be reserved for alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable, so I will prioritize nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin and tailor to local resistance and patient factors [^fb0d862e] [^5b3f0c5f].

> For pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, I need to ensure coverage of likely resistant gram-negatives. Fluoroquinolones, if susceptible, are reasonable oral options for stable patients, while parenteral ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem are appropriate empiric choices depending on severity and local ESBL risk. I should confirm that if ESBL-producing Enterobacterales are suspected, a carbapenem is preferred initially, with step-down to active oral agents once stable and susceptibilities return [^868445cc] [^e6fdfc78].

> But wait, what if the organism is carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales or difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas? In that case, I should verify that preferred agents include ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, or cefiderocol for CRE pyelonephritis or cUTI, and ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-relebactam, or cefiderocol for DTR Pseudomonas, reserving aminoglycosides as alternatives and avoiding polymyxins when possible due to toxicity and limited benefit. I should double-check susceptibilities before finalizing, as oral options like TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones are preferred only if active [^fca0c1f6] [^f97c0a19] [^2b8488a4].

> Next, I should review duration, and I need to ensure I am not defaulting to prolonged therapy when shorter effective courses suffice. For uncomplicated cystitis, 5 days of nitrofurantoin or a single dose of fosfomycin are effective, for pyelonephritis or cUTI 7 to 14 days is typical, and for gram-negative bacteremia from a urinary source, 7 days is sufficient if the patient is clinically improving, afebrile, and hemodynamically stable, with source control addressed. Let me verify that the IPD meta-analyses support 7 versus 14 days for gram-negative bacteremia showing no mortality difference, which they do [^fb0d862e] [^e8b7f17e] [^dd9942a8].

> I should confirm the plan to obtain cultures before antibiotics whenever feasible, then de-escalate promptly. Obtaining a urinalysis and quantitative culture with susceptibilities before therapy allows targeted therapy within 48 to 72 hours, reduces adverse events, and supports stewardship. I need to ensure I reassess at 48 to 72 hours and narrow or stop therapy if the clinical picture and cultures do not support infection [^99949f99] [^e6fdfc78].

> Source control is essential in complicated UTI, so I must check for obstruction, stones, abscess, or devices and act to relieve them. Catheter-associated infections generally require catheter removal or exchange, and obstructed systems need drainage. If source control is delayed, I should extend therapy and reassess response, documenting the rationale clearly [^b1396b1e] [^e6fdfc78].

> For special populations, I should double-check nuances. In pregnancy, screen and treat ASB with 4 to 7 days of an agent such as nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin, or TMP-SMX depending on gestational timing and susceptibilities. In pediatrics, avoid fluoroquinolones and tailor to local resistance. In the elderly with delirium but no localizing urinary symptoms, avoid treating ASB and evaluate other causes. In immunocompromised hosts, maintain a lower threshold for broader empiric coverage and longer durations if response is suboptimal [^e3929ce1] [^b2a79a19] [^fde217b5].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship principles are embedded throughout. Avoid treating ASB, use the narrowest effective agent, choose the shortest effective duration, and transition to oral therapy as soon as clinically stable with active options. I should verify that early IV-to-oral switch in stable gram-negative bacteremia is safe and associated with shorter length of stay, which contemporary data support, while acknowledging that ongoing RCTs will refine timing [^5b3f0c5f] [^08dcd359].

> Finally, let me reconsider the initial premise to ensure internal consistency. The key decision points are: distinguish ASB from UTI, classify the syndrome, assess severity and resistance risks, select empiric therapy aligned with local epidemiology, obtain cultures and de-escalate, secure source control when indicated, choose guideline-concordant durations, and apply stewardship. If I follow this sequence and verify each step against IDSA and contemporary guidance, I will minimize overtreatment, resistance, and adverse events while maximizing clinical cure [^e6fdfc78] [^868445cc] [^8144d778].

Treat gram-negative bacilli in urine based on **clinical context** and **resistance risk**. For **asymptomatic bacteriuria**, do not treat except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^6df2fa6d] [^528cef34]. For **symptomatic UTI**, use nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX if susceptible; if resistant or in complicated cases, use fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, or carbapenems per susceptibilities [^868445cc] [^fca0c1f6]. For **complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**, start parenteral therapy (ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem) and tailor to culture results; treat for 7–14 days, shorter if clinically improving and source control is achieved [^e6fdfc78] [^dd9942a8]. Always obtain cultures before antibiotics when possible and apply stewardship principles to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^99949f99] [^5b3f0c5f].

## Clinical significance of gram-negative bacilli in urine

Gram-negative bacilli — especially E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas — are common uropathogens [^3a1a459e]. Their presence may reflect colonization, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or true infection; **clinical correlation is essential** to avoid overtreatment [^b2a79a19].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is indicated for **symptomatic UTI** (cystitis, pyelonephritis, or complicated UTI) and for **asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB)** only in pregnancy or before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^6df2fa6d] [^528cef34]. Routine treatment of ASB is discouraged because it does not improve outcomes and increases adverse effects [^1a72a468].

---

## Empiric antibiotic selection

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns**, **patient-specific factors**, and **illness severity**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin (5 days) <br/> - TMP-SMX (3 days) if low resistance <br/> - Fosfomycin (single dose) [^fb0d862e] |
| Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis | - Ceftriaxone (IV) <br/> - Piperacillin-tazobactam (IV) <br/> - Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem) if ESBL risk [^868445cc] |
| Severe infection or sepsis | - Carbapenem (meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) <br/> - Combination therapy if Pseudomonas suspected [^notfound] |

---

## Definitive therapy based on culture and susceptibility

Once susceptibilities return, **narrow therapy** to the narrowest active agent:

- **ESBL-producing Enterobacterales**: carbapenems preferred; fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX if susceptible [^868445cc].
- **Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE)**: ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, or cefiderocol [^fca0c1f6].
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or carbapenems; avoid fluoroquinolones monotherapy if resistance risk is high [^notfound].

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: 3–5 days (nitrofurantoin 5 days; TMP-SMX 3 days) [^fb0d862e].
- **Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**: 7–14 days; shorter (7 days) if clinical response is good and source control is achieved [^dd9942a8].
- **Gram-negative bacteremia**: 7 days if clinically stable and source controlled [^e8b7f17e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: treat ASB with beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cephalexin) for 4–7 days [^e3929ce1].
- **Catheter-associated UTI**: remove or replace the catheter; treat for 7–14 days based on severity [^notfound].
- **Renal impairment**: dose-adjust antibiotics as indicated; avoid nephrotoxic agents when possible [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor for **clinical response** within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, reassess for obstruction, abscess, or resistant organisms and repeat cultures. Track for adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides and C. difficile infection with broad-spectrum agents [^868445cc].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention focuses on **hydration**, **bladder training**, and **antimicrobial stewardship** to limit resistance. Consider prophylaxis only for frequent, symptomatic recurrences after addressing modifiable risks [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel agents

New agents such as cefiderocol, plazomicin, and combinations like ceftazidime-avibactam expand options for **multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections**, though stewardship and susceptibility testing remain critical [^3aefa134] [^f9b460db].

---

Treatment of gram-negative bacilli in urine must be **individualized** to the clinical context, resistance risk, and patient factors, with empiric therapy followed by **culture-guided narrowing** to optimize outcomes and minimize resistance.

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^42728dcb]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### White paper: developing antimicrobial drugs for resistant pathogens, narrow-spectrum indications, and unmet needs [^88a6d888]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Despite progress in antimicrobial drug development, a critical need persists for new, feasible pathways to develop antibacterial agents to treat people infected with drug-resistant bacteria. Infections due to resistant gram-negative bacilli continue to cause unacceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Antibacterial agents have been historically studied in noninferiority clinical trials that focus on a single site of infection (eg, complicated urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections), yet these designs may not be optimal, and often are not feasible, for study of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria. Over the past several years, multiple stakeholders have worked to develop consensus regarding paths forward with a goal of facilitating timely conduct of antimicrobial development. Here we advocate for a novel and pragmatic approach and, toward this end, present feasible trial designs for antibacterial agents that could enable conduct of narrow-spectrum, organism-specific clinical trials and ultimately approval of critically needed new antibacterial agents.

Worldwide prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is rapidly increasing, primarily a result of antibiotic misuse in the medical community. Resistant infections involving the urinary tract are typically caused by gram-negative bacteria. When treating these infections, clinicians have few effective antimicrobials to choose from and many are associated with significant adverse effects. There are now situations when clinicians are tasked with managing infections from pan-resistant organisms; thus, it is of paramount importance that spread of resistance be controlled. This review discusses common gram-negative resistance classes, highlighting the mechanisms of resistance, risk factors, type of infections, treatment, and outcomes associated with each class.

Table 3
Suggested duration of therapy by site of infection

UTI, urinary tract infection.

Antibiotic durations should always be individualized to the patient and their clinical status. Many studies have underrepresentation of critically ill patients.

# 7 days is recommended in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

* Consider prolonged courses of 14 days with non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli due to an increased risk of relapse/recurrence with shorter courses.

¶ After definitive source control.

† Trials excluded immunocompromised patients, patients with indwelling prostheses, infectious syndromes that required prolonged durations, or organisms that required prolonged durations of treatment (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis). Most evidence for shorter courses is in bacteremia from gram negative bacteria secondary to urinary tract infections. Control of the primary source and blood culture clearance should also be achieved.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^b58a3adf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### The role of carbapenems in initial therapy for serious Gram-negative infections [^a292e398]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with serious Gram-negative infections must be both prompt and correct. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mortality risk is significantly increased when the initial antibiotic regimen does not adequately cover the infecting pathogen. Furthermore, changing to an appropriate regimen once culture results are available does not reduce this risk. Therefore, one must empirically treat serious infections with a regimen that covers likely pathogens. Selecting such a regimen is complicated by the increasing prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Moreover, multidrug-resistant pathogens, once limited to hospital-acquired infections, are increasingly being detected in community-acquired infections, especially those involving the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts or in immunocompromised patients. Consequently, the initial antibiotic regimen must have a broad spectrum of activity that includes potential resistant pathogens, as indicated by the local antibiogram. Many multidrug-resistant pathogens remain susceptible to carbapenems despite increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance. This article reviews the role played by carbapenems in the initial treatment of serious Gram-negative infections and the potential effect of emerging resistance on this role.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^2aca5aa2]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^a576c443]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Diagnostic stewardship for urine cultures [^579168d4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are among the most common infectious diagnoses in health care, but most urinary tract infections are diagnosed inappropriately in patients without signs or symptoms of infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and negative downstream effects, including antimicrobial resistance, health care-associated infections, and adverse drug events. Diagnostic stewardship is the process of modifying the ordering, performing, or reporting of test results to improve clinical care. Diagnostic stewardship impacts the diagnostic pathway to decrease inappropriate detection and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. This article reviews diagnostic stewardship methods and closes with a case study illustrating these principles in practice.

IDSA 2023 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), piperacillin–tazobactam suggested approach — If piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an ESBL-E and clinical improvement occurs, no change or extension of antibiotic therapy is necessary. The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) as an alternative option. Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs caused by AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^ffb46411]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### An implementation guide to reducing overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^2d54e01c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) frequently lacks appropriate indication, yet remains prevalent across settings. Numerous guidelines, professional societies, and campaigns such as Choosing Wisely advocate against this low-value practice. Efforts aimed at reducing unnecessary treatment of ASB demonstrate improved costs, and avoidable harm without increased risk of adverse events. We propose an evidence-based implementation guide to aid practitioners in reducing inappropriate treatment of ASB.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^475c2152]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gram-negative bacteremia is common in both community and health care settings, with a significant increase in incidence described for some Gram-negative bacteria in recent years. Prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy for such common infections may lead to increased resistance emergence; adverse events and secondary infections, including Clostridioides difficile infection; prolonged hospital-stay; and excess cost.

tThough recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the non-inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses for Gram-negative bacteremia, prolonged courses are still commonly used and current guidelines still recommend the range of 7–14 days. In addition, it is unclear whether shorter courses of antibiotics are appropriate for specific sub-groups of patients, such as those with non-urinary source of bacteremia; intensive care patients, elderly, and others.

Observational design is a limited tool for evaluating duration of therapy due to confounding by indication and immortal time bias issues. Thus, RCTs are the preferred design to answer this question. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs is considered to be the gold standard of systematic review. IPD meta-analysis advantages (among others) are narrowing the confidence intervals, and increasing the power to evaluate treatment effect in specific sub-groups of patients.

We performed an IPD meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. We aimed to explore outcomes in several pre-specified sub-groups of patients. We hypothesized no significant difference between short and long antibiotic course for either of the sub-groups.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^38cfbfed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Treatment options for multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives in urinary tract infections [^3aefa134]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria are challenging to treat because of limited treatment options and potential side effects of less frequently used anti-infectives. In the past few years, several new antimicrobial agents effective against MDR Gram-negatives have become available. This review focuses on the treatment options for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) caused by MDR Gram-negatives.

Recent Findings

The novel combinations, betalactam or carbapenem and betalactamase inhibitor, ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem/vaborbactam, are effective for infections caused by KPC-carbapenemase-producing pathogens. Imipenem/relebactam, another carbapenem/betalactamase inhibitor combination, has been approved for the treatment of cUTI. However, data on the efficacy of imipenem/relebactam against carbapenem-resistant pathogens is still limited. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is mainly used for the treatment of MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. For the treatment of cUTI caused by extended-spectrum betalactamases producing Enterobacterales aminoglycosides or intravenous fosfomycin should be considered.

Summary

To ensure prudent use and to avoid the development of resistance to novel anti-infective substances, an interdisciplinary approach, including urologists, microbiologists, and infectious disease physicians, is strongly advised.

IDSA 2023 extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — preferred and alternative antibiotics are specified as follows: Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems are alternative agents for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and although effective, their use is discouraged when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are active. An aminoglycoside (as a single dose) and oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) are also alternative treatments for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and treatment suggestions for ESBL-E infections assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^3ad70182]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^6df2fa6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^51ff1b50]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPD systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-IPD Statement, and Cochrane instructions for IPD-MA. Considering the priority of the results for decision-making, and taking into account expected new evidence from a large ongoing trial in the topic, we conduct this review as a living systematic review. For the living systematic review we will repeat the search every 12 months. Updates of the meta-analysis will be conducted when new evidence that is likely to influence the results will be identified.

We included RCTs comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia, as defined in individual trials. We included only trials evaluating patients with Gram-negative bacteremia as their target population. Trials evaluating various infection types (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), and reporting bacteremic patients as a sub-group were not included. We excluded trials addressing source of bacteremia requiring prolonged treatment (endocarditis/endovascular infections; necrotizing fasciitis; osteomyelitis; abdominal abscesses and other unresolved abdominal sources requiring source control (surgery/drainage); central nervous system infections; empyema; any uncontrolled focus of infection (undrained abscess/deep seated intra-abdominal infection, undrained moderate to severe hydronephrosis). We also excluded patients with intracellular pathogens including Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp.

Interventions tested were antibiotics with in vitro activity against the pathogen for ≤ 7 vs > 7 days. Any choice and route of administration of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) were eligible for inclusion. Any source of bacteremia not requiring prolonged treatment (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.) and any place of acquisition (community or hospital) were eligible for inclusion.

Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality; relapse of bacteremia; length of hospital stay; readmissions; local suppurative and distant complications; restarting of Gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy; emergence of resistance to study antibiotics; functional capacity and time to return to baseline capacity; new clinically or microbiologically documented infection; and adverse events: any diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and rash (for secondary outcomes definitions, see Appendix).

1959. 00270090032005. Of the Gram-negative flora, those really sensitive to penicillin are the Neisseriae, which behave chemotherapeutically the same way as the Gram-positive cocci. If we modify our definition of sensitivity and go to higher concentrations than those usually attained in the body after the clinical dosage forms of penicillin, we may encounter a few strains that are inhibited by moderate concentrations of the antibiotic. There are a few reports in the literature of septicemias caused by Gram-negative resistant bacteria that were cured by huge doses of penicillin. 2–5, 9. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for those strains were mostly 10μg. -20μg. per milliliter. Strains requiring higher concentrations have been correctly considered as extra resistant.

Attention has been drawn to the sensitivity of Proteus, and the strains of Proteus mirabilis have been proven more sensitive than the other strains. 1, 6, 7, 9.

Question 3.3 — CRE infections outside the urinary tract that are not carbapenemase producing: For isolates that exhibit susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem (ie, MICs ≤ 1 μg/mL) but are not susceptible to ertapenem (ie, MICs ≥ 1 μg/mL), the use of extended-infusion meropenem (or imipenem-cilastatin) is suggested; if such isolates do not exhibit susceptibility to any carbapenem, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are preferred treatment options. The rationale notes that less than 3% of the 1249 isolates resistant to ertapenem but susceptible to meropenem and imipenem contained a carbapenemase gene, and that standard-infusion meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin may be reasonable for uncomplicated cUTIs. For isolates susceptible to meropenem but not imipenem (and vice versa), the panel suggests basing treatment on severity of illness and site of infection. The panel suggests against the use of meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam to treat ertapenem-resistant, meropenem-susceptible and imipenem-susceptible infections, and suggests against the use of extended-infusion carbapenems with or without a second agent when susceptibility to meropenem or imipenem has not been demonstrated. Tigecycline or eravacycline are alternative options for CRE infections not involving the bloodstream or urinary tract.

- Gram stain of urethral secretions exist that demonstrate ≥ 2 WBCs per oil immersion field, men with recurrent NGU should be tested for M. genitalium by using an FDA-cleared NAAT. Treatment for M. genitalium includes a two-stage approach, ideally using resistance-guided therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is available it should be performed, and the results should be used to guide therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days should be used. The rationale for this approach is that although not curative, doxycycline decreases the M. genitalium bacterial load, thereby increasing likelihood of moxifloxacin success. Higher doses of azithromycin have not been effective for M. genitalium after azithromycin treatment failures. Men with persistent or recurrent NGU after treatment for M. genitalium or T.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^e8b7f17e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

We aim to compare the effect of short versus long treatment duration in Gram-negative bacteremia on all-cause mortality in pre-specified sub-groups.

Methods

Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short (≤ 7) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia during hospital stay. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify trials conducted up to May 2022. Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, local or distant infection complications, adverse events, and resistance emergence.

Outcomes were assessed in pre-specified subgroups: women vs men; non-urinary vs urinary source; presence vs absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised patients versus non-immunocompromised patients, and age (above/below 65). Fixed-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All three trials had low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment.

Findings

Three RCTs (1186 patients) were included; 1121 with enterobacterales bacteremia. No significant difference in mortality was demonstrated between 7- and 14-days treatment (90-day mortality: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30-day mortality: 1.08, 0.62–1.91). Relapse (1.00, 0.50–1.97); length of hospital stay (P = 0.78); readmission (0.96, 0.80–1.22); and infection complications (local: 1.62 0.76–3.47; distant: 2.00, 0.18–22.08), were without significant difference, and so were adverse events or resistance emergence.

No significant difference in clinical outcomes between 7 and 14 days of antibiotics was demonstrated in the subgroups of gender, age, hemodynamic status, immune status, and source of infection.

Interpretation

For patients hemodynamically stable and afebrile at 48 h prior to discontinuation, seven days of antibiotic therapy for enterobacterales bacteremia result in similar outcomes as 14 days, in terms of mortality, relapse, length of hospital stay, complications of infection, resistance emergence, and adverse events. These results apply for any adult age group, gender, source of infection, immune status, and hemodynamic status on presentation.

Question 3.6 — infections outside of the urinary tract caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) with OXA-48-like production: Suggested approach: Ceftazidime-avibactam is the preferred treatment option for OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections. Cefiderocol is an alternative treatment option. If OXA-48-like enzymes are produced by an Enterobacterales clinical isolate, ceftazidime-avibactam is preferred and cefiderocol is an alternative option, and more than 95% of OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales isolates are susceptible to both agents. Meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam have limited activity against OXA-48-like producing isolates because vaborbactam and relebactam are unlikely to inhibit OXA-48-like enzymes and are not suggested, even if susceptible in vitro. Clinical trial data comparing ceftazidime-avibactam vs cefiderocol are not available, and an observational study including 171 patients with OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections treated with ceftazidime-avibactam identified 30-day mortality in 22%.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1a72a468]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative uropathogens: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^f9b460db]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represent the highest priority for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Cefiderocol (S-649266), a new siderophore cephalosporin, has broad activity against Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.

Methods

We did a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority trial at 67 hospitals in 15 countries. Adults (≥ 18 years) admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection with or without pyelonephritis or those with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were randomly assigned (2:1) by an interactive web or voice response system to receive 1 h intravenous infusions of cefiderocol (2 g) or imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) three times daily, every 8 h for 7–14 days. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline urine culture with more than two uropathogens, a fungal urinary tract infection, or pathogens known to be carbapenem resistant. The primary endpoint was the composite of clinical and microbiological outcomes at test of cure (ie, 7 days after treatment cessation), which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% and 20% margins) of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug and had a qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10 5 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug, according to the treatment they received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02321800.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2015, and Aug 16, 2016, 452 patients were randomly assigned to cefiderocol (n = 303) or imipenem-cilastatin (n = 149), of whom 448 patients (n = 300 in the cefiderocol group; n = 148 in the imipenem-cilastatin group) received treatment. 371 patients (n = 252 patients in the cefiderocol group; n = 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group) had qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10 5 CFU/mL) and were included in the primary efficacy analysis. At test of cure, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved by 183 (73%) of 252 patients in the cefiderocol group and 65 (55%) of 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with an adjusted treatment difference of 18·58% (95% CI 8·23–28·92; p = 0·0004), establishing the non-inferiority of cefiderocol. Cefiderocol was well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 122 (41%) of 300 patients in the cefiderocol group and 76 (51%) of 148 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with gastrointestinal disorders (ie, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) the most common adverse events for both treatment groups (35 [12%] patients in the cefiderocol group and 27 [18%] patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group).

Interpretation

Intravenous infusion of cefiderocol (2 g) three times daily was non-inferior compared with imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in people with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. The results of this study will provide the basis for submission of a New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration. Clinical trials of hospital-acquired pneumonia and carbapenem-resistant infections are ongoing.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam versus doripenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis: RECAPTURE, a phase 3 randomized trial program [^baff522b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

RECAPTURE 1 and 2 comprised 2 identical phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trials designed incorporating FDA and EMA guidance. All patients (or their legal representatives) provided written informed consent. The studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocols (available at:) were approved by study sites' independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards.

Thelists full inclusion/exclusion criteria. In brief, eligible patients were aged 18–90 years, and had cUTI or acute pyelonephritis considered by the investigator to be serious and requiring hospitalization for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis was based on positive urine cultures obtained within 48 hours of enrollment showing 1–2 gram-negative uropathogens at ≥ 10 5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and pyuria. Complicated UTI without pyelonephritis was defined as presence of ≥ 2 symptoms, including ≥ 1 UTI-specific symptom (dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days) as well as ≥ 1 complicating factor. Acute pyelonephritis was indicated by flank pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days, and/or costovertebral angle tenderness, with fever and/or nausea/vomiting. Patients could be enrolled before cultures were available, providing that positive results were expected, the study drugs were considered appropriate empiric therapy, and a urine Gram stain showed gram-negative bacilli and no gram-positive bacteria. Indwelling bladder catheters in place for > 24 hours had to be removed or replaced (unless considered unsafe or contraindicated) before the baseline urine collection. Standardized catheter management guidelines were followed.

Key exclusion criteria included complete obstruction of any portion of the urinary tract, perinephric or intrarenal abscess, or prostatitis; UTI symptoms potentially attributable to another process; urinary diversion or vesicoureteral reflux; creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/minute (including patients on dialysis).

CRAB — polymyxins (Question 5.5) — Polymyxin B can be considered in combination with at least 1 other agent for the treatment of CRAB infections, and the panel preferentially suggests polymyxin B when considering polymyxin-based regimens. Colistin is favored for CRAB UTIs because it converts to its active form in the urinary tract, whereas there is minimal excretion of polymyxin B in the urine. There is no CLSI susceptible category for the polymyxins against A. baumannii and the benefit is likely diminished when polymyxin MICs are > 2 μg/mL. The panel advises against polymyxin monotherapy, citing a narrow therapeutic window in which ~2 μg/mL may be required to achieve 1-log10 reduction in bacterial growth but this is also the threshold associated with nephrotoxicity, and noting that in the largest colistin monotherapy trials (over 300 patients in each trial) mortality was relatively high at 46% in both trials.

### Recognition and prevention of healthcare-associated urinary tract infections in the intensive care unit [^3a1a459e]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the intensive care unit and predominantly occurs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. The predominant microorganisms causing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in the intensive care unit are enteric Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, Candida species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Multidrug resistance is a significant problem in urinary pathogens. Duration of catheterization is the most important risk factor for development of CAUTI. Diagnosis, particularly in the intensive care unit setting, is very difficult, as asymptomatic bacteriuria may be difficult to differentiate from symptomatic CAUTI. In general, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, and treatment of CAUTI often requires removal of the catheter along with systemic antimicrobial therapy. General strategies for prevention of CAUTI apply to all healthcare-associated infections and include measures such as adherence to hand hygiene. Targeted strategies for prevention of CAUTI include limiting the use and duration of urinary catheterization, using aseptic technique for catheter insertion, and adhering to proper catheter care.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^cceb5891]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^30d5c2f9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by DTR P. aeruginosa — preferred and alternative treatments — lists ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, and cefiderocol as the preferred treatment options, while tobramycin or amikacin (as a single dose) and colistin are alternative options. Preferred agents are based on clinical trials showing non-inferiority, and data are insufficient to favor 1 of these agents over others for uncomplicated cystitis because available trials generally do not include patients infected by pathogens with DTR phenotypes. A single dose of tobramycin or amikacin is an alternative option, and a single IV dose of tobramycin or amikacin are likely effective for uncomplicated cystitis as aminoglycosides are nearly exclusively eliminated by the renal route in their active form, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical data are lacking.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when to screen and when to treat [^5146fc23]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common. Populations with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract may have an exceedingly high prevalence of bacteriuria, but even healthy individuals frequently have positive urine cultures. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is seldom associated with adverse outcomes. Pregnant women and individuals who are to undergo traumatic genitourinary interventions are at risk for complications of bacteriuria and benefit from screening and treatment programs. Although screening is recommended for renal transplant recipients, the benefits for these patients are less clear. For other populations, including most bacteriuric individuals, negative outcomes attributable to asymptomatic bacteriuria have not been described. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients is not beneficial and, in fact, may be associated with harmful outcomes, such as increased short-term frequency of symptomatic infection, adverse drug effects, and reinfection with organisms of increased antimicrobial resistance. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and treatment is recommended for only selected groups where benefit has been shown. Many research questions still need to be addressed. Different populations have unique risk factors, and the benefits and risks of different management approaches for asymptomatic bacteriuria must continue to be addressed systematically in appropriate clinical trials.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in functionally impaired older adults and long-term care residents — screening and treatment: In older, community-dwelling persons who are functionally impaired, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and in older persons resident in long-term care facilities, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence notes that only 16% of bacteriuric residents with advanced dementia met minimum criteria for symptomatic UTI, but 75% of these received treatment; antimicrobial therapy conferred no survival benefit (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 1.09 [95% CI, .43–2.75] for oral therapy vs no therapy, and 1.83 [95% CI, .44–7.60] for intramuscular therapy vs no therapy); increased frequency of bacteriuric episodes was significantly associated with an increased frequency of receiving an antimicrobial or subsequent isolation of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in urine, but not changes in mental status or admission to hospital for UTI; and the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) within 3 months of therapy was > 8.5-fold higher for patients who received antimicrobial treatment than those who did not.

Available studies focus on comparing newer β-lactam agents to older agents and generally focus on MDR P. aeruginosa and not DTR P. aeruginosa. Reported outcomes include favorable clinical outcomes in 81% of patients receiving ceftolozane-tazobactam vs 61% with polymyxin- or aminoglycoside-based therapy; pooled trials of 95 patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam vs carbapenem-based comparators observed favorable clinical response in 57% (32 of 56 patients) vs 54% (21 of 39). Only 66% of isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam, and an observational study with 100 patients per group reported mortality approximately 40% in both groups.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Rational antibiotic treatment of outpatient genitourinary infections in a changing environment [^b57b6c19]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the outpatient setting, genitourinary infections (GUIs) remain costly to treat and are a significant cause of morbidity. Recent evidence supports more substantial roles for pathogens other than Escherichia coli, particularly gram-positive pathogens, in the pathogenesis of GUIs. Broad-spectrum agents should be considered in order to address this etiologic change appropriately. Criteria for antimicrobial selection set forth by the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) recommend using antibiotics that are supported by strong clinical evidence, have good susceptibility profiles, are safe, are cost-effective, and are used for the optimal duration. Evidence-based guidelines recommend considering local E coli resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy when resistance is high. Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Among the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin offer coverage for the gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, which may make them preferable in treating urinary tract infections empirically in such patient groups. For the treatment of bacterial prostatitis, only trimethoprim and the fluoroquinolones possess both the appropriate bactericidal activity and the ability to diffuse into the prostate. Levofloxacin shows particularly good penetration into prostatic tissue. Safety issues to consider include imbalances in intestinal microflora caused by antimicrobial agents that may lead to overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Once the optimal agent is identified, the optimal duration of treatment should be determined to maximize treatment success while minimizing the potential for resistance. Finally, cost considerations include the costs of treatment failure due to inappropriate therapy or nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.

From the societal perspective, avoidance of antimicrobial use where there is no benefit is preferred, and when the quality of evidence is low with no suggestion of potential harm, the panel "generally recommend against the treatment of ASB because of the high-quality evidence that antimicrobial therapy contributes to antimicrobial resistance". They also note costs are not offset by demonstrable benefits and that high-quality evidence shows no reduction in symptomatic UTI or other outcomes where there is no evidence of benefit with treatment of ASB.

Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^c3dc2c2b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^5b3f0c5f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^b0c72375]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative guidance — KPC-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections outside the urinary tract: Meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are preferred treatment options, with cefiderocol an alternative option. Preferred agents for KPC-producing infections include these three agents, and all 3 agents appear to have greater than 95% activity against KPC-producing Enterobacterales in the United States. Although all 3 are preferred, the panel slightly favors meropenem-vaborbactam, followed by ceftazidime-avibactam, and then imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, based on available clinical outcomes data and likelihood of resistance emergence. In an observational comparison, clinical cure and 30-day mortality among patients who received meropenem-vaborbactam versus ceftazidime-avibactam were 85% and 61% and 12% and 19%, respectively; although these differences were not statistically significant, they numerically favor meropenem-vaborbactam. Among patients with recurrent CRE infections, 0% (0 of 3) after meropenem-vaborbactam versus 20% (3 of 15) after ceftazidime-avibactam had subsequent CRE isolates resistant to initial therapy, and other clinical experiences found a slightly higher likelihood of clinical cure and survival and a lower risk of resistance emergence with meropenem-vaborbactam. Limited clinical data are available for imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam in KPC-producing Enterobacterales; among Enterobacterales infections, favorable clinical response occurred in 40% (2 of 5 patients) with imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam versus 100% (2 of 2 patients) with imipenem-cilastatin plus colistin, and it is difficult to draw conclusions due to small numbers. Over 95% of KPC-producing Enterobacterales test susceptible to cefiderocol, and cefiderocol is suggested as an alternative agent for treating KPC-producing pathogens due to limited clinical outcomes data and to reserve it for infections caused by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacterales or glucose non-fermenting gram-negative organisms.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

Administer ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems as alternative options. Do not use the latter if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. Administer a single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) as another alternative option.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Inappropriate treatment of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria in a tertiary care hospital [^25aa6387]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines state that asymptomatic bacteriuria is not a clinically significant condition in men and nonpregnant women and that treatment is unlikely to confer clinical benefit. We hypothesized that, among patients with indwelling catheters or condom collection systems, many who receive a diagnosis of and are treated for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) actually have asymptomatic bacteriuria and, therefore, that antibiotic therapy is inappropriate.

Methods

We reviewed all urine culture results at a veterans affairs medical center during a 3-month period. Cultures yielding 10(4) colony-forming units/mL were included if the urine had been collected from a hospitalized patient with an indwelling (Foley) catheter or a condom collection system. We applied standardized definitions to determine whether the episode represented catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CAABU) or CAUTI. Antibiotic therapy was considered appropriate for patients who met criteria for symptomatic UTI.

Results

Overall, 280 episodes met criteria for inclusion: 164 CAABU and 116 CAUTI. Of the 164 episodes of CAABU, 111 (68%) were managed appropriately (no treatment), whereas 53 (32%) were treated with antibiotics (inappropriate treatment). In multivariate analysis, older patient age, having predominantly gram-negative bacteriuria, and higher urine white blood cell count were significantly associated with inappropriate treatment of CAABU (P < .05, by logistic regression).

Conclusions

Better recognition of CAABU and the distinction between this condition and CAUTI, consistent with evidence-based guidelines, may play a key role in reducing unneeded antibiotic usage in hospitalized patients.

### Current economic and regulatory challenges in developing antibiotics for Gram-negative bacteria [^890116d7]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

The design of clinical trials for antibacterials is challenging since specific pathogen-caused infections have to be considered. Given that AMR is widespread and caused by multiple different bacteria, identifying and recruiting patients with such pathogen-specific infections is difficult, as they are fewer in number. This challenge was recently faced by the new aminoglycoside antibiotic plazomicin. In a clinical trial that enroled patients with urinary tract infections, plazomicin showed excellent results when compared with the standard available treatment. However, when a trial was undertaken to study the drug in carbapenem-resistant infections, only 39 patients could be recruited out of 2000 screened. This exemplifies the struggles of conducting clinical trials; while new antibiotics are urgently needed for serious infections, the enrolment of patients with these infections is almost nil.

The inclusion criteria for patient enrolment are also complex. According to new regulations, existing antibiotics cannot be administered to patients before the trial; on the other hand, patients recruited with chronic infections are required to be given multiple intravenous doses of antibiotics. The former excludes the involvement of critically ill patients, while the latter of non-critically ill patients, overall complicating the trial requirements. Furthermore, to minimise errors in determining the efficacy of the test drug, ventilator-associated pneumonia trials are required to recruit subjects who have not received any prior treatment. However, it is largely unethical to withhold treatment from patients infected with these high-mortality-associated diseases. As a result, the recruitment of patients in such trials is low, and generalising the trial findings becomes difficult.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^76ea8269]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Single-dose antibiotic therapy fell into disfavor when it was observed that women had a high risk of recurrence within six weeks of the initial treatment. 14, 15 The risk was attributed to the failure of single-dose antibiotics to eradicate gram-negative bacteria from the rectum, the source or reservoir for ascending uropathogens. Unlike single-dose antibiotic therapy, a three-day regimen reduces rectal carriage of gram-negative bacteria and is not associated with a high recurrence rate. Thus, three-day regimens appear to offer the optimal combination of convenience, low cost and an efficacy comparable to that of seven-day or longer regimens but with fewer side effects. Patients who are too ill to take oral antibiotics or who are unable to take them should initially be treated with parenterally administered single agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a third-generation cephalosporin, aztreonam, a broad-spectrum penicillin, a quinolone or an aminoglycoside.

The choice of antibiotic is largely empiric, but Gram staining of the urine may be helpful. Once these patients have improved clinically, they can be switched to oral therapy based on the results of culture and sensitivity studies. 11 The total duration of therapy need not exceed 14 days, regardless of the initial bacteremia. Patients with persistent symptoms after three days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated by renal ultrasonography or computed tomography for evidence of urinary obstruction or abscess. In the small percentage of patients who relapse after a two-week course, a repeated six-week course is usually curative.
11. Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling Foley catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens. Patients with mild to moderate infections may be treated with one of the oral quinolones, usually for 10 to 14 days.

Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary in patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications. 29 Although amoxicillin is frequently suggested as the agent of choice, E. coli is now commonly resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin and cephalexin. Thus, treatment should be based on the results of susceptibility tests. Nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may also be used; however, caution should be exercised in the third trimester because the sulfonamides compete with bilirubin binding in the newborn.

### Management of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^c557e1f5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review recent publications concerning the management of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), including the issues of diagnosis and prevention. Articles reviewed include the various guidelines concerning CAUTI released recently by multiple organizations.

Recent Findings

There has been a recent upsurge of interest in prevention of CAUTI and a proliferation of guidelines in this area. Social changes in US government reimbursement to hospitals and public reporting of hospital-acquired infections may underlie this interest. The awareness that CAUTI and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria are distinct conditions is increasing, but unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria remains quite prevalent. The focus in recent CAUTI literature is on prevention, often through strategies to minimize urinary catheter use. Very little new evidence is available to guide diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Summary

Interpretation of many studies of CAUTI is impeded by the failure to distinguish between symptomatic CAUTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria in the study outcomes. This distinction currently relies on clinical symptoms and is not easily made, even with the help of various guidelines. Many aspects of the management of CAUTI merit further study, and the current interest in CAUTI is likely to lead to exciting advances in this field.

### Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia [^08dcd359]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The rising global incidence of gram-negative bacteremia contributes to significant morbidity, mortality, and challenges in clinical management. The optimal treatment duration for gram-negative bacteremia has received increased attention in recent years. While randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have explored this topic, there is a lack of emphasis on the appropriate timing for transitioning from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotic therapy. Early transition could lead to reduced hospital stays, lower health care costs, and improved patient quality of life. Additionally, switching to oral therapy may help mitigate the risks associated with IV catheters while also facilitating an earlier return to regular activities of daily living.

Few studies have directly compared transitioning to oral therapy with continuing IV therapy. A multicenter cohort study compared early oral stepdown therapy and continued IV therapy for gram-negative bacteremia and found comparable outcomes in 30-day all-cause mortality. Another cohort study focused solely on urinary tract–related gram-negative bacteremia, finding similar treatment failure rates but shorter hospital stays with early oral therapy. Currently, 2 ongoing, open-label RCTs are evaluating the safety and efficacy of early oral antibiotic stepdown in patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. The INVEST trialrandomizes patients to either early oral stepdown within 3 days or continuation of IV antibiotic therapy for at least 24 hours after randomization before clinical reassessment. The SOAB trialrandomized patients to either early oral stepdown between days 3 to 5 or continuation of IV treatment for the entire treatment duration. Both trials have excluded patients with complicated gram-negative bacteremia, defined as polymicrobial infection, uncontrolled focus of infection, infection with hard-to-treat gram-negative bacteria, and being immunocompromised or having terminal illness. In both trials, clinical stability, defined as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable, was required for eligibility. The upcoming GOAT trialwill compare oral antibiotic stepdown within 5 days with continuing IV treatment for the duration of therapy but will exclude only patients with polymicrobial infection or immunosuppression or who are actively receiving vasopressors.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^b2a79a19]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in the absence of urinary symptoms, is a common clinical finding that often warrants a decision about whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy. There are few indications to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria, and inappropriate treatment contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In 2019, the Infectious Diseases Society of America revised its 2005 guidelines on asymptomatic bacteriuria, incorporating new evidence. The updated guidelines recommend screening and appropriate treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and in individuals undergoing endourological procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The guidelines recommend against screening and treatment in infants and children; healthy adults, including nonpregnant pre- and postmenopausal women; and patients with diabetes mellitus, long-term indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injuries. The guidelines also recommend against screening and treatment in patients undergoing nonurological surgery, patients who have had a kidney transplant more than one month prior, recipients of other solid organ transplants, or those with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury. Although delirium in older adults can be caused by a urinary tract infection, the guidelines recommend that patients with delirium and no urinary or systemic symptoms be assessed for other causes of delirium, rather than initiating treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treatment has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.

### Importance of urinary tract infection to antibiotic use among hospitalized patients [^cb9c26cc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria receive extended courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic use was analyzed in patients admitted to the hospital with urinary tract infection. Strategies to optimize antibiotic use for such patients are discussed and include implementing a process whereby a urine culture is automatically performed if a urinalysis result suggests infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^5887d644]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-Negative infections [^2f20a229]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, carbapenem-resistant, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, although the likelihood of susceptibility to any of these agents is low. Administer a single dose of an aminoglycoside, oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only), colistin, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol as alternative options.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — screening and treatment recommendations: In pregnant women, we recommend screening for and treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest a urine culture collected at one of the initial visits early in pregnancy. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Remarks note that the optimal duration of therapy will vary depending on the antimicrobial given; the shortest effective course should be used.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnant women — screening and treatment are advised, with culture timing and therapy duration specified. In pregnant women, we recommend screening for and treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and we suggest a urine culture collected at 1 of the initial visits early in pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to inform a recommendation for or against repeat screening during the pregnancy after an initial negative culture or after treatment of an initial episode. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Tobramycin sulfate (tobramycin) [^fb13dd37]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli, Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, S. aureus, Providencia spp, and Citrobacter spp

Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use.

Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram-negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box.

### About Gram-negative bacteria… [^6a8a20a0]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Gram-negative bacteria can cause serious infections in healthcare settings.
- Infections from these bacteria are becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to antimicrobial resistance.
- To prevent these infections, healthcare providers should follow recommended infection control practices. Overview Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis in healthcare settings. These infections can be hard to treat since the bacteria causing them can become resistant to common antibiotics. Resistance to most or all antibiotics has also been reported. Types Prevention
- Patients and caregivers should follow CDC guidelines on patient safety.
- Healthcare providers and facilities should follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.

Testing CDC collaborates with laboratories to identify and recommend tests to detect gram-negative bacteria. Keep Reading: Laboratory Testing for Gram Negative. Treatment Gram-negative infections can be difficult to treat. Some types of gram-negative bacteria can become resistant to multiple drugs, including antibiotics like carbapenems. What CDC is doing
- Providing testing to identify antimicrobial resistance cases, measure resistance and track transmission in a healthcare setting through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network.
- Tracking gram-negative bacteria infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
- Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
- Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
- Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and slow the spread of resistant germs.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^16b6bc0f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Estimated undertreatment of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in eight low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [^d3225206]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

We made some adjustments to the total CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths from the GRAM study to ensure that our estimates were as conservative as possible and accurately reflected the deaths of patients from infections that required treatment with an agent with specific activity against CRGN bacterial infections. The first adjustment attempted to account for the fact that, for the selected countries, the literature shows that although resistance remains high, up to 30% of carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa isolates might be sensitive to other antibiotics (eg, fluoroquinolones). Thus, we conservatively removed 40% of the deaths caused by carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa from the total CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths. For the second adjustment, we excluded a proportion of deaths related to complicated urinary tract infections (UTI), primarily to exclude deaths of patients with infections that could be treated with aminoglycoside monotherapy in line with current guidelines; data from the literature suggest that up to 40% of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria in LMICs are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Thus, for this second adjustment, we assumed that of the 40% of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria potentially susceptible to aminoglycosides, 85% could have been successfully treated with aminoglycoside monotherapy, and we removed 35% (ie, 40% of 85%) of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria from further calculations (further details are in the appendix [p 1]).

Next, we estimated an overall case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. We began by pooling available estimates from the literature, to calculate an overall distribution of CRGN bacterial infection types considered the major drivers of mortality according to the GRAM study(ie, bloodstream infections, lower respiratory tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, and UTIs). We multiplied these estimates by literature-based case fatality rates for each of these infection types (table 1) to obtain an overall weighted case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. Due to the low availability of high-quality data in LMICs, estimates for infection distribution and case fatality rates were drawn from data for adults in high-income countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia; these infection-specific case fatality rates were drawn from estimated case fatality rates for treated adults identified as having a CRGN infection (predominantly carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella). We tested variation in the overall case fatality rate with robustness tests.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^fb0d862e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^99949f99]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

### Resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections [^aecdc483]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (UTI) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. Older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence of resistant bacteria isolated from UTI. Resistant isolates are more frequent in long-term care populations than the community. Resistant isolates include common uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Providencia stuartii. Isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. The increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. Therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. Antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. In particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. Where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. This permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. Where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. Where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

### Personalised antimicrobial susceptibility testing with clinical prediction modelling informs appropriate antibiotic use [^03459677]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is a key weapon against antimicrobial resistance. Diagnostic microbiology laboratories use one-size-fits-all testing approaches that are often imprecise, inefficient, and inequitable. Here, we report a personalised approach that adapts laboratory testing for urinary tract infection to maximise the number of appropriate treatment options for each patient. We develop and assess susceptibility prediction models for 12 antibiotics on real-world healthcare data using an individual-level simulation study. When combined with decision thresholds that prioritise selection of World Health Organisation Access category antibiotics (those least likely to induce antimicrobial resistance), the personalised approach delivers more susceptible results (results that encourage prescription of that antibiotic) per specimen for Access category antibiotics than a standard testing approach, without compromising provision of susceptible results overall. Here, we show that personalised antimicrobial susceptibility testing could help tackle antimicrobial resistance by safely providing more Access category antibiotic treatment options to clinicians managing urinary tract infection.

Endourologic procedures and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — For endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma, we recommend screening for and treating ASB prior to surgery (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest obtaining a urine culture prior to the procedure and prescribing targeted antimicrobial therapy rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest a short course (1 or 2 doses) rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.
