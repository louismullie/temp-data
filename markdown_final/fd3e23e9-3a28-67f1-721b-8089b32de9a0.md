## Question

toxin and tampons

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between toxins and tampons, specifically how tampons relate to toxic shock syndrome and what the evidence shows about risk, mechanisms, and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity of toxic shock syndrome and its subtypes. Then, I should verify the toxin involved and the pathophysiology. Next, I will examine the historical and contemporary epidemiology linking tampons to menstrual TSS. After that, I need to appraise the quality of evidence and quantify risk factors, including duration of use and absorbency. Then, I should review mechanistic explanations and reconcile conflicting data. Finally, I will translate this into practical, evidence-based counseling and highlight knowledge gaps and limitations, making sure I cite the best available sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Toxic shock syndrome is a severe, toxin-mediated illness characterized by fever, hypotension, rash, and multiorgan dysfunction, historically divided into menstrual and nonmenstrual forms, with menstrual TSS classically associated with tampon use in young women during menses [^7febc7a2] [^1eb5f5d9].

> I need to check the toxin and mechanism. The predominant driver of menstrual TSS is toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, a staphylococcal superantigen that bypasses conventional antigen processing, causes massive T-cell activation, and triggers a cytokine storm; host susceptibility hinges on vaginal colonization by TSST-1–producing Staphylococcus aureus and lack of neutralizing antibodies, which explains why only a small subset of colonized women develop disease [^1eb5f5d9] [^f9261800] [^cb3e548f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about incidence without anchoring to historical context. In the early 1980s, ultra-absorbent tampons were linked to a marked increase in menstrual TSS, with U.S. incidence peaking around 13.7 per 100,000; after removal of those products, standardized absorbency labeling, and public education, incidence fell to roughly 1–3 per 100,000 menstruating women, and contemporary estimates suggest menstrual TSS remains rare, on the order of 0.03–0.5 per 100,000 people overall, with mortality around 8% [^a8496f76] [^7febc7a2] [^1eb5f5d9].

> Next, I should review the quality of evidence linking tampon use characteristics to risk. The most informative recent study is a 2020 French nationwide case-control analysis of 55 cases and 126 controls that found independent associations between menstrual TSS and wearing a tampon for more than 6 consecutive hours and not reading or following instructions, with odds ratios around 2.0–2.3; overnight use beyond 8 hours carried an even higher univariate risk, though this did not remain significant in multivariable models, and the authors explicitly note limitations including recall bias and lack of absorbency data, so I should be cautious in overinterpreting exact thresholds [^9a383522] [^dbe24f87] [^00e3caf0].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic plausibility for duration and absorbency effects. Prolonged tampon use may create a microenvironment that enhances TSST-1 production, and higher-absorbency materials historically provided more surface area and oxygenation; in vitro and ex vivo models show TSST-1 can traverse vaginal mucosa at low levels and that biofilm conditions augment toxin production, while a randomized trial of tampons with glycerol monolaurate reduced S. aureus counts and exotoxin levels, supporting the concept that local conditions modulate risk, though clinical translation remains limited [^a513a416] [^962125cc] [^b5f1e7fa].

> I should double-check conflicting data and historical critiques. Earlier epidemiologic studies faced ascertainment and recall biases, and a classic JAMA critique argued that the etiologic role of tampons was not definitively proven due to these methodological flaws; nonetheless, convergent lines of evidence from case-control studies, microbiologic data, and regulatory changes that reduced incidence collectively support a causal contribution of tampon use, particularly with high absorbency and prolonged wear, even if the exact magnitude of risk is uncertain [^af22efca] [^7febc7a2] [^a8496f76].

> Let me consider host susceptibility, because this modifies absolute risk. A large North American colonization study found that about 9% of menstruating women are vaginally colonized with S. aureus, and while most have protective antibodies to TSST-1, a minority lack them, with notable racial differences in seropositivity; this helps explain why menstrual TSS remains rare despite widespread tampon use and underscores that colonization plus absent neutralizing antibodies are necessary but not sufficient conditions for disease [^aa5d2a40] [^cb3e548f].

> I will now examine practical counseling and prevention. Based on current evidence and expert guidance, I should advise using the lowest absorbency needed, changing tampons every 4–6 hours whenever feasible, avoiding overnight use beyond 6–8 hours, and reading and following package instructions; these measures align with the case-control findings and with broader public health messaging that emphasizes education and adherence to labeled use [^9a383522] [^b0ec05a6] [^087f7fca].

> But wait, what if patients ask about alternatives like menstrual cups. Systematic reviews suggest menstrual cups have a low reported TSS risk with only a handful of case reports, yet absence of denominator data precludes direct comparison with tampons; importantly, cups do not appear to increase overall infection risk and may reduce bacterial vaginosis in some settings, though users should still maintain strict hygiene and avoid prolonged retention [^c7d60afb] [^164b8a2c] [^87c40e9f].

> Next, I should review clinical recognition and management, because early treatment changes outcomes. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in menstruating patients with fever, rash, hypotension, and multiorgan involvement, perform a pelvic exam to identify and remove retained tampons or other foreign bodies, and initiate aggressive supportive care with fluids, vasopressors as needed, and antibiotics that include an antitoxin agent such as clindamycin; IVIG may be considered in severe cases, though high-quality pediatric RCT data are limited [^d098266d] [^b16e810c] [^242deef6].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. The best risk-factor evidence is observational and subject to recall and selection biases, absorbency details were not captured in the key case-control study, and many contemporary users employ modern materials with standardized absorbency, so the generalizability of historical risk estimates to current products is uncertain; nonetheless, the directionality of risk with prolonged use and poor adherence to instructions is biologically plausible and consistent across studies [^00e3caf0] [^9a383522] [^7febc7a2].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is balanced: tampons are not inherently "toxic", but their use can facilitate menstrual TSS in the presence of TSST-1–producing S. aureus colonization and absent protective antibodies, with risk amplified by prolonged wear and high absorbency; incidence is low but not negligible, and risk is largely modifiable by adherence to use instructions, timely changes, and choosing the lowest effective absorbency, which together justify continued vigilance and education rather than alarmism or avoidance of tampons altogether [^1eb5f5d9] [^9a383522] [^087f7fca].

---

Tampons can increase the risk of **toxic shock syndrome (TSS)** [^1eb5f5d9], a rare but serious condition caused by **TSST-1 toxin** from Staphylococcus aureus [^a8496f76]. Risk rises with **prolonged use (> 6–8 hours)** [^9a383522], high absorbency, and poor hygiene [^b0ec05a6]; modern tampons are safer than 1980s formulations, but TSS still occurs [^7febc7a2]. Use the lowest absorbency, change every 4–8 hours, and never leave a tampon in overnight [^b0ec05a6]; if you have fever, rash, vomiting, or dizziness, remove the tampon and seek care immediately [^23a1a4be].

---

## Toxins associated with tampons

The primary toxin linked to tampon use is **toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)** [^1eb5f5d9], a superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus [^a8496f76]. TSST-1 causes massive T-cell activation and cytokine release, leading to shock and multi-organ failure [^f9261800]. Streptococcal superantigens (e.g. streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins) can also cause TSS but are less commonly associated with tampons [^a8496f76].

---

## Historical context and incidence

TSS rose in the early 1980s with **high-absorbency tampons** containing synthetic fibers (e.g. carboxymethylcellulose) [^7febc7a2]; incidence peaked at ~13.7/100,000 in 1980 [^a8496f76]. After these products were withdrawn and absorbency standardized, incidence fell to ~1–3/100,000 menstruating women in the US [^7febc7a2]. Recent data suggest a stable incidence of ~1/100,000 in young women, with mortality around 8% [^1eb5f5d9] [^23a1a4be].

---

## Risk factors associated with tampon use

Several factors increase **TSS risk** with tampons:

- **Prolonged use**: Wearing a tampon > 6–8 hours doubles risk [^9a383522] [^b0ec05a6].
- **High absorbency**: Higher absorbency increases risk; use the lowest effective absorbency [^087f7fca].
- **Poor hygiene**: Not washing hands, improper insertion, or forgetting to remove tampons increases risk [^9a383522].
- **Lack of education**: Not reading or following instructions increases risk [^9a383522] [^3e2ccbbb].

---

## Mechanisms of toxin production and absorption

Tampons can alter the vaginal environment, increasing **S. aureus growth and TSST-1 production** [^3ca4827b]. Prolonged use allows toxin accumulation and mucosal absorption [^a513a416]. TSST-1 can penetrate the vaginal mucosa, causing systemic effects even without invasive infection [^a513a416].

---

## Clinical manifestations of toxic shock syndrome

TSS presents with **sudden onset** of:

- **High fever** (≥ 39°C)
- **Hypotension** (systolic < 90 mmHg)
- **Diffuse rash** (sunburn-like, often desquamates)
- **Multi-organ involvement**: GI (vomiting, diarrhea), renal (oliguria), hepatic (jaundice), CNS (confusion), hematologic (thrombocytopenia) [^1eb5f5d9] [^d098266d]

Early symptoms are nonspecific (fever, chills, malaise, myalgias), so **high suspicion is critical** in menstruating tampon users [^d098266d].

---

## Preventive measures and guidelines

To minimize **TSS risk**:

- **Change tampons every 4–8 hours**: Never exceed 8 hours [^7febc7a2].
- **Use the lowest absorbency**: Match to flow; avoid super-absorbent unless necessary [^087f7fca].
- **Wash hands**: Before and after insertion.
- **Alternate products**: Use pads or menstrual cups, especially at night [^b0ec05a6].
- **Recognize symptoms**: Remove tampon immediately if fever, rash, vomiting, or dizziness occurs [^23a1a4be].

---

## Regulatory and safety standards

Tampons are regulated as medical devices; the FDA requires standardized absorbency labeling, biocompatibility testing, and **mandatory TSS warnings** in packaging [^489e587c]. Modern tampons are primarily cotton/rayon and are safer than 1980s formulations, but risk is not eliminated [^7febc7a2].

---

## Alternative menstrual products

Menstrual cups and pads are alternatives; cups have a low reported TSS risk but require **strict hygiene** and regular emptying [^c7d60afb]. Pads eliminate internal risk but may be less convenient for some users.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Tampons can increase **TSS risk** via TSST-1, but risk is low and modifiable with proper use [^1eb5f5d9]. Use the lowest absorbency, change every 4–8 hours, and seek care promptly for early symptoms [^9a383522]. Modern tampons are safer, but vigilance remains essential [^7febc7a2].

2 Methods

2.1 Study design and participants

To examine the relationship between tampon use and MTSS in women between 12–30 years of age, a nationwide, case-control study was performed with incident cases in metropolitan areas of France. The case population included women with a clinical diagnosis of MTSS that was reported to the CNRS of Lyon between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017, and which included vaginal detection of TSST-1-producing S. aureus strain and clonal complex (CC) assignation by the CNRS. All suspected cases were assessed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) diagnostic criteria. Cases meeting all five clinical criteria were considered confirmed. Those lacking a single criterion were considered probable. Confirmed and probable cases involving tampons, and with symptom onset occurring within three days of the beginning or end of menses, were eligible for inclusion. Control participants comprised women with no past history of MTSS, of 12–30 years of age, and who used tampons as menstrual protection (Data collection and control of potential bias in the Supplement). They were enrolled between February 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. Cases suspected of using only menstrual cups (one woman during the inclusion time) or controls suspected of using only pads or menstrual cups were excluded.

Applying our eligibility criteria, a total of 78 cases were identified from the CNRS database. During the same period, only two MTSS cases of women age > 30 were notified to the laboratory; they were not included in our study. All eligible participants (and their mothers, if the patient was below 18 years old) were invited by mail or phone to participate in the study on tampon usage and MTSS. Of the 78 cases contacted, 55 agreed to participate, yielding a 70% positive response rate. Cases were retrospectively contacted in February 2017 and asked to fill the questionnaire according to the use and knowledge they had before they developed the MTSS. Healthy women nationwide were enrolled in the control population by IFOP©, a professional survey institute specializing in national surveys conducted in the general French population. Using the non-probabilistic "quota" method 126 participants of 12–30 years of age were contacted and completed the questionnaire on tampon usage and MTSS (Data collection and control of potential bias in the Supplement). The case-control study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines.

Summary

Background

Menstrual tampons are widely used in western countries. Indirect evidence suggests that tampon misuse could be associated with an increased risk of menstrual toxic shock syndrome (MTSS). The aim of this study was to determine what characteristics of tampon use are associated with increased risk of menstrual toxic shock syndrome (MTSS).

Methods

A nationwide, case-control study in France, was conducted with women that use tampons with MTSS diagnoses according to the CDC diagnostic criteria (n = 55, from January 2011, to December 2017) and a control group of women with no MTSS history (n = 126, from February to December 2017). Information regarding tampon use during a 6-month period was collected. Associations between tampon use and MTSS were assessed using logistic regression models stratified by residential area.

Findings

Compared to controls, women diagnosed with MTSS more frequently reported maximum tampon wear of > 6 h (62% vs. 41%; P = 0.02), overnight tampon use (77% vs. 54%; P = 0.006), and neither read nor followed tampon instructions in case of reading (65% vs. 42%; P = 0.006). In univariate analysis, MTSS risk was two-fold higher with tampon use for > 6 consecutive hours (odds ratio, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.2–4.5]), and three-fold higher with tampon use during sleep for > 8 h (odds ratio, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.4–7.7]). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only maximum tampon use for > 6 h (odds ratio, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.04–3.98]), and neither read nor followed the tampon instructions in case of reading (odds ratio, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.15–4.39]) were independently associated with MTSS.

Interpretation

Our study suggests that the risk of MTSS was associated with using tampons for more than 6 h, overnight tampon use during sleep, and neither read nor followed tampon insertion instructions in case of reading.

4 Discussion

The present study screened for a potential relationship between tampon use and MTSS. Our results show that MTSS is still a severe disease, and suggest that increased MTSS risk was associated with using a tampon for over 6 consecutive hours (OR = 2.33), overnight tampon use (OR = 3.22), and lack of education about tampon use. These findings suggest that MTSS risk may increase starting at tampon use ≥ 6 h, rather than from 8 h, and that women could be advised to wear a tampon for a maximum of ≤ 6 consecutive hours rather than the currently recommended maximum of ≤ 8 h. Although prior studies have investigated the impact of tampon wearing duration on MTSS occurrence, this topic has not been addressed recently, with the currently marketed tampon varieties. The conclusions of prior studies for maximum hours of tampon wearing time were mainly based on the number of tampons to use per day in patients and in vitro experiments. They were in close agreement with our present findings. Our results specify (in number of hours) when the risk increase begins and additionally support the current recommendation to use sanitary napkins or menstrual panties rather than tampons during the night, especially for women who sleep for more than 6 h.

Compliance of women with FDA recommendationsand labelling instructions for tampon use are essential for MTSS prevention. Yet, our present results indicated that while tampon wearing time recommendations are usually followed by women, in keeping with the findings of previous studies, a large majority of respondents did not follow one or more of the labelling recommendations. Our study points out a persistent level of tampon misuse practices, and the need to promote safer tampon use. The surveyed also revealed that women had a low level of knowledge about MTSS. To date, few studies have investigated women's knowledge of MTSS, and many of the available studies were performed in the 1980s. In 1985, a survey reported a lack of knowledge regarding MTSS among adolescents. Our present findings suggest that this issue persists today, and may be even more prevalent than previously reported.

The main strength of this nationwide case-control study is that is exploring a question that has been scarcely investigated: which tampon use practices have an impact on MTSS occurrence? This topic is growing concern due to the apparent rise of MTSS cases reported in US, France and elsewhere. In this context, our results highlight important avenues for improving MTSS prevention.

This case-control study has several potential limitations. The invitation to participate in the study on tampon usage and MTSS and the questionnaire may have influenced women's answers on tampon use and MTSS. There was no stratification by age for the control inclusion. The absence of medical history of potential MTSS for the control population was established by an interview only based on the absence of hospitalization for fever of shock during tampon use. However the disease is so uncommon that it was very unlikely to include women with history of MTSS as control. Only women vaginally colonized by TSST-1 producing S. aureus and with no protective antibodies against TSST-1 are really at risk of MTSS. It was unfortunately not possible to include these criteria for the selection of controls. Time of inclusion between control and case differs. Cases were retrospectively contacted in February 2017 while they developed their MTSS between January 2011 to December 2017. Cases were asked to fill the questionnaire according to the use and knowledge they had before they developed the MTSS. The time lag between the interview and MTSS onset could be greater than the 6 months used for control, and may have introduced recall bias for cases. However, except for "Forgot to remove a tampon before inserting a new one" and "Read the instruction provided in tampon pack", no significant association between time-lag and variables were observed in cases, suggesting that length of time lag had little effect on the quality of their reporting and the analysis. Additionally, no information about tampon absorbency was collected.

Our findings suggest an increase risk of MTSS in women using a tampon for a duration starting from over 6 consecutive hours, overnight tampon use, and with lack of education about tampon use. There remains a need for further epidemiological research to confirm ours results and to more precisely identify MTSS facilitators and to fine-tune the MTSS prevention measures that will best improve women's health.

Comparison between cases and controls revealed differences in median of maximum tampon-wearing time (8, [IQR, 5–8.5] h vs. 6 [IQR: 4–8] h; P < 0.05) (Figure S1), in the percentage having a maximum tampon-wearing time of > 6 h (62% vs. 41%; P = 0.01), and in the percentage using tampons during sleep > 8 h (77% vs. 54%; P = 0.006). Notably, cases were less likely to know the MTSS risk of tampon use (24% vs. 41%; P = 0.03), to have read the tampon instructions (58% vs. 78%; P = 0.01), and to read and follow the tampon instructions (35% vs. 58%; P = 0.006). No difference in educational level or socioeconomic status was observed between the two groups.

This study was reviewed and accepted by the ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Est IV, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France, N° L16-176). Written consent was obtained from all participants, or from the parents/guardians of participants under 18 years of age.

2.2 Procedures

For this study, the main exposure was tampon use. Upon finding no standard definition in the literature how tampons should be used, we relied on the usage precautions cited in the guidance document and the recommendations of the FDA. The variable "tampon use" was evaluated using the following criteria: use of tampon outside of menses, forgetting to remove a tampon before inserting a new one, using a tampon with an absorption level not matching the menstruation flow, and/or using a tampon for over 8 h. Additionally it was decided to test the impact of wearing a tampon for over 6 h, which is frequently cited by practitioners.

Data were retrospectively collected using a specially-designed, self-administered, anonymous questionnaire (Questionnaire in the Supplement), which was similar for both cases and controls. It included questions regarding the terms of tampon use during the 6 months prior to MTSS for cases, and during the 6 months before the interview for controls. The questionnaire also included questions regarding how the women had learned how to use tampons; questions to evaluate their level of knowledge about MTSS; and questions about demographic data, such as age and residential area.

The final model obtained from multivariate analysis contained two independent variables without interaction: "maximum wearing time of > 6 h" (OR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.04–3.98]; P = 0.04), and "neither read nor followed the tampon instructions in case of reading" (OR, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.15–4.39]; P = 0.02). Results' summary of the complete multivariate regression analyses and details on the variable definition are reported Table S2 in supplement.

Education regarding tampon use was strongly related to tampon misuse; therefore, an in-depth analysis of tampon education was performed in the control population (Table 3). With regards to the usage precautions cited in the guidance document and the FDA recommendations, women educated by their mothers and other relatives were only less inclined to use a tampon when they were planning to sleep (47% vs. 66%; P = 0.04). Women who read the instructions from a tampon package reported less frequent tampon use for > 8 h (9.6% versus 32%; P = 0.02) and during the night (47% vs. 75%; P = 0.02). Women who indicated that they read and followed the tampon instructions reported a lower rate of tampon use for > 8 h (9.6% vs. 25%; P = 0.03) and of tampon use due to anticipation outside of menses (22% vs. 42%; P = 0.03). In our control population, education from a health practitioner had no impact on tampon proper use, nor did media access (e.g. websites, books, and journals). None of the reported education was associated with a better understanding of the link between tampon use and MTSS (data non shown).

### Association of characteristics of tampon use with menstrual toxic shock syndrome in France [^3ca4827b]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

At least three conditions are considered necessary for MTSS development: vaginal colonization by a TSST-1-producing S. aureus strain, a vaginal environment conducive to TSST-1 production due to the use of intra-vaginal protection during menses, and the absence of neutralization antibodies against TSST-1. Since western populations exhibit a high prevalence (60–80%) of tampon exposure, MTSS might remain a significant public health issue. Among women who use tampons, 1–5% are vaginally colonized with TSST-1-producing S. aureus, and 10–20% of women have no protective antibodies against TSST-1. The low incidence of MTSS suggests that only a minor subset of these predisposed women will actually develop MTSS, and that other factors are involved in disease occurrence, such as how tampons are used, which was pointed out during the outbreak in the 1980s with tampons made of carboxymethylcellulose fibers. However, there are limited published studies regarding the association between MTSS and the use of currently marketed tampons made of cotton or cellulose fibers, leaving many unanswered questions.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the use of tampons in women who developed MTSS. Our secondary objectives were to evaluate education regarding tampon use. The present results may offer practical guidance for the development of preventive public health strategies.

Clinical and microbial characteristics of 55 French patients with menstrual toxic shock syndrome (2011–2017).

Table 2
Comparison of between case and control populations.

The 126 controls ranged from 13 to 30 years of age, with a median age of 18.0 years (IQR, 16.0–24.8 years) (Table 2). Twenty (26%) reported using a tampon for over 8 h, and 52 (41%) for over 6 h during the day. The median duration of maximum tampon wear was 6 h (IQR, 4–8 h). Tampon usage when planning to sleep > 8 h was reported by 65/120 controls (54%). Regarding absorbency choice, 41 controls (33%) indicated that they did not select a tampon with an absorption level corresponding to the intensity of their menstruation. Anticipatory use outside of menses was reported by 38 controls (30%), and 12 (10%) reported having forgotten to remove a tampon before inserting a new one. Concerning the level of knowledge about MTSS, 48 controls (38%) had heard about MTSS, and 52 (41%) knew that improper use of tampons could cause MTSS. Only 56 (44%) had received initial education before their first tampon use. From this initial education, only 4/56 (7%) learned the early warning signs of MTSS, and 2/56 (4%) learned what to do if these signs occurred. Mothers and other relatives were cited as the primary source of information by 77 controls (61%), followed by self-learning using media (internet, books, journals…) for 35 controls (29%). Only 13 controls (10%) reported having been educated by a health practitioner. Ninety-eight controls (78%) had read the instruction form included in the tampon pack, and 73 (58%) stated that they read and followed those instructions.

### Association of characteristics of tampon use with menstrual toxic shock syndrome in France [^7febc7a2]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute onset illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains that can produce superantigenic exotoxins, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). TSS is characterized by non-specific symptoms, such as fever, cutaneous signs (rash followed by desquamation), digestive disorders, myalgia, and hypotension. While TSS is often initially self-limited, it is a potentially serious disease that can rapidly lead to multiple-organ failure and death. TSS treatment requires early ICU involvement for fluid resuscitation and possible vasopressors, and intravenous antibiotics with anti-staphylococcal agents and with anti-toxinic antibiotic such as clindamycin.

TSS is subdivided into two major categories: non-menstrual TSS that occurs during the course of suppurative staphylococcal infections, and menstrual toxic shock syndrome (MTSS) that occurs in young women with vaginal colonization of TSST-1-producing S. aureus and who use tampons or other intra-vaginal devices.

MTSS received attention in the early 1980s, upon the description of cases and deaths among healthy women using tampons made of high-absorbency carboxymethylcellulose fibers. Following the removal of these specific tampons from the market and their replacement with tampons made of cellulose or cotton fibers, the implementation of mandatory labelling, and improved patient education, the annual MTSS incidence in the United States (US) decreased from 10 cases to approximately 1–3 cases per 100,000 menstruating women. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the inclusion of instructions that limit wear-time per tampon to no more than 8 h and advise against the overnight use of tampons. There has been no active worldwide surveillance of this disease since 1986, making assessment of its incidence challenging. A study conducted in the US suggested that TSS incidence increased by 18% from 2002 to 2003. The same trend has been reported in France since 2003 by the Centre National de Reference des Staphylocoques (CNRS). However, no studies have investigated this apparent rise of MTSS, its potential reasons, or determinants.

5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Cases of TSS have been reported by Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

5.3 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Discontinue Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (> 8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.

3 Results

Base on the CDC definition, 30 patients (55%) met the definition for confirmed TSS and 25 (45%) for probable TSS. The demographic, the clinical and microbial characteristics, and the outcome of the 55 cases are summarized in Table 1. Cases age ranged from 12 to 30 years of age, with a median age of 17.9 years (IQR, 16.0–21.7 years). None of the patients had co-morbidities. Medical care in an intensive care unit was required for 47 patients (85%). No patient died from MTSS. TSST-1 producing S. aureus isolates recovered from tampon or vaginal specimens were methicillin susceptible and belonged predominantly to the same clonal complex CC30. Among the 55 cases, 14 (24%) reported using a tampon for over 8 h, and 34 (62%) for over 6 h during the day (Table 2). The median duration of maximum tampon wear was 8 h (IQR, 5–8.5 h). Tampon usage when planning to sleep > 8 h was reported by 40/52 cases (77%). Regarding absorbency choice, 23/53 cases (43%) indicated that they did not select a tampon with an absorption level corresponding to the intensity of their menstruation. Anticipatory use outside of menses was reported by 14 cases (24%), and 4 cases (7%) reported having forgotten to remove a tampon before inserting a new one. Concerning the level of knowledge about MTSS, 19 cases (35%) had heard about MTSS, and 13/54 (24%) knew that improper use of tampons could cause MTSS. Only 21 (38%) had received initial MTSS education before their first tampon use. From this initial education, only 1/21 (5%) learned the early warning signs of MTSS, and 1/21 (5%) learned what to do if these signs occurred. Mothers and other relatives were cited as the primary source of information by 40 cases (73%), followed by self-learning using media (internet, books, journals…) for 16 cases (29%). Only 7 cases (13%) reported having been educated by a health practitioner. Thirty-two cases (58%) had read the instruction form included in the tampon pack, and only 19 (35%) stated that they read and followed those instructions. To avoid information bias, the impact of the time-lag between exposure and interview on the answers was examined. Only 3/19 variables were associated with the time lag: "Forgot to remove a tampon before inserting a new one"(p = 0.04), "Read the instruction provided in tampon pack" (0.02) and "Had initial education" (0.015).

### Association of characteristics of tampon use with menstrual toxic shock syndrome in France [^046cd534]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Safer tampon use and improved knowledge of MTSS are closely linked to learning modalities. Our present data suggest that education on tampon use is still deficient in France. Most notably, it was observed that the majority of women did not receive initial education about tampons prior to use and this education was frequently disconnected to the risk of MTSS. It is important that adequate menstrual hygiene habits be formed at the beginning of adolescence, as such habits will influence adult behaviors. To obtain knowledge about tampon use, adolescents frequently discussed the topic with their mothers or self-trained themselves by reading tampon labels, as previously described. However, the high level of misuse practices suggests that these learning modalities are likely insufficient to teach women about tampon use and MTSS. It was discovered that health professionals were minimally utilized as sources of knowledge about tampon use, despite their in-depth knowledge about MTSS and greater ability to influence behaviours by providing adequate information. Overall, our study results confirmed findings from earlier studies and the absence of progress. Education about tampon use still needs to be improved.

### Toxic shock syndrome: still a timely diagnosis [^be5a35b0]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, severe, toxin-mediated disease, characterized by fever, hypotension, and multiorgan system involvement. Toxic shock syndrome has made headlines because of its high associated morbidity and mortality rate in previously healthy young females. Incidence peaked in the early 1980s owing to increased usage of ultra-absorbent tampons. After improved patient education and tampon labeling, the incidence of menstrual TSS has declined.

Case

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl presented to an urgent care center with a 2-day history of fever, erythematous maculopapular rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise. She was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive. Investigations revealed thrombocytopenia, an elevated white count and lactate, and acute kidney injury, consistent with septic shock. Recent tampon usage with menstruation was reported, and a pelvic examination revealed purulent vaginal discharge. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit for antibiotic and vasopressor therapy. Vaginal swabs later tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus and TSS toxin-1.

Conclusions

Although the incidence of TSS has decreased in recent years, it is crucial that clinicians rapidly recognize and treat this life-threatening condition. Emergency physicians should always have a high index of suspicion for TSS in young females presenting without another obvious cause of shock. A pelvic examination should always be completed in these cases.

The most familiar etiology of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is that of menstruation and tampon use. Nonmenstrual TSS has been described in all types of wounds including postsurgical, respiratory infection, mucous membrane disruption, burns, and vesicular lesions caused by varicella and shingles. A case of TSS occurring in a diabetic male patient with foot blisters is presented. Early recognition by an infectious disease specialist and appropriate medical management led to complete recovery. There have been no reported cases of Staphylococcus aureus TSS originating in the foot to date.

### Toxic shock and tampons… [^af22efca]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The main evidence that tampons are an etiologic cofactor in the development of toxic shock syndrome comes from epidemiologic case-control studies. The patients chosen as cases in those studies were assembled from reports submitted to health agencies in response to publicity that may have influenced physicians to diagnose TSS and to submit reports particularly in situations where the patient was a menstruating tampon user. When the submitted reports were checked for fulfillment of TSS diagnostic criteria, and when cases or controls were asked about antecedent tampon usage, suitable scientific precautions were not used to achieve "blinded" objective decisions. Since these biases would have distorted the statistical relationships, the etiologic role of tampons in TSS has not been scientifically proved. Harvey M, Horwitz RI, Feinstein AR.

### Menstrual toxic shock syndrome: case report and systematic review of the literature [^1eb5f5d9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is a life-threatening disease caused by superantigen-producing Staphylococcus aureus. Incidence ranges from 0·03 to 0·50 cases per 100000 people, with overall mortality around 8%. In this Grand Round, we present the case of a previously healthy 23-year-old menstruating woman who was diagnosed with mTSS after she presented at our hospital with a septic condition for the second time. The diagnosis was confirmed by fulfilment of the clinical criteria outlined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; fever, rash, desquamation, hypotension, and multi-system involvement) as well as a nasal swab positive for the S aureus strain and presence of the gene encoding for toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1). In the early 1980s, when mTSS was first described, use of tampons was considered the main risk factor. Today, the complex interplay between pathogenic factors of S aureus, immunological mechanisms of the host, and changes in the vaginal ecosystem during menstruation has broadened current understanding of the disease, and the CDC criteria have appreciable limitations in everyday clinical practice.

### Clinical and molecular epidemiology of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in the United Kingdom [^a8496f76]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a life-threatening illness characterized by fever, rash, desquamation, organ dysfunction, and shock. In 1980, the use of highly absorbent tampons in the United States triggered an outbreak of menstrual TSS (mTSS) in young women, and TSS incidence peaked at 13.7/100,000 population. Changes in tampon manufacture and advice regarding tampon use helped halt the epidemic. TSS is a notifiable illness in the United States; in 2004–2014, average annual incidence varied from 0.03–0.05/100,000 population. In the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, staphylococcal TSS is not a notifiable illness, so the clinical, microbiological, and toxigenic features of TSS remain poorly described.

TSS is attributed to staphylococcal superantigens that cause massive T-cell activation and cytokine release. TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1) is associated with 95% of mTSS cases and 50% of TSS cases caused by nonmenstrual infective foci (nmTSS). Although 24 different staphylococcal superantigens have been described, including staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) and enterotoxin-like superantigens, SE types A, B, and C are implicated in remaining nmTSS cases, despite the lack of data from Europe.

TSST-1 is encoded by the gene tst, which is carried on mobile genetic elements (MGE) named staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) that lie within the S. aureus chromosome. SaPIs are linked to specific S. aureus genetic families, known as lineages. Within human S. aureus strains, tst is carried on SaPI1, SaPI2, and SaP68111. Known regulators of tst include the S. aureus accessory gene regulator operon (agr) via the effector molecule RNAIII, the staphylococcal respiratory response regulator AB (SrrAB), a glucose catabolite repressor CcpA, the staphylococcal accessory regulator A, σ B and the SaeRS 2-component system.

### Menstrual TSS remains a dangerous threat [^087f7fca]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

I provide commentary for an important epidemiology study by Billon et al.who address recent risk factors of menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS). mTSS came to the attention of the biomedical community dramatically in the early 1980s, through both publications and impressive news media attention. Mathematical modeling, based on percent of women lacking protective antibodies, percent of women with TSS Toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus vaginally, and amount of TSS Toxin required for sufficient vaginal transport, predicted the maximum incidence of mTSS should be near 10/100,000 (10/100K). This was indeed the case.

The prior studies showed the risk of mTSS was higher in young women who used tampons than in women who used menstrual pads. Risk increased along with increased tampon absorbency. In 1984, the last of the highest absorbency tampons were removed from the market as a result of convincing epidemiology, and particularly, a mTSS lawsuit (O'Gilvie v. International Playtex), with accompanying greatly reduced, yet still present, risk of mTSS. Regulatory standards were established worldwide resulting in uniform labeling of tampon absorbency and inclusion of package inserts. Women were advised they could reduce, but not eliminate, their likelihood of developing mTSS by not using tampons, using them intermittently, or if choosing to use tampons, using the lowest absorbency to control menstrual flow. With the above regulations and advice, the incidence of mTSS dropped to 1–2/100K.

### Evaluation of surveillance methods for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome [^96e898e3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe illness associated with toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus. First named in 1978, TSS has been associated with tampon use, intravaginal contraceptive devices, and skin infections, particularly after surgical procedures. In January 1980, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) initiated surveillance for TSS with active and passive components. The national incidence of TSS decreased during 1980–1996 after removal of high-absorbency tampons from the market and public awareness campaigns. In subsequent years, surveillance methods in Minnesota were changed to a solely passive surveillance system that relied on clinicians to report cases. MDH uses the 1997 case definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Atlanta, GA, USA) to determine case criteria for any probable TSS case (> 4 clinical criteria and laboratory criteria) considered reportable (Table 1). Given the complexity of the case definition, we suspected that TSS underreporting was likely.

Table 1
Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome case definitions*

*From the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
†Involving > 3 organ systems.

Recently, several factors, including increasing prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus that carries superantigens and the trend toward earlier menarche, suggested that the incidence of TSS might be increasing. Additionally, the number of requests for superantigen testing in the Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) area made to a reference microbiology laboratory that tests staphylococcal isolates from TSS cases increased during 2000–2003. To determine the incidence of TSS, active surveillance was initiated at all MSP area hospitals using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), codes assigned at hospital discharge. We compared passive surveillance reports with ICD-9 codes to determine an effective and efficient surveillance method for TSS.

### Toxic shock syndrome of a probable gynecologic source in an adolescent: a case report and review of the literature [^d895d97e]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute toxin-mediated infectious syndrome characterized by fever, hypotension, desquamation, and multiorgan involvement. It is a rare condition (incidence of 0.79/100,000 women), particularly in the adolescent population, and it may be menstrual (mTSS) or non-menstrual (nmTSS) in origin.

Case

A 15-year-old girl developed symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that worsened over a 3-day period. At initial presentation, she was hypotensive, febrile, and tachycardic. Her condition deteriorated and within 36 hours she required intubation, vasopressor treatment, and antibiotic therapy. Multiple sites were cultured but only the vaginal culture, which grew Staphylococcus aureus, was positive. Recent menses with tampon use was reported. She responded to aggressive therapy and was discharged home 3 weeks after initial presentation.

Summary and Conclusion

We describe a rare case of TSS of a probable gynecologic source in a 15-year-old female who successfully responded to aggressive intensive care treatment. mTSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an adolescent presenting with signs of septic shock, particularly if there is a recent history of tampon use. Early intervention is critical to improving survival.

### Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c7d60afb]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

A lack of affordable and effective menstrual products can result in leakage and chaffing in menstruating girls and women and can affect their health and education. The number of programmes that provide menstrual products to assist women and girls has increased. The menstrual cup, a receptacle used to collect menstrual blood flow, has received little attention, which in part might reflect concerns about insertable products as either culturally unacceptable or because of previous public health alerts associated with highly absorbent tampons (eg, toxic-shock syndrome). Information about leakage, acceptability, and safety of menstrual cups is needed to support organisations to make informed decisions and provide more comprehensive menstrual health education for girls and women. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Popline, Cinahl, Global Health database, Emerald, Google Scholar, and WorldWideScience from database inception on Nov 24, 2018, for publications in English using the keywords ("Menstrual Cup") AND "Review" to determine if a review of menstrual cups was available with information on leakage, acceptability, and safety. No review was identified, but a literature review on menstrual management in emergency contexts noted a lack of empirical evidence examining the introduction and testing of menstrual cups in humanitarian settings.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis examining girls' and women's experiences of menstrual cups, aggregating outcomes from 43 studies and 3319 participants who were asked about their use or willingness to use menstrual cups. We provide information on leakage compared with other products, a listing of known adverse events, and quantitative and qualitative information on acceptability in both high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries. We also assessed availability and prices of menstrual cups. Serious adverse events were not common, with five reported cases of toxic-shock syndrome. However, the number of menstrual cup users is unknown, so comparisons of risk of toxic-shock syndrome between menstrual cups, tampons, or the intravaginal diaphragm cannot be made. Although menstrual cups are manufactured and available globally, they are not commonly mentioned on websites offering educational materials on puberty for girls.

### Characterization of three Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a 17-year-old female who died of tampon-related toxic shock syndrome [^a7f97da5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

We report the identification and characterization of three Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from throat and vaginal cultures, as well as from an axillary abscess, of a 17-year-old female who died of tampon-related toxic shock syndrome. The three S. aureus isolates were unrelated as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The vaginal isolate was mecA, Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and staphylococcal enterotoxin B and C negative, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 positive, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec) untypeable, which was consistent with the clinical and autopsy findings that death was due to tampon-related toxic shock syndrome.

Figure 1: Likelihood of Developing a VTE

*CHC = combination hormonal contraception

Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY.

Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.

Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke.

Use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Infection risk did not appear to increase with use of a menstrual cup, and compared with pads and tampons, some studies indicated a decreased infection risk. A study in Kenya that detected lower bacterial vaginosis in users of a menstrual cup than in those who used sanitary pads postulated that the inert material of the menstrual cup might assist in maintaining a healthy vaginal pH and microbiome. Reported pain might relate to variations in the pelvic anatomy or wrong positioning of the menstrual cup leading to internal pressure. These factors could account for case reports of hydronephrosis or urinary incontinence. Allergies to the materials used in menstrual cups are not common, but women should be aware of the possibility and keep this in mind when starting use. However, for women who start using a menstrual cup, discrimination between discomfort as part of the normal learning curve and pathology might be difficult. Laboratory studies have shown contradicting results on the possibility of development of TSST-1 in the presence of menstrual cups, but clinical data in humans using cups have so far not shown reason for concern. The reported risk of toxic shock syndrome with use of a menstrual cup seems low, with five cases identified via our literature search. Although aggregated data on the number of menstrual cups sold or used is unavailable, we anticipate the number of girls and women using the 199 different brands globally is likely to be in the thousands. In the USA, the incidence of all types of toxic shock syndrome was around 0·8–3·4 per 100 000 population, whereas menstrual toxic shock syndrome was reported in 6–12 per 100 000 users of high-absorbency tampons in 1980. Similarly, among women using female barrier contraceptives, which also use medical-grade silicone or latex products, toxic shock syndrome is low (approximately 2·25 cases per 100 000 users per year).

### A randomized, double-blind study on the safety and immunogenicity of rTSST-1 variant vaccine: phase 2 results [^f9261800]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic infection with a Staphylococcus aureus strain capable of producing toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) may lead to the development of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, a critical illness, characterised by fulminant onset of fever, rash, hypotension and multi-organ failure. Driven by its superantigen characteristics, the exotoxin TSST-1 bypasses the conventional pathway of T-cell activation by interfering directly with the class II major histocompatibility complex on T-cells, causing subsequent release of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, TNF-α, TNF-β and IFN-γ, and inducing a cytokine storm. Toxic shock syndrome has been classified into two distinct entities: menstrual toxic shock syndrome and nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome. Albeit an overall low incidence of 0.03–0.5 per 100,000 people, menstrual toxic shock syndrome remains an important cause of morbidity among young women with a mortality of around 8%. Prerequisites include vaginal colonisation by a TSST-1-producing S. aureus strain, absence of protective antibodies against TSST-1 and prolonged tampon use, although TSST-1 may also be associated with use of menstrual cups. TSST-1 accounts for 85–100% of menstrual toxic shock cases, as opposed to 40–60% of nonmenstrual cases. However, 50% of cases of toxic shock syndrome are of nonmenstrual origin, extending the population at risk to men and children. While antibody titres against TSST1 increase with age, the absence of neutralising antibodies, especially in immunocompromised patients, children and young adults, predisposes them to an increased risk of severe disease. Nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome occurs frequently in conjunction with S. aureus -associated infections such as skin lesions, surgical-wound infections, postpartum infections, or osteomyelitis, amongst others, and is associated with a higher mortality than menstrual toxic shock syndrome.

Consequently, the development of a safe and effective vaccine targeting TSST-1 remains an unmet medical need. The rTSST-1v vaccine is a recombinant superantigen-based vaccine, containing a detoxified double-mutant rTSST-1 antigen. In a previous first-in-man trial, the rTSST-1v vaccine in a dose of up to 30 μg was safe, well-tolerated and yielded a strong antibody response. In this phase II trial, we aimed to further assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity with increasing doses of rTSST-1v in healthy subjects.

Figure 1: Likelihood of Developing a VTE

*CHC = combination hormonal contraception

Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY.

Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in Haloette, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.

Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke.

Use Haloette with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Cases of TSS have been reported by etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of Haloette and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

### Prevalence of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-producing Staphylococcus aureus and the presence of antibodies to this superantigen in menstruating women [^aa5d2a40]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is thought to be associated with colonization with toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1)-producing Staphylococcus aureus in women with insufficient antibody titers. mTSS has been associated with menstruation and tampon use, and although it is rare, the effects can be life threatening. It remains of interest because of the widespread use of tampons, reported to be about 70% of women in the United States, Canada, and much of Western Europe. This comprehensive study was designed to determine S. aureus colonization and TSST-1 serum antibody titers in 3,012 menstruating women in North America between the ages of 13 and 40, particularly among age and racial groups that could not be assessed reliably in previous small studies. One out of every four subjects was found to be colonized with S. aureus in at least one of three body sites (nose, vagina, or anus), with approximately 9% colonized vaginally. Eighty-five percent of subjects had antibody titers (≥ 1:32) to TSST-1, and the vast majority (81%) of teenaged subjects (13 to 18 years) had already developed antibody titers. Among carriers of toxigenic S. aureus, a significantly lower percentage of black women than of white or Hispanic women were found to have antibody titers (≥ 1:32) to TSST-1 (89% versus 98% and 100%). These findings demonstrate that the majority of teenagers have antibody titers (≥ 1:32) to TSST-1 and are presumed to be protected from mTSS. These findings also suggest that black women may be more susceptible to mTSS than previously thought.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Nuvaring) [^f1b3d328]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in NuvaRing, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.

Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke.

Use NuvaRing with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Cases of TSS have been reported by NuvaRing users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the NuvaRing users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of NuvaRing and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

5.3 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use NuvaRing in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Discontinue NuvaRing use if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

NuvaRing is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (> 8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.

### TSST-1 promotes colonization ofwithin the vaginal tract by activation of CD8T cells [^e442cf57]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately one-third of the human population is thought to be chronically colonized by Staphylococcus aureus either on the skin or other mucosal surfaces including the nasal and vaginal tracts. However, colonization by S. aureus can become harmful when natural host defenses are weakened leading to numerous diseases ranging from superficial skin infections to life-threatening invasive conditions including bacteremia, endocarditis, and pneumonia.

Apart from a broad range of infections, S. aureus can also cause specific toxin-mediated diseases, including toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is triggered by the bacterial superantigens (SAgs). SAgs are secreted exotoxins that short circuit the interaction between major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) molecules and T-cell receptors (TCRs), which may lead to uncontrolled T-cell activation, excessive cytokine production, and systemic inflammation known as TSS. Staphylococcal TSS can be distinguished into two subgroups where the non-menstrual form can occur from essentially any S. aureus infection and can be caused by different SAgs; however, the menstrual form of TSS (mTSS) is usually related to the use of menstrual hygiene products, such as tampons, and occurs in women who are vaginally colonized by S. aureus that specifically produce the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Nevertheless, little is known about how TSST-1 functions within the S. aureus life cycle.

### Menstrual technology innovations and the implications for heavy menstrual bleeding [^91262b56]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTERNAL ABSORBENT PRODUCTS: TAMPONS AND SPONGES

The disposable tampon has a legacy of regulation unique among menstrual technologies. To reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Tampon Task Force guided consumers to use the least absorbent product (Table 1). The Task Force chose gram weight of saline absorbed as the metric, although this remains controversial because heparinized blood is more absorbable than saline. Despite this limitation, one commonly accepted threshold at which an evaluation for heavy menstrual bleeding should be considered is when patients report saturating a tampon more frequently than every 2 hours or experiencing flooding around tampons. –

Table 1.
Disposable Tampon Labeling by Absorbency According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration Requirements

Recent surveys still demonstrate that just less than half of menstruating individuals report that tampons are their preferred product for menstrual management. Modern tampons generally are made of an absorbent cylinder of cotton, rayon, or polyester attached to a blended string made of cotton, polyester, or polypropylene. Tampons can be placed into the vagina digitally, with a disposable plastic or cardboard telescoping applicator or a reusable medical-grade silicone applicator. Public concerns continue to exist regarding both the environmental and personal exposure risk of the components included in tampons, although these do not appear to be elevated above background exposures.

Manufacturers and environmental advocates have proposed sea sponges as an alternative to tampons since the 1980s. Early investigations found sea sponges to contain abrasives such as sand and contaminants such as mold and bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, the species most commonly associated with TSS. Some sea sponges are marketed as reusable, although cleaning specifications are not validated and sometimes contradictory. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved any sea sponge for menstrual use, but many user-identified strategies exist on the internet, including use of sponges advertised for cosmetic uses (eg, application of makeup). Internationally, several synthetic sponges are available in the European Union and Australian markets. A popular sponge from the Netherlands is made of rubber latex and purports its ability to be kept in place comfortably during intercourse. These come individually packed and are intended for single use.

### Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (annovera) [^0dfe73be]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11	Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

Annovera is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

Cervical Cancer

Some studies suggest that CHCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

5.12	Effect on Binding Globulins

The estrogen component of ANNOVERA may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine- binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.

5.13	Hereditary Angioedema

In females with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.

5.14	Chloasma

Chloasma may occur with ANNOVERA use, especially in females with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Advise females who tend to develop chloasma to avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using ANNOVERA.

5.15	Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Cases of TSS have been reported by vaginal ring users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and in some TSS cases ring users were also using tampons. Causal relationship between the use of a vaginal ring and TSS has not been established. No cases of TSS occurred in clinical trials with ANNOVERA. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis, remove ANNOVERA, and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

### Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c150dc4e]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Women, girls, and transgender people require hygienic menstrual products monthly to live healthy and productive lives. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the menstrual cup, combining information from medical and grey literature to inform choice and strengthen the evidence base for programmes supporting menstrual health, such as for schoolgirls in low-income and middle-income countries or among refugees. Leakage was similar or less when using the menstrual cup than when using disposable pads and tampons. The adoption of a menstrual cup required a familiarisation phase and peer support seemed to be important for uptake in low-income and middle-income countries. Challenges in resource constrained settings (eg, lack of sanitation, hygiene, and privacy) did not stop women from using the cup. Around 70% of participants in 13 studies declared wanting to continue use. We identified several incidental case reports of vaginal damage, toxic shock syndrome, or urinary tract complaints after menstrual cup use, and difficulty retrieving the menstrual cup was also reported. Use of menstrual cups has been described as a factor for IUD dislodgement. Menstrual cups were infrequently mentioned in online educational materials on puberty and menstruation for adolescent girls; the lack of information appears to be global. Brands of menstrual cups were identified in 99 countries with a wide range in prices with a median of US$23·30.

Table 2
Safety and side-effects of the menstrual cup

We found no increased infection risk (reproductive tract or systemic infection) associated with use of a menstrual cup among European, North American, and African women and girls, compared with other menstrual products (table 2). A decrease in candidiasis was reported with use of the menstrual cup in two of four studies that investigated this infection; one study found no candidiasis infections at follow-up in 18 participants, and the other, a randomised feasibility pilot among schoolgirls (aged 14–16 years) in Kenya comparing menstrual cups, sanitary pads, and usual practice (cloths, pads, tissue, or other makeshift materials), showed no difference in the prevalence of candidiasis by study group (menstrual cup 11 [8%] of 143, pads 19 [10%] of 200, and usual practice 13 [9%] of 156; menstrual cup vs pads p = 0·68 and menstrual cup vs usual practice p = 0·87; table 2). One studyreported lower prevalence of bacterial infections among users of the menstrual cup than among users of tampons or pads (not further specified), and a randomised pilot studyin Kenya reported lower prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among users of the menstrual cup than users of pads and usual practice enrolled for 9 months or longer (menstrual cup 13 [13%] of 101, pads 29 [20%] of 143, usual practice 20 [19%] of 104; menstrual cup vs pads p = 0·018 and menstrual cup vs usual practice p = 0·074; table 2). Toxic shock syndrome was identified in five case reports;, microbiological confirmation was available with cultures from menstrual cup and blood showing streptococcus for one case. In two participants from two case reports, concomitant conditions were present (intrauterine device [IUD] in situ; an immunodeficiency disease). A potential additional case of toxic shock syndrome was identified in a web blog (appendix pp 43–44): we could not determine whether this case has separately been reported in the MAUDE system or in a case report and thus it has been left out of our analysis. The prevalence of vaginal Staphylococcus aureus was examined among Kenyan schoolgirls participating in a randomised pilot study;, no difference was seen between menstrual cup, pads, and usual practice groups. No expression of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) was found in S aureus positive samples from menstrual cup users in this study. In-vitro studies of production of TSST-1 in the presence of menstrual cup material showed conflicting results (table 2).

### Reduction in Staphylococcus aureus growth and exotoxin production and in vaginal interleukin 8 levels due to glycerol monolaurate in tampons [^962125cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcal menstrual toxic shock syndrome depends on vaginal production of exotoxins. Glycerol monolaurate (GML) inhibits Staphylococcus aureus exotoxin production in vitro. The purpose of this study was to determine whether GML, as a tampon fiber finish, inhibits production of exotoxins and the cytokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) during normal tampon use.

Methods

On day 2 of menstruation, when vaginal S. aureus counts are high in colonized women, study participants exchanged their own preferred tampons, after wearing them for 2–6 h, for study tampons with or without GML (assigned randomly and blindly), which they then wore for 4–6 h. The women's own tampons and the study tampons with or without GML were assayed for S. aureus, the exotoxins toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and alpha-toxin, and IL-8.

Results

A total of 225 women completed the study. S. aureus was present in the tampons of 41 women (18%). Lower numbers of S. aureus and the exotoxins were detected in study tampons with or without GML than in women's own tampons; lower amounts of the exotoxins were present in study tampons with GML than study tampons without GML. The IL-8 level was lower in tampons from women without vaginal S. aureus compared with women with S. aureus and was lower in study tampons with GML than in study tampons without GML.

Conclusions

Tampons that contain GML reduce S. aureus exotoxin production. S. aureus increases vaginal IL-8 levels, and GML reduces production of this proinflammatory cytokine. These results suggest that GML added to tampons provides additional safety relative to menstrual toxic shock syndrome as well as benefits for vaginal health generally, thus supporting the addition of GML to tampons.

### Staphylococcal cutaneous infections: invasion, evasion and aggression [^b5f1e7fa]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal infections cause a variety of cutaneous and systemic infections, including impetigo, furuncle, subcutaneous abscess, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and neonatal toxic shock syndrome-like exanthematous disease (NTED), in association with microbial virulence factors. The virulence factors produced by Staphylococcus aureus have a wide array of biological properties, including disruption of the epithelial barrier, inhibition of opsonization by antibody and complement, interference with neutrophil chemotaxis, cytolysis of neutrophils, and inactivation of antimicrobial peptides. Exfoliative toxins (ETs) induce the 'acantholytic' infection of S. aureus due to the disruption of cell-to-cell cohesion, which allows the pathogenic organisms to spread within the epithelium. Furthermore, S. aureus expresses exotoxins with biological properties of superantigens that induce T-cell activation with subsequent anergy and immunosuppression. Of the S. aureus leukotoxins, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is involved in the development of multiple furuncles with more intense erythema, particularly in healthy young adults. TSS is an acute life-threatening illness caused by TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1) and is usually classified into two categories; menstrual TSS, originally described in association with tampon use, and nonmenstrual TSS with a variety of clinical settings. NTED is a neonatal disease induced by TSST-1 although clinical symptoms are much milder than those of TSS. In TSS and NTED, the expansion of TSST-1-reactive Vbeta2-positive T cells is observed. The production of pathogenic S. aureus exotoxins and biofilm formation is regulated by the accessory gene regulator (agr) locus in the quorum-sensing signaling pathway. There is no doubt that targeting the quorum-sensing signaling pathway or anti-toxin therapy is a promising therapeutic approach supportive of primary antibiotic therapy.

### A randomized, double-blind study on the safety and immunogenicity of rTSST-1 variant vaccine: phase 2 results [^a79fdb3f]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Aside from rTSST-1v, there are currently no other TSST-1-targeting vaccines in clinical development. Targeting another superantigen, the STEBVax vaccine, containing recombinant staphylococcal enterotoxin B, was shown to be safe and immunogenic in a phase 1 trial.

While the strengths of this trial involve its randomised, double-blind, adjuvant-controlled, parallel-group design, the inclusion of more women than men and its extended follow-up period, it shows several limitations including its sample size of 140 subjects and inclusion of almost only Caucasians. A larger pivotal, multinational, randomised-controlled, pivotal, phase 3 trial is needed to confirm safety and immunogenicity of the eventual rTSST-1v dose regimen. Based on the well-known risk-factors, a lack of protective antibody levels and the use of tampons or menstrual cups, the target population of such a trial should include healthy adolescents, especially girls, aged ≥ 11 years and a more diverse study population. Thus, one obvious limitation of this study is its limited generalizability, which needs to be addressed in future trials. There are some missing data due to subjects, who have terminated their study participation early, and it is impossible to exclude some degree of selection bias. The per-protocol analysis is prone to such bias. Furthermore, analysis of the ITT introduces measurement bias, because it assesses assigned and not actually received treatments. Furthermore, the follow-up period of 27 months is somewhat limited. In vaccine development, longer term immunogenicity is usually addressed as a post-marketing authorisation commitment. Inclusion of a real placebo control group (e.g. receiving saline) could allow a more robust analysis of safety and tolerability".

In summary, the results of this trial represent a critical step towards a successful vaccine against S. aureus -associated toxic shock syndrome and support its continued development and testing in young adolescents.

Septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and catheter-related infections are conditions in which intensive care management of the patient may be necessary. Toxic shock syndrome is a toxin-mediated illness that is not limited to young menstruating women and should be considered in women and men who present with fever, hypotension, rash, and multiorgan dysfunction. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients in the United States and is the most common predisposing factor for acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Central venous catheters are often a necessity for optimal patient care in these critically ill patients.

### Clarithromycin plus intravenous immunoglobulin therapy can reduce the relapse rate of Kawasaki disease: a phase 2, open-label, randomized control study [^996c2feb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the effect of clarithromycin in patients with KD. In this exploratory phase 2 study, the addition of clarithromycin to standard therapy did not affect our primary end point, the duration of the fever. However, clarithromycin plus IVIG therapy significantly reduced the relapse rate and shortened hospital stay compared with IVIG therapy alone.

Clarithromycin, a 14‐membered ring macrolide, is a widely used antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. 24, 25 It is well known that clarithromycin and other 14‐ and 15‐membered macrolides have anti‐inflammatory activity that is not mediated through their traditional antimicrobial effect. 12, 13, 26, 27, 28 Biofilm formation and virulence factors are associated with changes in the morphology of bacteria, exopolysaccharide alginate production, and a system of bacterial intercommunication known as quorum sensing. Clarithromycin suppresses the pili assembly, alginate production, and the transcription of several genes that comprise the quorum sensing system, leading to the inhibition of the biofilm formation. 12, 13, 29, 30, 31

Biofilms are medically important and account for over 80% of microbial infections in the body. 32 The development of toxic shock syndrome, which is an acute systemic shock caused by the exotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, is deeply related to biofilm conditions. It is preferentially observed in association with tampon use, wound infection, and burns and other cutaneous lesions. 33 Furthermore, toxic shock syndrome toxin‐1 production was extremely enhanced when S. aureus was cultured as a biofilm rather than cultured with conventional methods, suggesting that S. aureus under biofilm condition but not planktonic condition is closely related to the development of toxic shock syndrome. 34, 35 Similarly, we hypothesized that KD may be evoked not by microbes themselves but by bioactive molecules produced by microbes under biofilm‐like conditions. 2, 11 Therefore, we evaluated the clinical effect of clarithromycin as an antibiofilm agent against KD in the current study.

While the fundamental principles of epistaxis management have not changed over the decades, the methods by which tamponade is achieved have been evolving. Inflatable nasal tampons are being used and seen with increasing frequency in our ENT clinic. They are usually placed by emergency department personnel, who then refer patients to our clinic for removal. The classically described complications of nasal packs are induction of the nasopulmonary reflex, toxic shock syndrome, and discomfort.

### Systemic septic embolisation secondary to an atrial myxoma in a young woman [^0a590f62]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

We present a case of a left atrial myxoma infected with Staphylococcus aureus in a 35-year-old woman who was found to have a retained tampon. Multiple systemic septic emboli were seen on computed tomography imaging of the brain, spleen and kidneys. She was successfully treated by surgical excision of the myxoma and 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy. We postulate that the source of this patient's S. aureus infection was tampon use, leading to a toxic shock syndrome and causing infection of an undiagnosed left atrial myxoma, which led to the embolisation. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first reported case of such an entity. In those with an underlying cardiac predisposition, tampon use may represent a risk of infection with S. aureus, and we intend to heighten clinical awareness of this potentially life-threatening association. We also discuss the diagnosis, complications and treatment of infected atrial myxoma and illustrate the imaging findings.

### Fatal toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device [^244fd29c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome is a rare toxin-mediated condition that can rapidly produce multiorgan failure and severe shock. Toxic shock syndrome has been previously recognized in various clinical situations relating to surgery, nasal packing, abscesses, burns, and most notably menstrual-related cases. This case report describes a previously healthy 33-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; vital signs at triage were normal. Within hours, she developed shock and cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient met all 6 of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for toxic shock syndrome, and her intrauterine device grew out Staphylococcus aureus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the medical literature of fatal toxic shock syndrome related to an intrauterine device.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^679420bf]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) patient profiles — In cardiogenic shock (CS), previously, more than 80% of cases resulted from acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but currently only about 30%-45% are related to ACS. Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction are relatively rare causes with even higher mortality risks. Non-ACS causes include acute myocarditis, atrial and ventricular arrhythmia, valvular disease, acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, other cardiomyopathies (eg, peripartum, toxic aetiology, and Takotsubo), tamponade, or post-cardiotomy shock; tMCS can play an important role in massive pulmonary embolism when conventional interventions have failed. The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced tMCS utilization, particularly VA-ECLS for concomitant haemodynamic instability and cardiac dysfunction, or oxyRVAD (a combination of right ventricular assist device [RVAD] and an oxygenator) for pulmonary and right ventricular failure. Within the last decade, new tMCS indications have developed, including protected PCI, protected or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), protected "high risk" cardiac operations, and tMCS-protected ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation; the timing of tMCS placement prior to high-risk PCI is associated with improved survival compared to post-PCI. In extremely high-risk populations undergoing TAVI, emergency use of tMCS during the procedure leads to high short- and long-term mortality rates compared to prophylactic utilization. Although originally developed for CS, indications now include prophylactic insertion before high-risk cardiac procedures, treatment of postcardiac-surgery circulatory collapse, and bridging end-stage heart failure patients to a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or an HTx, or to recovery (bridge to recovery, BTR); typical scenarios include post-cardiotomy heart failure, fulminant myocarditis, stunned myocardium after acute ischaemia, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, or massive pulmonary embolism.

### Incidence and risk factors for toxic shock syndrome after endoscopic sinus surgery: a systematic review [^ba5533df]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but serious complication after sinonasal surgery and a commonly cited consideration for prescribing antibiotics when nasal packing or stents are placed. Most reports are limited to case reports or small series. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of patients who developed TSS as a complication of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and/or septoplasty.

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases.

Review Methods

Eligibility criteria were patients of any age who developed TSS as a complication of ESS and/or septoplasty.

Results

Twenty-five studies were included in the final review. Seventy cases were identified over 38 years (1982–2020). The pooled incidence of TSS after sinonasal surgery was 0.0003 (0.0002–0.0004, 95% confidence interval, CI) or 30 per 100,000 persons. Among 33 patients with single-subject data, mean age was 33.8 years (29.73–37.87, 95% CI). Seventeen (51.5%) patients had nasal packing, 3 (9.1%) had stents, 5 (15.2%) had both, 7 (21.2%) had none. Fourteen (42.4%) patients had nonabsorbable packing and 5 (15.2%) had absorbable packing. Sixteen (48%) patients received peri-operative antibiotics. Thirty-two (97%) patients had full recovery.

Conclusion

The incidence of TSS after sinonasal surgery is very rare. TSS can occur with and without nasal packing and prophylactic antibiotics were not protective. Outcomes were favorable with appropriate recognition and management. Further study is needed to determine which patients are most at risk for TSS.

### Menstrual TSS remains a dangerous threat [^a5263965]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The most potentially controversial aspect of the study by Billon et al.is their finding that use of tampons for > 6 h or overnight use increases risk of mTSS. A prior study showed an increased risk of mTSS in association with overnight use of tampons. However, that prior study was performed in the early 1980s when tampons of the highest absorbency were marketed. Since 1984, there has been little evidence to suggest that tampon use of > 6 h or even overnight (approximately 8 h) poses an increased risk on mTSS. This has led to the current recommended use of a tampon for 2–8 h. The Billon et al.finding is important if confirmed by additional recent epidemiology data. It is important to considered that 8-h tampon use overnight versus 8-h use during the daytime may also have different risks due to different body positions and menses accumulation. If the current data are confirmed, the recommended duration of use of individual tampons should be reduced. No matter what, however, women should remain vigilant to the early mTSS symptoms, and they should use enhanced caution with tampon use of > 6 h.

Finally, the manuscript finds the median age of mTSS cases to be 18 years in France. This is higher than in the United States wherein most cases occur in young women 12–15 years of age. It is unknown why this difference exists, but it could be that young women in the United States begin menstruation and/or use of tampons at earlier ages.

The Billon et al.study is important in that it emphasizes concerns that mTSS is less-recognized today among young women, putting them at elevated risk. Prolonged use of tampons appears to increase risk. mTSS remains a dangerous infection.

### Menstrual TSS remains a dangerous threat [^23a1a4be]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The last epidemiology study of mTSS was performed in 2011, where we reported the incidence was 1.4/100K in 13–24 year-aged young women. In the United States, this would be approximately 1000 cases per year. There was also a background incidence of TSS that occurred independent of tampon use, combining both males and females, at approximately 0.5/100K.

The current Billon et al.research is the only new epidemiology study of mTSS performed since 2011. Their findings confirm the mTSS association with tampon use and case numbers being 1–2/100K young women in France, meeting the clinical criteria for mTSS or probable mTSS.

Several unique and potentially alarming findings were determined in the Billon et al.study. There has not been pervasive news media coverage of mTSS since the incidence was reduced 10-fold in 1984. This has led to complacency, confirmed by the Billon et al.study, which found that young women were more likely to develop mTSS if they were unfamiliar with warning information. There should always be strong warning mechanisms in place to keep young women abreast of mTSS as they near menstruation. This must be more than simply providing tampon box warnings and package inserts. Every young woman should know that mTSS has early flu-like symptoms near or during menstruation, including acute onset of fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and progressive dizziness upon standing. If present, they should seek immediate medical attention. This could be done by periodic broad mass media attention.

### ACMT position statement: No evidence that tampons cause metal poisoning [^262bbfa0]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). High credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position statement — tampons and metal exposure states "No Evidence that Tampons Cause Metal Poisoning" and references a study finding trace concentrations of "16 metals and metalloids in 30 different tampons from 14 different brands", with testing of "60 material samples from tampons representing 30 individual tampons" and a reported "median lead concentration, for example, was 173 ng/g". The study authors "could not evaluate absorption and 'cannot speculate on potential harm to the health of menstruators'", and "does not provide any information on bioavailability via the intra-vaginal route or health effects".

### Fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device [^0960b02c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The occurrence of toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device (IUD) is very rare.

Objectives

To raise awareness of the risk of toxic shock syndrome caused by an IUD, to educate others about when to suspect this complication, and to provide treatment recommendations.

Case Report

A 49-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department in septic shock after complaining of 5 days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination findings included a diffusely tender and rigid abdomen with free fluid on bedside sonogram. She was found, on computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis, to have an IUD with moderate ascites. The IUD was removed, and both her IUD and her blood cultures grew out group A Streptococcus. Despite aggressive medical management, which included multiple vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she died from group A streptococcal sepsis, with the IUD as her most likely source. Her clinical presentation and laboratory findings meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Her diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy.

Conclusion

IUDs should be considered as a possible source of infection in patients with an IUD who present with symptoms consistent with toxic shock syndrome. These patients need to be aggressively managed with early surgical intervention.

### Structural and functional properties of antibodies to the superantigen TSST-1 and their relationship to menstrual toxic shock syndrome [^cb3e548f]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is an acute febrile disease accompanied by hypotension and multiple organ involvement. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus producing the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) vaginally is necessary; however, only a small fraction of those infected with TSST-1 producing bacteria actually develop mTSS, suggesting that host factors modulate disease susceptibility. Serum antibodies to the toxin protect against development of the syndrome, but not all antibodies can neutralize the toxin. We set out to determine whether risk of developing the syndrome is related to the absence of neutralizing antibody and if antibody isotypes influence the neutralization capacity. In healthy subjects, TSST-1-binding serum antibodies were exclusively of the IgG and IgM classes; however, toxin-neutralizing capacity was correlated to the TSST-1-specific IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies (r² = 0.88, p < 0.0001 and 0.33, p < 0.0086, respectively) but not with IgM antibodies. Specific IgA was not detectable. Compared to healthy matched controls who were colonized vaginally with S. aureus, IgG1 anti-TSST-1 antibodies and toxin neutralizing activity was lacking in all of the acute phases and in the majority of convalescent sera, suggesting that these patients may be incapable of generating TSST-1 neutralizing antibodies. These new findings support the hypothesis that host factors are important in the development of mTSS and that the anti-toxin isotype impacts antibody functionality.

### A clinical decision analysis for use of antibiotic prophylaxis for nonabsorbable nasal packing [^1a341801]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonabsorbable nasal packing is often placed for the treatment of epistaxis or after sinonasal or skull base surgery. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a rare, potentially fatal occurrence. However, the risk of TSS must be balanced against the major risk of antibiotic use, specifically Clostridium difficile colitis (CDC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate in terms of cost-effectiveness whether antibiotics should be prescribed when nasal packing is placed.

Study Design

A clinical decision analysis was performed using a Markov model to evaluate whether antibiotics should be given.

Setting

Patients with nonabsorbable nasal packing placed.

Methods

Utility scores, probabilities, and costs were obtained from the literature. We assess the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic use when the risk of community-acquired CDC is balanced against the risk of TSS from nasal packing. Sensitivity analysis was performed for assumptions used in the model.

Results

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for antibiotic use was 334,493 US dollars (USD)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that not prescribing antibiotics was cost-effective in 98.0% of iterations at a willingness to pay of 50,000 USD/QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that when the risk of CDC from antibiotics was greater than 910/100,000 or when the incidence of TSS after nasal packing was less than 49/100,000 cases, the decision to withhold antibiotics was cost-effective.

Conclusions

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of nasal packing is not cost-effective and should be reconsidered. Even if antibiotics are assumed to prevent TSS, the risk of complications from antibiotic use is of greater consequence.

### The evaluation and management of toxic shock syndrome in the emergency department: a review of the literature [^d098266d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe, toxin-mediated illness that can mimic several other diseases and is lethal if not recognized and treated appropriately.

Objective

This review provides an emergency medicine evidence-based summary of the current evaluation and treatment of TSS.

Discussion

The most common etiologic agents are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Sources of TSS include postsurgical wounds, postpartum, postabortion, burns, soft tissue injuries, pharyngitis, and focal infections. Symptoms are due to toxin production and infection focus. Early symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. Diffuse erythema and desquamation may occur later in the disease course. Laboratory assessment may demonstrate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation studies. Diagnostic criteria are available to facilitate the diagnosis, but they should not be relied on for definitive diagnosis. Rather, specific situations should trigger consideration of this disease process. Treatment involves intravenous fluids, source control, and antibiotics. Antibiotics should include a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, cephalosporin, or vancomycin (in methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalent areas) along with either clindamycin or linezolid.

Conclusion

TSS is a potentially deadly disease requiring prompt recognition and treatment. Focused history, physical examination, and laboratory testing are important for the diagnosis and management of this disease. Understanding the evaluation and treatment of TSS can assist providers with effectively managing these patients.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^672955c4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

First described in 1978, toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe febrile illness now confirmed to be caused by exotoxin-producing strains of Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Investigations based on extensive chart review and/or microbiology laboratory data suggest little or no decrease in overall TSS incidence and an increase in streptococcal TSS. Given the persistence and severity of TSS and the differences in its treatment from other causes of septic shock, its evolving epidemiology needs to be accurately monitored. To this end, we assessed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)–coded TSS cases in Colorado, USA.

### Long-term outcomes of patients with toxic shock syndrome: a matched cohort study [^bd6cb03e]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We examined long-term outcomes of toxic shock syndrome.

Methods

We conducted a matched cohort study of 630 patients with toxic shock syndrome and 5009 healthy controls between 2006 and 2021 in Quebec, Canada. Outcomes included hospitalization for renal, cardiovascular, hepatic, and other morbidity during 15 years of follow-up. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of these outcomes over time, comparing patients with toxic shock syndrome relative to matched controls.

Results

Compared with healthy controls, rehospitalization rates at 15 years were higher for men with toxic shock syndrome (52.0 vs 30.0 per 100) but not for women (38.7 vs 45.6 per 100). In men, toxic shock syndrome was associated with an elevated risk of renal (HR 17.43, 95% CI 6.35–47.82), cardiovascular (HR 2.57; 95% CI 1.52–4.34), and hepatic hospitalization (HR 19.83, 95% CI 4.72–83.34). In women, toxic shock syndrome was associated with renal hospitalization (HR 4.71, 95% CI 1.94–11.45). Streptococcal toxic shock was associated with a greater risk of rehospitalization than staphylococcal toxic shock.

Conclusions

Toxic shock syndrome is associated with rehospitalization up to 15 years later, especially in men. These patients may benefit from continued follow-up to prevent long-term morbidity.

### Menstrual toxic shock syndrome: a French nationwide multicenter retrospective study [^28ba3b12]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies describing the clinical features and short-term prognosis of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for menstrual toxic shock syndrome (m-TSS) are lacking.

Methods

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with a clinical diagnosis of m-TSS admitted between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2020 in 43 French pediatric (n = 7) or adult (n = 36) ICUs. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical features and short-term prognosis, as well as to assess the 2011 Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) diagnostic criteria, in critically ill patients with m-TSS.

Results

In total, 102 patients with m-TSS (median age, 18 years; interquartile range, 16–24 years) were admitted to 1 of the participating ICUs. All blood cultures (n = 102) were sterile. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus grew from 92 of 96 vaginal samples. Screening for superantigenic toxin gene sequences was performed for 76 of the 92 vaginal samples positive for S. aureus (83%), and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 was isolated from 66 strains (87%). At ICU admission, no patient met the 2011 CDC criteria for confirmed m-TSS, and only 53 (52%) fulfilled the criteria for probable m-TSS. Eighty-one patients (79%) were treated with antitoxin antibiotic therapy, and 8 (8%) received intravenous immunoglobulins. Eighty-six (84%) patients required vasopressors, and 21 (21%) tracheal intubation. No patient required limb amputation or died in the ICU.

Conclusions

In this large multicenter series of patients included in ICUs for m-TSS, none died or required limb amputation. The CDC criteria should not be used for the clinical diagnosis of m-TSS at ICU admission.

### Toxic shock syndrome following cessation of prophylactic antibiotics in a child with a 2% scald [^5942cfc8]. Burns (2002). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but serious complication of burns in children. Symptoms usually start within 3 days of the burn injury and even children with minor burns can be susceptible. Prompt diagnosis and rapid treatment is crucial in limiting the morbidity associated with this condition. We report here a 19-month-old child with a 2% scald who developed TSS following cessation of a 5-day course of flucloxacillin. This case highlights a number of issues regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics and TSS as well as illustrating the continuing need to educate parents concerning the importance of seeking a prompt medical opinion if the child becomes ill following even a minor burn injury.

### Delayed development of toxic shock syndrome following abdominal tissue expansion in a pediatric reconstruction patient: case report [^c787054e]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal postoperative complication, and even more so if the diagnosis is delayed. We present the case of a 7-month-old male infant who developed TSS as a complication of tissue expansion using an external port device. There have been 5 documented cases of TSS after tissue expander or breast prosthesis placement occurring in the adult population, however, there has not been a reported case of TSS in an infant. The long interval to development of TSS like symptoms, 4 months in this case, should not exclude TSS from the differential diagnosis. In a pediatric patient, a diffuse macular rash without the severe systemic symptoms on initial presentation can present as a diagnostic challenge. New diagnosis techniques are discussed that can shorten the time to a diagnosis of TSS. In this case, because the local bacterial count was low, the expanded tissue was transferred without complication.

### The food and drug administration's proactive toxic anterior segment syndrome program [^c6b9059b]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) is a rare inflammatory condition usually observed within the first 48 hours after uncomplicated anterior segment surgery. Over the decades since its initial description, a number of TASS outbreaks have been reported. For a few of these outbreaks, the inciting factors were identified, but for the majority, the precipitating factors were often postulated but not confirmed. In light of the limitations identified in these outbreak investigations, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Center for Devices and Radiological Health staff has embarked on a number of activities aimed at mitigating medical device-related TASS outbreaks. Under the FDA-designed Proactive TASS Program (PTP), FDA scientists have conducted animal studies to better explore the inflammatory potential of suspected ophthalmic device contaminants implicated in prior cases of TASS. For contaminants displaying a TASS-like reaction in these animal models, the FDA scientists have developed analytic test methods to measure the level of those contaminants in or on ophthalmic devices. Moreover, FDA researchers have developed methods to better capture the clinical information necessary to assist investigations of potential future outbreaks. Last, the FDA has partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to facilitate a potential TASS investigation, including expediting the analysis of potentially contaminated medical devices. The PTP is an example of the FDA proactively developing test methods and disease surveillance methods geared toward protecting the public's health.

### Biocompatibility and toxicology program: research on medical… [^489e587c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Although limitations were identified in the literature review, as is common, the findings did not identify safety concerns associated with tampon use and contaminant exposure. The FDA continues to recommend FDA-cleared tampons as a safe option for use as a menstrual product. The Literature Review The purpose of the literature review was to determine the available evidence on contaminants in tampons and their related health effects. It included nine published articles that evaluated a variety of different contaminants in tampons, including metals, phthalates, parabens, bisphenols, volatile organic compounds, dioxins, and triclocarban. There are limitations related to the methods used in the studies that were reviewed. In addition, none of the studies reviewed address how much, if any, of the contaminants identified are released from the tampon or absorbed through the vagina.

Although limited, the available evidence continues to support the FDA's conclusion that tampons remain a safe menstrual product option. Additional Study The FDA's internal bench laboratory study, already underway, intends to determine if metals from tampon materials are released or absorbed in the body. Specifically, the study will measure the amount of metals that may be released from tampon materials under conditions that more closely mimic normal use. The FDA will share findings from the laboratory testing when they are complete and have been peer reviewed. The ongoing laboratory study will better enable the FDA to complete a risk assessment of metals contained in tampon materials, based on a worst-case scenario of metal exposure. FDA Actions The FDA committed to further evaluating the safety of tampons because an outside study published in 2024 found low levels of metals in tampons during laboratory testing.

While that study reported metals in some tampons, it did not test whether metals are released from tampons when used or whether they were absorbed into the vaginal lining or getting into the bloodstream. Regulatory Background Before tampons can be legally sold in the U. S., they must meet FDA requirements for safety and effectiveness. Manufacturers must test tampons and the materials the tampon is made of before, during, and after manufacturing. Also, before tampons are allowed onto the market, manufacturers must perform biocompatibility and other safety testing. The FDA reviews the results of the testing prior to market authorization.

### The use of etanercept for treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis when toxic shock syndrome is in the differential [^ce271036]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) can sometimes mimic Steven Johnsons syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of both TSS and SJS/TEN. Etanercept, a TNF-alpha inhibitor has been recently shown to treat and decrease mortality of SJS/TEN. We report a 51-year-old female with history of SJS presenting with painful skin and bullae 2 days following cystoscopy with botulinum toxin injection into the bladder. Due to initial concern for SJS/TEN, the patient was treated with 50mg of subcutaneous etanercept. Punch biopsies were not consistent with SJS, and the patient fulfilled five out of five criteria for a confirmed case of TSS. The patient ultimately had a favorable outcome despite etanercept treatment. Ultimately, TNF-alpha antagonists are an emerging therapy to treat SJS/TEN, and are unlikely to worsen TSS prognosis. Given that etanercept can be used to successfully treat SJS/TEN and TNF-alpha levels are elevated in TSS, if a dermatologist chooses to treat TEN with etanercept, consideration of TSS on the differential should not necessarily exclude etanercept as a reasonable treatment option.

### Recurrent nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome: clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment [^0dea6f7a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We report 3 cases of recurrent nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. The primary sites of infection were the genital tract (in a patient who underwent cesarean delivery), the upper respiratory tract, and a breast abscess. In all 3 patients, the initial illness was not recognized to be TSS; only after development of recurrent illness with desquamation was this diagnosis entertained. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus that were isolated from 2 patients produced TSS toxin-1, whereas the third strain produced staphylococcal enterotoxin B. All 3 patients lacked antibody to the implicated toxins at the time of presentation with recurrent illness. Nonmenstrual TSS can occur in a variety of clinical settings and may be recurrent. The presence of desquamation during a febrile, multisystem illness could suggest this diagnosis and should prompt the clinician to obtain appropriate cultures for S. aureus.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^a7c1810f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Despite timely intervention, there exists a small subgroup of patients with septic shock who develop progressive multi-organ failure. Seemingly refractory to conventional therapy, they exhibit a very high mortality. Such patients are often poorly represented in large clinical trials. Consequently, good evidence for effective treatment strategies is lacking. In this article, we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock based on our experience of toxin-mediated sepsis in a specialist referral centre. Many components of this strategy are inexpensive and widely accessible, and so may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes in these critically ill patients.

### Penetration of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 across porcine vaginal mucosa ex vivo: permeability characteristics, toxin distribution, and tissue damage [^a513a416]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate transvaginal penetration of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and its effects on permeability and tissue integrity in vitro with the use of excised porcine vaginal mucosa.

Study Design

Permeability to tritiated water (1 and 10 microg/mL applied toxin) and transmucosal flux of (35)S-methionine-labeled toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (10 and 20 microg/mL) for up to 12 hours were assessed with the use of a continuous flow perfusion system. The location of labeled toxin that penetrated the mucosal tissue strata was determined. The integrity of toxin-treated, intact, scalpel-incised tissue was evaluated histopathologically.

Results

Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 caused a non-dose-dependent increase in mucosal permeability and traversed the intact mucosa at a low rate without disrupting tissue integrity. In incised vaginal mucosa, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 induced subepithelial separation and atrophy that were analogous to clinically relevant vaginal lesions that were reported in fatal cases of menstrual toxic shock syndrome.

Conclusion

An in vitro model could be used to demonstrate that toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 permeates the vaginal mucosa and distributes throughout the tissue. Histologic evaluation of tissues that were exposed to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 demonstrated lesions that were similar to those lesions that were reported in cases of menstrual toxic shock syndrome.

### High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin versus albumin 4% in paediatric toxic shock syndrome: a randomised controlled feasibility study [^242deef6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IG) in paediatric TSS could improve shock and organ failure.
Data are needed to evaluate efficacy and safety of IGs, but randomised clinical trial seem to be very difficult to conduct in this indication.

### Is it Kawasaki shock syndrome, Kawasaki-like disease or pediatric inflammatory multisystem disease? The importance of semantic in the era of COVID-19 pandemic [^4425823c]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Many of these cases occurred after several weeks of quarantine, and it is possible that these subjects suffered from a mild form of COVID-19 after intrafamilial transmission and severe complications appeared weeks later, likely related to a dysregulated immune response. The temporal relationship between infection curves and reported cases would also be consistent with this hypothesis.

The presence of shock has led to analogies with KD shock syndrome. Toxic shock is a rare presentation of KD (1–2%), often inaugural and without the typical mucocutaneous symptoms, but toxic shock has also been associated for years with bacterial toxins, especially from streptococcus and staphylococcus, playing a role of superantigen with subsequent immunologic reaction similar to anaphylaxis. At present, little is known on the link between viral infection and shock syndrome. Of interest, a retrospective cohort of 1099 SARS-COV-2 confirmed patients in China reported 12 (1.1%) with shock syndrome, the direct role of the virus may, however, be only speculative, as these patients may have had coinfections suffered from treatment-related anaphylactic reactions.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: a case series emphasizing the urgency of recognition and tailored treatment [^056a5ab3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but lethal condition associated with Streptococcus Pyogenes Group A (GAS). With rising incidence and high mortality, timely recognition and management are crucial. This case series presents two adult TSS cases caused by invasive GAS, highlighting the importance of early identification and multidisciplinary management.

Case Presentations

The first case involves a 42-year-old male who presented with fever, dizziness, and a tender, erythematous olecranon following an elbow laceration. Despite negative imaging for necrotizing fasciitis, a positive throat swab for GAS prompted immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive resuscitation. Clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. The patient developed TSS and acute kidney injury, requiring intensive care and hemodialysis. The second case features a previously healthy 43-year-old female presenting with systemic symptoms and a rash, without trauma history. Positive GAS blood cultures confirmed TSS, leading to similar management and subsequent renal complications requiring hemodialysis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? These cases highlight the evolving epidemiology of invasive GAS infections and the associated risk of TSS. Early identification and appropriate tailored treatment are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality, especially given the recent surge in invasive GAS. Clinical vigilance for skin changes and thorough laboratory investigations, including non-sterile site cultures, are critical. Early identification enables the use of adjunctive treatments like clindamycin and IVIG, and facilitates appropriate de-escalation of antibiotics. Prompt consultation with infectious disease, intensive care, and surgical teams is necessary to ensure optimal treatment.

### Toxic shock syndrome caused by staphylococcal infection after breast implant surgery: a case report and literature review [^03533aad]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome is a rare but life-threatening complication after breast implant surgery. We describe a 77-year-old woman who developed toxic shock syndrome caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after breast implant reconstruction. Despite a high fever and markedly increased white blood cell count, suggesting severe infection, she initially had no symptoms of local findings, such as wound swelling and redness of the breast. Soon after diagnosis of toxic shock syndrome and removal of her breast implant, she was recovered from the shock state. To date, 16 cases of toxic shock syndrome have been reported, including this case, and they were related to breast implants or tissue expander surgery. The common and noteworthy characteristic of these cases was the lack of local findings, such as swelling or redness, which suggests infection. Therefore, early diagnosis is generally difficult, and the initiation of proper treatment can be delayed without knowledge of this characteristic. Toxic shock syndrome requires early diagnosis and treatment. If the patient has a deteriorated vital sign after breast implant surgery or tissue expander breast reconstruction, toxic shock syndrome should be suspected, even if there are no local signs of infection, and removal of the artifact should be considered as soon as possible.

### The epidemiology of pediatric thermal injury-associated toxic shock syndrome: a systematic review [^2108f232]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Thermal injury-associated toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a life-threatening condition that can occur in children following burn injuries. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcomes of children who experienced TSS following a thermal injury. Additionally, the existing literature was systematically examined and published cases of pediatric TSS occurring after burns were compiled. In June 2023, without regard for time constraints, articles that met the criteria were searched across several electronic databases. The inclusion criteria were English-language publications, pediatric patients, and reported outcomes of interest for clinical questions. Due to the heterogeneity of the included publications and the lack of data in an appropriate format, a meta-analysis was not feasible. Our research identified 23 studies published between 1980 and 2023, including 72 cases (from multiple countries) that met the inclusion criteria. Of the 72 patients with thermal injuries complicated by TSS, 53 (73.6%) children survived, 6 (8.3%) died, and for 13 (18%) cases, the outcome was not documented. Our systematic review highlights the rarity, severity, and complexity of pediatric thermal injury-associated TSS. Key findings from the review indicate that pediatric thermal injury-associated TSS carries a high mortality rate and significant morbidity. By increasing awareness, improving diagnostic accuracy, and optimizing treatment strategies, healthcare professionals can improve patient outcomes in this challenging condition.
