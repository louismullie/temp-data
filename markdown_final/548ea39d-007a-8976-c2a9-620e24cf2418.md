## Question

Kiki made 10 cucumber sandwiches and 8 egg sandwiches for the tea party. Each cucumber sandwich was cut into 4 triangles. Each egg sandwich was cut into 2 rectangles. If her guests ate 28 triangles and 12 rectangles, how many slices of bread did they eat?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many slices of bread were eaten given that 28 triangles of cucumber sandwiches and 12 rectangles of egg sandwiches were consumed, with each cucumber sandwich yielding 4 triangles and each egg sandwich yielding 2 rectangles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how many cucumber sandwiches correspond to 28 triangles. Then, I should verify how many egg sandwiches correspond to 12 rectangles. Next, I will sum the total number of sandwiches and convert that to slices of bread, assuming one slice per sandwich half. Finally, I should double-check the logic and make sure I'm not missing any assumptions about sandwich construction or cutting that would change the bread count.

> Let me first confirm the cucumber sandwich math. If each cucumber sandwich is cut into 4 triangles, then the number of sandwiches represented by 28 triangles is 28 divided by 4, which equals 7 sandwiches. Wait, let me verify that division: 4 times 7 is indeed 28, so 7 cucumber sandwiches were eaten.

> Now, I will examine the egg sandwich math. If each egg sandwich is cut into 2 rectangles, then 12 rectangles correspond to 12 divided by 2, which equals 6 egg sandwiches. Hold on, I should verify: 2 times 6 is 12, so 6 egg sandwiches were eaten.

> Next, I should review the total sandwiches and convert to bread slices. Total sandwiches eaten are 7 cucumber plus 6 egg, which equals 13 sandwiches. I need to ensure I'm mapping sandwiches to bread correctly: a typical sandwich uses two slices of bread, so 13 sandwiches would be 13 times 2, which equals 26 slices of bread. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "one slice per sandwich", but that would undercount; yes, it's two slices per sandwich, so 26 slices is correct.

> But wait, what if the cutting implies open-faced sandwiches or a different construction? Let me reconsider: the problem states Kiki made cucumber and egg sandwiches and then cut them into triangles or rectangles; the standard interpretation is that each whole sandwich begins with two slices and is then cut, so the bread count should still be 2 slices per sandwich. I should confirm there is no indication of open-faced or single-slice construction; there isn't, so 26 slices remains the right answer.

> Final answer: 26 slices of bread were eaten.

The guests ate **26 slices of bread**. Here's how: 28 triangles ÷ 4 triangles per cucumber sandwich = 7 cucumber sandwiches, and 12 rectangles ÷ 2 rectangles per egg sandwich = 6 egg sandwiches. Total sandwiches = 7 + 6 = 13, and since each sandwich uses 2 slices, the guests ate 13 × 2 = **26 slices of bread**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Cucumber sandwiches

- **Total cucumber sandwiches made**: 10
- **Triangles per cucumber sandwich**: 4
- **Total triangles from cucumber sandwiches**: 10 × 4 = 40
- **Triangles eaten**: 28
- **Cucumber sandwiches eaten**: 28 ÷ 4 = 7

---

### Egg sandwiches

- **Total egg sandwiches made**: 8
- **Rectangles per egg sandwich**: 2
- **Total rectangles from egg sandwiches**: 8 × 2 = 16
- **Rectangles eaten**: 12
- **Egg sandwiches eaten**: 12 ÷ 2 = 6

---

### Total sandwiches eaten

Total sandwiches eaten = 7 cucumber + 6 egg = **13 sandwiches**.

---

### Bread slices consumed

Each sandwich uses 2 slices of bread, so total slices = 13 × 2 = **26 slices**.

---

## Final answer

The guests ate **26 slices of bread**.

Healthy eating

We assessed consumption of unsweetened beverages, fruits and vegetables, snacks, and the number of meals per day during the last week in a self-developed food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which has not been validated so far. However, items were based on a validated FFQ previously used in wave 2 of the longitudinal cohort study "German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents" (KiGGS) and food categories were based on the food pyramid of the German Nutrition Society (DGE, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung). In the self-administered FFQ, respondents are asked questions about the frequency and about the portion size of a limited number of usually consumed foods. It is relatively inexpensive, easy and quick to administrate. However, only a limited number of foods can be included in a FFQ for feasibility reasons and to limit the burden for participants. Intervention goals in the nutrition module of JolinchenKids – fit and healthy in daycare are based on the nutrition pyramid of the AID Infoservice of the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food which is based on the recommendations of the DGE. When developing the FFQ used in our study, we therefore adapted a predefined list of foods to the nutrition pyramid of the AID. Items were developed and used to measure the consumption of water and unsweetened drinks, fruits, vegetables, bread, cereals and side dishes, milk (products), meat, fish and eggs, fats and oils, and sweets, sweet spreads, pastries or salty snacks. To assess consumption of unsweetened beverages parents were asked the following "How often did your child drink water (mineral water, tap water, homemade soda water) and unsweetened drinks (fruit tea, herbal tea) in recent weeks?" Response categories were "never/ less than one glass per week", "one to three glasses per week", "four to six glasses per week", "one glass a day", "two to three glasses a day", "four to five glasses a day", and "more than five glasses a day" wherein one glass was defined as 135 ml. To assess number of snacks per day we asked parents the following question: "How often did your child eat sweets, sweet spreads, pastries or salty snacks such as chips and french fries in recent weeks?" Response categories were "never/ less than one serving per week", "one to three servings per week", "four to six servings per week", "one serving a day", "two servings a day", "three servings per day", "four servings per day", and "more than four servings a day". One portion size was quantified as one child's hand full of a snack. In addition, the number of meals on weekdays and weekends was assessed. Based on the recommendations of the nutrition pyramid, nutrition was considered healthy, if a child consumed i) at least four glasses of unsweetened beverages, ii) at least five portions of fruits and vegetables, iii) not more than one snack per day, and iv) at least three portions of milk and dairy products per day.

Total energy intake

After the last blood collection time point total energy intake from standardized, continental, ad libitum breakfast typical for the Austrian population was determined. The total energy content of the breakfast was about 11.3 MJ, with a proportion of 46% carbohydrate, 41% fat, and 13% protein. In more detail, the breakfast consisted of four rolls, three slices of bread, 80 g of butter, 60 g of honey, 100 g of strawberry jam, 6 slices cheese (~125 g), 5 slices ham (~100 g), 180 g of wild berry yoghurt, 200 mL coffee or tea, 20 g of sugar, 40 g of coffee creamer, and 200 mL of water. For participants following a vegetarian or vegan diet, isocaloric plant-based alternatives were provided. Quantitative energy consumption was assessed by back weighing the food that was not consumed. Calculation of energy and nutrient intake was performed using the software nut.s v1.32.50 (nutritional.software, Vienna, Austria).

### Potential for elimination of folate and vitamin B deficiency in India using vitamin-fortified tea: a preliminary study [^1134o8v3]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2021). High credibility.

Vitamin-fortified tea efficaciously reverses low folate and vitamin B 12 status in Indian women

We found a high prevalence of low-vitamin B 12 and low-folate status as well as anaemia among women of childbearing-age in Sangli, India, irrespective of whether they were vegetarian or near-vegetarians — the latter are defined as non-vegetarians who consume small portions of animal-source foods often only once or twice a week. As a result, there is often little difference in dietary intake of folate and vitamin B 12 content between those consuming vegetarian or non-vegetarian diets, as best illustrated among affluent urban-dwelling individuals and neighbouring slum-dwelling individuals in North India. Because of a strongly expressed preference for food-based vitamin supplements to reverse their extant low vitamin intake and status by scores of women of childbearing-age from several states of India (see online supplemental material), our focus was on identifying a commonly-consumed, scalable, fortifiable food for rapid replenishment of folate and vitamin B 12.

Fortification with folate and vitamin B 12 did not modify the terroir of the tea, thereby retaining its acceptability to women. In addition, heat exposure of these vitamins during the brewing of tea was far less intense when compared that during breadmaking using flour fortified with both vitamins, as reported by Winkels et al. For example, despite exposure to ~500°C for ~45 min (during breadmaking) followed by autoclaving — (at 119°C for 15 min to extract vitamins from bread prior to analysis) — which led to only a 25% net loss of both vitamins, consumption of three slices of bread daily led to a significant improvement in the status of both vitamins among healthy older people. In a similar vein, both vitamins were stable during the brewing of tea using vitamin-fortified teabags because daily consumption of tea fortified with 1 mg of folate per cup over 2 months significantly improved serum folate levels in 34 of 36 women; by contrast, there was an insufficiently meaningful change in the serum folate of women consuming mock-fortified tea. Moreover, among women using teabags spiked with 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg of vitamin B 12 per cup, over one-half and two-thirds of women, respectively, increased their serum vitamin B 12 levels well into the normal range.

### A practical approach to low protein diets in Sweden-45 years of clinical use [^113XY2Y2]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Dietary recall at 1 st encounter (February 2012)

Breakfast: 2 slices of toast, butter and marmalade, one cup of tea with honey, 2–3 dL of milk, sometimes 1½ dL yogurt

Snack: coffee

Lunch: milk and cereals, possibly one cheese sandwich or omelet (2 eggs) or residues or food at lunch restaurant ex one hamburger, 1 potato, gravy, vegetables, 1 rye bread with butter. Beverage: water with lemon.

Snack: coffee and cake or bun or cheese sandwich

Dinner: cooked meal: 2 dL pasta, 1.5–2 dL meat sauce or a piece of salmon (140 g), sauce, 1 potato, carrot, parsnip or tea with 2 cheese sandwiches. Beverage: beer or water with lemon

Evening: 1 fruit

Estimated protein intake: 50–75 grams.

Since the patient is slightly overweight, the protein restriction is adjusted according to his ideal body weight, which is 75 kg (weight according to BMI 25 + 25% of weight difference): This means a daily protein intake around 45 g/day (0.6 × 75 = 45). BMI according to desirable weight was only used to calculate protein needs, not to restrict energy intake. The patient was not recommended to loose weight.

The dietician gives information about the purpose of the LPD, shows examples of low protein dishes such as diluted meat/fish dishes and cold cuts, as well as appropriate portion sizes of meat/fish. The patient is encouraged to plan his eating according to this regimen and for example distribute the 45 g of protein intake as follows: 10 g during breakfast, 12–15 g during lunch, 12–15 g during dinner and 5 g as snacks throughout the day. Graphical examples are presented to him regarding whole meals providing approximately 10–12 g protein (Fig. 3).

### The 2015 Dutch food-based dietary guidelines [^115jbhbo]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

In addition, a shift in the consumption of beverages is desirable. Health gain is obtained if sugar-containing beverages in children (average Dutch consumption three quarters of a litre per day) and adults (a quarter to a third litre) are replaced by water or by tea and filtered coffee without sugar. People who drink alcohol should limit the amount to one glass per day and avoid binge drinking.

Health gain can also be expected from limiting salt intake. This can be realized by avoiding processed foods and by not adding salt during cooking or at the table. Furthermore, it is favourable to replace butter, hard margarines, cooking fats by soft margarines, liquid cooking fats and vegetable oils. For special population groups, it is important to use extra vitamin D. In addition, women with the desire to become pregnant have to take extra folic acid, and vegans need extra vitamin B12. For the general population, it is not needed to take nutrient supplements for the prevention of chronic diseases.

Not all diet-related disorders were reviewed for the guidelines such as constipation and dental caries. Still the guidelines promote the prevention of these disorders: a higher intake of fibre prevents constipation and less (frequent) sugar consumption helps to prevent caries.

The guidelines are intended for use in the prevention of chronic diseases in the general population. Pregnant women, newborns and children up to 2 years old are outside the scope of the guidelines. Most research data relate to effects observed in adults. Although the committee included studies in children aged two and older, the data available for this group are scarce.

General
Follow a dietary pattern that involves eating more plant-based food and less animal-based food, as recommended in the guidelines.

Higher consumption recommended
Eat at least 200 g of vegetables and at least 200 g of fruit daily.
Eat at least 90 g brown bread, wholemeal bread or other whole-grain products daily.
Eat legumes weekly.
Eat at least 15 g of unsalted nuts daily.
Eat one serving of fish, preferably oily fish, weekly.
Drink three cups of tea daily.

### Addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the United States: report of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored expert panel [^113RGetM]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Appendix F — peanut protein in peanut-containing foods — states that if dietary peanut is introduced to an infant, the total peanut protein to be regularly consumed per week should be approximately 6 to 7 g over 3 or more feedings; in the LEAP trial, at evaluations conducted at 12 and 24 months of age, 75% of children in the peanut consumption group reported eating at least this amount. Choking precautions specify that whole nuts should not be given to children less than 5 years of age and that peanut butter directly from a spoon or in lumps/dollops should not be given to children less than 4 years of age. Table S-I lists amounts containing approximately 2 g of peanut protein, including Bamba 17 g or ¾ of a 28-g (1-oz) bag or 21 sticks, peanut butter 9–10 g or 2 teaspoons, and peanuts 8 g or ~10 whole peanuts (2½ teaspoons of grounded peanuts); typical serving sizes include peanut butter spread on a slice of bread or toast (16 g) and peanuts 2½ teaspoons of ground peanuts (8 g). If, after a week or more eating peanut, your infant or child displays mild allergic symptoms within 2 hours of eating peanut, you should contact your health care provider.

### "Bowel prep hyponatremia"-a state of acute water intoxication facilitated by low dietary solute intake: case report and literature review [^112DV45Y]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

On further questioning, it transpired that the patient had had very limited food intake prior to the scheduled procedure. On the day before admission (two days before the endoscopy appointment), her diet consisted of carrot-ginger soup with white bread for lunch and rusk with tea for dinner. The next day, a breakfast consisting of two slices of plain toast and a cup of coffee, followed by a broth at lunchtime, was all she had to eat. No additional salt had been added to her meals. Furthermore, the patient had been taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for the last five days because of shoulder pain (Diclofenac 50 mg bid). A diagnosis of hyponatremic encephalopathy due to acute water intoxication facilitated by poor dietary solute intake was made. On follow-up appointment 1 week later, the patient was well and electrolytes were normal. Adrenal function was tested and found to be intact.

### Effect of longer family meals on children's fruit and vegetable intake: a randomized clinical trial [^11311DdY]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Trial Outcomes

Video cameras simultaneously recorded the meals from 2 angles: frontal view of the child and frontal view of the parent. The recordings were merged into 1 double-view movie and coded using Datavyu software, version 1.2.2 (Datavyu Team).

Food consumption of the parent-child dyads was coded from the video recordings by independent coders using a standardized coding system. Key variables were the number of pieces of fruits and vegetables, the number of bread and cold cuts (ie, slices of bread, cheese, and cold cut meat; teaspoons of butter and sweet spreads), the amount of dessert (teaspoons of chocolate pudding or fruit yogurt; number of cookies), and the amount of water and sugar-sweetened beverages in milliliters (estimated to the nearest 100 mL). All participants were offered the same food and beverage categories (ie, fruits and vegetables, bread and cold cuts, dessert, and water and sugar-sweetened beverages) and serving sizes. Foods served were held constant within families across regular and longer conditions. The exact food type (eg, type of bread and type of fruit) reflected the child's preferences (eg, favorite bread and top-3 preferred fruits) that were reported in the online preassessment and thus varied between families. Due to the natural variation in the size of fruits and vegetables, it was not possible to ensure that all pieces were uniform. The weight range was 10 to 14 g for cherry tomatoes and 6 to 10 g for grapes and tangerine segments. Other fruits and vegetables (eg, apples and cucumbers) were cut into pieces weighing 9 to 11 g. Variability in size likely balanced out across conditions.

### The effectiveness of walking exercise on the bowel preparation before colonoscopy: a single blind randomized clinical trial [^116af1i6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The day before the colonoscopy

The intervention group participants were supposed to eat a light breakfast at 8 a.m. without milk and other dairy products. From 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. they were allowed to drink only clear liquids in the amount of 8 to 10 glasses (such as water, tea, or lemon juice) and walk for 5 min. From 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. they were told to eat a light lunch (like a piece of cooked chicken with a slice of bread) and two bisacodyl pills and then walk for 5 min. Then the patients were not allowed to eat any solid food until the colonoscopy procedure. The patients were told to dissolve three packs of PEG in 3 L of water (approximately equivalent to 12 to 13 full glasses) drink about one glass of this solution (the first PEG solution) every 15 to 20 min from 3 p.m. and walk for 5 min.

The participants were supposed to eat two other bisacodyl pills at 6 p.m. and walk for 5 min. After finishing the first PEG solution, our patients were allowed to drink clear liquids such as water, tea, and completely strained fruit juice as much as they wanted and walk for 5 min. After finishing the first PEG solution, they were allowed to rest for about 2 h. They were supposed to dissolve two other packets of PEG powder in two liters of water (about eight glasses) and then drink them (the second PEG solution) from 9 p.m. every 15 to 20 min and walk for 5 min. After finishing the second PEG solution, the patients were forbidden to eat or drink anything until the colonoscopy.

The day before the colonoscopy for the control group was similar to the intervention group, but the participants were not told to walk.

Patients were given smart bands (Mi band 2, Xiaomi) and monitored to assess the number of footsteps taken. An alert patient companion observed all steps of the protocol for each patient.

### The largest last supper: depictions of food portions and plate size increased over the millennium [^1137wkfc]. International Journal of Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

Portion sizes of foods have been noticably increasing in recent years, but when did this trend begin? If art imitates life and if food portions have been generally increasing with time, we might expect this trend to be reflected in paintings that depict food. Perhaps the most commonly painted meal has been that of Jesus Christ's Last Supper, chronicled in the New Testament of the Bible. A CAD-CAM analysis of the relative food-to-head ratio in 52 representative paintings of the Last Supper showed that the relative sizes of the main dish (entree) (r = 0.52, P = 0.002), bread (r = 0.30, P = 0.04), and plates (r = 0.46, P = 0.02) have linearly increased over the past millennium.

### How important is the choice of the nutrient profile model used to regulate broadcast advertising of foods to children? A comparison using a targeted data set [^117Dignz]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Commercials were excluded from the data set if they were (1) for an alcoholic drink or for tea/coffee or chewing gum; (2) for a retailer that provides a broad range of products (for example, a supermarket); (3) for a food product for babies or toddlers; or (4) for weight-loss or weight-gain shakes. A total of 11, 763 commercials remained after these exclusions.

The remaining commercials were categorised as follows: (1) single food items; (2) single brands that include a range of products (for example, Golden Wonder Pot Noodles, which are available in 12 flavours in the UK); and (3) meals that incorporate more than one food item (for example, McDonald's Big Mac Meal). Nutrition data were sourced for these three categories as follows: for single food items, company websites were reviewed and all available nutrition data and recommended serving sizes were taken. When information that is usually available from nutrition information panels was not available from the company web site, food packaging was sourced and nutrition data were extracted. These data were supplemented with nutrition data for a similar food from a UK food composition table of generic foods(for example, nutrition data for Kerry Cheestrings was supplemented with data on the generic food 'Cheese, processed slices or block'). For brands, a single product from the range was selected randomly to represent the brand, and nutrition data were sourced as for single food items. For meals, nutrition data for each component of the meal were sourced as for single food items. Using serving size data, the nutrition data were then combined to create weighted-average nutrition data for the meal (including drinks). Throughout, when serving size data were not available from company web sites they were supplemented by a UK serving size guide. An internal validity exercise was conducted to assess the similarity between Supplementary Data from the generic food composition table and data extracted directly from web sites/ packaging, when both sets of data were available. Correlation (assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient) between the two sets of data ranged from r = 0.62 for sodium per 100 g to r = 0.92 for energy per 100 g, indicating that agreement between the two data sources was strong. For 324 of the 336 included foods, we were able to extract nutritional data from web sites or food packaging.

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^113K93DR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis — alternative regimen composition and fluoroquinolone use — is guided as follows: once-weekly isoniazid (INH) 900 mg plus rifapentine (RPT) 600 mg may be considered for use only in HIV-uninfected persons without cavitation on chest radiography, and otherwise we recommend against use of once-weekly therapy with INH 900 mg plus RPT 600 mg (Recommendation 4c: strong recommendation; high certainty in the evidence). If pyrazinamide (PZA) cannot be included or resistance to PZA is determined, experts recommend a regimen consisting of INH, rifampin (RIF), and ethambutol (EMB) for the initial 2 months followed by INH and RIF for 7 months given either daily or thrice weekly. When substituting a fluoroquinolone for EMB or INH, all alternative regimens are 6 months or longer in duration, and we recommend against the routine use of 4-month fluoroquinolone-containing regimens for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. A single randomized trial regimen of daily moxifloxacin/RIF/PZA/EMB for 2 months followed by once-weekly 1200 mg RPT + 400 mg moxifloxacin for 4 continuation phase months had relapse rates similar to the standard 6-month regimen given daily, and use of this regimen may be considered; each dose of RPT was preceded by a meal of 2 boiled eggs and slices of bread. Of note, there is no evidence that a once-weekly continuation phase comprised of 1200 mg RPT + 400 mg moxifloxacin after 2 months of intensive phase INH/RIF/PZA/EMB, without moxifloxacin in place of EMB in the intensive phase, would achieve similar outcomes.

### Periconceptional bread intakes indicate new zealand's proposed mandatory folic acid fortification program may be outdated: results from a postpartum survey [^113sK1xk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

The Vitamins and Minerals in Pregnancy Survey was a retrospective survey of postpartum women in birthing centers and hospitals located across New Zealand between March 7 and April 15, 2011. Participating sites included: Tauranga Hospital, Tauranga; Whakatane Hospital, Whakatane; River Ridge East Birth Centre, Waterford Birth Centre and Waikato Hospital, Hamilton; Hutt Hospital, Lower Hutt; Kenepuru Community Hospital and Wellington Hospital, Wellington; Christchurch Women's Hospital, Christchurch; Queen Mary Maternity Hospital, Dunedin; and Southland Hospital, Invercargill. Women aged 18 y or over who had delivered a healthy term (≥ 37 wk gestation) infant and could communicate in English were eligible for participation. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Multi-Region Ethics Committee of the New Zealand Ministry of Health.

Survey questionnaire

An anonymous, self-administered 65-item questionnaire was developed based on similar postpartum questionnaires used elsewhere. The questionnaire included items on dietary supplement use and usual bread intake before and during pregnancy, as well as maternal socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics. Participants were asked whether they ate non-organic, shop-bought bread. If yes, participants were asked how many servings of bread they consumed per day in the month before pregnancy and during each trimester of pregnancy (i.e. months 1–3, 4–6 and 7–9 of pregnancy). One slice of bread with a median weight of 33.0 g was defined as single serving, with items such as rolls, buns, pita bread, focaccia, Turkish pide, naan, bagels, English muffins and sweet buns being equivalent to two bread slices/servings. Using the proposed level of mandatory bread fortification of 135 μg folic acid per 100 g bread, the average daily folic acid intake from bread for each individual was estimated. Pre-testing and refinement of the questionnaire was undertaken in January 2011 with eight pregnant volunteers.

Each establishment may have up to six NAICS codes to reflect the types of products produced; all six NAICS codes were used to identify whether an establishment should be classified as a food processing. employment counts may be better treated as a general missing data problem rather than a problem specific to the smallest establishment size category. We classified each industry at the NAICS level into four size categories: fewer than 20 employees, 20 to 99 employees, 100 to 499 employees, and 500 or more employees. There are 42. available for the company's headquarters, not the branch establishments.

Initial testing for gluten-related disorders — pretest gluten consumption affects serology, as "Serological tests for CD are dependent on the consumption of gluten, and avoidance of gluten before testing can result in a false-negative test result", and experts agree "the ingestion of ≥ 10 g of gluten (equivalent to 2 slices of whole wheat bread) per day for ≥ 8 weeks should allow for confident interpretation of the tTG antibody test result". Available assays include "IgA and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against gliadin (AGA), endomysium (EMA), tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and deamidated gliadin peptides (DGPs)".

### Periconceptional bread intakes indicate new zealand's proposed mandatory folic acid fortification program may be outdated: results from a postpartum survey [^1129GW2G]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Nearly 15 y have elapsed since the collection of data upon which New Zealand's current mandatory fortification proposal is based, and our data indicates bread consumption has decreased markedly from a median of 3–4 slices/d to 2 slices/d in the target group of childbearing-age women. If mandatory fortification is implemented as proposed, we estimate the age- and ethnicity-weighted mean additional folic acid intake to be 119 μg/d among women prior to pregnancy, well below the intended 140 μg/d. Given the bread consumption data collected in this study, to achieve the targeted additional intake of 140 μg/d, a mandatory fortification level of 160 μg folic acid/100 g bread may be required. Nonetheless, the results of our study indicate that the least advantaged segments of the target population will benefit from the mandate if implemented as currently proposed. Additional folic acid intakes were shown to be greatest among Pacific and indigenous Māori ethnic groups, those with increased parity, lower income and education, younger and single mothers and women with unplanned pregnancies. Conversely, subgroups predicted to derive the least benefit from the proposed bread scheme are women of Asian descent and those with a postgraduate education.

### 'After mealtime is before mealtime'-an ethnographic exploration of nursing home residents' practices of dealing with meal requirements [^111386jh]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

To avoid questions from caregivers and thus regain more control over their own food intake, residents have developed various strategies. If lunch is not at all tasty, residents switch to having a snack between meals. A late breakfast is also an excuse not to have lunch. But, as some residents explained, sweet snacks are not a good substitute for lunch. Therefore, in Facility 1, bread with sausage or cheese was also offered as an afternoon snack.

Mrs Kainz increasingly opts for snacks between meals, as she can never be sure what lunch will be like. However, if lunch was not to her liking and she let it go back almost untouched, the comments of the nursing staff would be unpleasant. In addition, she would have to wait until there was something to eat again, because in principle she very much likes to eat. Then, she remarked, one could 'keep one's head above water' with the snack at 2 pm, but the sweet pastries were not a smart alternative, because for her only savoury dishes are considered a 'full meal' This could also be a slice of bread with sausage or cheese. In Facility 2, where she lives, however, there is only a sweet pastry for snacks and not bread with a savoury topping. As Mrs Kainz does not have visitors, she cannot organise any alternatives to the foreseen meal plan and the selection of additional meals in the facility if she does not like what is offered, as is the strategy of Mr Armbauer, for example. His daughter comes to visit him once a week and brings all the food that he 'misses' in Facility 1. Besides home-cooked soups, which are warmed up for supper for Mr Armbauer – if the personnel are willing to do so –, family baked goods, puddings, yogurts, juices and sausages are brought by his daughter. These are kept in the ward fridge, labelled with the resident's name, and are handed to Mr Armbauer on request – again, if the staff is willing to do so. Because he is looking forward to these special treats, he makes sure that he leaves 'enough space' for it during the day's mealtimes. Therefore, he does not take a snack in the afternoon and only eats enough of lunch so that no questions are asked.

### Reduced mortality among whole grain bread eaters in men and women in the Norwegian county study [^114xnEj2]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To study whether mortality is reduced among whole grain eaters in Norway.

Design

Non-interventional, prospective, baseline 1977–1983, followed for mortality through to 1994.

Setting

Three Norwegian counties.

Subjects

A total of 16,933 men and 16,915 women; systematic screening of all residents aged 35-56y at baseline, not disabled and free of cardiovascular disease (79% response rate).

Predictor Variable

We combined self-report of type and number of bread slices (white, light whole grain, dense whole grain) to form a whole grain bread score, with range 0.05 (1 slice per day, made with 5% whole grain flour) to 5.4 (9 slices per day, made with 60% whole grain flour).

Results

Norwegian whole grain bread eaters were less likely to be smokers, were more physically active, had lower serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, and ate less total and saturated fat as a proportion of energy intake than white bread eaters. After adjustment for age, energy intake, sex, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking, body mass index, physical activity at leisure and work, and use of cod liver oil or other vitamin supplements, hazard rate ratios (HRR) for total mortality were inverse and graded across whole grain bread score categories (category 5 vs category 1 HRR: 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.63–0.89 in men and 0.66, 0.44–0.98 in women).

Conclusion

Protection by whole grain intake against chronic disease is suggested in Norway, where four times as much whole grain is consumed as in the United States.

These "food signs" are highly memorable and easily recognizable and include findings that resemble various fruits and vegetables; meat, fish, and egg dishes; pasta, rice, grains, and bread (carbohydrates); desserts, cakes, and candy; and dishes, cutlery, condiments, and so on. It is important that radiologists recognize these classic signs, which will allow confident diagnosis on the basis of imaging findings alone or narrowing of the differential diagnosis.

### Periconceptional bread intakes indicate new zealand's proposed mandatory folic acid fortification program may be outdated: results from a postpartum survey [^1163JM23]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Study sample characteristics

Of the 968 women invited to participate, 758 agreed. Thirty-five women did not meet inclusion criteria for maternal age or gestational duration, resulting in a total sample of 723 (75%). Median maternal age (IQR) was 31 y (8 y), similar to the national median recorded in the year ended March 2011 (30 y). Almost half of all deliveries were to primiparous women (45%) and 44% of all pregnancies were unplanned, comparable to data reported recently from a large, Auckland-based study (43% and 40%, respectively). Two-thirds (66%) of women held a post-secondary qualification, and 42% reported an annual household income below the national median for 2010 (64,272 NZ$). Most women were married or cohabitating (91%). Compared to recent national maternity data, this sample had a higher proportion of New Zealand Europeans (65% versus 56%), a lower proportion of Māori (14% versus 21%) and Pacific women (5% versus 11%), and a similar proportion of Asians (9% versus 10%). Post-stratification weighting was performed using age and ethnicity groups and analyses reported hereafter are weighted and incorporate robust standard errors with sites treated as clusters.

Bread consumption in the periconceptional period

Before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy 86% of women consumed bread that would be fortified if mandatory fortification were implemented as currently proposed. Mean bread intake in first trimester was greater than that prior to conception (+0.21 slices/d, 95% CI = 0.09–0.34; p = 0.004) (Table 1). Correspondingly, estimated mean folic acid intake derived from bread if fortified at the proposed level increased in the first trimester by almost 10 μg/d (9.53 μg/d, 95% CI = 3.92–15.16; p = 0.004).

Celiac disease diagnostic pathway — biopsy avoidance in symptomatic children and at-risk patients is outlined as a "Suggested biopsy-avoiding diagnostic pathway for coeliac disease". For symptomatic patients with high serologic titers, "If the antibody titer is above ×10 upper limit of normal in a symptomatic patient, the guidelines give the option to perform further tests (TG2-IgA, EMA, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8) in a second blood sample", and "If they are all confirmative, the child may be diagnosed with CD provided symptoms subside after the institution of a GFD", which "may reduce the need of EGD by 30% to 50%". The flow includes branches such as "TG2-IgA > 10×ULN, IgA normal" and "Biopsy: Histology positive (Marsh ≥ 2)", while for asymptomatic or at-risk children, "A positive anti-TG2 result should lead to biopsies and histological analysis for diagnosis", and "Potential coeliac disease suggests further follow-up". When diagnosis is sought after self-initiated diet change, "we suggest that the patient goes back on a normal diet with 3 slices of wheat bread daily for 1 to 3 months followed by TG2-IgA determination".

### Effect of longer family meals on children's fruit and vegetable intake: a randomized clinical trial [^113CYu3t]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This randomized clinical trial found that children consumed significantly more fruits and vegetables when family meals lasted 10 minutes longer, on average. The 7 additional pieces of fruits and vegetables (on average) corresponded to approximately 1 portion or 100 g (eg, 1 medium apple). This outcome has practical importance for public health because 1 additional daily portion reduces the risk of cardiometabolic disease by 6% to 7%. Moreover, this outcome was specific to fruits and vegetables; children did not eat significantly more of the other foods on offer. This finding is in line with results of cross-sectional studies showing that longer family meals are associated with better diet quality in childrenas well as with observational studiesand 1 randomized clinical trialin the school context. That trialfound that extending school lunch time increased fruit and vegetable intake.

Higher intake of fruits and vegetables during longer meals cannot be explained by longer exposure to food alone; otherwise, an increased intake of bread and cold cuts would have occurred. One possible explanation is that the fruits and vegetables were cut into bite-sized pieces, making them convenient to eat. Previous studies found that longer exposure to accessible foods increased the intake of these foods. Inconvenience or frictionmay explain why children did not consume more of the main components, such as bread or cheese, during longer meals; grabbing a bite-sized piece of fruit seemed more convenient than topping a slice of bread with cheese. Explorative analyses showed that the longer the meal lasted, the more fruits and vegetables the children ate and that more vegetables were eaten from the start, whereas the additional fruit was consumed during the extra time.

Additionally, longer family meals were associated with a slower eating rate, increased satiety, and a lower risk of obesity in childrenpotentially because increased satiety played a role in reduced snacking between meals. We did not find a more positive mealtime atmosphere during the longer condition possibly because the laboratory setting led to more socially desirable communication, resulting in a ceiling effect.

In a linear regression analysis predicting percent weight change, adjusted for age, education, income, RDS score, physical activity, and smoking status, these factors explained only 5.6% of the variance for men and 5.8% for women. Adding food categories and specific foods increased the explained variance to 20.6% for men and 17.5% for women (Fig. 4 B). For men, adding 1 cup of rice (~ 220 kcal) daily was linked to a 2.5% weight gain, and 1 slice of whole wheat bread slightly increased weight. Conversely, 1 egg (~ 80 kcal) was linked to a 1.2% weight decrease, and 1 portion of beef (~ 265 kcal) was linked to a 1.5% decrease, with fruits and vegetable salad having a small effect. In women, 1 pita bread (~ 200 kcal) was associated with a 2.1% weight gain, 1 slice of pizza (~ 300 kcal) with a 2.2% gain, and 1 portion of rice with a 1.6% gain, as well as rye bread. Conversely, 1 apple (~ 80 kcal) was linked to a 1.2% weight decrease, and a handful of cashew nuts (~ 250 kcal) were linked to a 3.4% decrease, with vegetables having a slight effect. Interestingly, changes in total energy intake contributed to the model in women but not men (Figs. 4 C-4D, and Supplementary Material 1: Tables S11-S12).

AGA Clinical Practice Update — gluten exposure and HLA testing in diagnosis: Best Practice Advice 7 notes, "Reduction or avoidance of gluten before diagnostic testing is discouraged, as it may reduce the sensitivity of both serology and biopsy testing", and Best Practice Advice 8 advises, "When patients have already started on a GFD before diagnosis, we suggest that the patient go back on a normal diet with 3 slices of wheat bread daily preferably for 1 to 3 months before repeat determination of TG2-IgA". Best Practice Advice 9 states, "Determination of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 has a limited role in the diagnosis of CD. Its value is largely related to its negative predictive value to rule out CD in patients who are seronegative in the face of histologic changes, in patients who do not have serologic confirmation at the time of diagnosis, and in those patients with a historic diagnosis of CD; especially as very young children before the introduction of celiac-specific serology".

### Parenting a child with phenylketonuria (PKU): an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of the experience of parents [^111pqL1G]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2018). Low credibility.

Fear of Child Feeling Different

Parents described that PKU was invisible until occasions where food was present. As food was viewed as an important part of social life, parents expressed concerns about their child fitting in, being treated differently compared to others, or that their child would feel different from others or be excluded.

Jemima: I worry about [child] going to high school… I worry about him being in primary school and being picked on… food is such a social side of your life these days… everyone goes out for tea… and stuff like that, and it breaks my heart to think, you know… that's gonna be difficult for [child].

Concerns were present and future based; parents considered both the social impact of PKU later in their child's life (e.g. at parties, school) and how they would cope with the increased demands of minimising this impact. Parents feared their child missing out on opportunities because of their PKU and felt determined to prevent this from happening. Parents were concerned their child would feel different within the family. Parents were navigating challenges, such as eating together, considering the impact on siblings, and striking a balance that was fair to their child and did not affect family members.

Nina: But it was hard to accept that he was going to have a different… kind of life, if you like… and then I kept thinking really far in the future like… thought about when he wants to go to parties… and… other kids are eating cake and… he can't join in… and you know… when he's a teenager and they all go to McDonald's, and he… he's just got to sit there with a little bag of fries…

### Vaccine-induced anaphylaxis in a child with cow's milk allergy: lactose hydrate was the culprit [^116W52sh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the cause of the potentially fatal viral encephalitis that is endemic in the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions. Although JE vaccines are generally safe, sporadic cases of anaphylaxis as a vaccine adverse event (ie, 0.42 cases per million vaccinations in 2013–2020) have been reported in Japan. The cause of anaphylaxis, however, has not been well described. Here, we report a case of anaphylaxis following JE vaccination of a child with cow's milk allergy, and by using the basophil activation test (BAT), we confirmed the lactose hydrate in the vaccine as the culprit allergen.

The patient was a 3-year-old boy with milk allergy, egg allergy, and allergic rhinitis. He avoided milk from the age of 7 months, at which time he had manifested symptoms of urticaria after eating a food containing skimmed milk powder. At the age of 3 years, he was able to consume a bread containing a small amount of milk (about 0.1 mL of milk per slice) without any symptoms. However, 1 month later, he started to feel itching of the tongue after eating the same bread. At the age of 3 years and 6 months, he received the first dose of a JE vaccine (ENCEVAC [Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute, Kumamoto, Japan]) at a local clinic. He developed a cough and generalized urticaria 40 minutes after the vaccination. He was transferred to an emergency hospital, and anaphylaxis was diagnosed. Intramuscular epinephrine and an intravenous corticosteroid alleviated the symptoms. Later, he was referred to our department to determine the cause of the anaphylaxis.

### Delayed gastric emptying and reduced postprandial small bowel water content of equicaloric whole meal bread versus rice meals in healthy subjects: novel MRI insights [^113fC2o1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging

MRI scanning was carried out supine on a 1.5T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). Gastric emptying was assessed using a balanced gradient echo sequence acquiring 24 contiguous axial slices with reconstructed in-plane resolution 1.56 × 1.56 mm 2, slice thickness 10 mm, echo time TE = 1.2 ms, repetition time TR = 2.4 ms, flip angle 45° and one breath hold of ∼10 s. This imaging sequence yields good contrast between the stomach contents and other abdominal organs. Samples containing mobile water appear brighter than viscous samples with reduced water content and mobility. The content of apparent freely mobile water in the small bowel (SBWC) was assessed as previously described and validated, using a single-shot fast spin echo sequence acquiring 24 contiguous coronal slices with reconstructed in-plane resolution 0.78 × 0.78 mm 2, slice thickness 7 mm, TE = 320 ms, TR = 8000 ms and one breath hold of 24 s. This sequence yields high-intensity signals from areas with freely mobile fluid and dark signals from poorly mobile or bound water and all other body tissues. At each time point, the positioning of the subject, setup and data collection took ∼5 min, after which the volunteers were kept sitting upright in a quiet lounge next to the scanner. After the in vivo study was completed, to further understand our results we scanned WMB, RP and gluten-free bread samples in vitro 90 min after hydrating with saliva by chewing and spitting the resulting chyme into a bowl to compare the resulting signal changes with the in vivo findings.

### Population-scale dietary interests during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1163Z32B]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has altered people's lives around the world. Here we document population-wide shifts in dietary interests in 18 countries in 2020, as revealed through time series of Google search volumes. We find that during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic there was an overall surge in food interest, larger and longer-lasting than the surge during typical end-of-year holidays in Western countries. The shock of decreased mobility manifested as a drastic increase in interest in consuming food at home and a corresponding decrease in consuming food outside of home. The largest (up to threefold) increases occurred for calorie-dense carbohydrate-based foods such as pastries, bakery products, bread, and pies. The observed shifts in dietary interests have the potential to globally affect food consumption and health outcomes. These findings can inform governmental and organizational decisions regarding measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on diet and nutrition.

### Prospective analysis reveals associations between carbohydrate intakes, genetic predictors of short-chain fatty acid synthesis, and colorectal cancer risk [^113hKDYx]. Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic factors

To assess for an effect modification between host genetically predicted SCFA production PGS and intakes of carbohydrate types and sources and colorectal cancer risk, we used an LRT comparing the main multivariable model with a model with an interaction term between the carbohydrate source (per 5% energy increment) or fiber intake (per 5 g/day increment) with the butyrate PGS or propionate PGS, separating participants by the median PGS for both butyrate and propionate (low or high PGS). We also adjusted models for the first 10 principal components of ancestry to reduce the potential impact of population stratification.

We further conducted a sensitivity analysis assessing intakes of fiber from breads and cereals derived from the few dietary questions asked at the baseline questionnaire with colorectal cancer risk by the butyrate and propionate PGS in the larger UK Biobank sample (n = 343,621; 4,191 cases of colorectal cancer). The fiber from breads and cereals variable was calculated using the consumption frequency and type of bread and cereals reported by individuals at their recruitment visit. Specifically, participants were asked how many slices of bread or bowls of cereal they consumed per week as well as the type of bread and cereal they mainly consumed. From these responses, the NSP contents (in grams) of slices of bread and breakfast cereals were determined based on the frequency of consumption and types of bread or cereal reported in the touchscreen questionnaire. The estimated intakes of fiber from cereal and fiber from bread were then summed to obtain the total intake of fiber from breads and cereals. Further details of the calculation of the fiber from breads and cereals from the touchscreen questionnaire have been described in greater detail elsewhere and further details of this sensitivity analysis can be found in the Supplementary Methods.

All analyses were conducted using Stata version 17.0, and P values were two-sided with P < 0.05 being considered statistically significant.

### Effect of 2 pieces of nutritional advice on folate status in Swedish women: a randomized controlled trial [^115jNwVX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ten years after the introduction of mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States, Canada, and Costa Rica, the issue is still under debate in several countries, and Sweden recently decided against mandatory fortification.

Objective

The objective was to determine the folate status of women after an intervention involving 2 Swedish dietary recommendations: a food recommendation (bread) and a complete meal recommendation (breakfast).

Design

Fifty-one free-living women with normal folate status participated in a 12-wk controlled intervention trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following interventions: apple juice (control group; n = 17), a breakfast providing 125 microg folate (breakfast group; n = 17), or 5 slices of whole-meal bread to be eaten over the course of the day, which provided 70 microg folate (bread group; n = 17). Folate status was assessed on the basis of concentrations of erythrocyte folate, serum folate, and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and at weeks 8 and 12 of the trial.

Results

In the breakfast group, initial median concentrations of erythrocyte folate (805 nmol/L) increased by 172 nmol/L (95% CI: 24, 293; P = 0.02) relative to the control. The relative increase in initial serum folate (2 nmol/L, 95% CI: 0, 5; P = 0.06) was nonsignificant. The initial tHcy concentration (8.7 micromol/L) decreased by 2.3 micromol/L (95% CI: -1, -3.4; P < 0.01). In the bread group, the initial tHcy concentration (9.1 micromol/L) decreased nonsignificantly by 1.4 micromol/L (95% CI: 0, -2.8; P = 0.08) relative to the control group, whereas other outcomes were stable.

Conclusions

The folate status of the subjects improved after regular consumption of the breakfast meal. The additional folate intake from the bread maintained the folate status but was not sufficient to improve it.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^112M6AyC]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Rye Bread

Statements on rye bread were derived from the evidence generated in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of two RCTs that included 48 people with chronic constipation and investigated the effect of rye bread (6 or 8 slides/day) compared to white bread for 3 weeks.

Two RCTs, including 48 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of rye bread on stool frequency compared to white bread. Overall, rye bread significantly increased stool frequency by +0.43 bowel movements/week (95% CI 0.03, 0.83 bowel movements/week) compared to white bread. However, the magnitude of effect was small, which is reflected in the strength of recommendation (qualified). In addition, the dose was 6 or 8 slices of rye bread per day, which may not be a realistic or manageable dose for some patients.

Two RCTs, including 48 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of rye bread on global symptoms of constipation (including severity of abdominal pain, flatulence, borborygmi, abdominal bloating, constipation, and diarrhea) compared to white bread using a questionnaire with scores raging 0–18 (higher score, worse global symptoms). Overall, rye bread increased the global symptom score by +2.00 points (95% CI 0.48, 3.53) compared to white bread. Therefore, rye bread worsened global symptoms. However, the magnitude of the effect was small and may not be clinically important to patients.

TABLE 3
Frequency of consumption of 39 food groups across days and meals: percentage of days and meals in which foods were consumed (n = 814) 1

Not all food groups with strong correlations (see Figure 2) were consumed frequently (see Table 3). Across days, only "bread" and "processed meat" correlated strongly and were also frequently consumed (98.1% and 78.5%, respectively). For breakfast, frequencies of consumption did not further relate to the correlations. At lunch, "potatoes" (in grams) were the most frequently consumed food (49.1%) and showed strong correlations with other food groups on Supplemental Figure 3. For afternoon snacks, the strong positive correlation between "coffee" and "cakes and cookies" (Supplemental Figure 4) related to a high frequency of consumption (63.3% and 51.6%, respectively). Finally, we could relate dinner food intake correlations (Supplemental Figure 5) to food consumption frequency values for "bread" with "cheese" and with "processed meat" (consumed at 72.0%, 47.4%, and 53.7% of dinners, respectively).

### Whole grain consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all cause and cause specific mortality: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies [^114XcbDA]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To quantify the dose-response relation between consumption of whole grain and specific types of grains and the risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all cause and cause specific mortality.

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase searched up to 3 April 2016.

Study Selection

Prospective studies reporting adjusted relative risk estimates for the association between intake of whole grains or specific types of grains and cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all cause or cause specific mortality.

Data Synthesis

Summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals calculated with a random effects model.

Results

45 studies (64 publications) were included. The summary relative risks per 90 g/day increase in whole grain intake (90 g is equivalent to three servings-for example, two slices of bread and one bowl of cereal or one and a half pieces of pita bread made from whole grains) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.87; I(2) = 9%, n = 7 studies) for coronary heart disease, 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03; I(2) = 56%, n = 6) for stroke, and 0.78 (0.73 to 0.85; I(2) = 40%, n = 10) for cardiovascular disease, with similar results when studies were stratified by whether the outcome was incidence or mortality. The relative risks for morality were 0.85 (0.80 to 0.91; I(2) = 37%, n = 6) for total cancer, 0.83 (0.77 to 0.90; I(2) = 83%, n = 11) for all causes, 0.78 (0.70 to 0.87; I(2) = 0%, n = 4) for respiratory disease, 0.49 (0.23 to 1.05; I(2) = 85%, n = 4) for diabetes, 0.74 (0.56 to 0.96; I(2) = 0%, n = 3) for infectious diseases, 1.15 (0.66 to 2.02; I(2) = 79%, n = 2) for diseases of the nervous system disease, and 0.78 (0.75 to 0.82; I(2) = 0%, n = 5) for all non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes. Reductions in risk were observed up to an intake of 210–225 g/day (seven to seven and a half servings per day) for most of the outcomes. Intakes of specific types of whole grains including whole grain bread, whole grain breakfast cereals, and added bran, as well as total bread and total breakfast cereals were also associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and/or all cause mortality, but there was little evidence of an association with refined grains, white rice, total rice, or total grains.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis provides further evidence that whole grain intake is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and total cancer, and mortality from all causes, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, diabetes, and all non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes. These findings support dietary guidelines that recommend increased intake of whole grain to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality.

### Periconceptional bread intakes indicate new zealand's proposed mandatory folic acid fortification program may be outdated: results from a postpartum survey [^112QpWrF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In September 2009, a folic acid fortification mandate (135 μg/100 g bread) was to be implemented in New Zealand. However, due to political and manufacturer objection, fortification was deferred until May 2012. Based on estimates of bread consumption derived from a 1997 nationally representative survey, this program was intended to deliver a mean additional intake of 140 μg folic acid/d to women of childbearing age. Little is known about current bread consumption patterns in this target group. The aim of this study was to assess bread consumption among women prior to and during pregnancy with the intent to estimate periconceptional folic acid intakes that would be derived from bread if mandatory fortification were implemented as currently proposed.

Methods

A retrospective survey of 723 postpartum women in hospitals and birthing centres across New Zealand was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire on bread intake prior to and during pregnancy and maternal socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics.

Results

Median bread intake before conception (2 slices/d) was below that of previous data upon which the current fortification proposal was modeled (3–4 slices/d). If mandatory fortification is implemented as proposed, only 31% (95% CI = 24%-37%) of childbearing-age women would attain an additional folic acid intake of ≥ 140 μg/d, with a mean of 119 μg/d (95% CI = 107 μg/d-130 μg/d). Based on these data, a fortification level of 160 μg/100 g bread is required to achieve the targeted mean of 140 μg folic acid/d. Nonetheless, under the current proposal additional folic acid intakes would be greatest among the least advantaged segments of the target population: Pacific and indigenous Māori ethnic groups; those with increased parity, lower income and education; younger and single mothers; and women with unplanned pregnancies. Subgroups predicted to derive less than adequate folic acid intakes from the proposed policy were women of Asian descent and those with a postgraduate education.

Conclusions

This study provides insight on the ability of a fortification policy to benefit the groups at highest risk of poor folate intakes in a population. However, bread consumption among the target group of childbearing women appears to have declined since the data used in previous dietary modeling were collected. Thus, it seems prudent to re-model dietary folic acid intakes based on more recent national survey data prior to the implementation of a mandatory folic acid fortification policy.

### A one-quarter reduction in the salt content of bread can be made without detection [^116JpcCd]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if it is possible to deliver a one-quarter reduction in the sodium content of bread without detection.

Design

Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

The Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Australia.

Participants

One-hundred and ten volunteers from the hospital staff that completed 94% of scheduled assessments.

Intervention

Six consecutive weeks of bread with usual sodium content or six consecutive weeks of bread with cumulating 5% reductions in sodium content each week.

Main Outcome Measure

The proportion of participants reporting a difference in the salt content of the study bread from week to week.

Results

The intervention group were no more likely than the control group to report a difference in the salt content of the bread from week to week (P = 0.8). Similarly, there were no differences between randomized groups in the scores for flavour (P = 0.08) or liking of the bread (P = 0.95) over the study follow-up period. However, the saltiness scores recorded on a visual analogue scale did decline in the intervention group compared with the control group (P = 0.01)

Conclusions

A one-quarter reduction in the sodium content of white bread can be delivered over a short time period, while maintaining consumer acceptance. Over the long term, and particularly if achieved for multiple foods, a decrease in sodium content of this magnitude would be expected to reduce population levels of blood pressure and the risks of stroke and heart attack.

### Bread affects clinical parameters and induces gut microbiome-associated personal glycemic responses [^111xTyms]. Cell Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Bread is consumed daily by billions of people, yet evidence regarding its clinical effects is contradicting. Here, we performed a randomized crossover trial of two 1-week-long dietary interventions comprising consumption of either traditionally made sourdough-leavened whole-grain bread or industrially made white bread. We found no significant differential effects of bread type on multiple clinical parameters. The gut microbiota composition remained person specific throughout this trial and was generally resilient to the intervention. We demonstrate statistically significant interpersonal variability in the glycemic response to different bread types, suggesting that the lack of phenotypic difference between the bread types stems from a person-specific effect. We further show that the type of bread that induces the lower glycemic response in each person can be predicted based solely on microbiome data prior to the intervention. Together, we present marked personalization in both bread metabolism and the gut microbiome, suggesting that understanding dietary effects requires integration of person-specific factors.

### Ultra-processed food and incident type 2 diabetes: studying the underlying consumption patterns to unravel the health effects of this heterogeneous food category in the prospective lifelines cohort [^113QFquw]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Notwithstanding the high heterogeneity among different types of UPF, previous studies on the health consequences of UPF mainly focused on its overall intake. To our knowledge, the current study is the first that investigated the relation of overall intake and consumption patterns of UPF with incident type 2 diabetes in a large population-based sample. Our findings emphasize that it is crucial to consider various habitual UPF consumption patterns and their unique food groups when studying their health effects. In line with overall UPF intake, both the warm savory snack and the cold savory snack UPF patterns were associated with higher risks of type 2 diabetes. Results deviated for the traditional Dutch cuisine pattern and the sweet snack pattern, as the associations with type 2 diabetes were absent for the first, and inverse for the latter. The absence of an association for the traditional Dutch cuisine pattern illustrates that the detrimental effects of UPF may not be solely due to the degree of food processing. As UPF forms a highly heterogeneous food category, it is also important to consider their nutritional quality. For instance, a key food product in the traditional Dutch cuisine pattern was sliced bread. Despite mostly being ultra-processed, approximately 70% of the sliced bread consumed in The Netherlands is brown bread (made with a mixture of whole-wheat and white flour) or whole-wheat bread, and therefore often high in fiber and micronutrients. Higher intake of fiber and whole-wheat products was found to be associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, the UPF products identified in these two savory snack patterns are generally high in salt and fat and are often energy dense. It is conceivable that they may increase diabetes risk through metabolic disturbances, such as elevated blood pressure and lipid abnormality. Therefore, a cautious interpretation of the health effects of UPF is warranted. More specifically, their effects on health may be determined by more than the level of food processing alone, which makes that not all types of UPF are necessarily detrimental to health.

### Effectiveness of regular oat β-glucan-enriched bread compared with whole-grain wheat bread on long-term glycemic control in adults at risk of type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^113VLzp2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A high intake of whole grains is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and soluble fiber from oats and barley, i.e. β-glucans, have been shown to lower blood cholesterol and postprandial glycemia. Despite such data and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claims supporting β-glucan induced reductions in glucose and cholesterol, effectiveness in real-life settings among individuals at elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the long-term effectiveness of daily consumption of β-glucan enriched bread, compared to whole-grain wheat bread, on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and glycemic control in adults at risk of type 2 diabetes.

Design

A 16-week randomized, double-blind dietary intervention was conducted in 194 adults (58 ± 8 years; Body Mass Index (BMI) 32 ± 5 kg/m 2; HbA1c 5.6 ± 0.3% (38 ± 3 mmol/mol); Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol 3.6 ± 1.0 mmol/L) across sites in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Participants consumed at least 3 slices/day of either β-glucan enriched bread (6 g β-glucan/day) or control bread, 6 days/week.

Results

After 16 weeks, there was no significant between-group difference in HbA1c (Δ = -0.01%, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.06; p = 0.49). Similarly, no differences were observed in fasting glucose (Δ = -0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.11 to 0.14), insulin (Δ = -0.76 pmol/L, 95% CI: -0.99 to 2.5), or LDL-cholesterol (Δ = -0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.27 to 0.05) (all p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Contrary to expectations from efficacy studies, this effectiveness trial did not support metabolic benefits of oat-derived β-glucan enriched bread under real-life conditions. A simple bread replacement may not be sufficient to improve glucose homeostasis in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes.

### A mixed method study exploring adherence to and acceptability of small quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) among pregnant and lactating women in Ghana and Malawi [^112c4woM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Food practices / convenience

In both countries participants described in detail how they accommodated (or tried to accommodate) SQ-LNS in their daily meal routines. Most of the women did this: It is good for me, if I were to be taking it always I wouldn't have had any problems (Ghana 1218, 1 st interview). Typically women reported that they mixed SQ-LNS with a small amount of porridge or some other food in the morning as instructed. However, in Ghana it was rather common for the interviewees to say that it was difficult for them to take Nkatepa like this interviewee: It is difficult for me… but I try my best to take all (Ghana 1637, 1 st interview). In Malawi, women typically found consuming Chiponde easy as this quote illustrates: But for me, I just cook porridge then I put in the porridge and eat (Malawi 3365, 1 st interview).

In Malawi, women described a very limited selection of daily food alternatives besides nsima ndi ndiwo, stiff maize porridge with sauce and porridge, phala. There were only a few who reported spreading Chiponde on bread or scones and a few mixing it in tea. In Ghana, women narrated more dish options they experimented mixing Nkatepa with (porridge, soups, bread, tea, banku, stews). Some women in Ghana said that when the food they liked mixing the Nkatepa with was not available, they skipped taking it: I used it to take oats or rice water or porridge, it is good for me, but if I am to use it to eat soupy dishes, I am unable to eat it (Ghana 1314, 1 st interview). There were also some other non-food related reasons reported as a cause for skipping: I went to the hospital yesterday and I was given injection… as for that I don't take it [SQ-LNS] together with the injection (Ghana 1704, 1 st interview).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pollen-food allergy syndrome, more specifically with respect to common triggers, BSACI 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- typical birch-related triggers include raw apples, stone fruits, kiwi fruit, carrot, celery, soya milk, raw peanuts, and raw tree nuts (usually hazelnuts, almonds, and walnuts)

- symptoms can also occur when peeling potatoes or other root vegetables

- freshly prepared fruit/vegetable juices or smoothies, celery, soya milk, raw nuts, large quantities of roasted nuts, and concentrated nut products, can provoke more severe reactions.

To increase protein intake: use plenty of dairy products; boiled in milk porridge, cheese on bread, snack with cheese, yogurt or milk, foods milk powder, high protein dairy products, and hot meal with meat, fish or eggs; 2. To increase energy intake: eat several small meals a day e.g. oil to foods, margarine on a slice of bread.

The intervention was intended to increase food intake of energy-dense foods, the number of meals and their consumption of energy-, protein- and nutrient-rich snacks, such as slices of bread with margarine, yogurt and curd cheese. If the participant had a lack of energy, she/he was advised to eat small meals more frequently during the day and to increase the use of vegetable oil in foods and/or margarine on a slice of bread and use fat dairy products. If the participants diet did not include enough protein for her/his needs, she/he was advised to consume more dairy products like milk as a drink, cheese on bread, snack with curd cheese, quark, yogurt, curdled milk and cottage cheese and boiled porridge made with milk. In addition, participants were advised to use of milk powder in foods and high protein dairy products and to eat daily two warm meals with meat, chicken, fish or eggs. According to guidelines we recommended the use of a vitamin D supplementation of 20/g/day, but these were excluded from in the analysis. Only the dietary intake of vitamin D was included in the analyses. In this intervention did not prescribe multivitamin supplements to the participants.

Data collection

Outcome measurements

A clinical nutritionist assessed nutrient intake with 24-hour dietary recall at the baseline and after the six-month follow-up in both groups. The participants' nutrients were calculated from the 24-hour dietary recall using AivoDiet program, developed for nutrient counting. We compared protein intake with the recommendations in the ESPEN guidelines i.e. a protein intake should be at least 1 g/kg/BW per day, adjusted for individual needs.

### Whole grain consumption and risk of colorectal cancer: a population-based cohort of 60, 000 women [^1149CVFH]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

In analyses of individual whole grain foods, only hard whole grain rye bread had a statistically significant inverse association with colon cancer risk. After excluding cases that occurred within 2 years of follow-up, the multivariate RR of colon cancer for women who consumed two or more slices per day of hard whole grain bread compared with those who consumed less than four slices per week was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.55–0.98; P -value for trend = 0.02). Each daily increment of one slice of hard whole grain bread was associated with a 12% reduction in colon cancer risk (multivariate RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–0.99).

Refined grain consumption was not appreciably associated with risk of colon or rectal cancer. The multivariate RRs for the highest (⩾2.5 servings day −1) compared with the lowest category (< 0.5 servings day −1) of refined grain consumption were 1.29 (95% CI, 0.92–1.82) for colon cancer and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.48–1.40) for rectal cancer.

We also examined the association between cereal fibre intake and risk of colon cancer (Figure 1). After controlling for age, education, body mass index, and intakes of total energy, saturated fat, calcium, red meat, fruits, and vegetables, women in the top quintile of cereal fibre intake had a 27% (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57–1.03) reduced risk of colon cancer compared with those in the bottom quintile. Further adjustment for intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E, β -carotene, folate, vitamin B 6, and magnesium did not materially change the results, although the confidence interval widened (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.53–1.08). There was no association of cereal fibre intake with rectal cancer risk (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.64–1.53).

### Evidence-based kernels: fundamental units of behavioral influence [^111YCPnz]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2008). Low credibility.

The unit of a kernel is indivisible in the sense that it would be ineffective if one eliminated any of its components. Experimental evaluations of kernels may involve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or interrupted time-series experiments (Flay et al.). Examples of kernels include timeout, written praise notes, self-monitoring, framing relations among stimuli to affect the value of a given stimulus, and physiological strategies such as nasal breathing when upset or increasing omega-3 fatty acids in the diet in order to influence behavior. The description of a kernel as an indivisible procedure merits discussion by metaphor and example.

First, a kernel is like a seed that contains central information for growth or change. Second, a kernel also evokes the idea of an implicit human technology to effect change from the earliest use of agriculture to the use of core routines in modern computers. A broken seed will not grow, and a broken core computer routine ("kernel panic") will cause the machine to be inoperative. One of the oldest prepared foods by humans, dating to the Neolithic era — bread, further illustrates the point of indivisibility. Bread consists of flour and water. Bread may be leavened or unleavened. Even unleavened, bread can be quite varied: lavashes, tortilla, chapatis, rotis, naans, etc. Bread is simple and irreductable: remove the flour or liquid, there is no bread. The example of bread also illustrates the nearly infinite ways additions to it can make it sweet, spicy, bitter, fattening, medicinal, or celebratory. Of course other preparations of meat, legumes, fruits, or vegetables can be served with bread to form daily meals or diet — a culinary equivalent of a program.

### Effect of cinnamon on gastric emptying, arterial stiffness, postprandial lipemia, glycemia, and appetite responses to high-fat breakfast [^116ret72]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Study day protocol

Subjects reported to the laboratory after a 12 h overnight fast. Following 15 min interval of supine rest, measurements of arterial stiffness (see measurements) and BP were obtained and a baseline blood sample was collected. Subjects returned to the seated position and after a 10 min interval, baseline breath samples were taken and visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaires were completed (t = -15 and -10 min). Once baseline measurements were taken, subjects consumed the test meal within 15 min (see below). Upon completion of the meal (t = 0 min), sequential postprandial measurements of GE, appetite sensations, arterial stiffness, BP and plasma glucose and lipids responses were taken. Expired breath samples were collected at t = 0 min, every 5 min for the first half hour after meal consumption and thereafter in 15-min intervals from t = 30 until 360 min for the detection of 13 CO 2 (see measurements). VAS questionnaires were administered after consumption of breakfast (t = 0 min) and every 30 min until t = 360 min. Arterial stiffness, BP measurements and blood samples were collected hourly from t = 60 to t = 270 min (t = 240 min for blood samples). At the end of postprandial assessments (t = 360 min), subjects were presented with an assortment of cold lunch-type buffet foods. The meal comprised of six slices of wholegrain bread (235 g), six slices of white bread (235 g), 115 g sliced ham, 115 g sliced chicken, 100 g grated cheddar cheese, 60 g lettuce, 125 g cherry tomatoes, 80 g sliced cucumber, 90 g sweet corn, 100 g coleslaw, 30 g butter, 30 g mayonnaise, 30 g relish, 415 g strawberry yoghurt, 6 biscuits (75 g), 120 g chocolate Swiss roll, 60 g crisps and 300 mL water. The total energy content of the buffet meal was 16504 kJ. The selection presented was in excess of anticipated consumption. Subjects were given 30 min (i.e. t = 360–390 min) to eat ad libitum until 'comfortably full'. After ingestion of the buffet meal, subjects completed another VAS questionnaire and were then free to leave the laboratory. Additional VAS questionnaires were administered after consumption of the test meal and buffet meal (t = 0 and 390 min) to evaluate meal palatability as well as sensations of nausea and well-being. They recorded their subsequent food intake for the remainder of the test day.

### Sources of dietary iodine: bread, cows' milk, and infant formula in the Boston area [^116m4jZ4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Dietary iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production. Although U.S. dietary iodine is generally adequate, some groups, especially women of childbearing age, are at risk for mild iodine deficiency. Children's average urinary iodine is higher than that of adults. U.S. dietary iodine sources have not been assessed recently. A survey of iodine content in 20 brands of bread, 18 brands of cows' milk, and eight infant formulae was performed between 2001 and 2002. Three bread varieties contained more than 300 microg iodine per slice. Iodine content in other brands was far lower (mean ± sd, 10.1 ± 13.2 microg iodine/slice). All cows' milk samples had at least 88 microg iodine/250 ml, ranging from 88–168 microg (116.0 ± 22.1 microg/250 ml). Infant formulae values ranged from 16.2 to 56.8 microg iodine/5 oz (23.5 ± 13.78 microg/5 oz). The public should be aware of the need for adequate dietary iodine intake and should be aware that ingredient lists do not reflect the iodine content of foods.

### Identifying dietary patterns and associated health-related lifestyle factors in the adult Danish population [^1175t64X]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

To identify and describe dietary patterns in Danish adults and to examine which demographic and health-related lifestyle factors are associated with dietary patterns.

Subjects/Methods

Data derived from the Danish national survey of diet and physical activity collected in 2003–2008 and included 1569 men and 1785 women. Diet was assessed by a 7-day pre-coded food diary. Information on age, gender, weight, height, physical activity, smoking habits, educational level and attitudes towards healthy eating habits was derived from face-to-face interviews. Principal component analysis was applied to explore dietary patterns. Associations with lifestyle factors were examined by means of multiple regression analyses.

Results

Three major dietary patterns were identified: a 'traditional' pattern correlated with intake of rye bread, white bread, fat on bread, cheese, jam, cold meat, minced meat, potatoes and gravy, and cake and biscuits; a 'health-conscious' pattern correlated with coarse bread, fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy, nuts, water and tea; and a 'fast food' pattern correlated with pizza, hamburger/spring rolls, crisps, rice and pasta, sugar-sweetened soft drinks and sweets. The 'traditional' pattern was positively associated with male gender and age, whereas the 'health-conscious' pattern was positively associated with being female, increasing age and educational level. The 'fast food' pattern was inversely associated with age and smoking.

Conclusions

Three distinct dietary patterns were identified, and associated lifestyle and demographic factors were characterised. The findings are valuable in targeting future nutrition education and will enable more focused strategies in communicating food-based dietary guidelines.

### Effect of individually tailored nutritional counselling on protein and energy intake among older people receiving home care at risk of or having malnutrition: a non-randomised intervention study [^112Gy4NW]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

It was observed that it was possible to increase the protein intake in home care clients with a cognitive decline (MMSE score under 24) e.g. the proportion of those subjects with a protein intake less than 1.0 g/kgBW decreased. This is in accordance with a previous study where a tailored nutritional counseling was provided to home-dwelling older adults with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. That is an important finding because the cognitive decline may decrease the patient's intake of nutrients due the problems with food preparation, forgetting to eat, loss of appetite and eating problems due to poor oral health. An explanation for the finding in the present study was that the counseling was given not only to family caretakers as in the previous study but also to homecare nurses who were provided with the appropriate counseling information which allowed them to supervise the continuation of the intervention according to the instructions given by a clinical nutritionist. The fact that the intervention was implemented by both homecare nurses and family caretakers was the keystone in its success in persons with cognitive decline.

Our study is the first to evaluate the intake of many important nutrients such fibre, vitamin D, thiamine, vitamin B12, iron and zinc among home care clients with PEM; the intervention improved also their intake as compared to the control group. In our intervention, a clinical nutritionist recommended snacks, such as a slice of bread with margarine, yogurt and curd cheese, porridge, vegetable oil/fats when making food or spreading margarine on a slice of bread, as well ensuring regular consumption dairy and meat products. These were recommended because in the Finnish diet, cereal products are important sources of fibre, iron, zinc and thiamine, meat is a good source of thiamine, vitamin B12, iron and zinc, dairy products provide vitamin D and B12, zinc and vegetable fats are important sources of vitamins D and E.

### AGA clinical practice update on the role of diet in irritable bowel syndrome: expert review [^114hGzdw]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

NICE dietary and lifestyle advice for adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) emphasizes patient self‑management and clinician assessment of activity and diet, stating that people with IBS should be given information on general lifestyle, physical activity, diet, and symptom‑targeted medication, and that health care professionals should assess physical activity levels, ideally using the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire, with brief advice and counseling for those with low activity levels; general dietary advice includes to have regular meals and take time to eat; avoid missing meals or leaving long gaps; drink at least 8 glasses of fluid per day, especially water or other noncaffeinated drinks (eg, herbal teas); restrict tea and coffee to 3 cups per day; reduce alcohol and fizzy drinks; it may be helpful to limit high‑fiber food; reduce "resistant starch"; limit fresh fruit to 3 portions per day (a portion should be approximately 80 g); people with diarrhea should avoid sorbitol; and people with wind and bloating may find it helpful to eat oats and linseeds (up to 1 tablespoon per day).

### Opportunities and barriers for smaller portions in food service: lessons from marketing and behavioral economics [^115wno7n]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Change default to smaller portion of less-healthy foods and add healthier ones

Another way to reduce the default sizes of less-healthy foods is to serve them with additional portions of complementary healthy items. For example, some restaurants offer customers French fries, salad, or half-and-half. Half-and-half could be made the new default at places like Applebee's. McDonald's has experimented with something similar in its Happy Meals, replacing its traditional small French fries with a small serving of French fries (100 calories) plus apple slices.

The advantages of this approach are that it allows customers to satisfy their craving for French fries while reducing energy intake, and not undermining value perception (because the smaller portion of fries is made up with something else). Still, risks remain.

If consumers do not like the virtue item (salad or apples) they may throw it out, not only leading to unnecessary waste, but also leading the customer to perceive a value loss. Even if they eat the virtue item, many consumers may not enjoy it very much, at least compared to the French fries, leading to reduced satisfaction. This tradeoff is one that many 'eager' health customers will like, but reluctant customers will be more resistant to. So the opportunity is biggest with chains that have a large eager segment.

The approach will not work for all menu categories. For example, it will not work straightforwardly for things that cannot be mixed or put on the same plate, like beverages. Still, beverages can be served in separate glasses or bottles. In addition, some blends may work better than previously thought. The Mushroom Council is now working with food operators to market a blended burger that is 60% beef and 40% mushroom. If something like that became the default, higher-calorie beef portions would effectively be reduced.

The main cost barrier in most of these mixed offerings is that in most cases it adds to product and operational costs. Generally, the operator will need more of the healthier items, which tend to be more expensive (although perhaps not in the case of beef versus mushrooms), and adding two items to a side dish instead of one involves operational costs in cooking, serving and communicating.

Still this is one of the best opportunities because it limits the major threat of value erosion. And operational innovation can reduce the cost of most complicated processes. The question is will any operators invest the research and development dollars to make this happen?

### What would batman eat? priming children to make healthier fast food choices [^114WYdUQ]. Pediatric Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fast food patronage is a frequent reality for many children and their parents. Although there are increasingly healthier alternatives for popular menu items (apple slices instead of French fries), they are infrequently selected.

Objectives

We investigated whether either of two priming tactics - the priming of a role model's food choices or the priming of healthy foods - could influence children to make healthier fast food choices.

Methods

In the priming model condition, 22 children (ranging in age from 6 to 12 years) were presented with 12 photos of 6 admirable and 6 less admirable models and asked, 'Would this person order apple fries or French fries?' In the health prime condition, the same children were shown 12 photos of 6 healthy foods and 6 less healthy foods and asked to indicate if each food was healthy or unhealthy.

Results

When children were asked what various admirable people - such as Batman or Spiderman - would eat, 45% chose apple slices over French fries, which was higher than the health prime (P < 0.001) or the control condition (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Advising a parent to ask their child 'What would Batman (or another admired character or person) eat?' might be an easy step to take in what could be a healthier fast food world.

### Protein intake at the first day of full-oral intake during hospitalization is associated with complications and hospital length of stay [^117LvNG1]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

This is a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study, performed at our academic center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, which compared a traditional meal service (TMS) (July 2015–May 2016) with FfC (January 2016–December 2016). However, in this post hoc analysis, we were interested in the association between protein intake relative to requirements and clinical outcomes regardless of the type of meal service. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Radboud University Medical Center (UMC) decided that a formal approval was not required (2015‐1805) (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03195283). All patients gave informed consent before participation.

Study Population

Patients at the departments of gastroenterology, orthopedics, urology, and gynecology were recruited at their day of admission. Inclusion criteria were being ≥ 18 years of age and having oral intake for at least 1 full day. Patients who were receiving tube‐ or parenteral feeding, who had a language barrier, or who were unable to adequately answer our questions were excluded.

Hospital Meal Services

TMS consisted of 3 meals, 2 small snacks, and drinks with each round served by nutrition assistants. Breakfast and lunch include cold dishes such as slices of bread with several bread spreads or yogurt. Dinner consisted of predefined choices for meat, potatoes/rice/pasta, and vegetables. The amount of protein and energy (kcal) of the meals ranged from 0 to 26 g and 0 to 575 kcal, respectively. FfC consisted of 6 meals served by nutrition assistants. Breakfast included yogurt, oatmeal, or slices of protein‐rich bread with several bread spreads. Dependent on the time of day, in‐between meals consisted of protein‐rich smoothies, fruit salads, cheese, wraps, and sausages. Lunch consisted of salads, sandwiches, and hot soups, and dinner consisted of warm meals served in a small pan. Amount of protein and energy of the meals ranged from 0 to 29 g and 0 to 621 kcal, respectively.

### Bread feeding is a robust and more physiological enteropathogen administration method compared to oral gavage [^113yFijJ]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study also shows that bacteria directly delivered in PBS via needle feeding are susceptible to the acidic environment of the stomach. Even though this susceptibility can be rescued by buffering the bacterial suspension with CaCO 3, this infection method still produces artificial neck colonization. On the contrary, bread feeding provides bacterial protection against the stomach acidic environment and fully eliminates colonization of the neck region. Overall, our results encourage us to reinvestigate the infectious process byandemploying bread feeding, a very robust and more physiological administration method that can be potentially extended to other enteropathogen infection models.

### Association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and all cause mortality: SUN prospective cohort study [^113wtxCu]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Dietary assessment

Type of diet consumed was assessed at baseline with a 136 item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire previously validated and repeatedly re-evaluated in Spain. We measured frequencies of consumption in nine categories (ranging from never or almost never to more than six servings daily), and the food frequency questionnaire included a typical portion size for each item. To estimate daily consumption for each food item, we multiplied the portion size by the frequency of consumption.

We categorised all food and beverage items of the food frequency questionnaire into one of the four NOVA food groups — a classification system based on the extent and purpose of industrial food processing. The first group includes unprocessed or minimally processed foods, which are fresh or processed in ways that do not add substances such as salt, sugar, oils, or fats, and infrequently contain additives. The processes aim to extend life, allow storage for long use, and facilitate or enable different methods to be used for preparation (freezing, drying, and pasteurisation). Examples in this group include fruit and vegetables, grains (cereals), flours, nuts and seeds, fresh and pasteurised milk, natural yogurt with no added sugar or artificial sweeteners, meat and fish, tea, coffee, spices, and herbs. The second group contains processed culinary ingredients. These are substances obtained from foods of the first group or from nature and might contain additives to preserve the original properties (ie, salt, sugar, honey, vegetable oils, butter, lard, and vinegar). The third group comprises processed foods, to which substances such as salt, sugar, or oil have been added and methods such as smoking, curing, or fermentation have been used. Examples include canned or bottled vegetables and legumes, fruit in syrup, canned fish, cheeses, freshly made bread, and salted or sugared nuts and seeds. The fourth group comprises ultra-processed foods and drink products that are made predominantly or entirely from industrial substances and contain little or no whole foods. These products are ready to eat, drink, or heat — that is, carbonated drinks, sausages, biscuits (cookies), candy (confectionery), fruit yogurts, instant packaged soups and noodles, sweet or savoury packaged snacks, and sugared milk and fruit drinks. We focused on this last NOVA group.

### High-amylose barley bread improves postprandial glycemia compared to regular barley and wheat bread in subjects with or without type 2 diabetes [^1169CYjk]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Experimental protocol

After a standardised evening meal and an overnight fast (from midnight), the study participants arrived at the clinic at 07.30 AM on all three study days.

Smoking was not allowed during the overnight fast or the study visits. Alcohol consumption was not permitted the day before the study days. Anti-hypertensive, cholesterol-lowering and anti-diabetic drugs were paused 24 h before every study day. The three intervention days were separated by a six-day minimum washout.

Antihypertensive medications were temporarily discontinued due to their potential confounding effects on blood glucose regulation, although blood pressure was not an outcome measure in this study. The half-lives of metformin and simvastatin - used by the majority of study participants - are approximately 2–4 h, while those of SGLT-2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and atorvastatin range from 12 to 13 h. We acknowledge that a one-day discontinuation may not allow for complete washout of all drugs across there therapeutic classes; however, due to practical considerations, all medications were paused for the same duration.

During the study days, a catheter was placed in a cubital vein for blood sampling. Baseline questionnaires were completed, and blood samples were drawn. At 0 min the test bread was consumed within the next 10 min along with 250 mL of tap water. A bread perception questionnaire was completed within the first 10 min.

During the following 4 h, blood samples were drawn as following: glucose, insulin, and glucagon at –10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min; TG, FFA, GLP-1 and GIP at –10, 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. All blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 °C; thereafter, plasma samples were frozen at –20 °C and the next day stored at –80 °C, except from plasma for glucose measurements, since this was analysed on the study day.

Questionnaires regarding satiety were completed at: 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. At 120 min, an additional 250 mL of tap-water was served.

### Ospemifene (Osphena) [^1155WFTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Omeprazole (CYP2C19 Inhibitor)

Omeprazole (a moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor) 40 mg was given for 5 days. On Day 5, approximately one hour after omeprazole administration, ospemifene 60 mg was administered after breakfast (two slices of bread with ham, cheese, a few slices of cucumber and/or tomatoes, and juice). Multiple doses of omeprazole in fourteen postmenopausal women increased Cmaxand AUC0-infby 1.20- and 1.17-fold, respectively.

Effect of Ospemifene on the Pharmacokinetics of the Co-Administered Drug

Warfarin

Ospemifene 60 mg was given after a light breakfast (two slices of bread with ham and cheese, and juice) once daily for 12 days in sixteen postmenopausal women who were determined to be rapid metabolizers of CYP2C9 (CYP2C9✱1/✱1 or CYP2C9✱1/✱2). On Day 8, a single dose of warfarin 10 mg and vitamin K 10 mg was administered one hour after a light breakfast. The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) for S-warfarin with and without ospemifene for Cmaxand AUC0-infwas 0.97 (0.92–1.02) and 0.96 (0.91–1.02), respectively. Multiple doses of ospemifene did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of warfarin. No study was conducted with multiple doses of warfarin.

Omeprazole

Ospemifene 60 mg was administered once daily for 7 days after a light meal in the late afternoon in fourteen postmenopausal women. On Day 8 after an overnight fast, a single 20 mg dose of omeprazole was administered in the morning of at least 10 hrs; ospemifene was not given on Day 8. The geometric mean ratio for the metabolic index (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole) at the concentration at the 3 hr time point and for AUC0-8hrwas 0.97 with and without ospemifene. It is unclear if ospemifene will affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 due to the significant time gap between ospemifene and omeprazole administration.

Fluconazole (CYP3A4/CYP2C9/CYP2C19 Inhibitor)

Fluconazole (a moderate CYP3A / strong CYP2C9 / moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor) 400 mg was given on Day 1 followed by 200 mg on Days 2 to 5 under fasted condition. On Day 5 approximately one hour after fluconazole administration, ospemifene 60 mg was administered after breakfast (two slices of bread with ham, cheese, a few slices of cucumber and/or tomatoes, and juice). Fluconazole 200 mg was taken for three additional days under fasted condition. Multiple doses of fluconazole in fourteen postmenopausal women increased the Cmaxand AUC0-infof ospemifene by 1.7- and 2.7-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Rifampin (CYP3A4/CYP2C9/CYP2C19 Inducer)

Rifampin 600 mg was given once daily for 5 consecutive days (given at least one hour before or two hours after a meal) in the late afternoon. On Day 6 after an overnight fast, ospemifene 60 mg was administered in the morning after under fed condition (two slices of bread with ham, cheese, a few slices of cucumber and/or tomatoes, and juice). Multiple doses of rifampin 600 mg in twelve postmenopausal women reduced Cmaxand AUC0-infof ospemifene by 51% and 58%, respectively. Rifampin and other inducers of CYP3A4 are expected to decrease the systemic exposure of ospemifene [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

Ketoconazole (CYP3A4 Inhibitor)

Ketoconazole 400 mg was given once daily for 4 consecutive days after breakfast. On Day 5 after an overnight fast, ketoconazole 400 mg and ospemifene 60 mg were co-administered under fed condition (two slices of bread with ham, cheese, a few slices of cucumber and/or tomatoes, and juice). Ketoconazole administration once daily continued for an additional 3 days (Days 6 to 8). Co-administration of a single 60 mg dose of ospemifene and multiple doses of ketoconazole in twelve postmenopausal women increased Cmaxand AUC0-infby 1.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Results

Definition of the actual criteria

For the product group bread, Figure 2 shows the data description and Figure 3 shows the percentage of products that comply (overall and per key-nutrient). The legend in Figure 3 shows examples of indicator foods that do or do not comply with the criteria. Statistics, distributions and plots of the key-nutrient content were used when necessary (data not shown). For all product groups, all of this information is available in Supplementary Appendix 3 'Detailed characteristics per product group'. Table 2 shows the overall criteria for all product groups.

To illustrate the scientific debate, a few examples are addressed below. Supplementary Appendix 4 'Overview of product group descriptions, criteria and rationales' contains all of the debated rationales for the product-group-specific criteria, including an overview of the changes made to the original Netherlands-based criteria.

For example, the rationale for encouraging innovation (Figure 1) was applied to the energy criterion in beverages. Owing to concerns that the consumption of sugar-rich beverages can adversely affect energy intake, weight gain and increase the risk of health problems, beverages should not contribute by more than 10% to daily energy intake. However, people will continue to consume these sugar-sweetened drinks. Therefore, reformulation should be encouraged. Currently, standard energy containing drinks contain 10–12 g of sugar/100 g (40–48 kcal/100 g). As a first step without forcing manufacturers to use artificial sweeteners, the criterion has been set at 20 kcal/100 g or 100 ml, which is the equivalent of 5 g of sugar. This will be progressively lowered over time. It is also important to note that on the one hand a considerable number of consumers do not consume sweeteners, and on the other, there are concerns about the possible effects of excessive sweetness on long-term habituation to sugar and sweet foods. By relying on a gradual sugar reduction approach, it is expected that once consumers have gotten used to a less sweet taste, this will also facilitate the lowering of sugar levels in other product groups such as milk products and breakfast cereals.

Tasty Tips for Snacks
- Encourage your children to pay attention to servings and help them measure out single servings of their favorite snacks according to the serving size listed on the Nutrition Facts label. Keep them in resealable plastic bags or containers so you can quickly grab-and-go.

1. Ask your kid to select a box or bag of cereal, chips, cookies, crackers, or pretzels from your pantry. Have them measure out how much they would usually eat for a snack into a bowl. Make sure they don't peek at the label.
2. Next, have them check the serving size on the Nutrition Facts label and measure out a serving according to the label into another bowl.
3. Together, compare the two portions. Discuss how the two amounts differ. Are they surprised to see what the serving size is for this snack.
4. Figure out the calories for the serving size they typically eat. Remind them that if they eat two servings, they are getting double the calories and nutrients. Recap Questions:

1.

What did you like the best about this activity.
2. What did your child say about this activity.
3. What do you think your child learned. Revised: October 2018.
- Sandwiches can vary in shape and size — so don't limit lunches to traditional breads. Try whole grain tortillas, pitas, and English muffins that are higher in dietary fiber, a nutrient to get more of.
- Spreads and dressings count in the overall calorie tally. Read the Label on the spreads. and dressings that your family uses on sandwiches. You and your children may be in for a surprise. Try spreads lower in saturated fat, a nutrient to get less of, such as mustard or hummus instead of mayonnaise.
- Fill your sandwich with lots of tasty "extras" full of nutrients to get more of, such as. leafy greens, cucumber and tomato slices, avocados, and colorful chopped red, green, and yellow peppers.
- For snacks that contain more than one serving per package, have your children measure out a single serving according to the label.

- Don't forget to Read the Label on snack bars. These lunch box additions are easy and.
