## Question

torodol dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Toradol (ketorolac) dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and indication. Then, I should verify the core dosing principles and duration limits. Next, I will examine parenteral dosing by age, weight, and renal function, followed by oral and intranasal dosing. After that, I need to check special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will integrate safety monitoring and provide a concise, practical summary with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its indication so I don't anchor on the wrong premise. Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonselective NSAID indicated for short-term (≤ 5 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires opioid-level analgesia, typically in a postoperative setting, and therapy should be initiated parenterally with oral use only as continuation if needed, not as initial therapy [^115y2Di8] [^113dEMgV].

> I need to ensure the overarching dosing principles are explicit. The mantra is use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, never exceed a total of 5 days of therapy across routes, and avoid concomitant use with other NSAIDs; for breakthrough pain, do not increase ketorolac dose or frequency — instead, add low-dose opioids prn if not contraindicated [^115y2Di8] [^116UABn2] [^112E6FSE].

> Next, I should review parenteral dosing for adults under 65 years with normal renal function. For a single dose, 60 mg IM or 30 mg IV is appropriate; for multiple dosing, 30 mg IV/IM every 6 hours, not to exceed 120 mg/day; onset is about 30 minutes with peak effect at 1–2 hours and duration around 4–6 hours, so I should keep that pharmacokinetic profile in mind when planning rescue strategies [^112E6FSE] [^1172Dezi].

> Hold on, I should verify adjustments for older adults, low body weight, and renal impairment because these are common and high-risk scenarios. For patients ≥ 65 years, those < 50 kg, or with reduced renal function, single-dose IM is capped at 30 mg and IV at 15 mg; for multiple dosing, use 15 mg every 6 hours with a maximum of 60 mg/day; in eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid use if possible, and if absolutely necessary, cap at 60 mg/day with close monitoring; in dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, avoid use altogether when feasible [^112E6FSE] [^112QuMgW] [^114jKgNK] [^1114ZwhL].

> Wait, let me verify the oral transition so I don't misstate it. Oral ketorolac is not for initial dosing; it is continuation therapy only, typically 10 mg every 4–6 hours prn, not to exceed 40 mg/day, and the total combined parenteral plus oral duration must not exceed 5 days; I initially thought "start with 20 mg PO once", but that is incorrect — labels describe either 20 mg once then 10 mg q4–6h, or 10 mg once then 10 mg q4–6h, so I should correct that and emphasize the 40 mg/day ceiling and the 5-day total limit [^115sA1C4] [^115y2Di8].

> I will now examine intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) because it is sometimes used. The labeled adult dose is 15.75 mg per spray, one spray in each nostril every 6–8 hours, not to exceed 5 days total therapy across all ketorolac formulations; in renal impairment with eGFR 20–60, cap total daily dose at 40 mg, and avoid use if eGFR < 20 [^116UABn2] [^1151dyCW] [^114XpXtH].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications so I don't miss safety landmines. Pediatric use is not established for ketorolac, so it should be avoided in children; in pregnancy, avoid NSAIDs after 20 weeks due to ductus arteriosus risk; in nursing mothers, exposure via breast milk is low but caution is advised; in patients with active GI ulceration, bleeding disorders, or high bleeding risk, avoid ketorolac; perioperative use when hemostasis is critical should be avoided or undertaken with great caution due to bleeding risk [^116ttTws] [^1119Fm2e].

> I should double-check renal and hepatic cautions and drug–drug interactions. Ketorolac is renally cleared and can precipitate renal decompensation in patients with impaired function, heart failure, liver disease, diuretic or ACE inhibitor use, or in the elderly; monitor serum creatinine, BUN, and watch for hyperkalemia in at-risk patients; avoid concomitant NSAIDs and use caution with anticoagulants or antiplatelets due to bleeding risk [^1119Fm2e] [^116UABn2].

> Next, I should review practical administration details to ensure safe use. IV boluses should be given over at least 15 seconds, and IM injections should be deep and slow; visually inspect parenteral solutions for particulates or discoloration before use; for breakthrough pain, add low-dose opioids rather than escalating ketorolac beyond labeled frequency or dose [^112E6FSE] [^1172Dezi].

> But wait, what if someone asks for a quick synthesis? For a typical adult under 65 with normal renal function, 30 mg IV every 6 hours to a maximum of 120 mg/day is standard; for those ≥ 65, < 50 kg, or with eGFR 20–60, use 15 mg every 6 hours to a maximum of 60 mg/day; for eGFR < 20, avoid if possible and cap at 60 mg/day if absolutely necessary; total duration across routes must not exceed 5 days; oral use is continuation only at 10 mg q4–6h, ≤ 40 mg/day, within the 5-day total; intranasal dosing is 15.75 mg per nostril every 6–8 hours, ≤ 5 days total, with renal caps as above [^112E6FSE] [^115y2Di8] [^116UABn2] [^1151dyCW].

---

Toradol (ketorolac) is for **short-term use only** (≤ 5 days) [^115y2Di8] in adults with moderate to severe acute pain requiring opioid-level analgesia [^115y2Di8]. The **standard adult dose** is 30 mg IV/IM every 6 hours, not to exceed 120 mg/day [^112E6FSE]; for patients ≥ 65 years, < 50 kg, or with renal impairment, use 15 mg every 6 hours, not to exceed 60 mg/day [^112E6FSE]. Oral ketorolac is only for continuation after parenteral therapy [^115y2Di8], typically 10 mg every 4–6 hours, not to exceed 40 mg/day [^115sA1C4]. Avoid use in severe renal impairment, active GI bleeding, or perioperative settings with bleeding risk [^1119Fm2e]; monitor for renal, GI, and bleeding complications [^1119Fm2e].

---

## Indications and duration of therapy

Ketorolac is indicated for **short-term management** (≤ 5 days) [^115y2Di8] of moderately severe acute pain requiring opioid-level analgesia, typically in postoperative settings [^115y2Di8]. Therapy should be initiated with IV or IM dosing, with oral ketorolac used only as continuation therapy if necessary [^115y2Di8]. The total combined duration of IV/IM and oral therapy must not exceed 5 days [^115y2Di8] due to increased risk of adverse reactions [^115y2Di8].

---

## Standard adult dosing (age < 65 years, normal renal function, body weight ≥ 50 kg)

| **Route of administration** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| IV | 30 mg | Every 6 hours | 120 mg |
| IM | 30 mg | Every 6 hours | 120 mg |
| Oral (continuation only) | 10 mg | Every 4–6 hours | 40 mg |

---

Oral ketorolac is **not indicated as initial therapy** [^115y2Di8] and should only be used as continuation therapy after parenteral administration [^115y2Di8].

---

## Dosing adjustments for special populations

### Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), patients < 50 kg, or with renal impairment

In elderly patients (≥ 65 years), those weighing < 50 kg, or with renal impairment, **reduce the dose** to 15 mg IV/IM every 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 60 mg [^112E6FSE]. Close monitoring for adverse effects, particularly renal complications, is essential [^1119Fm2e].

---

### Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m²)

In severe renal impairment (eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m²), **avoid ketorolac use** if possible [^112QuMgW]. If absolutely necessary, limit the total daily dose to 60 mg and monitor renal function closely [^112QuMgW].

---

### Hepatic impairment

Ketorolac is **not extensively metabolized by the liver**; therefore, no specific dose adjustment is recommended for hepatic impairment. However, caution is advised due to potential increased risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal complications [^notfound].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Ketorolac increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation. Use caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease, concurrent corticosteroid or anticoagulant therapy, or in the elderly [^116ttTws].

- **Renal effects**: Ketorolac can cause renal toxicity, particularly in patients with impaired renal function, dehydration, or those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function closely during therapy [^1119Fm2e].

- **Bleeding risk**: Ketorolac inhibits platelet aggregation, increasing the risk of bleeding. Avoid use in patients with active bleeding, coagulation disorders, or perioperative settings where hemostasis is critical [^1119Fm2e].

- **Perioperative use**: Ketorolac should be avoided preoperatively and used with caution postoperatively due to the risk of bleeding and hematoma formation [^1119Fm2e].

---

## Summary of key dosing recommendations

- **Standard adult dose**: 30 mg IV/IM every 6 hours, maximum 120 mg/day [^112E6FSE].
- **Reduced dose**: 15 mg IV/IM every 6 hours, maximum 60 mg/day for elderly, patients < 50 kg, or with renal impairment [^112E6FSE].
- **Oral therapy**: 10 mg every 4–6 hours, maximum 40 mg/day, only as continuation therapy [^115sA1C4].
- **Duration**: Total therapy must not exceed 5 days [^115y2Di8].

---

Ketorolac is a potent NSAID for short-term management of moderate to severe acute pain, with dosing tailored to patient-specific factors such as age, weight, and renal function. Adherence to recommended dosing and monitoring protocols is essential to minimize adverse effects and ensure patient safety [^115y2Di8].

The dose of a medicine prescribed is so much a part of everyday practice and prescribing guidance that it might appear a surprising subject for a symposium. In reality, however, many questions about choosing doses are unresolved.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are not approved for use for more than 5 days.
Do not exceed the recommended dose of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. Do not co-administer tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets with other tramadol or acetaminophen containing products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20)].
Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

### Tramadol with or without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain [^115u4f93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tramadol is an opioid analgesic licensed for use in moderate to severe pain. It is considered as a low risk for abuse, so control regulations are not as stringent as for 'strong' opioids such as morphine. It has a potential role as a step 2 option of the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and adverse effects of tramadol with or without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer-related pain.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases using a wide range of search terms: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched three clinical trials registry databases. The date of the last search was 2 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We selected studies that were randomised, with placebo or active controls, or both, and included a minimum of 10 participants per treatment arm. We were interested particularly in blinded studies, but also included open studies. We excluded non-randomised studies, studies of experimental pain, case reports, and clinical observations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form and checked for agreement before entry into Review Manager 5. We included information about the number of participants treated and demographic details, type of cancer, drug and dosing regimen, study design (placebo or active control) and methods, study duration and follow-up, analgesic outcome measures and results, withdrawals, and adverse events. We collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. The main outcomes of interest for benefit were pain reduction of 30% or greater and 50% or greater from baseline, participants with pain no worse than mild, and participants feeling much improved or very much improved.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (12 reports) with 958 adult participants. All the studies enrolled participants with chronic malignant tumour-related pain who were experiencing pain intensities described as moderate to severe, with most experiencing at least 4/10 with current treatment. The mean ages were 59 to 70 years, with participants aged between 24 and 87 years. Study length ranged from one day to six months. Five studies used a cross-over design. Tramadol doses ranged from 50 mg as single dose to 600 mg per day; doses of 300 mg per day to 400 mg per day were most common. Nine studies were at high risk of bias for one to four criteria (only one high risk of bias for size). We judged all the results to be very low quality evidence because of widespread lack of blinding of outcome assessment, inadequately described sequence generation, allocation concealment, and small numbers of participants and events. Important outcomes were poorly reported. There were eight different active comparators and one comparison with placebo. There was little information available for any comparison and no firm conclusions could be drawn for any outcome. Single comparisons of oral tramadol with codeine plus paracetamol, of dihydrocodeine, and of rectal versus oral tramadol provided no data for key outcomes. One study used tramadol combined with paracetamol; four participants received this intervention. One study compared tramadol with flupirtine - a drug that is no longer available. One study compared tramadol with placebo and a combination of cobrotoxin, tramadol, and ibuprofen, but the dosing schedule poorly explained. Two studies (191 participants) compared tramadol with buprenorphine. One study (131 participants) reported a similar proportion of no or mild pain at 14 days. Three studies (300 participants) compared tramadol with morphine. Only one study, combining tramadol, tramadol plus paracetamol, and paracetamol plus codeine as a single weak-opioid group reported results. Weak opioid produced reduction in pain of at least 30% from baseline in 55/117 (47%) participants, compared with 91/110 (82%) participants with morphine. Weak opioid produced reduction in pain of at least 50% in 49/117 (42%) participants, compared with 83/110 (75%) participants with morphine. There was no useful information for any other outcome of benefit or harm.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited, very low quality, evidence from randomised controlled trials that tramadol produced pain relief in some adults with pain due to cancer and no evidence at all for children. There is very low quality evidence that it is not as effective as morphine. This review does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is very high. The place of tramadol in managing cancer pain and its role as step 2 of the WHO analgesic ladder is unclear.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112dgYFH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences.

### Tramadol / paracetamol fixed-dose combination in the treatment of moderate to severe pain [^112cY8Jc]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common reason patients seek medical attention and pain relief has been put forward as an ethical obligation of clinicians and a fundamental human right. However, pain management is challenging because the pathophysiology of pain is complex and not completely understood. Widely used analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been associated with adverse events. Adverse event rates are of concern, especially in long-term treatment or at high doses. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are available by prescription, over the counter, and in combination preparations. Patients may be unaware of the risk associated with high dosages or long-term use of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Clinicians should encourage patients to disclose all medications they take in a "do ask, do tell" approach that includes patient education about the risks and benefits of common pain relievers. The ideal pain reliever would have few risks and enhanced analgesic efficacy. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with two or more agents may offer additive or synergistic benefits to treat the multiple mechanisms of pain. Therefore, pain may be effectively treated while toxicity is reduced due to lower doses. One recent fixed-dose combination analgesic product combines tramadol, a centrally acting weak opioid analgesic, with low-dose paracetamol. Evidence-based guidelines recognize the potential value of combination analgesics in specific situations. The current guideline-based paradigm for pain treatment recommends NSAIDs for ongoing use with analgesics such as opioids to manage flares. However, the treatment model should evolve how to use low-dose combination products to manage pain with occasional use of NSAIDs for flares to avoid long-term and high-dose treatment with these analgesics. A next step in pain management guidelines should be targeted therapy when possible, or low-dose combination therapy or both, to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity.

### Drug dosing recommendations for all patients: a roadmap for change [^11423T1P]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Most drug labels do not contain dosing recommendations for a significant portion of real-world patients for whom the drug is prescribed. Current label recommendations predominately reflect the population studied in pivotal trials that typically exclude patients who are very young or old, emaciated or morbidly obese, pregnant, or have multiple characteristics likely to influence dosing. As a result, physicians may need to guess the correct dose and regimen for these patients. It is now feasible to provide dose and regimen recommendations for these patients by integrating available scientific knowledge and by utilizing or modifying current regulatory agency-industry practices. The purpose of this commentary is to explore several factors that should be considered in creating a process that will provide more effective, safe, and timely drug dosing recommendations for most, if not all, patients. These factors include the availability of real-world data, development of predictive models, experience with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s pediatric exclusivity program, development of clinical decision software, funding mechanisms like the Prescription Drug Users Fee Act (PDUFA), and harmonization of global regulatory policies. From an examination of these factors, we recommend a relatively simple, efficient expansion of current practices designed to predict, confirm, and continuously improve drug dosing for more patients. We believe implementing these recommendations will benefit patients, payers, industry, and regulatory agencies.

Recommendation 5

For patients already receiving opioid therapy, clinicians should carefully weigh benefits and risks and exercise care when changing opioid dosage. If benefits outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should work closely with patients to optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy. If benefits do not outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with patients to gradually taper to lower dosages or, if warranted based on the individual circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioids. Unless there are indications of a life-threatening issue such as warning signs of impending overdose (e.g. confusion, sedation, or slurred speech), opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).

Tapentadol extended-release (ER) tablets — formulations, initiation, titration, and precautions include the following: Available as tablets containing 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 mg tapentadol for twice daily dosing. In opioid-naïve and non-tolerant patients: Initiate therapy with 50 mg twice daily; use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioid to tapentadol ER; convert current opioid to an estimated equianalgesic daily dose of tapentadol; reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for initial daily start dose. Dose change increments: May increase dose by no more than 50 mg twice daily every 3 days. Maximum daily dose: 500 mg daily. Tapentadol ER tablets must be taken whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of tapentadol and can lead to overdose. Steady state is attained after the third dose (24 hr after the first twice daily multiple dose administration). Special populations: Elderly — No dosing adjustment needed, consider starting at lowest recommended dosage; patients with renal dysfunction — No dosage adjustment for mild or moderate renal impairment; not recommended in severe renal impairment; patients with hepatic dysfunction — Use not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Other considerations: Must NOT be taken concomitantly with alcohol which can increase serum tapentadol concentration and cause fatal overdose, and use with or within 14 days of MAOIs is contraindicated.

### Rational opioid dosing in the elderly: dose and dosing interval when initiating opioid therapy [^1142bi9y]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Opioids are the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe pain. However, opioid therapy in the elderly is often associated with significant morbidity because of excessive ventilatory depression. The large amount of interindividual variability in opioid dose-response relationships makes it difficult to individualize the dose and dosing interval to provide safe and effective analgesia. By examining how aging affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of opioids, it is possible to provide a rational basis for age adjustment in opioid dosing.

2.1	IMPORTANT DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS

NUCYNTA tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of NUCYNTA tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with NUCYNTA tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].
NUCYNTA tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Establishing "best practices" for opioid rotation: conclusions of an expert panel [^114BwHep]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

Opioid rotation is a strategy applied during opioid therapy for pain that refers to a switch from one opioid to another in an effort to improve clinical outcomes (benefits or harms). It begins with the selection of a new drug at a starting dose that minimizes potential risks while ideally maintaining analgesic efficacy. The selection of a starting dose must be informed by an estimate of the relative potency between the existing opioid and the new one. Clinically relevant estimates of relative analgesic potency have been codified in the "equianalgesic dose table", which has been used with little modification for more than 40 years. New information about relative potency and the growing implementation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain provided a strong rationale for the convening of an expert panel to discuss the scientific foundation to opioid rotation and the elements that now should inform a clinical guideline for this practice. The panel affirmed both the value and the limitations of the current equianalgesic dose table and proposed a guideline intended to promote safety during opioid rotation.

Precautions for use, compatibility, drug combinations and opioids

When administering opioids parenterally, the physicochemical compatibility with all other drugs needs to be taken into consideration, as well as the risk of side effects arising from the combination (standard, expert agreement).

In the event of metabolic failure, particularly liver or renal, the same precautions should be taken for WHO level 2 and 3 opioids (standard, expert agreement).

In the event of metabolic failure, opioids should be prescribed with caution taking the following into account (recommendation, expert agreement):
selection of opioids taking into consideration their preferential metabolic pathway and active metabolites;
administration of oral or parenteral immediate-release forms;
administration of lower doses (much lower doses may be appropriate depending on the extent of the metabolic failure);
cautious titration taking into consideration the efficacy and duration of action of the first dose to calculate the subsequent doses and intervals. After a few days of a stable dose, it may be possible to consider using a sustained-release formulation with adjustment, if necessary, of the rescue dose.

Rapid or immediate release formulations should be used initially in patients with a short or irradiated small intestine (recommendation, expert agreement). In elderly patients, lower doses and/or longer intervals between the doses is recommended. Dose titration, following the above rules, will facilitate pain control (recommendation, expert agreement).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1119jbEB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should generally avoid unnecessary dosage increases, use caution when increasing opioid dosages, and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount because overdose risk increases with increases in opioid dosage. Although evidence to recommend specific intervals for dosage titration is limited, rapid dosage increases put patients at greater risk for sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose. For opioid-naïve outpatients with acute pain treated with an opioid for a few days or less, dosage increases are usually unnecessary and should not be attempted without close monitoring because of the risks for respiratory depression. In the context of long-term opioid use, when dosage is increased, clinicians should reevaluate patients after increasing dosage for changes in pain, function, and risk for harm (see Recommendation 7).

Before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause, considering that dosage increases to > 50 MME/day are unlikely to provide substantially improved pain control for most patients while overdose risk increases with dosage, and carefully reassess evidence of benefits and risks. If a patient's opioid dosage for all sources of opioids combined reaches or exceeds 50 MME/day, clinicians should implement additional precautions, including increased frequency of follow-up (see Recommendation 7), and offer naloxone and overdose prevention education to both the patient and the patient's household members (see Recommendation 8).

Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to increase dosage after an individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences.

Certain states require clinicians to implement clinical protocols at specific dosage levels. For example, before increasing long-term opioid therapy dosage to > 120 MME/day, clinicians in Washington state must obtain consultation from a pain specialist who agrees that the increase is indicated and appropriate. Clinicians should be aware of policies related to MME thresholds and associated clinical protocols established by their states.

### Ketorolac use may increase risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy [^117MwWxh]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ketorolac (Toradol), a commonly used nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in the postoperative period, has been associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak after colon resection. The effect of postoperative NSAID and ketorolac use on postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is unknown.

Methods

Retrospective review of consecutive PDs at a high-volume pancreas center from 2012 to 2015. POPF was identified and graded using International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula criteria. Demographics, operative variables and 30-d postoperative NSAID use, dosage, and timing (early = postoperative day [POD] 0–5, late > POD 5) were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of POPF.

Results

Four hundred twenty-three PDs were analyzed (mean age 66 y, 47% female), and 60% received NSAIDs postoperatively. Ketorolac (median POD 0–5 cumulative dose = 90 mg, interquartile range 60–165) was used in 35.7% (n = 151). POPF occurred in 90 patients (21.3%). Early (POD 0–5) ketorolac use was associated with increased POPF, especially grade A (odds ratio [OR] 2.16, P = 0.036). Each 25 mg incremental increase in ketorolac use was associated with a 10% increase in the incidence of POPF (OR 1.10, P = 0.021), whereas a cumulative dose of > 150 mg was associated with a 44% increased risk of POPF (OR 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.03–2.01, P = 0.035). A multivariate regression model identified estimated blood loss, soft gland, pancreatic duct diameter, body mass index, and cumulative ketorolac dose > 150 mg as independent predictors of POPF (P < 0.0001, pseudo R² = 0.149).

Conclusions

Increasing doses of ketorolac in the early postoperative period are associated with increased risk of POPF, whereas a cumulative dose of > 150 mg is an independent predictor of POPF after PD.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketorolac tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

 Acute Pain in Adult Patients Ketorolac tromethamine is indicated for the short-term (≤ 5 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Therapy should always be initiated with intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine, and oral ketorolac tromethamine is to be used only as continuation treatment, if necessary.

The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine injection and oral ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days of use because of the potential of increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but ketorolac tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^117BuoTs]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a well known and long history of use. Oral ibuprofen was approved in the USA over 40 years ago and has been a nonprescription drug for more than 30 years. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor ®, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. Nashville, TN, USA) was first approved in 2009 for the management of mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with narcotics, and for the reduction of fever in adults. It is the only IV NSAID approved for the treatment of fever in the USA. Since 2002, the safety and effectiveness of IV ibuprofen has been investigated in ten clinical studies, Phases II–IV, conducted under a corporate investigational new drug application (Table 1).

Two other IV NSAIDs are currently available in the US market, ketorolac tromethamine injection ("ketorolac", Toradol, Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) and diclofenac sodium injection ("diclofenac", Dyloject™, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA). Ketorolac injection was approved in 1989 for the short-term management of moderately severe, acute pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. Ketorolac is contraindicated for use in excess of 5 days, for minor or chronic pain, and for use in pediatric patients. Additional limitations on ketorolac administration include prohibitions against all preoperative use, in patients with active ulcers or who are otherwise at a high risk of bleeding, those with advanced renal impairment, and women who are nursing. Diclofenac sodium injection was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opiates. Diclofenac is only approved for use in adults and is contraindicated in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted. Neither of these IV NSAIDs are indicated for the treatment of fever.

Although findings regarding risks for new long-term opioid use after use for acute pain relate specifically to patients who were previously opioid naïve, risks also might be associated with dosage escalation (see Recommendation 4) if patients already treated with long-term opioids are prescribed additional opioid medication for new acute pain superimposed on chronic pain. Therefore, strategies that minimize opioid use should be implemented for both opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients with acute pain when possible. If patients receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible. If additional opioids are required (e.g. for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including an appropriate taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).

In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation.
Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day. (Overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day.) (See Recommendation 4.)
Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone, because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage.
An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.
Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days to reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and prevent unintentional initiation of long-term opioid therapy. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently for most patients.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at higher risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation.
In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted.
At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives and goals, determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function, and determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid use disorder.
Clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression, anxiety, or other psychological comorbidities is optimized.
Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, considering their effects on pain and function relative to any adverse effects experienced. If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g. if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g. dosages of ≥ 50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see from Recommendation 5).
Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).

### Ketotolac tromethamine [^116GSDZy]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketorolac
tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac
tromethamine. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent
with individual patient treatment goals.

Acute Pain in Adult Patients

Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are indicated for the short-term
(≤ 5 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at
the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Therapy should always be
initiated with ketorolac tromethamine-IV or IM and ketorolac tromethamine
tablets are to be used only as continuation treatment, if necessary.

The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine-IV/IM and
ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 days of use because of the
potential of increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions
associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION and ADVERSE
REACTIONS). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as
possible, but ketorolac tromethamine tablet therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115rDGgN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113ieNB2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting oxymorphone — available as 5 or 10 mg tablets and 1mg/ml solution for injection — has initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) of 5 to 10 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and there is no optimal or maximum dose of oxymorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing includes Analgesic Onset (min): 30 to 45 and Duration (hr): 4. In special populations, Elderly or debilitated: Use with caution and start at low end of dosing range; levels are increased 40% in patients ≥ 65 years. Food effects note: when taken orally with a high-fat meal, peak levels of oxymorphone immediate-release are 38 to 50% greater; it must be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.

### Population pharmacokinetic modeling to facilitate dose selection of tapentadol in the pediatric population [^1145cMF5]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The main aim of this analysis was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the strong analgesic tapentadol in 2-year-old to < 18-year-old patients with acute pain and to inform the optimal dosing strategy for a confirmatory efficacy trial in this patient population.

Methods

The analysis dataset included tapentadol concentrations obtained from 92 pediatric patients receiving a single tapentadol oral solution (OS) dose of 1.0 mg/kg bodyweight in two single-dose PK clinical trials. Population PK analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Simulations were performed to identify tapentadol OS doses in pediatric subjects (2 to < 18 years) that would produce exposures similar to those in adults receiving safe and efficacious doses of tapentadol IR (50–100 mg every 4 hrs).

Results

Tapentadol PK in children aged from 2 to < 18 years was best described by a one-compartment model. Mean population apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution for a typical subject weighing 45 kg were 170 L/h and 685 L, respectively. Clearance, expressed in bodyweight units as L/h/kg, decreased with increasing age whereas total clearance (L/h) increased with increasing age. Model-based simulations suggested that a tapentadol OS dose of 1.25 mg/kg to children and adolescents aged 2 to < 18 years would result in efficacious tapentadol exposures similar to those in adults receiving tapentadol immediate release 50–100 mg every 4 hrs. The proposed tapentadol OS dose was subsequently applied in a confirmatory efficacy trial in 2 to < 18-year-old patients suffering from acute postsurgical pain.

Conclusion

This analysis provides an example of a model-based approach for a dose recommendation to be used in an efficacy trial in the pediatric population. Uniform dosing based on bodyweight was proposed for the treatment of acute pain in children aged from 2 to < 18 years.

### Drug dosing recommendations for all patients: a roadmap for change [^112okVt4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The eight steps are:

Sponsor shares with the FDA the potential RWP gap estimates between the anticipated pivotal efficacy clinical evidence (e.g. phase III trials) and the likely market population (see Table 1). A new FDA Guidance is needed to describe how to estimate the RWP gap and prevalence.
Declare risk of inadequate dosing precision and factors likely to alter PK or drug response in order to determine patient types in most need of precision dosing recommendations.
The FDA comments on and agrees with the Sponsor with final gap analysis and plans. The sponsor's gap plan components should be included in the Guidance. This should include pivotal clinical trial considerations, such as how to recruit a more diverse phase III patient sample, dosing strategy, and population PKs plan.
Clinical trials will include collection and sampling time plans supporting analysis of efficacy, safety, and population PK/PD. The FDA should both agree with the plan and be authorized to require implementation.
The NDA submission will include the statistical and PK/PD analyses along with a modeling prediction report for dosing in patient groups not studied (or not well represented) in the pivotal study(s) (e.g. pregnancy, obesity, and complexity). (FDA Guidance needed.)
The FDA approved label will include dosing for all relevant patient characteristics based on either evidence or prediction where appropriate. CDS software consistent with the label will also be approved. The sponsor and the FDA should conduct a drug population model drug exposure prediction range for the RWP population characteristic ranges likely produce drug exposure extremes. These results could serve as an alert for dosing and labeling consideration. Sponsor and FDA pivotal trial population PK/PD analyses will comply with standards and will be available to the public in sufficient detail that the models can be replicated by future investigators (e.g. model code and assumptions underlying the model). The sponsor's postmarket clinical predictions confirmation plan (e.g. pediatrics, obesity, and complexity) will be approved. Dosing recommendations for specific characteristics (e.g. weight and glomerular filtration rate) will indicate the limits based on label dosing recommendations. (FDA Guidance needed.)
RWP postmarket studies. RWP drug efficacy‐safety studies will likely be conducted at various times postmarket to assess for the population in general along with patient subgroups variables, such as age, disease severity, comorbidities, socio‐economic socio‐geographic status, body size, organ function, genotype, and new drug formulations (e.g. line extensions and generics). It will be worthwhile to determine the value of applying a population PK model to predict the individual RWP trough steady‐state drug concentration (or other relevant PK metric) to be used as another analysis variable that can be related to efficacy, safety, and dosing. It will be useful for the FDA to include this option in their current research comparing new drug efficacy and safety from the phase III trial to RWP data evaluations. The first RWP efficacy‐safety assessment will be conducted by about 2 years postapproval to adjust dosing estimates if needed. (FDA Guidance needed.) PK dosing predictions for RWP subgroups not represented in the pivotal trials will be prospectively assessed for prediction accuracy. This will need to be a relatively large study providing balance across the various groups enabling drug dosing recommendations to be adjusted (e.g. label and software) in conjunction with the above efficacy‐safety study results. The results will also be useful to revise the drug‐disease population PK or PK/PD model made available to the public. (FDA Guidance needed.)
Because new drugs are approved by international regulatory agencies (e.g. the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), and the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)) consideration will need to be given to establishing a precision dosing guideline for the International Council for Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) covering the above technical requirements and standards. This should be the basis for standards for sharing RWP data, models, and tools as appropriate because we can learn from broader patient experience. In addition, these standards will make the work easier for companies to implement.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acunivive 60) [^1172Dezi]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE INJECTION

Ketorolac tromethamine injection may be used as a single or multiple dose on a regular or "prn" schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to the administration of ketorolac tromethamine (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but ketorolac tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

When administering ketorolac tromethamine injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins in ~30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.

Single-Dose Treatment: The following regimen should be limited to single administration use only

IM Dosing

Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg.
Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 30 mg.

IV Dosing

Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg.
Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 15 mg.

Multiple-Dose Treatment (IV or IM)

Patients < 65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 120 mg.
For patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS), and patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs): The recommended dose is 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg.

For breakthrough pain, do not increase the dose or the frequency of ketorolac tromethamine. Consideration should be given to supplementing these regimens with low doses of opioids "prn" unless otherwise contraindicated.

### OxyContin was submitted and justifiably approved by the agency as a 12-hour dosage form [^111Q3AFh]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Extended-release (ER) or long-acting (LA) opioids are increasingly used for management of chronic pain. Approximately 3.8 million patients receive prescriptions for ER/LA opioids in the US. The number of prescriptions dispensed for ER/LA has more than doubled over the past decade, increasing from 9.3 million in 2000 to 22.9 million in 2009. Consequently, in 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for ER/LA opioids.

Opioids are characterized by a high interindividual variability in response, which can also change in a given patient over time due to development of tolerance, progression of the underlying etiology, and age; therefore, opioids cannot be approached as "one size fits all". It is imperative to individualize therapy for each patient with careful monitoring and adjustments for safety and efficacy. The dosing intervals for ER formulations are established during clinical trials; however, in clinical practice, some patients may require more frequent dosing.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should carefully weigh both the benefits and risks of continuing opioid medications and the benefits and risks of tapering opioids.
If benefits outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should work closely with patients to optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy.
When benefits (including avoiding risks of tapering) do not outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with patients to gradually taper to a reduced opioid dosage or, if warranted based on the individual clinical circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioid therapy.
In situations where benefits and risks of continuing opioids are considered to be close or unclear, shared decision-making with patients is particularly important.
At times, clinicians and patients might not be able to agree on whether or not tapering is necessary. When patients and clinicians are unable to arrive at a consensus on the assessment of benefits and risks, clinicians should acknowledge this discordance, express empathy, and seek to implement treatment changes in a patient-centered manner while avoiding patient abandonment.
Patient agreement and interest in tapering is likely to be a key component of successful tapers.
For patients agreeing to taper to lower opioid dosages and for those remaining on higher opioid dosages, clinicians should establish goals with the patient for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendations 2 and 7) and maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should collaborate with the patient on the tapering plan, including patients in decisions such as how quickly tapering will occur and when pauses in the taper might be warranted.
Clinicians should follow up frequently (at least monthly) with patients engaging in opioid tapering. Team members (e.g. nurses, pharmacists, and behavioral health professionals) can support the clinician and patient during the ongoing taper process through telephone contact, telehealth visits, or face-to-face visits.
When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g. anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used.
Longer duration of previous opioid therapy might require a longer taper. For patients who have taken opioids long-term (e.g. for ≥ 1 year), tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns.
When patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g. for ≥ 1 year), tapers of 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers.
For patients struggling to tolerate a taper, clinicians should maximize nonopioid treatments for pain and should address behavioral distress.
Clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to further slow the taper rate.
At times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the patient is ready and might have to be slowed as patients reach low dosages.
Before reversing a taper, clinicians should carefully assess and discuss with the patient the benefits and risks of increasing opioid dosage.
Goals of the taper might vary (e.g. some patients might achieve discontinuation whereas others might attain a reduced dosage at which functional benefits outweigh risks). If the clinician has determined with the patient that the ultimate goal of tapering is discontinuing opioids, after the smallest available dose is reached the interval between doses can be extended and opioids can be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day.
Clinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal.
Clinicians should advise patients of an increased risk for overdose on abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dose because of loss of opioid tolerance, provide opioid overdose education, and offer naloxone.
Clinicians should remain alert to signs of and screen for anxiety, depression, and opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (see Recommendations 8 and 12) that might be revealed by an opioid taper and provide treatment or arrange for management of these comorbidities.
Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high-dose or otherwise high-risk opioid regimens (e.g. opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g. by providing overdose education and naloxone) (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians can use periodic and strategic motivational questions and statements to encourage movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes and functional goals.
Clinicians have a responsibility to provide or arrange for coordinated management of patients' pain and opioid-related problems, including opioid use disorder.
Payers, health systems, and state medical boards should not use this clinical practice guideline to set rigid standards or performance incentives related to dose or duration of opioid therapy; should ensure that policies based on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discontinuation of opioids; and should ensure that policies do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who are using prescribed opioids for chronic pain, including those receiving high dosages of opioids, or for refraining from rapidly tapering patients prescribed long-term opioid medications.
Although Recommendation 5 specifically refers to patients using long-term opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, many of the principles in these implementation considerations and supporting rationale, including communication with patients, pain management, behavioral support, and slower taper rates, also are relevant when discontinuing opioids in patients who have received them for shorter durations (see Recommendations 6 and 7).

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^112E6FSE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When administering ketorolac tromethamine injection, the intravenous bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The intramuscular administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins in ~30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing intravenous or intramuscular. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.

 Single-Dose Treatment: The following regimen should be limited to single administration use only Intramuscular Dosing
- **Patients < 65 years of age**: One dose of 60 mg.

- Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 30 mg.

 Intravenous Dosing
- **Patients < 65 years of age**: One dose of 30 mg.

- Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 15 mg.

 Multiple-Dose Treatment (Intravenous or Intramuscular)
- **Patients < 65 years of age**: The recommended dose is 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 120 mg.

- For patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS), and patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs): The recommended dose is 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours.

The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg.

For breakthrough pain, do not increase the dose or the frequency of ketorolac tromethamine.

Consideration should be given to supplementing these regimens with low doses of opioids "prn"unless otherwise contraindicated.

 Pharmaceutical Information for Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection Ketorolac tromethamine injection should not be mixed in a small volume (e.g., in a syringe) with morphine sulfate, meperidine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride or hydroxyzine hydrochloride; this will result in precipitation of ketorolac from solution.

 NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^111xWjBY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

NSAIDs — use as first-line therapy, dosing strategy, and contraindications in austere environments — Recommendation: We recommend NSAIDs as an effective class of analgesic agents that should be employed as a first-line treatment for mild to severe pain in the austere environment in the absence of contraindications. Recommendation: We recommend that treatment strategies with NSAIDs should employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects. Recommendation: We recommend that NSAIDs should not be used with known renal dysfunction, pregnancy, history of bariatric surgery, and/or history of GI bleeding. Topical NSAIDs, though proven to be effective analgesics, have a limited role in the treatment of significant injury in austere environments, given the increased weight, bulk, and limited stability of these preparations.

Opioid Safety and Effectiveness

- The panel endorses that all opioids used for pain carry a risk of misuse. Opioids are also associated with adverse clinical events. Patient comfort and safety must be carefully balanced when prescribing opioids. Because of the potential for misuse of all opioids, the panel recommends that the prescriber should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period possible (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends not prescribing benzodiazepines in conjunction with opioids because of the significant risks of inconsistent sedation and potential for misuse (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends avoiding long-acting opioids in the acute setting (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends prescribing precisely. Commonly written prescriptions with ranges of dose and duration can allow tripling of daily dose to levels consistent with adverse events (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Opioids are the most commonly used medications for treatment of most severe pain conditions. All opioids come with some level of safety concern. Regardless of the formulation used, there is always a risk of adverse events, as well as abuse, addiction, or both. The number and severity of adverse events from opioids are related to their potency, half-life, and mode of use.

The number of milligrams in the dosage is not an indication of how strong the medication might be. Potent opioids (eg, fentanyl is 50–100 times as potent as morphine) increase the number and severity of events. Although oxymorphone and oxycodone are about equally effective in treating pain, more adverse events are seen with oxymorphone because of its higher potency. Oxymorphone has 3–7 times the efficacy of morphine, whereas oxycodone is only 1.5 times greater. Currently, immediate-release opioids are prescribed at a significantly higher rate than extended-release options. These extended-release medications result in a 4.6-fold higher abuse rate and a 6.1 times increased diversion potential. The risk of addiction and abuse also has a strong correlation with the length of time the opioids are prescribed. Although some patients may become addicted after long-term therapy, a significantly larger proportion will show behavior of medication misuse and illicit drug use.

Immediate-release opioids, which cause serum opioid levels to rapidly increase and decrease with a shorter half-life, have a shorter period of pain relief. Long-acting ("continued-release" tablets) may deliver opioids for a longer period, but the amount of opioid absorbed is less per unit of time. This results in less fluctuation in serum drug levels, keeping opioid concentration in the therapeutic range. For the inpatient setting, long-acting opioids may have the same effectiveness as short-acting opioids when used as monotherapy, but given newer multimodal pain management regimens, this is not recommended current practice. Both short-acting and long-acting opioids have been shown to be effective in treating pain and increasing quality of sleep, with the main difference being that the number of pills prescribed will be higher in the short-acting group. – Other drug formulations have been created to include supposed abuse deterrent properties, but in actuality may have a similar profile in regard to effectiveness and adverse events. Combining opioids with other drugs has been shown to be more effective in managing pain than opioids alone. More specifically, combining opioids with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to be more effective than opioids alone. Benzodiazepines do not have this beneficial synergy. Taking any of these formulations with food does not change the maximum dose of the medication delivered, although when taken after a high fat meal, the time to maximum concentration is delayed.

### NSAIDs or opioids, damned if you do, damned if you don't? evidence-based selections to optimize therapeutic goals and minimize harms [^115iBEkh]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Available evidence to help guide efficacious nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and opioid analgesic prescribing will be reviewed.

Design

Review.

Conclusions

The available evidence can guide but cannot provide any prescriber with absolute knowledge regarding outcome for these frequently prescribed and potentially dangerous agents. Knowledge of the available evidence and application of such to our patients on an individualized basis hopefully will help to optimize therapeutic goals and minimize harms.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (toronova II SUIK) [^1119Fm2e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In postmarketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with the peri-operative use of intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, peri-operative use of ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken with caution when hemostasis is critical (see PRECAUTIONS).

 Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Ketorolac tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and such patients should be followed closely. With the use of ketorolac tromethamine, there have been reports of acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.

Nursing Mothers

Limited data from one published study that included 10 breastfeeding women 2–6 days postpartum showed low levels of ketorolac in breast milk and were undetectable (less than 5 ng/mL) in 4 of the patients. After a single administration of 10 mg of ketorolac tromethamine, the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.037. After 1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Assuming a daily intake of 400 to 1,000 mL of human milk per day and a maternal body weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant exposure was 0.00263 mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.

Exercise caution when ketorolac is administered to a nursing woman. Available information has not shown any specific adverse events in nursing infants; however, instruct patients to contact their infant's healthcare provider if they note any adverse events.

Pediatric Use

Ketorolac tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of ketorolac tromethamine in pediatric patients below the age of 17 years have not been established.

Geriatric Use

(≥ 65 Years of Age) Because ketorolac tromethamine may be cleared more slowly by the elderly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) who are also more sensitive to the dose-related adverse effects of NSAIDs (see WARNINGS - Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation), extreme caution and reduced dosages (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and careful clinical monitoring must be used when treating the elderly with ketorolac tromethamine.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in remote environments: 2014 update [^117LVdsr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society acute pain — nonopioid analgesia: Combining acetaminophen with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) should be used as the first-line medication treatment of acute pain in the wilderness, unless there is a specific patient allergy or other contraindication (Recommendation grade: 1A). As the basis of medical therapy for acute injury, these medications should be regularly dosed throughout the acute injury period. NSAIDs do have adverse effects, including renal injury (especially in dehydrated patients) and inhibition of platelet function that can increase bleeding; giving NSAIDs with food can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, and if significant abdominal pain develops, the medication should be stopped. Short-term use for up to 10 days of over-the-counter NSAIDs with standard dosing has been shown to be extremely safe and well tolerated, and an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/d or less or naproxen at 660 mg/d or less has no greater risk than placebo. For acetaminophen, prescription-dose acetaminophen up to 4 g/d in an adult is still appropriate for short-term use; it is considered safe in intoxicated patients, but care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and patients with hepatic dysfunction.

### Pharmacokinetics of tramadol after subcutaneous administration in a critically ill population and in a healthy cohort [^112yAGkL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tramadol is an atypical centrally acting analgesic agent available as both oral and parenteral preparations. If given parenterally, the intravenous (IV) route is commonly preferred. However, administration of large IV bolus doses of tramadol can result in a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, which may be decreased by reducing the rate of delivery or by administering the drug via the subcutaneous (SC) route. IV administration also requires venous access which is associated with infective and thromboembolic complications. Furthermore, while the intramuscular (IM) route is another alternative, SC delivery is preferred by patients. A SC cannula can be sited for repeated needleless injections, reducing patient discomfort and increasing patient and staff safety. Therefore, for patients who are unable to take tramadol orally, the SC route of administration offers an easy alternative. Although the pharmacokinetic profile of tramadol has been previously characterised in humans after oral, IM, IV administration, similar data are not available for subcutaneous tramadol and cannot be extrapolated from these studies.

While tramadol as the sole analgesic agent for the management of moderate to severe acute pain may be inadequate, when used as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen in severely ill and other patients it may offer several advantages. Compared with pure opioid agonists at equianalgesic doses, tramadol is significantly less likely to lead to respiratory depression and has less effect on gastrointestinal motor function than morphine, whilst nausea and vomiting are the most common adverse effects and occur at rates similar to other opioids.

It is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of tramadol after SC injection, especially the rate of absorption and time to peak blood concentration, to determine the optimal dose and frequency of administration. It is also necessary to determine if there are differences between healthy subjects and severely ill patients in order to know if different dose regimens are needed in the healthy postoperative patients and in the unstable patients in the high dependency area.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 50 mg tramadol administered as a single SC bolus dose to healthy opioid-naïve subjects and to severely ill patients in a high dependency setting. Evaluating the absorption kinetics for tramadol in healthy subjects and in patients will also assist in clinical decision-making and a better understanding of whether dosing regimens based on results from studies in healthy subjects may be transferrable to patients.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^116sCpgj]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Home medication dosing tools — recommendations and provision practices are outlined as follows: AAP has long recommended that liquid medications be measured using standard dosing tools, and the FDA has recommended inclusion of a dosing tool with standard measurement markings for all OTC liquid medications. With prescription and OTC products, it is recommended that only the tool provided with the medication be used for administering that medication, and caregivers can be counseled to ask for a dosing tool at the time of medication purchase if they are not given one. Storing the tool with the medication up, away, and out of sight of children can promote caregiver use of the correct tool and prevent unintentional medication ingestions. Tool quality matters; the Pharmacopeia recommends the use of dosing tools with indelible markings. Despite these recommendations, it is not standard practice for dosing tools to be provided in the clinical or pharmacy setting. With the growing use of electronic prescribing, information on optimal dosing tools for prescribed medications could be automatically generated at the point of prescribing in the EHR or at the point of dispensing within pharmacy software systems, providing information to clinicians and pharmacists about which tool is best to use based on the recommended dose amount.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^1169xt8Y]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for trauma pain management — properties, dosing, formulations, and cautions: Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly used analgesic and antipyretic, although its exact mechanism of action for pain management remains unknown, and it offers several advantages, including numerous routes of administration, ease of access, and relatively few adverse effects. The addition of APAP to traditional opioid therapy consistently demonstrates decreased morphine requirements, and scheduled dosing is ideal. Intravenous APAP is commonly used in several countries as the only postoperative analgesic; however, many U.S. hospitals do not include it in their inpatient formularies because of the drug's high cost and similar analgesic effects between scheduled intravenous and oral therapy. Intravenous APAP is generally well-tolerated and effective in most patients, but hypotension has been reported in some patients. Recognize that the liquid oral formulation of APAP contains sorbitol and can cause diarrhea in some patients. Avoid APAP in patients with acute liver failure, and use reduced doses in older adults and patients with chronic liver disease.

### Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management: recommendations [^11537gcF]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Intravenous NSAIDs versus IV opioids — We suggest either IV NSAIDs or IV opioids for the initial management of moderate to severe pain in the prehospital setting. (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding pain severity at 15 minutes, partial, or full relief of pain, or time to analgesic effect, and the evidence did not demonstrate any clinically significant difference in pain severity at 30 or 60 minutes. The panel expressed concern that there was evidence of significant sub-therapeutic dosing of the NSAID, ketorolac, in the limited data available, and noted a small difference in cost with the intervention (NSAIDs, specifically ketorolac) being more costly than opioids; at least one study suggested that adverse events were more common with morphine, including drowsiness/sleeping and nausea/vomiting. Intravenous NSAIDs, including ketorolac, may be attractive as a first line analgesic in patients who are intolerant or allergic to opioids or who prefer a lower risk of side effects, and the panel noted that ketorolac is already in use in many EMS systems.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent or as-needed use.
ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain. FDA has noted that some ER/LA opioids should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of opioids of immediate-release opioids daily for at least 1 week.
When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance.
Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of drugs to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations.
Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including assessing risk for QT prolongation and considering electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain.
Only clinicians who are familiar with the dosing and absorption properties of the ER/LA opioid transdermal fentanyl and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing it.

Supporting Rationale

ER/LA opioids include methadone, transdermal fentanyl, and extended-release versions of opioids such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and morphine. Clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on short-term pain and function were generally consistent across duration of action (short- or long-acting) and opioid type (opioid agonist, partial agonist, or mixed mechanism [with mixed opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action] agent), although five trials directly comparing different types of opioids found a mixed mechanism agent associated with greater pain relief versus a pure opioid agonist, with fewer nonserious adverse events. A fair-quality study demonstrated a higher risk for overdose among patients treated with ER/LA opioids than among those treated with immediate-release opioids, especially within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with relative risk decreasing with longer duration of exposure. Clinical evidence reviews did not find evidence that continuous, time-scheduled use of ER/LA opioids is more effective or safer than intermittent use of immediate-release opioids or that time-scheduled use of ER/ LA opioids reduces risk for opioid use disorder.

'Weak' opioid analgesics (WHO level 2)

'Weak' opioid analgesics should be used in patients with moderate pain (standard, expert agreement).

Weak opioid analgesics can be used alone or in combination with a level 1 analgesic (option, expert agreement). The following products can be used: codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine, tramadol (option, expert agreement). There are no absolute criteria to guide the selection of the different drugs.

Tramadol should not be combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (standard, expert agreement). Tramadol should be used with caution in patients with a risk of epilepsy and when used in combination with antidepressants (recommendation, expert agreement).

Dextropropoxyphene should not be used in combination with carbamazepine as it will induce an increase in the plasma concentration of carbamazepine (recommendation, expert agreement).

Constipation should always be anticipated in patients receiving codeine (standard, expert agreement).

Strong opioid analgesics (WHO level 3)

Strong opioid analgesics should be used in patients with moderate to severe pain (standard, expert agreement).

### Adherence to label and device recommendations for over-the-counter pediatric liquid medications [^112bbxhr]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To reduce dosing errors when administering orally ingested over-the-counter liquid medications, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Consumer Healthcare Products Association released voluntary recommendations for dosing directions and dosing devices. This study assessed recommendation adherence for national brand name orally ingested over-the-counter liquid pediatric analgesics/antipyretics and cough, cold, and allergy medications available after the FDA guidance was finalized in 2011 to identify and prioritize specific improvements to dosing directions and devices.

Methods

Recommendations were categorized as top tier or low tier based on potential to directly address ≥ 3-fold dosing errors. Two independent reviewers assessed dosing directions and accompanying dosing devices for adherence to recommendations.

Results

Of 68 products, 91% of dosing directions and 62% of dosing devices adhered to all top tier recommendations; 57% of products adhered to every top tier recommendation, and 93% adhered to all or all but one. A dosing device was included with all products. No dosing directions used atypical volumetric units (eg, drams), and no devices used volumetric units that did not appear in dosing directions. Six products used trailing zeros or failed to use leading zeros with decimal doses; eight did not use small font for fractions. Product adherence to low tier recommendations ranged from 26% to 91%.

Conclusions

Products adhered to most recommendations in the final FDA guidance and Consumer Healthcare Products Association guideline, suggesting that these voluntary initiatives promote adherence to recommendations. Improving adherence to recommendations should be prioritized based on potential to reduce harm.

### Safety concerns with the centers for disease control opioid calculator [^111sXnpi]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Morphine milligram equivalence (MME) and other comparable acronyms have been employed in federal pain guidelines and used by policy makers to limit opioid prescribing.–On March 18, 2016, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guidelines provided 12 recommendations for "primary care clinicians prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care". One of the CDC recommendations states that clinicians "should avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day".

There has been controversy regarding the methodology used to develop the CDC opioid prescribing guidelines, including concern regarding the bias of the guideline committees due to its domination by the anti-opioid group, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. The CDC used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for producing evidence-based recommendations; however, the guidelines deviated significantly from the established GRADE methodology without associated justification. There is a significant mismatch in the strength of the recommendations made in the guidelines and the supporting evidence. When considering that all recommendations were based on level 3 or 4 evidence yet eleven of the recommendations were assigned grade A, this is a major deviation from the National Clearing House guidelines on levels of evidence and grades of recommendations. The CDC guidelines excluded studies with observation periods of less than 1 year for basing their recommendations on the benefits and risks of opioids. According to the CDC guidelines, "No evidence shows a long-term benefit of opioids in pain and function versus no opioids for chronic pain with outcomes examined at least 1 year later". This is inconsistent with current standards on analgesic study durations in chronic pain. The international harmonized standards adopted by the United States for approval of chronic pain interventions recommend 12 weeks for efficacy assessment. Tayeb et al conducted a review evaluating analgesic trial durations for opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and behavioral therapy. The authors found that nearly all trials had active treatment durations of 12 weeks or less across 869 articles. Commenting on CDC's recommendation on nonopioid therapies, Tayeb et al wrote, "if a one year minimum threshold for duration of active treatment were required to justify using any of the major typical therapies for chronic pain, then none of these nonopioid therapies could be recommended".
