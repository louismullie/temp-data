## Question

What is dysdiadokinesia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what dysdiadokinesia is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the literal meaning and core definition. Then, I should verify how it is tested at the bedside. Next, I will consider the underlying neuroanatomy and pathophysiology. After that, I should review common etiologies and associated signs that co-occur. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition and note any nuances or exceptions I need to check for accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the literal meaning and basic definition. Dysdiadokinesia literally translates to "difficulty with alternating movements", and clinically it denotes an impairment of rapid alternating movements, typically manifesting as clumsiness, irregular rhythm, and loss of smoothness when performing alternating pronation–supination of the forearms or rapid alternating hand movements, which is a hallmark of cerebellar dysfunction [^116P8VMR] [^111HLWzw].

> Wait, let me verify the standard bedside test so I don't overgeneralize. The classic maneuver is to ask the patient to perform rapid alternating pronation–supination of each hand, or to tap the thigh with the palm then dorsum of the hand in rapid succession; dysdiadokinesia is evident when the movements are slow, awkward, poorly coordinated, and lose their regular rhythm, and this is commonly included in ataxia scales such as SARA as a marker of cerebellar impairment [^116P8VMR] [^115d6ExY].

> I need to ensure I anchor the neuroanatomy correctly. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while dysdiadokinesia is classically linked to cerebellar circuitry, it reflects disruption of the cerebellar coordination of timing, rhythm, and synergy across cortical–subcortical motor networks; thus, it frequently co-occurs with other cerebellar signs such as dysmetria, intention tremor, dysarthria, nystagmus, and gait ataxia, reinforcing its localization value when seen in aggregate [^116P8VMR] [^111HLWzw].

> Next, I should review common etiologies so the definition is clinically situated. Dysdiadokinesia is a nonspecific sign that accompanies cerebellar disorders including hereditary ataxias such as SCA17, autoimmune and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, toxic or drug-induced cerebellar injury, and systemic or metabolic causes like vitamin E deficiency; it has also been reported in tardive syndromes cohorts with cerebellar signs, though that association is less specific and should be interpreted cautiously [^114kFR1z] [^113fxiFL] [^116iqCwj].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about drug-induced cerebellar toxicity; I should double-check that. Isoniazid labeling describes a cerebellar syndrome that may include dysdiadochokinesia alongside gait and limb ataxia, dysmetria, intention tremor, dysarthria, or nystagmus, particularly in the setting of renal dysfunction, which supports the idea that dysdiadokinesia can be a manifestation of toxic cerebellar injury in addition to primary neurodegenerative or autoimmune etiologies [^115mzsGC] [^117UEcRc].

> Let me synthesize a precise, clinically useful definition now. Dysdiadokinesia is the inability to perform rapid alternating movements smoothly and rhythmically, typically detected on rapid pronation–supination or alternating hand tapping, reflecting impaired cerebellar coordination of timing and synergy; it is a nonspecific cerebellar sign that commonly coexists with dysmetria, intention tremor, dysarthria, nystagmus, and gait ataxia, and it localizes dysfunction to cerebellar pathways rather than to a single disease entity [^116P8VMR] [^111HLWzw].

> But wait, what if the movements look irregular yet the patient has normal rhythm — could that still be dysdiadokinesia? Hold on, I should verify the nuance: dysdiadokinesia specifically implies both loss of smoothness and loss of regular rhythm during alternation; irregular, effortful movements without the rhythmic breakdown point more toward a different motor control problem rather than classic dysdiadokinesia, so I need to ensure I'm describing the rhythmic incoordination accurately when I label it as such [^notfound].

Dysdiadokinesia is a **cerebellar sign** characterized by **impaired rapid alternating movements**, most clearly seen when patients perform pronation–supination of the forearms or rapid hand tapping, resulting in clumsy, irregular, and slowed movements [^116P8VMR]. It reflects **cerebellar dysfunction** — particularly involving the cerebellar hemispheres and their connections — and is commonly associated with other cerebellar signs such as dysmetria, intention tremor, and ataxic gait [^111HLWzw]. Dysdiadokinesia is not a disease itself but a clinical marker that helps localize pathology to the cerebellum and guide further evaluation and management [^116P8VMR].

---

## Clinical features and examination

Dysdiadokinesia is identified on neurological examination by asking the patient to perform **rapid alternating movements**, such as:

- **Pronation–supination**: Rapidly alternating the forearms between palm-up and palm-down positions.
- **Hand tapping**: Rapidly tapping the hand on the thigh or opposite hand.
- **Finger-to-nose testing**: Rapidly alternating finger-to-nose movements.

In dysdiadokinesia, these movements are characteristically **slow, irregular, and clumsy**, with loss of rhythm and coordination [^116P8VMR]. The severity can vary depending on the underlying cause and extent of cerebellar involvement.

---

## Pathophysiology

Dysdiadokinesia arises from **cerebellar dysfunction**, particularly involving the cerebellar hemispheres and their connections with the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. The cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements, ensuring they are smooth, precise, and well-timed. Damage to the cerebellum or its pathways disrupts this coordination, leading to irregular, slow, and clumsy movements characteristic of dysdiadokinesia [^116P8VMR].

---

## Common causes and associated conditions

Dysdiadokinesia is a nonspecific sign associated with **various neurological conditions**, including:

- **Multiple sclerosis**: Commonly presents with dysdiadokinesia due to cerebellar demyelination [^notfound].
- **Spinocerebellar ataxias**: Genetic disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, often presenting with dysdiadokinesia [^114kFR1z].
- **Alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration**: Chronic alcohol use can cause cerebellar damage, leading to dysdiadokinesia [^notfound].
- **Drug-induced cerebellar toxicity**: Certain medications, such as isoniazid, can cause cerebellar toxicity, resulting in dysdiadokinesia [^117UEcRc].
- **Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration**: Autoimmune-mediated cerebellar degeneration associated with malignancies [^113fxiFL].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis of dysdiadokinesia is primarily **clinical**, based on neurological examination findings. Additional diagnostic tests may be performed to identify the underlying cause, including:

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: To visualize cerebellar lesions, demyelination, or degeneration [^112WjRUT].
- **Blood tests**: To identify metabolic or toxic causes.
- **Genetic testing**: In suspected hereditary cerebellar disorders.

---

## Treatment and management

Treatment of dysdiadokinesia focuses on **addressing the underlying cause**. Management strategies include:

- **Disease-specific treatment**: Immunomodulatory therapies for multiple sclerosis, genetic counseling and supportive care for hereditary ataxias, and discontinuation of offending drugs in drug-induced cases.
- **Physical therapy**: Rehabilitation exercises to improve coordination and motor function.
- **Occupational therapy**: Adaptive strategies to manage daily activities and improve quality of life.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies depending on the **underlying cause** and extent of cerebellar damage. In some cases, such as drug-induced cerebellar toxicity, symptoms may improve with discontinuation of the offending agent. In progressive neurodegenerative disorders, dysdiadokinesia may worsen over time, significantly impacting motor function and quality of life [^notfound].

Dysdiadokinesia is a **cerebellar sign** characterized by impaired rapid alternating movements, reflecting cerebellar dysfunction. It is a valuable clinical marker for localizing neurological pathology to the cerebellum and guiding further diagnostic evaluation and management.

### Future directions in tardive dyskinesia research [^116e34hQ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) research is at a crossroads because of renewed interest in this syndrome following the successful development and regulatory approval of two novel vesicular monoamine transport 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors. Despite these clinical advances, significant lacunae exist in the knowledge base of TD pathophysiology, prognosis, and epidemiology. Moreover, conflicting definitions of TD as either a syndrome that encompasses a broad array of related phenomena or as a specific subset of tardive syndromes are an impediment to both clinical and basic science research, and to educational efforts targeting nonspecialist clinicians. A unique opportunity is thus presented by the enhanced focus on TD to resolve fundamental issues with regards to nomenclature and clinical criteria, thereby facilitating more sophisticated surveillance and genetic and epidemiological research into tardive movement disorders related to dopamine receptor blocking agents. The widespread use of newer antipsychotics portends that TD will remain a persistent public health issue. This article will present one view of research avenues to be explored for this neuropsychiatric condition, including those that may yield immediate therapeutic benefits by extending expert knowledge into routine clinical care situations.

### Tardive dyskinesia: recognition, patient assessment, and differential diagnosis [^113Hutxb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder associated with antipsychotic treatment. Because of the serious and potentially irreversible nature of TD, accurate diagnosis is crucial. However, diagnosing TD can be challenging, since the subtle and often fluctuating symptoms can be easily mistaken for symptoms of mental illness or other side effects. Although the risk of developing TD in relation to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics is lower than that associated with first-generation antipsychotics, the risk still exists and may be greater than once believed. Clinicians prescribe antipsychotics for a variety of illnesses and may underestimate the possibility of a patient developing TD, thus missing early signs of the disorder. In this ACADEMIC HIGHLIGHTS, experts review the prevalence, phenomenology, risk factors, and impact of TD, illustrated by case examples, and provide valuable clinical information to guide early recognition and accurate diagnosis.

### Identifying tardive dyskinesia: risk factors, functional impact, and diagnostic tools [^113GDFYS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder induced by dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs), including antipsychotics. Because the introduction of second-generation antipsychotics has reduced but not eliminated the risk for TD as had been hoped, recognizing and treating TD are important skills for clinicians. Many patients rely on DRBAs for chronic conditions. To minimize the risk of patients' involuntary movements becoming permanent, they must be detected early and treated. To improve the early recognition and diagnosis of TD, clinicians must know the risk factors, understand the functional impairment, regularly and systematically assess their patients, and appropriately apply diagnostic criteria.

### Historical perspectives on tardive dyskinesia [^115H1HjA]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a persistent hyperkinetic movement disorder associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents including antipsychotic medications. Although uncertainty and concern about this drug side effect have vacillated since its initial recognition 60 years ago, recent commercial interest in developing effective treatments has rekindled scientific and clinical interest after a protracted period of neglect. Although substantial research has advanced knowledge of the clinical features and epidemiology of TD, many fundamental questions raised by early investigators remain unresolved. In this paper, we review the early clinical reports that led to the acceptance of TD as an iatrogenic disorder and the lingering controversies that emerged thereafter. Continued research on TD as a serious adverse reaction to treatment may not only enhance patient outcomes and recovery efforts but may also provide insights into both the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs and the nosology and pathophysiology of idiopathic psychomotor disorders.

### Unravelling of the paroxysmal dyskinesias [^1136aiuv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal dyskinesias (PxD) refer to a rare group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders presenting with recurrent attacks of abnormal movements, typically dystonia, chorea or a combination thereof, without loss of consciousness. Classically, PxD have been categorised according to their triggers and duration of the attacks, but increasing evidence suggests that there is a certain degree of clinical and genetic overlap and challenges the concept that one phenotype is attributable to one single aetiology. Here we review the increasing spectrum of genetic conditions, as well as of other non-genetic disorders, that might present with PxD, provide criteria for case definition and propose a diagnostic workup to reach a definitive diagnosis, on which treatment is heavily dependent.

### Earlier diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia [^113N8YJc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) have an insidious onset and fluctuating nature, and the risk of TD associated with second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) treatment has been underestimated, it has been challenging for clinicians to make an early and accurate TD diagnosis. More patients are at risk of developing this potentially permanent, disabling condition than ever before because of the widespread use of SGAs; therefore, prevention of TD, if possible, is of utmost importance. Clinicians must use reliable screening tools and diagnostic criteria to assess patients for TD, rule out other abnormal movement conditions, and make an accurate TD diagnosis.

### Definition and classification of dystonia [^115PYcxb]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Dystonia is a movement disorder with varied clinical features and diverse etiologies. Here we present a revision of the 2013 consensus definition and classification of dystonia in light of subsequent publications and experience with its application during the last decade. A panel of movement disorder specialists with expertise in dystonia reviewed the original document and proposed some revision. There was broad consensus to retain the definition of dystonia with only minor clarifications to the wording. Dystonia is defined as a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent abnormal movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements and postures are typically patterned and repetitive and may be tremulous or jerky. They are often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and frequently associated with overflow movements. The two-axis structure for classification of the many different presentations of dystonia was also retained, with some revision. Axis I summarizes key clinical characteristics of dystonia, including age at onset, family history, body distribution, temporal dimensions, phenomenology, and whether dystonia is isolated or combined with other neurological or medical problems. Axis II organizes information regarding its etiological basis, including genetic, acquired, and anatomical, and common disease mechanisms. This consensus provides an update to the original definition and classification of dystonia with the aim of facilitating its clinical recognition and management. The revision retains the essence of the original proposal and aims particularly to provide a structure facilitating a uniform implementation. © 2025 The Author(s).

### New nomenclature for drug-induced movement disorders including tardive dyskinesia [^1111vAjo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Psychotropic agents are increasingly being prescribed by different specialty clinicians for a variety of psychiatric illnesses, making it necessary to improve understanding of the etiology, diagnosis, and management of drug-induced movement disorders (D-IMD) across medical specialties. Early descriptions of movement disorders were based on identifiable disease states such as parkinsonism, dystonia deformans, and Huntington's chorea, which introduced complicated and often overlapping nomenclature. This has hindered communication about, description of, and diagnosis of these drug-induced disorders. Research criteria for tardive dyskinesia, a specific, purposeless, involuntary, hyperkinetic, potentially persistent D-IMD, have varied, with relatively few data-driven conclusions available to support clinical decision-making. The differences in research criteria among published reports on rates of tardive dyskinesia with atypical antipsychotics make it difficult to find meaningful comparisons and conclusions between atypicals. A novel system for classifying D-IMD according to whether they are reversible or persistent, hypokinetic or hyperkinetic, and dystonic or nondystonic is proposed. This new classification system will provide clinicians and researchers across specialties a more precise language, which will hopefully improve the diagnosis of and research criteria for D-IMD.

### Movement disorders: classifications [^115Lc24R]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Movement disorders (ataxia, dystonic disorders, gait disorders, Huntington disease, myoclonus, parkinsonism, spasticity, tardive dyskinesia, tics and tremor) are clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous and are characterized by impairment of the planning, control or execution of movement. Current classifications of these disorders have inherent shortcomings due to the complex nature of movement disorders and the lack of diagnostic tests for the majority. Undiscriminating terminology, as well as the clinical, pathological and genetic heterogeneity, further complicate the development of comprehensive categorizations. Modern classification schemes tend to focus on clinical, pathological or genetic/molecular criteria, but more recent attempts have been made to integrate across these levels. From a historical perspective, two 'golden ages' have shaped the current and evolving classification schemes: (1) the definition of clinical pathological entities in the early twentieth century and (2) the application of molecular neurogenetics in the past 10–15 years. However, the classification of movement disorders on clinical grounds (according to age at onset, distribution of symptoms, disease course, provoking factors and therapeutic response) remains one of the most useful modes of categorization. Postmortem criteria have been employed to distinguish between degenerative and nondegenerative disorders, and specific hallmarks may be required to establish or confirm a diagnosis. Genetic features used for classification purposes include mode of inheritance and molecular genetic data, such as linkage to a known gene locus or identification of a specific genetic defect. A final classification scheme is based on alterations in molecular mechanisms (e.g. trinucleotide expansions) or protein function (e.g. channelopathies). Despite recent advances, it may not be possible to develop the 'ultimate' classification of movement disorders, and different patterns of lumping and splitting may be useful for the clinician, the pathologist or the geneticist/molecular biologist. Furthermore, certain individual cases with unique features may not fit into any particular category. Continued research by both clinicians and basic scientists is necessary in order to refine and redefine classification schemes of movement disorders.

### Classification of movement disorders [^117CmNi5]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

The classification of movement disorders has evolved. Even the terminology has shifted, from an anatomical one of extrapyramidal disorders to a phenomenological one of movement disorders. The history of how this shift came about is described. The history of both the definitions and the classifications of the various neurologic conditions is then reviewed. First is a review of movement disorders as a group; then, the evolving classifications for 3 of them — parkinsonism, dystonia, and tremor — are covered in detail.

### Emerging concepts on bradykinesia in non-parkinsonian conditions [^116Ff1V7]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Bradykinesia is one of the cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, clinical and experimental studies indicate that bradykinesia may also be observed in various neurological diseases not primarily characterized by parkinsonism. These conditions include hyperkinetic movement disorders, such as dystonia, chorea, and essential tremor. Bradykinesia may also be observed in patients with neurological conditions that are not seen as "movement disorders", including those characterized by the involvement of the cerebellum and corticospinal system, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and psychiatric disorders.

Methods

We reviewed clinical reports and experimental studies on bradykinesia in non-parkinsonian conditions and discussed the major findings.

Results

Bradykinesia is a common motor abnormality in non-parkinsonian conditions. From a pathophysiological standpoint, bradykinesia in neurological conditions not primarily characterized by parkinsonism may be explained by brain network dysfunction.

Conclusion

In addition to the pathophysiological implications, the present paper highlights important terminological issues and the need for a new, more accurate, and more widely used definition of bradykinesia in the context of movement disorders and other neurological conditions.

### Dyskinesia matters [^113i4vpq]. Movement Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) represents a significant source of discomfort for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). It negatively affects quality of life, it is associated with both motor and nonmotor fluctuations, and it brings an increased risk of disability, balance problems, and falls. Although the prevalence of severe LID appears to be lower than in previous eras (likely owing to a more conservative use of oral levodopa), we have not yet found a way to prevent the development of this complication. Advanced surgical therapies, such as deep brain stimulation, ameliorate LID, but only a minority of PD patients qualify for these interventions. Although some have argued that PD patients would rather be ON with dyskinesia than OFF, the deeper truth is that patients would very much prefer to be ON without dyskinesia. As researchers and clinicians, we should aspire to make that goal a reality. To this end, translational research on LID is to be encouraged and persistently pursued. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Prochlorperazine [^116CtUEP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if neuroleptic treatment is withdrawn. Neuroleptic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.

The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### The nosology of tardive syndromes [^117Ud8Y6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Since the original description of side effects of neuroleptics, different terminologies and definitions for tardive dyskinesia (TD) and tardive syndrome (TS) have been used by different authors, and often these two terms have been used interchangeably. This paper proposes a nosology designed to define and clarify various terms and phenomenologies within the TS spectrum. We propose to use the term tardive dyskinesia to refer to the original description of repetitive and complex oral-buccal-lingual (OBL) movements, as well as to the analogous repetitive movements that can appear in the limbs, trunk, or pelvis. The repetitive, relatively rhythmic nature of the movements is the common denominator of this phenomenologic category. The term tardive syndrome refers to the spectrum of all persistent hyperkinetic, hypokinetic and sensory phenomenologies resulting from chronic dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBA) exposure. Thus, TS is an umbrella term. When dystonia is the main feature of TS it is considered to be tardive dystonia (TDyst). Retrocollis appears to be the predominant form of cervical dystonia in this condition. Cranial dystonias, particularly oromandibular dystonia, are also common forms of TDyst. Tardive akathisia refers to the inability to remain still with an urge to move, giving the appearance of restlessness. It is a sensory phenomenon and a common and disabling form of TS. Unlike acute akathisia, tardive akathisia tends to occur late and persists after the drug is withdrawn. In tardive tourettism, the patient exhibits the features of Tourette syndrome with complex motor and phonic tics associated with premonitory urge and relief of tension after performing the tic behavior. Tardive tremor differs from the resting tremor seen in drug-induced parkinsonism in that it is mainly a postural and kinetic greater than resting tremor. Tardive pain has been reported in association with chronic use of DRBA's. The pain involved the mouth, tongue and the genital region. The patients tended to obsess over the pain and usually had some other form of motor tardive syndrome, either tardive dyskinesia, tardive akathisia or tardive dystonia. The term tardive parkinsonism has been proposed for those drug induced parkinsonism patients who have persistent symptoms following discontinuation of the DRBA. However, there is a strong possibility that the DRBA may have simply unmasked subclinical parkinsonism or that there is coincident Parkinson disease developing during the period the patient is taking the DRBA.

### Selecting treatment for patients with tardive dyskinesia using safety and efficacy evidence [^116Zp9PL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

​​ Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a condition of potentially irreversible abnormal involuntary movements associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents, such as antipsychotics. While prevention is the best strategy, it is not always possible. This report outlines strategies to reduce TD symptoms, including the use of the FDA-approved treatment options (valbenazine and deutetrabenazine).

### Pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesia: potential for new therapies [^115VJ5LP]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2001). Medium credibility.

Involuntary movements — or dyskinesias — are a debilitating complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease, and is experienced in most patients. Despite the importance of this problem, little was known about the cause of dyskinesia until recently; however, this situation has changed significantly in the past few years. Our increased understanding of levodopa-induced dyskinesia is not only valuable for improving patient care, but also in providing us with new insights into the functional organization of the basal ganglia and motor systems.

### Dopaminergic therapy for motor symptoms in early parkinson disease practice guideline summary: a report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^115WTb1E]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Long-term risk of disabling dyskinesia — data synthesis and confidence in evidence statements — summarizes thresholds and a key comparison in early PD. The MCID in the risk of disabling dyskinesias was determined by consensus to be 15%; RDs ≤ 5% were considered clinically unimportant. Conclusion (low confidence): In early PD, levodopa is possibly more likely than ropinirole to cause disabling dyskinesia at 5 years (1 Class II study, RD 14.7%, 95% CI 5.8–24.8).

### Parakinesia: a Delphi consensus report [^1111CHKF]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Abnormal movements are intrinsic to some forms of endogenous psychoses. Spontaneous dyskinesias are observed in drug-naïve first-episode patients and at-risk subjects. However, recent descriptions of spontaneous dyskinesias may actually represent the rediscovery of a more complex phenomenon, 'parakinesia' which was described and documented in extensive cinematographic recordings and long-term observations by German and French neuropsychiatrists decades before the introduction of antipsychotics. With the emergence of drug induced movement disorders, the description of parakinesia has been refined to emphasize the features enabling differential diagnosis with tardive dyskinesia. Unfortunately, parakinesia was largely neglected by mainstream psychiatry to the point of being almost absent from the English-language literature. With the renewed interest in motor phenomena intrinsic to SSD, it was timely not only to raise awareness of parakinesia, but also to propose a scientifically usable definition for this phenomenon. Therefore, we conducted a Delphi consensus exercise with clinicians familiar with the concept of parakinesia. The original concept was separated into hyperkinetic parakinesia (HPk) as dyskinetic-like expressive movements and parakinetic psychomotricity (PPM), i.e., patient's departing from the patient's normal motion style. HPk prevails on the upper part of the face and body, resembling expressive and reactive gestures that not only occur inappropriately but also appear distorted. Abnormal movements vary in intensity depending on the level of psychomotor arousal and are thus abated by antipsychotics. HPk frequently co-occurs with PPM, in which gestures and mimics lose their naturalness and become awkward, disharmonious, stiff, mannered, and bizarre. Patients are never spontaneously aware of HPk or PPM, and the movements are never experienced as self-dystonic or self-alien. HPk and PPM are highly specific to endogenous psychoses, in which they are acquired and progressive, giving them prognostic value. Their differential diagnoses and correspondences with current international concepts are discussed.

### The clinical approach to movement disorders [^112524KZ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Movement disorders are commonly encountered in the clinic. In this Review, aimed at trainees and general neurologists, we provide a practical step-by-step approach to help clinicians in their 'pattern recognition' of movement disorders, as part of a process that ultimately leads to the diagnosis. The key to success is establishing the phenomenology of the clinical syndrome, which is determined from the specific combination of the dominant movement disorder, other abnormal movements in patients presenting with a mixed movement disorder, and a set of associated neurological and non-neurological abnormalities. Definition of the clinical syndrome in this manner should, in turn, result in a differential diagnosis. Sometimes, simple pattern recognition will suffice and lead directly to the diagnosis, but often ancillary investigations, guided by the dominant movement disorder, are required. We illustrate this diagnostic process for the most common types of movement disorder, namely, akinetic-rigid syndromes and the various types of hyperkinetic disorders (myoclonus, chorea, tics, dystonia and tremor).

### Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112pXF8k]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline — primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnosis is presented for clinicians investigating adult and pediatric patients for possible PCD. Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were conducted, and evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach for diagnosis and discussed by a multidisciplinary panel with expertise in PCD. Predetermined conflict-of-interest management strategies were applied, and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded exclusively by the nonconflicted panelists. After considering diagnostic test accuracy, the panel made recommendations for or against the use of specific diagnostic tests as compared with using the current reference standard (transmission electron microscopy and/or genetic testing) for the diagnosis of PCD, and provided a rationale for the direction as well as for the strength of each recommendation to establish the diagnosis of PCD.

Tardive syndromes are a group of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders that occur after some delay following exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents such as antipsychotic and anti-emetic drugs. The severity of these disorders ranges from mild to disabling or even life-threatening. There is a wide range of recognized tardive phenomenologies that may occur in isolation or in combination with each other. These phenomenologies include stereotypy, dystonia, chorea, akathisia, myoclonus, tremor, tics, gait disorders, parkinsonism, ocular deviations, respiratory dyskinesia, and a variety of sensory symptoms. Recognition of the various tardive phenomenologies may not only lead to early diagnosis but also to appropriate therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on the diagnosis and clinical course of tardive syndromes and how to distinguish between the various phenomenologies as well as how to differentiate them from other, similar but etiologically different, movement disorders.

### Definition and classification of hyperkinetic movements in childhood [^1128KzN2]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkinetic movements are unwanted or excess movements that are frequently seen in children with neurologic disorders. They are an important clinical finding with significant implications for diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of agreement on standard terminology and definitions interferes with clinical treatment and research. We describe definitions of dystonia, chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, tremor, tics, and stereotypies that arose from a consensus meeting in June 2008 of specialists from different clinical and basic science fields. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Chorea is an ongoing random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Athetosis is a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents maintenance of a stable posture. Myoclonus is a sequence of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. Tremor is a rhythmic back-and-forth or oscillating involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tics are repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. Stereotypies are repetitive, simple movements that can be voluntarily suppressed. We provide recommended techniques for clinical examination and suggestions for differentiating between the different types of hyperkinetic movements, noting that there may be overlap between conditions. These definitions and the diagnostic recommendations are intended to be reliable and useful for clinical practice, communication between clinicians and researchers, and for the design of quantitative tests that will guide and assess the outcome of future clinical trials.

### Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease: clinical manifestations [^111rQKjb]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Fluctuations in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as wearing-off and on-off effects, and dyskinesias are related to a variety of factors, including duration and dosage of levodopa, age at onset, stress, sleep, food intake, and other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. The majority of patients, particularly those with young onset of PD, experience these levodopa-related adverse effects after a few years of treatment. Assessment of these motor complications is difficult because of the marked clinical variability between and within patients. Daily diaries have been used in clinical trials designed to assess the effects of various pharmacological and surgical interventions on motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. The most common type of dyskinesia, called "peak-dose dyskinesia", usually consists of stereotypical choreic or ballistic movements involving the head, trunk, and limbs, and occasionally, the respiratory muscles, whereas tremor and punding are less-common complications. Dystonia is also typically seen in patients with diphasic dyskinesia and wearing-off effect. Recognition of the full spectrum of clinical phenomenology of levodopa-related motor complications is essential for their treatment and prevention.

### MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease [^116dJSCJ]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

This document presents the Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD). The Movement Disorder Society PD Criteria are intended for use in clinical research but also may be used to guide clinical diagnosis. The benchmark for these criteria is expert clinical diagnosis; the criteria aim to systematize the diagnostic process, to make it reproducible across centers and applicable by clinicians with less expertise in PD diagnosis. Although motor abnormalities remain central, increasing recognition has been given to nonmotor manifestations; these are incorporated into both the current criteria and particularly into separate criteria for prodromal PD. Similar to previous criteria, the Movement Disorder Society PD Criteria retain motor parkinsonism as the core feature of the disease, defined as bradykinesia plus rest tremor or rigidity. Explicit instructions for defining these cardinal features are included. After documentation of parkinsonism, determination of PD as the cause of parkinsonism relies on three categories of diagnostic features: absolute exclusion criteria (which rule out PD), red flags (which must be counterbalanced by additional supportive criteria to allow diagnosis of PD), and supportive criteria (positive features that increase confidence of the PD diagnosis). Two levels of certainty are delineated: clinically established PD (maximizing specificity at the expense of reduced sensitivity) and probable PD (which balances sensitivity and specificity). The Movement Disorder Society criteria retain elements proven valuable in previous criteria and omit aspects that are no longer justified, thereby encapsulating diagnosis according to current knowledge. As understanding of PD expands, the Movement Disorder Society criteria will need continuous revision to accommodate these advances.

### Tardive dyskinesia – diagnostic issues, subsyndromes, and concurrent movement disorders: a study of state hospital inpatients referred to a movement disorder consultation service [^116iqCwj]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Of 49 state hospital patients referred for movement disorder consultation for tardive dyskinesia (TD), 11 (23.9%) of 46 meeting inclusion criteria had movement disorders other than TD. These other disorders led to a false diagnosis of TD in 6 subjects (12.2%). Between-day dyskinesia variability affected TD ascertainment in only 3.2 percent of subjects. Prevalences of other neurological conditions in the 30 patients identified with definite TD were parkinsonism (90%), dystonia (25%), akathisia (16%), cerebellar signs (40%), dysmetria (23%), cerebellar tremor (17%), tardive dystonia (3.3%), and tardive akathisia (3.3%). Concurrence rates of parkinsonism with TD varied significantly according to which clinical signs were used to define parkinsonism. Using a rating score threshold of at least mild, rigidity occurred in 79.3 percent, bradykinesia in 55.2 percent, and resting tremor in 41.4 percent of subjects with TD; more significant rigidity occurred in 41.4 percent, bradykinesia in 31.0 percent, and resting tremor in 20.7 percent. Concurrence rates of neurological conditions with TD subsyndromes were distributed rather evenly according to condition prevalences, except for an association of cervicotruncal TD with bradykinesia (perhaps because of ventromedial striatal presynaptic and postsynaptic D2 blockade, respectively). These findings, as well as the occurrence of equal gender ratio and relative under-representation of bipolar and alcohol disorders in subjects with definite TD, are discussed.

### Tardive syndromes [^115dmvxV]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dopamine receptor﻿-blocking antipsychotics, first introduced into clinical practice in 1952, were hailed as a panacea in the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders. However, within 5 years, this notion was to be shattered by the recognition of both acute and chronic drug-induced movement disorders which can accompany their administration. Tardive syndromes, denoting the delayed onset of movement disorders following administration of dopamine receptor-blocking (and also other) drugs, have diverse manifestations ranging from the classic oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia, through dystonic craniocervical and trunk posturing, to abnormal breathing patterns. Although tardive syndromes have been an important part of movement disorder clinical practice for over 60 years, their pathophysiologic basis remains poorly understood and the optimal treatment approach remains unclear. This review summarises the current knowledge relating to these syndromes and provides clinicians with pragmatic, clinically focused guidance to their management.

### Treatment strategies for tardive dyskinesia [^11642JW9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a condition of potentially irreversible abnormal involuntary movements that is associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs), produces significant impairment of functioning and quality of life for patients. Contrary to expectations, TD has not vanished despite the introduction of SGAs. Instead, changing prescription practices and increased off-label prescription of DRBAs have placed more patients than ever at risk of this potentially dangerous and disabling condition. This activity provides an overview of treatment strategies for TD as part of an individualized management plan, including DRBA medication adjustment and antidyskinetic treatment.

### The clinical spectrum of levodopa-induced motor complications [^116TAume]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

After more than 40 years of clinical use, levodopa (LD) still remains the gold standard for symptomatic efficacy in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, long-term treatment with LD is often complicated by the development of various types of motor response oscillations as well as drug-induced dyskinesias. These treatment-related motor complications evolve in approximately one-third of patients after only 2 years of LD exposure and, once established, they are difficult to treat and significantly contribute to overall disability and disease burden. Although first described soon after the introduction of LD, the pathophysiology of motor complications is still not completely understood. In fact, it is most likely that non-physiological pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors, which is followed by various downstream alterations, plays a key role in the development of LD-induced motor response oscillations and dyskinesias. This review outlines the various types of motor complications and will also address underlying mechanisms, treatment options, as well as impact on clinical disability and quality of life (QoL).

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^116P8VMR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Cerebellar signs are seen in intention tremor syndromes. The main cerebellar sign is ataxia, which can become visible as dysmetria of the limbs or eye movements, dysarthria, dysdiadochokinesia and unsteady broad-based gait. Clinically, the tremor syndrome consists of a unilateral or focal, kinetic and slow (< 5 Hz) (intention) tremor, which can be accompanied by brainstem signs (eg, diplopia, cranial nerve palsy). If there are no cerebellar or brainstem signs, but only an intention tremor, the diagnosis of isolated intention tremor can be made, though this is very rare.

Dystonic posturing is the key feature of a dystonic tremor syndrome. It is now recognised that tremor is a very common feature of dystonia, occurring in 17%–55% of patients with adult-onset primary dystonia. A distinction can be made between 'dystonic tremor', in which dystonia in the affected limb is found (eg, head tremor in a patient with cervical dystonia), or 'tremor associated with dystonia', in which dystonia is found in any other body part than the tremulous limb (eg, hand tremor in a patient with cervical dystonia). Dystonic tremors are mostly postural or kinetic, but they may also occur at rest. The tremor usually has a jerky or irregular aspect, and it can exacerbate by attempting to maintain a certain posture. Sometimes a geste antagoniste (sensory trick) can be found, which helps in differentiating dystonic head tremor from essential head tremor, as does a rest tremor of the head, which seems more common in dystonic head tremor. Usually, no improvement on levodopa is seen.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^111HLWzw]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Reliable phenotypic recognition of early‐onset ataxia (EOA) among other developmental disorders with coordination impairment, such as developmental coordination disorder (DCD) 1, 2 and hypotonia of central nervous system origin, 3, 4 is important for selecting the correct diagnostic algorithm, predicting familial recurrence risk, and treating the child. However, in young children with motor coordination difficulties, clinical recognition of mild EOA features may be challenging.

Ataxia is literally translated from the Greek as 'without order', denoting impaired coordinative neurological output, which is mostly associated with disturbed functioning of the corticobasal ganglia, cerebellar network, and/or gnostic sensory afferents. 5 Ataxia can be phenotypically recognized by a lack of smoothly performed goal‐directed movements, resulting in dysdiadochokinesia, dysmetria, overshoot, impaired gait and posture, intention tremor, oculomotor dysfunction, and speech abnormalities. EOA refers to a group of rare heterogeneous disorders, mostly of recessively heritable origins, associated with the presentation of ataxic features before the age of 25 years. 6 Individual patients with EOA may reveal heterogeneous 'ataxic' motor phenotypes, 7 presenting ataxia as: (1) a solitary main symptom; (2) a main symptom in association with other comorbid movement disorder features; (3) a comorbid symptom, dominated by other prevailing movement disorder features, such as dystonia, chorea, or myoclonus; and (4) a stable and hardly discernible feature.

According to DSM‐5 criteria, 8 DCD is a developmental motor disorder characterized by non‐progressive motor incoordination, which interferes with daily activities or academic achievement, that is not attributable to a neurological, intellectual, or visual condition. 1 The descriptive diagnosis of the motor dysfunction is 'motor dyspraxia'. When the latter is due to DCD, it can be associated with other disorders such as attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 2 and also with mildly ataxic, 9 dystonic, or choreatic 10 features that are not excluded from the diagnosis. 11 Physiologically delayed motor coordination in very young children is excluded from the DCD diagnosis, since it reflects typical brain development. 12, 13 The underlying aetiology of DCD is still unclear, but dysfunctional activation within the cerebellar, basal ganglia, and corticospinal networks has been suggested. 11, 14, 15

### Gaps and controversies in catatonia as a movement disorder [^116ySNAK]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The term "catatonia" was introduced by German psychiatrist Karl Kahlbaum in 1874. Although historically tied to schizophrenia, catatonia exhibits a diverse range of phenotypes and has been observed in various medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. Its intrinsic movement characteristics and association with hypokinetic and hyperkinetic phenomenologies place catatonia within the purview of movement disorders. Despite the presence of catatonia in psychiatry literature for over 150years, many gaps and controversies persist regarding its etiopathogenesis, phenomenology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment. The current versions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) require clinicians to identify any three signs of 15 (ICD-11) or 12 (DSM-5) for the diagnosis of catatonia. Catalepsy and waxy flexibility are the only motor features with high specificity for the diagnosis. We highlight the gaps and controversies in catatonia as a movement disorder, emphasize the lack of a clear definition, and discuss the inconsistencies in the description of various catatonic signs. We propose the exploration of a bi-axial classification framework similar to that used for dystonia and tremor to encourage the evaluation of underlying etiologies and to guide therapeutic decisions to improve the outcome of these patients. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 associated with an expansion of 42 glutamine residues in TATA-box binding protein gene [^114kFR1z]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by abnormal expansions of CAG/CAA trinucleotides within the TATA-box binding protein gene (TBP). The currently accepted critical threshold of abnormal expansions is ≥ 43.

Objective

To investigate the minimal CAG/CAA expansion within the TBP in SCA17.

Results

285 patients with autosomal-dominant ataxia were examined, and abnormal or borderline expansions of CAG/CAA within TBP in eight cases were found. Of those, four patients from three families had exactly 42 CAG/CAA trinucleotides, that is, one codon less than the currently accepted critical threshold of 43. The four patients presented with a relatively benign phenotype. All had dysdiadochokinesia and dysarthria. Mild gait ataxia was observed in three of the four patients.

Conclusion

The reference definition of at least 43 CAG/CAA codons for pathological SCA17 alleles should be lowered to 42.

### Punding and dyskinesias [^114EmqAp]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

The presence of punding in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with inappropriate excessive use of dopaminergic medication but its relation to the severity of dyskinesias is not known. Through the use of clinical examination and medical chart review, the presence of punding and the severity of interdose dyskinesias were evaluated by two different observers. Punding was associated with more frequent interventions to reduce dyskinesias and with greater dyskinesia severity. We suggest the neural systems mediating the expression of dyskinesias and punding might overlap and that punding should be looked for systematically in PD patients presenting with disabling severe dyskinesias.

### Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111ZrmP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — interpretation of strong versus conditional recommendations for stakeholders clarifies that for patients, Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas under a conditional recommendation The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. For clinicians, a strong recommendation states Most individuals should receive the intervention. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences, while a conditional recommendation advises to Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences. For policy makers, a strong recommendation means The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, whereas conditional recommendations imply Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction in schizophrenia, alcoholism, and their comorbidity [^111Jqd7p]. Schizophrenia Research (2002). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of cerebellar structure and function, long recognized as a hallmark of chronic alcohol abuse, have also occasionally been noted in patients with schizophrenia. We used a four-point rating scale to assess clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction in men meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia (N = 34) and alcohol dependence (N = 15) as well as normal control subjects (N = 28). Compared to controls, alcoholics had impaired ratings of gait ataxia and instability of stance with eyes closed, and schizophrenics had impaired ratings of stance with eyes closed. The incidence of dysdiadochokinesia was greater in schizophrenics, but not alcoholics, than controls. The incidence of gait and stance abnormalities was higher in both patient groups relative to controls: within the schizophrenic group, 50–70% of those with positive signs for gait or stance impairment were comorbid for alcoholism, while only 25% of those with positive signs for dysdiadochokinesia were comorbid for alcoholism. The presence of dysdiadochokinesia in the schizophrenic group suggests cerebellar dysfunction that is independent of the effects of alcohol. By contrast, clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction of gait and stance in patients with schizophrenia may be secondary to the effects of alcohol on the cerebellum.

### Psychogenic movement disorders: past developments, current status, and future directions [^1171S6NX]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a "laboratory-supported definite" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.

2.4 Data Extraction Process

Two reviewers extracted data independently, with disagreements resolved by consensus in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. When patients were in multiple papers and there were disagreements, the papers were re‐reviewed independently, and a consensus was determined by the reviewers.

The following data were extracted: age at onset, age at diagnosis, age at death, age at last report, cataract, optic disk pallor, tendon xanthomas, osteoporosis, osteopenia, pes cavus, intellectual disability, learning difficulty, developmental delay, cognitive decline, dementia, psychiatric disturbances, seizures, epilepsy, cerebellar signs, dysmetria, nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesia, dysarthria, speech disturbances, ataxia, gait abnormality, sensory ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, dentate nucleus lesions, cerebellar white matter lesions, intention tremor, pyramidal signs, clonus, hypotonia, spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, spastic paraparesis, spastic tetraparesis, parkinsonism, resting tremor, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, akinesia, rigidity, masked face, hypomimia, peripheral neuropathy, axonal neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, polyneuropathy, diarrhea, neonatal jaundice, cholestasis and cholestanol levels.

Cataracts were selected when individuals were noted as having cataracts or juvenile cataracts. Tendon xanthoma was selected when individuals were noted as having tendon xanthomas on any parts of their body. The osteoporosis/osteopenia category was selected when patients were noted as having osteoporosis or osteopenia or when bone mineral density assessment z‐scores were below the expected range for age. Seizure was selected when patients were reported as having epilepsy or seizures.

Cognition was variably described across publications. Psychiatric disturbance was selected when patients were noted as having a psychiatric disorder or when they were reported to have behavioral changes, anxiety, agitation, aggression, delusions, depression, hallucinations, apathy, or suicide. For this study, intellectual disability was defined as when an individual was reported as having intellectual disability or "mental retardation" under the age of 22. The dementia category was defined as when an individual was noted as having dementia with onset over the age of 21 or with evidence of clinical testing using standardized instruments (MOCA or MMSE).

### Consensus statement on the classification of tremors. from the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society [^115LtVqJ]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.

Objectives

Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.

Methods

Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: "tremor", "tremor disorders", "essential tremor", "dystonic tremor", and "classification" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.

Results

Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.

Conclusions

This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### PICADAR: a diagnostic predictive tool for primary ciliary dyskinesia [^112x71np]. The European Respiratory Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Primary ciliary dyskinesia rule (PICADAR)" for primary ciliary dyskinesia.

The Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Rule, also known as PICADAR, is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a rare, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by chronic upper and lower respiratory tract disease. This calculator is applicable to patients who present with symptoms suggestive of PCD, such as chronic cough, chronic rhinosinusitis, and recurrent or persistent lower respiratory tract infections.

The PICADAR score is a useful tool for identifying patients who are at high risk of having PCD and who may benefit from further diagnostic testing. It uses seven clinical features to calculate a score, including full-term gestation, persistent wet cough, persistent rhinitis, neonatal chest symptoms, situs inversus or unexplained cardiac defects, congenital hearing defect, and a history of PCD in a sibling.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the PICADAR score may include patients who have other known causes for their respiratory symptoms, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, or immunodeficiency disorders. It's also important to note that while the PICADAR score can help identify patients at high risk for PCD, it is not definitive and further diagnostic testing is required for a confirmed diagnosis.

The PICADAR calculator helps estimate the likelihood of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) by evaluating a patient's symptoms through eight targeted questions. Each response translates into a numerical score based on a specific scoring framework, which together reflect the risk of PCD.

Patients answer the following questions:

- Do they have a daily wet cough that started in early childhood? A "Yes" translates to 0 points, whereas "No" scores 15 points.
- Were they born preterm or at full term? Being born "Term" adds 2 points.
- Did they experience chest symptoms such as tachypnea, cough, or pneumonia in the neonatal period? If "Yes", 2 points are awarded.
- Were they admitted to a neonatal unit? Similar to chest symptoms, a "Yes" yields 2 points.
- Do they have a situs abnormality like situs inversus or heterotaxy? A "Yes" response results in 4 points.
- Is there a congenital heart defect present? This also contributes 2 points if responded with "Yes".
- Do they have persistent perennial rhinitis? A "Yes" equals 1 point.
- Finally, do they experience chronic ear or hearing symptoms such as glue ear, serous otitis media, hearing loss, or ear perforation? A "Yes" scores another point.

Responses are converted into scores, and all are summed to create a total. This sum determines the risk of PCD based on the following score-to-risk mapping:

- Score of 0 corresponds to a 0.1% risk.
- Score of 1 indicates a 0.3% risk.
- Score of 2 suggests 0.8% risk.
- Score of 3 means 1.9% risk.
- Score of 4 estimates a 4.7% risk.
- Score of 5 reaches an 11.1% risk.
- Score of 6 suggests 23.9% risk.
- Score of 7 indicates a 44.1% risk.
- Score of 8 corresponds to a 66.4% risk.
- Score of 9 represents 83.3% risk.
- Score of 10 implies 92.6% risk.
- Score of 11 shows 96.9% risk.
- Score of 12 corresponds to 98.7% risk.
- A score of 13 or higher suggests an overwhelming 99.8% risk of PCD.

Crucially, a score of -1 or below reflects a scenario not supported by this calculator, emphasizing its reliance on the presence of a wet cough as a key factor.

Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of isoniazid (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Symptoms can be serious and potentially life threatening. If symptoms or signs of SCARs develop, discontinue isoniazid tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy.

Cerebellar Syndrome

Cerebellar syndrome which may include abnormal motor coordination presenting as gait, trunk, and limb ataxia, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysarthria, or nystagmus, has been reported in postmarketing case reports with the use of isoniazid (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Most cases of cerebellar syndrome involved patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), however, cerebellar syndrome was also reported in patients without CKD. Discontinue isoniazid tablets if symptoms or signs of cerebellar syndrome occur.

### Assessment of the reliability, responsiveness, and meaningfulness of the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) for lysosomal storage disorders [^115d6ExY]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

SARA for non- ataxia disorders

The SARA scale was thus initially developed to measure symptoms of cerebellar ataxia in autosomal-dominant Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs). Later, it was validated for use in other various types of ataxias. More recently, the SARA has been increasingly utilized as a clinical outcome assessment for a wide range of disorders, ranging from rare entities such as lysosomal disorders to more common pediatric cancers. The generalizability of the SARA may be related to multi-item assessments that can be categorized into 4 disease-agnostic functionally different categories:
A. Ambulation & function of lower extremities: test items (1) gait, (8) heel–shin slide
B. Postural balance: test items (2) stance, (3) sitting
C. Speech: test items (4) speech disturbance
D. Function of upper extremities (fine motor): test items (5) finger chase, (6) nose–finger, (7) fast alternating hand movements

When a patient performs voluntary movements as part of the SARA assessments, such as speaking or walking, this requires a sequence of coordinated actions (e.g. adequate motivation, attention, cognition, hearing, planning of movements, muscle power, strength, control and precision of movements) that involve many regions of the brain from the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem to the corticospinal tract, and the spinal cord. In LSDs, cellular damage and cell death occur throughout the entirety of the central nervous system, manifesting as a wide range of heterogeneous neurological signs and symptoms (e.g. dysarthrophonia, ocular motor, dysmetria, ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, dystonia, tremor, hypotonia, dyskinesias, spasticity — see Table 2), each of which could impact the ability of the patient to undertake the necessary sequence and precision of actions required to perform the SARA tasks, ultimately resulting in dysfunction in one or more of the above functional categories.

Table 2
Neurological symptoms of lysosomal storage disorders/impact on SARA test item

Therefore, we hypothesized that a change in the functional performance as assessed by the SARA scale could be indicative of broad alterations in many functional neurological networks, allowing its use as a measure of overall neurological disease severity in LSDs, as opposed to an isolated measure of cerebellar ataxia.

The mean changes in the AIMS total score by visit are shown in Figure 3.

In Study 2, a 12-week, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose trial, adults with tardive dyskinesia (n = 113) received daily doses of placebo or AUSTEDO, starting at 12 mg per day with increases allowed in 6-mg increments at 1-week intervals until satisfactory control of dyskinesia was achieved, until intolerable side effects occurred, or until a maximal dose of 48 mg per day was reached. Treatment duration included a 6-week dose titration period and a 6-week maintenance period followed by a 1-week washout. The population was 25 to 75 years old (mean 55 years), 48% male, and 70% Caucasian. Patients were titrated to an optimal dose over 6 weeks. The average dose of AUSTEDO after treatment was 38.3 mg per day. There was no evidence suggesting substantial differences in efficacy across various demographic groups. In Study 2, AIMS total score for patients receiving AUSTEDO demonstrated statistically significant improvement by 3.0 units from baseline to endpoint (Week 12), compared with 1.6 units in the placebo group with a treatment effect of -1.4 units. Table 6 summarizes the effects of AUSTEDO on tardive dyskinesia based on the AIMS.

### Aripiprazole (Opipza) [^114sVQwq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dystonia

Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

Additional Findings Observed in Clinical Trials

Adverse Reactions in Long-Term, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials

The adverse reactions reported in a 26-week, double-blind trial comparing oral aripiprazole and placebo in patients with schizophrenia were generally consistent with those reported in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials, except for a higher incidence of tremor [8% (12/153) for aripiprazole tablets vs. 2% (3/153) for placebo]. In this study, the majority of the cases of tremor were of mild intensity (8/12 mild and 4/12 moderate), occurred early in therapy (9/12 ≤ 49 days), and were of limited duration (7/12 ≤ 10 days). Tremor led to discontinuation (< 1%) of aripiprazole. In addition, in a long-term (52 weeks), active-controlled study, the incidence of tremor was 5% (40/859) for aripiprazole.

Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trial Evaluation of Aripiprazole

### Progressive myeloneuropathy with symptomatic anaemia [^112WjRUT]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Additionally, given our patient's symptoms of cerebellar ataxia (dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia), there was a concern for cerebellar lesions. However, MRI of the brain and cervical spine did not demonstrate a cerebellar lesion or abnormal enhancement to suggest a stroke or multiple sclerosis. Vitamin E deficiency was also considered. Testing for vitamin E deficiency was advised during an outpatient neurology follow-up appointment. However, the patient did not go to have this test completed.

Lymphoproliferative disorders such as lymphoma, leukaemia and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome are typically characterised by lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. While the bone marrow biopsy demonstrated cytoplasmic vacuolisation, suggestive of lymphoma, our patient did not have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly on physical examination. Serum LDH was also within normal limits. SPEP and UPEP were unremarkable. Given these results, the diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder was less likely.

MDS can have variable presentations but will almost always demonstrate a macrocytic or normocytic anaemia. Leucopenia is seen in about half of MDS cases while varying degrees of thrombocytopenia are seen in a quarter of MDS cases. In our patient, macrocytic anaemia and neutropenia may suggest MDS, and a bone marrow biopsy would be warranted to further evaluate for MDS. However, the additional symptoms of lower extremity neuropathy, gait abnormalities and abnormal neurological examination cannot be ignored in the constellation of symptoms. Given the combination of neurological and haematological findings, nutrient deficiency should be studied. Serum studies to evaluate for these deficiencies should be obtained prior to unnecessary invasive procedures.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease: executive summary [^1148qAof]. Neurosurgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease deep brain stimulation (DBS) target comparison — motor and dyskinesia effects: Motor function in the "on" medication "on" stimulation condition seems to improve equally, irrespective of whether STN or GPi is selected; in contrast, there is conflicting Class I data for the "off" medication condition on whether the latter target provides better control or whether GPi or STN DBS improve equally. There is strong consensus that STN DBS allows a more robust reduction of medications postoperatively. Class I evidence suggests GPi may be associated with a greater reduction in dyskinesias, but this reduction is not reflected in motor diaries measuring hours per day without dyskinesias, and findings are compatible with STN DBS exerting anti-dyskinetic effects mainly through medication reductions whereas GPi DBS suppresses dyskinesias directly.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequent reactions are those affecting the nervous system and the liver.

Nervous System Reactions

Peripheral neuropathy is the most common toxic effect. It is dose-related, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuritis (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics) and is usually preceded by paresthesias of the feet and hands. The incidence is higher in "slow inactivators".

Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment and toxic psychosis.

Cerebellar syndrome, which may include abnormal motor coordination manifesting as gait, trunk, and limb ataxia, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysarthria, or nystagmus, have been reported in post marketing case reports (see WARNINGS).

Hepatic Reactions

See boxed warning. Elevated serum transaminase (SGOT; SGPT), bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice and occasionally severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The common prodromal symptoms of hepatitis are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise and weakness. Mild hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by mild and transient elevation of serum transaminase levels occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients taking isoniazid. This abnormality usually appears in the first 1 to 3 months of treatment but can occur at any time during therapy. In most instances, enzyme levels return to normal and generally, there is no necessity to discontinue medication during the period of mild serum transaminase elevation. In occasional instances, progressive liver damage occurs, with accompanying symptoms. If the SGOT value exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of the isoniazid should be strongly considered. The frequency of progressive liver damage increases with age. It is rare in persons under 20, but occurs in up to 2.3 percent of those over 50 years of age.

Gastrointestinal Reactions

Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and pancreatitis.

Hematologic Reactions

Agranulocytosis; hemolytic, sideroblastic or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia; and eosinophilia.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Fever, skin eruptions (morbilliform, maculopapular, purpuric or exfoliative), lymphadenopathy, vasculitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia syndrome (DRESS) (see WARNINGS).

In Study 1, a 12-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial, adults with tardive dyskinesia were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 12 mg AUSTEDO, 24 mg AUSTEDO, 36 mg AUSTEDO, or placebo. Treatment duration included a 4-week dose escalation period and an 8-week maintenance period followed by a 1-week washout. The dose of AUSTEDO was started at 12 mg per day and increased at weekly intervals in 6 mg/day increments to a dose target of 12 mg, 24 mg or 36 mg per day. The population (n = 222) was 21 to 81 years old (mean 57 years), 48% male, and 79% Caucasian. In Study 1, the AIMS total score for patients receiving AUSTEDO demonstrated statistically significant improvement, from baseline to Week 12, of 3.3 and 3.2 units for the 36 mg and 24 mg arms, respectively, compared with 1.4 units in placebo (Study 1 in Table 6). The improvements on the AIMS total score over the course of the study are displayed in Figure 3. Data did not suggest substantial differences in efficacy across various demographic groups. The treatment response rate distribution, based on magnitude of AIMS total score from baseline to week 12 is displayed in Figure 4.

### Protein kinase C γ antibodies and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration [^113fxiFL]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2013). Low credibility.

Onconeural antibodies are diagnostic markers for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes and indicate the underlying tumor type. Recently, a new antibody against protein-kinase Cγ (PKCγ) was detected in a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD). We report here a second patient. A 70-year-old woman presented with cerebellar ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, and dysarthria. Her serum showed immunoreactivity against the cytoplasm, dendrites and axons of Purkinje cells in tissue-based screening, later confirmed by immunoblot and phage plaques as anti-PKCγ. Tumor search revealed an adenocarcinoma of hepatobiliary origin. Detection of PKCγ antibodies should be considered in PCD and adenocarcinoma without typical onconeural antibodies.

The etiology of cerebellar disorders is diverse and includes immune-mediated mechanisms. More specifically, autoimmune cerebellar symptoms may be associated with antibodies against intracellular targets such as anti-GAD antibodies, with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with antibodies such as anti-Yo, Hu, and Tr/DNER, with the cerebellar type of Hashimoto encephalopathy, with ataxia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, but also with antibodies that target membrane-bound molecules, primarily expressed in the Purkinje neurons, such as Ca/RhoGTPase-activating protein 26 (ARHGAP26)and mGluR1.

Examination

As in all of neurology, the examination of an MSA patient begins from the waiting room. Patients may have a wide-based or shuffling gait, often with a stooped posture. Retrocollis or a rigid extended posture might suggest progressive supranuclear palsy.

Abnormal postures such as Pisa syndrome (laterocollis of the trunk), disproportionate antecollis or contractures of the hands and feet may indicate MSA. Asymmetrical limb dystonia (or an alien limb) could relate to corticobasal syndrome.

Eye movements should be examined (saccades and pursuit) for cerebellar signs and for vertical saccade slowing/gaze restriction, indicating a supranuclear gaze palsy, as in progressive supranuclear palsy (table 5). A head impulse test is a useful screen particularly in MSA-C patients, looking for evidence of peripheral vestibulopathy as seen in CANVAS (cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome).

Table 5
Provides a list of possible MSA mimics and when to consider them

MSA patients often (but not always) have symmetrical bradykinesia and rigidity. Tremor should be examined at rest, with an outstretched posture and with action. Look for myoclonus (spontaneous/stimulus induced) or polyminimyoclonus. Cerebellar signs should be elicited through tests for dysdiadochokinesia, finger–nose and heel–shin testing. Tandem gait is often affected early in gait ataxia, but may not be specific for cerebellar dysfunction.

Reflexes and plantar responses should be checked for pyramidal involvement. Depressed reflexes with an abnormal sensory examination could indicate a peripheral neuropathy and consideration of CANVAS, Friedreich's ataxia and fragile X tremor–ataxia syndrome).

All patients should have a lying and standing blood pressure and HR measured if they can stand for 3 min. In addition, retropulsion should be checked unless the patient is highly likely to come to harm from it.

Over the last few years, there have been several case reports of autoimmune antibody mediated disease (CV2/CRMP5, Anti-Hu, Homer-3) causing symptoms in keeping with MSA. However, these cases usually stand out from typical MSA in having with extremely rapid symptom progression, within weeks to months.

### Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency [^115rr27i]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). High credibility.

Clinical patterns — percentages reported below refer to 190 published THD patients evaluated. Movement disorders and delayed gross motor development are the most frequent characteristic of THD; within movement disorders, reported frequencies include dystonia (59%), hypokinesia/bradykinesia (47%), rigidity (36%), tremor (27%), gait disturbance (16%), chorea (8%), dyskinesia (5%), and parkinsonism (5%). Movement disorders showed diurnal fluctuation in 64 THD cases (34%), and oculogyric crises were reported in n = 88 (46%). Palpebral ptosis was noted in 16% of THD patients, and seizures were also described (n = 8, 4%). Cognition is variably affected, with a minority of 17 cases (9%) reported to have normal intelligence and 96 individuals (51%) documented with cognitive impairments; among children, 79 (42%) had developmental delay and 17 (9%) had global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability.

### A study of tremor in multiple sclerosis [^115ab5Pu]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

One hundred patients with definite multiple sclerosis, who were randomly selected from a multiple sclerosis unit in London, were examined in order to study the prevalence, subtypes, clinical features and associated disability of tremor in this population. There were 35 males and 65 females with an average age of 47 years and an average disease duration of 18.8 years. The mean tremor duration was 13 years, with a median latency of 11 years from disease onset to appearance of tremor. Tremor was reported in 37 patients but was detected in 58. Tremor affected the arms (56%), legs (10%), head (9%) and trunk (7%). There were no examples of face, tongue or jaw tremor. All the patients had action tremor, either postural or kinetic (including intention). Rest, Holmes' ('rubral') and primary orthostatic tremors were not encountered. Tremor severity ranged from minimal in 27%, to mild in 16% and moderate or severe in 15% of cases. Tremor severity correlated with the degree of dysarthria, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia but not with grip strength. In order to determine the clinical characteristics of these tremors, the action tremors of the upper limbs were subclassified according to the predominant site and state of tremulous activity. Of the 50 patients with tremor in the right arm, 32% had distal postural tremor, 36% had distal postural and kinetic tremor, 16% had proximal postural and kinetic tremor; 4% had proximal and distal postural and kinetic tremor and 12% isolated intention tremor. Twenty-seven percent of the overall study population had tremor-related disability and 10% had incapacitating tremor. Patients with abnormal tremor (severity grade > 1/10) were more likely than those without tremor to be wheelchair dependent and have a worse Expanded Disability Systems Score, but Barthel activities of daily living indices and cognitive scores were comparable in the two groups.

### International clinical practice recommendations on the definition, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and psychosocial aspects of developmental coordination disorder [^116kFo4J]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

4.2.2 General aspects on screening

Early identification of children with motor impairments has been recommended. 89, 90 On the other hand, the diagnosis of DCD before the age of 5 years is not generally recommended. This has already been discussed (Recommendation 4).

Screening instruments for assessment of DCD are not sufficiently refined to enable highly valid and reliable results. Therefore, at present, it is not useful to screen the population for DCD. The diagnosis of DCD can only be made for a clinical population within a specified setting as described below.

Motor coordination test batteries are generally not feasible as screening protocols owing to both time and costs.

4.2.3 History taking: covering criteria IV, III, II, and I (previous tests)

4.2.4 Clinical examination: covering criteria III and II

In addition to the exploration of the history, clinical examination is mainly necessary to exclude the presence of other medical conditions that may explain motor impairment. The aim of the neurological status is to rule out other movement disorders and to support criterion III. A comprehensive clinical examination should be performed to verify that the disturbance is not due to a psychosocial condition (e.g. deprivation, child abuse) and/or general medical condition (e.g. cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, or muscular dystrophy).

Exclusion of neurological disorders such as corticospinal, cerebellar, extrapyramidal, or neuromuscular origin. Signs of neurometabolic disorders or of acquired neurological disorders (prenatal, perinatal, postnatal), peripheral neurological disorders. Since the previous GCP, no further studies on the diagnostic value of minor neurological dysfunction or the soft signs exhibited by individuals with DCD have been found.

A behavioural and cognitive evaluation is recommended for all children with DCD because attentional disorders, learning disorders, and ASD are frequent co‐occurances. If features of maladaptive behavioural or emotional issues exist, further examination according to the respective guidelines is necessary.

If there is a normal history of school and academic achievements, cognitive function does not need to be evaluated by objective measures (e.g. IQ testing). However, a test for intellectual ability is recommended, if there is any doubt.

Methods

Study collective and neuro-otological examination

6396 patients, who presented to the German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders (DSGZ, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany) between 2015 and 2018 with the chief complaints of vertigo, dizziness, or balance disorders, were screened retrospectively to identify patients with central vestibular disorders. Inclusion criteria were a minimum age of 18 years and sufficient language skills. Patients with multifactorial central pathology were excluded from the analyses.

All patients underwent a detailed medical history taking and a standardised clinical neurological examination, especially including precise sensory testing and positioning manoeuvres. Furthermore, all patients underwent a specialized neuro-otological and neuro-orthoptic examination including a visual acuity test (Snellen chart), measurements of the subjective visual vertical (SVV, normal range 0° ± 2.5°) and fundus photography to test for acute vestibular tone imbalance in the roll plane. Video-oculography (EyeSeeCam ®, Interacoustics, Denmark) was applied during the horizontal head impulse test to analyse the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in the high-frequency range and bithermal caloric testing of the horizontal semicircular canal function in the low-frequency range in a standardised manner. If useful additional audiometry, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, eye movement recording, gait analysis, or posturography were performed.

A total of 152 patients with specific chronic central vestibular disorders were identified from the retrospective cohort and classified into three subgroups:
"Pure" cerebellar ocular motor disorders (COD) such as downbeat nystagmus syndrome without other signs of cerebellar dysfunction (n = 61).
Cerebellar ataxia syndromes (CA) in the presence of cerebellar ocular motor disorders and further signs of cerebellar dysfunction, e.g. gait, truncal or limb ataxia, dysarthria, tremor or dysdiadochokinesia (n = 63; 30 idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia, 10 cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndromes (CANVAS); 7 spinocerebellar ataxia, 3 episodic ataxia type II, 4 other hereditary ataxia; 2 autoimmune, 1 metabolic, 4 post ischemia, 2 post intracranial haemorrhages).
Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes (APS, n = 28) caused by multiple system atrophy of cerebellar (MSA-C, n = 15) or parkinsonian type (MSA-P, n = 4), or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 9).
