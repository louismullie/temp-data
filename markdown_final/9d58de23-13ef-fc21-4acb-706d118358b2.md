## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cephalexin (Keflex) increases the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection and how to contextualize that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and what the FDA says about cephalexin and C. difficile. Then, I should verify the mechanistic plausibility and whether any antibiotic can theoretically precipitate CDI. Next, I will review comparative risk data across antibiotic classes to see where cephalexin fits. After that, I should check guideline positions and stewardship recommendations. Finally, I will translate this into practical prescribing advice and monitoring steps, including special populations and what to do if CDI is suspected.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. The FDA labeling for cephalexin explicitly warns that Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cephalexin, and that CDAD can range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, so I should not understate this risk even if cephalexin is not among the highest-risk agents [^cf210a6a].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. CDI risk arises when antibiotics disrupt normal colonic flora, reducing colonization resistance and allowing C. difficile proliferation and toxin production; this is a class effect and can occur with essentially any systemic antibiotic, including beta-lactams like cephalexin, though the magnitude of risk varies by agent and context [^cf210a6a] [^cbbc2cd4] [^6e1bc457].

> Next, I should review comparative risk across antibiotic classes. Hold on, I should verify which agents carry the highest risk. Multiple high-quality sources consistently rank third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and carbapenems as highest risk, whereas first-generation cephalosporins like cephalexin are generally considered lower risk but not risk-free; this aligns with dental and stewardship guidance noting cephalexin as a reasonable alternative when penicillins are contraindicated, albeit with attention to CDI prevention as a community priority [^a533ea33] [^6c1e2c8f] [^7fb45163].

> I need to check whether any quantitative estimates exist for cephalexin specifically. I should double-check the provided materials. While many cohort studies quantify risk for broad classes, I do not see a cephalexin-specific hazard ratio in the supplied references; the most granular signals repeatedly implicate broader cephalosporin classes rather than isolating cephalexin, reinforcing that cephalexin's risk is real but likely lower than agents like ceftriaxone or clindamycin [^a533ea33] [^8872b82b].

> Let me consider guideline synthesis to ensure consistency. IDSA/SHEA and SHEA/IDSA/APIC stewardship guidance emphasize minimizing high-risk antibiotics and duration, and they target restriction of third-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones rather than first-generation agents like cephalexin; this supports the interpretation that cephalexin is not a high-priority restriction target, though it remains a potential CDI trigger and warrants judicious use [^4922c926] [^81fd88e0].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk or has recent CDI? I should confirm special contexts. In patients with prior CDI, older age, immunocompromise, or prolonged hospitalization, even lower-risk antibiotics can tip the balance; in such cases, stewardship principles favor choosing the lowest-risk effective agent, using the shortest effective course, and in select very-high-risk scenarios, considering secondary prophylaxis strategies, recognizing that evidence for prophylaxis is evolving and not broadly indicated [^a533ea33] [^a33c072a] [^8be2ae77].

> I will now examine practical prescribing and monitoring steps. Let me think about duration first: keep courses as short as clinically justified, because cumulative antibiotic exposure increases CDI risk. If a patient on cephalexin develops three or more loose stools in 24 hours, I should stop the offending antibiotic when feasible and test for C. difficile with a two-step algorithm that includes a highly sensitive screening test followed by a highly specific confirmatory test to distinguish colonization from infection, and then treat per severity-based guidelines if confirmed [^81fd88e0] [^eea1ada2] [^3f591e30].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric and community angles. Children can develop community-associated CDI after antibiotic exposure, and cephalosporins are among the classes linked to increased risk, albeit at lower absolute rates than high-risk agents; this reinforces the need for stewardship even in outpatient settings where cephalexin is commonly used [^3679bcd9] [^271ebe8b].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I'm precise. Yes, cephalexin can cause C. difficile infection, because all systemic antibiotics can disrupt the microbiome; however, cephalexin is generally considered a lower-risk cephalosporin compared with third-generation agents, so the absolute risk is modest but not negligible, especially with longer courses, in older adults, inpatients, or those with prior CDI or colonization, and it warrants the same vigilance for diarrhea and the same stewardship principles as any antibiotic [^cf210a6a] [^a533ea33] [^81fd88e0].

---

Keflex (cephalexin) **can cause C. difficile infection** because it disrupts normal gut flora, allowing C. difficile to overgrow and produce toxins [^cf210a6a]. The risk is **lower than with high-risk antibiotics** (e.g. clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins) but is not zero, especially in older adults, those with recent antibiotic exposure, or immunocompromised patients [^a533ea33] [^8872b82b]. If diarrhea occurs during or after cephalexin use, **test for C. difficile** and stop the antibiotic if CDI is suspected or confirmed [^cf210a6a] [^eea1ada2].

---

## Mechanism of C. difficile infection associated with cephalexin

Cephalexin, like other antibiotics, **disrupts normal gut microbiota**, reducing colonization resistance and allowing C. difficile to proliferate and produce toxins A and B, causing CDI [^cf210a6a] [^6e1bc457]. This is a class effect of antibiotics, not unique to cephalexin [^cf210a6a].

---

## Risk factors for C. difficile infection with cephalexin

Several factors **increase the risk** of CDI with cephalexin:

- **Age**: Older adults (> 65 years) have higher risk due to altered microbiota and comorbidities [^27482b52].
- **Comorbidities**: Immunocompromised status, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic kidney disease increase susceptibility [^a533ea33].
- **Concurrent medications**: Proton pump inhibitors and other antibiotics further elevate risk [^a533ea33].
- **Duration of therapy**: Longer antibiotic courses increase risk [^8872b82b].

---

## Incidence and severity of C. difficile infection with cephalexin

The exact incidence of CDI with cephalexin is not well-defined, but **first-generation cephalosporins are generally lower risk** than third-generation agents [^a533ea33]. However, CDI can still occur and may be severe, including pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon [^cf210a6a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **antibiotic stewardship** to minimize CDI risk:

- **Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration** of cephalexin [^notfound].
- **Avoid unnecessary antibiotic use**, especially in patients with risk factors for CDI [^8e314e9b].
- **Monitor for diarrhea** during and after therapy; test for C. difficile if diarrhea occurs [^cf210a6a].

---

## Management of C. difficile infection associated with cephalexin

If CDI is suspected or confirmed during cephalexin therapy:

- **Discontinue cephalexin** immediately if clinically feasible [^cf210a6a].
- **Initiate CDI treatment** with oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin based on severity [^3f591e30].
- **Provide supportive care**, including hydration and electrolyte management [^cf210a6a].

---

## Preventive measures

To reduce the risk of CDI with cephalexin:

- **Prescribe only when clearly indicated** for bacterial infections [^8e314e9b].
- **Use the shortest effective course** (typically 5–7 days) [^notfound].
- **Educate patients** to report diarrhea promptly during and after therapy [^notfound].

---

Keflex (cephalexin) **can cause C. difficile infection** by disrupting gut microbiota, with risk influenced by patient factors and treatment duration. Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, monitor for diarrhea, and stop cephalexin if CDI is suspected or confirmed [^cf210a6a].

Evaluation of suspected Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)—When CDI is suspected, a disease-specific history should be performed emphasizing risk factors, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and signs of severe or fulminant disease. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Symptoms typically manifest soon after starting antibiotic therapy for another disease process, but can be delayed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The strongest risk factor for developing CDI is recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), and increased duration of exposure and number of antibiotics used are associated with higher risk for developing CDI, with drugs such as clindamycin, ampicillin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, and thirdgeneration cephalosporins more commonly associated with developing CDI.

Key Points

Question

What is the hazard of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) between asymptomatic carriers compared with noncarriers of C difficile, and is this hazard associated with antibiotic exposure?

Findings

In this cohort study of 33 756 hospitalizations among 23 001 patients, asymptomatic carriers had a higher hazard of CDI. Antibiotic exposure, particularly to amoxicillin and clavulanate and piperacillin and tazobactam, was associated with an increased hazard of CDI, especially among noncarriers, with no additional hazard among carriers.

Meaning

These findings suggest that while antibiotic stewardship may be associated with a reduced hazard of CDI in asymptomatic carriers given their already elevated hazard, additional strategies may be warranted.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) occur frequently among adults. The pathophysiology of CDI is related to disruption of normal gut flora and risk factors include hospitalization, use of antibiotic therapy, and older age. Clinical manifestations can range from mild disease to toxic megacolon. Diagnosis is challenging and is based on a combination of clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. Therapy includes cessation of antibiotics, or use of other agents depending on the severity of illness. Many novel agents for the treatment and prevention of CDI show promise and are under investigation.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^f516ba22]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline—undesirable effects of systemic antibiotics are quantified across outcomes, including community-associated Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection, antibiotic-resistant infections, costs, hospitalizations, and anaphylaxis. Of 10,000 people with a community-associated C. difficile infection in 2011, approximately 640 may have been exposed to antibiotics received from a dentist; of 10,000 people with a community-associated C. difficile infection, approximately 80 people probably died due to exposure to antibiotics. At least 2 million people may experience an antibiotic-resistant infection annually in the United States, and annually, there may have been approximately 23,000 deaths due to antibiotic-resistant infections. In 2011, the mean community-associated C. difficile—attributable cost was likely $3 billion, and the guideline authors approximated that in 2011 $300 million may have been related to community-associated C. difficile infections that were associated with a dental prescription for antibiotics. In 2008, antibiotic resistance may have caused $20 billion in direct costs with an additional $35 billion associated with productivity losses; the guideline authors approximate that $2 billion in direct costs with an additional $3.5 billion associated with productivity losses may have been related to antibiotic resistance associated with a dental prescription for antibiotics. Of 10,000 people with a community-associated C. difficile infection, 1,270 patients probably listed community-associated C. difficile infection as the primary reason for admission to the hospital, and the guideline authors approximated that in 2006, 0.24% of infection-related hospitalizations due to antibiotic-resistant infections may have been associated with a dental prescription for antibiotics. Of 100,000 hospitalizations from 1995 through 2013, approximately 46 patients may have reported anaphylaxis due to a penicillin drug class and received the antibiotic from a dentist; 2 patients may have reported anaphylaxis due to amoxicillin and received the antibiotic from a dentist; 6 patients may have reported anaphylaxis due to a cephalosporin drug class and received the antibiotic from a dentist; and 1 patient may have reported anaphylaxis due to cephalexin and received the antibiotic from a dentist.

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^d6bf2143]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of health care–associated infections. Patients with C difficile infection (CDI) endure considerable morbidity and mortality, while health care facilities face substantial costs related to treatment and infection control efforts.,, Despite various preventive strategies, the incidence of CDI remains high, necessitating further exploration of risk factors and targeted interventions.

C difficile infection occurs primarily in individuals with disrupted gut microbiota, and antibiotic exposure is a well-recognized risk factor. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, substantially increase CDI risk by altering the gut microbiome and creating conditions favorable for C difficile colonization and proliferation. Moreover, the risk of CDI is influenced by the duration and intensity of antibiotic exposure, with prolonged and multiple courses of antibiotics considered particularly hazardous.Other risk factors include advanced age, comorbidities, proton pump inhibitor use, and prior CDI events.

In addition to these general risk factors, asymptomatic carriers of C difficile, ie, individuals with positive test results for the bacterium without exhibiting symptoms, present unique challenges in health care settings. These carriers not only act as potential reservoirs for transmission but also are at an elevated risk of progressing to clinical CDI.,, However, the specific interactions among antibiotic use, type, and duration of treatment in this high-risk group remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to address these knowledge gaps by quantifying the rate of hospital-onset CDI among carriers of C difficile compared with noncarriers and by evaluating the role of antibiotic exposure in shaping this risk.

### Cephalexin [^cf210a6a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions in the form of rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with the use of cephalexin. Before therapy with cephalexin is instituted, inquire whether the patient has a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

If an allergic reaction to cephalexin occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate treatment.

5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cephalexin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.3 Direct Coombs’ Test Seroconversion

Positive direct Coombs’ tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibacterial drugs including cephalexin. Acute intravascular hemolysis induced by cephalexin therapy has been reported. If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy, perform a diagnostic work-up for drug-induced hemolytic anemia, discontinue cephalexin and institute appropriate therapy.

5.4 Seizure Potential

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures occur, discontinue cephalexin. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection is the most frequently identified health care-associated infection in the United States. C difficile has also emerged as a cause of community-associated diarrhea, resulting in increased incidence of community-associated infection. Clinical illness ranges in severity from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis and death. Appropriate management of infection requires understanding of the various diagnostic assays and therapeutic options as well as relevant measures to infection prevention. This article provides updated recommendations regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of incident and recurrent C difficile infection.

INTRODUCTION

As the causative agent of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the bacterium C. difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic spore forming pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract. As a toxin-mediated disease, CDI poses a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems globally. CDI causes a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to life-threatening complications such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic mega-colon. Antibiotic treatment can fail to fully resolve the primary infection, resulting in the relapse of disease in up to 20% of cases. C. difficile has been listed as an urgent threat by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC, USA) with an estimated 500 000 cases per year and 12 800 deaths with $1B attributable costs in the United States. The economic impact of CDI also represents a significant burden in Europe, with costs to healthcare systems estimated at €3000M per year. Risk factors for the development of primary CDI include age ≥65 years, antibiotic use, with increased risk for each extra antibiotic prescribed, and prior hospital admission.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is a Gram-positive, obligate anaerobic bacterium that is a member of the Firmicutes phylum. Its highly resistant spores survive on surfaces for long periods, rendering it highly transmissible from person to person. This occurs mainly in hospitalization facilities, categorizing C. difficile infection (CDI) as a nosocomial infection. This bacterium can also colonize the gut asymptomatically, potentially leading to a “silent” onward transmission. Symptomatic infection, also called CDI, is characterized by diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain and an increase in the white blood cell count. The major risk factor for CDI is antibiotic administration, which triggers diarrheal diseases, termed antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Although nearly all antimicrobial classes have been associated with CDI, clindamycin, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and penicillins are most commonly implicated.

The gut microbiome plays a central role in CDI. The human body is colonized by a large number of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses, together termed the human microbiome, whose composition is influenced by several factors, such as diet and host genetics. Opportunistic pathogens are primarily blunted by activation of the immune system. This colonization resistance is altered by antibiotics; bacterial composition, richness, and diversity change (dysbiosis) several days after antibiotic administration, generating a convenient niche for spore germination, proliferation, and toxin production. Indeed, data from human studies have shown that the presence of C. difficile, either as a colonizer or as a pathogen, is associated with reduced microbiota diversity. The various antibiotics families may have differential effects on the gut microbiota, thus varying in their impact on predisposition for CDI. The current study examined the changes in the gut microbiota occurring following antibiotic treatment of patients with CDI.

### Antimicrobial-associated risk factors for Clostridium difficile infection [^194422b5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), presumably through disruption of indigenous intestinal microflora, thereby allowing C. difficile to grow and produce toxin. Investigations involving animal models and studies performed in vitro suggest that inhibitory activity against C. difficile and differences in the propensity to stimulate toxin production may also influence the likelihood that particular drugs may cause CDI. Although nearly all antimicrobial classes have been associated with CDI, clindamycin, third-generation cephalosporins, and penicillins have traditionally been considered to harbor the greatest risk. Recent studies have also implicated fluoroquinolones as high-risk agents, a finding that is most likely to be related in part to increasing fluoroquinolone resistance among epidemic strains (i.e., restriction-endonuclease analysis group BI/North American PFGE type 1 strains) and some nonepidemic strains of C. difficile. Restrictions in the use of clindamycin and third-generation cephalosporins have been associated with reductions in CDI. Because use of any antimicrobial has the potential to induce the onset of CDI and disease caused by other health care-associated pathogens, antimicrobial stewardship programs that promote judicious use of antimicrobials are encouraged in concert with environmental and infection control-related efforts.

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^d69c5457]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of health care-associated infections. Understanding the association among C difficile carriage, antibiotic use, and infection hazard is essential for infection prevention.

Objective

To evaluate the hazard of C difficile infection (CDI) among asymptomatic carriers vs noncarriers of C difficile and whether it is associated with antibiotic exposure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study conducted between June 18, 2017, and June 21, 2023, analyzed hospitalizations from Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, Israel, which routinely screens for C difficile in high-risk patients admitted to internal medicine. Adult patients (aged >18 years) without active CDI at admission were included.

Exposure

Antibiotic exposure during hospitalization, including specific classes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the development of CDI, as confirmed by laboratory testing for C difficile. Antibiotic exposure was assessed as a time-varying variable.

Results

The study included 33 756 hospitalizations among 23 001 patients (median [IQR] age, 78 [68-87] years; 52.8% men). C difficile infection occurred in 67 of 1624 hospitalizations (4.1%) with positive screening results and in 47 of 32 132 hospitalizations (0.1%) with negative screening results. A positive C difficile screening result at admission was associated with a high hazard of infection (hazard ratio [HR], 27.5; 95% CI, 18.7-40.3). Antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased hazard for CDI (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.24-3.16). Piperacillin and tazobactam showed the most pronounced hazard for CDI (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.41-3.36). Among asymptomatic carriers, antibiotic exposure was not significantly associated with a further increase in CDI hazard (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.73-1.58).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, carriers of C difficile had a substantially higher baseline hazard for hospital-onset CDI. Antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased hazard among noncarriers but was not significantly associated with additional hazard among carriers. These findings suggest that while antibiotic stewardship may reduce CDI risk in noncarriers, additional strategies may be needed for carriers given their elevated baseline risk.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) antimicrobial stewardship—evidence overview: fifteen quasi-experimental studies published between 1994 and 2013 were identified, with most considered moderate (n = 13) or low (n = 2) quality and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Predominant strategies were formulary restriction (n = 11) or prospective audit and feedback (n = 4), targeting fluoroquinolones (n = 7 studies), cephalosporins (n = 10), clindamycin (n = 5), amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 3), and others (n = 1 each), and many studies targeted more than one antibiotic (n = 6). Interventions decreased targeted antibiotic use by 50% to >90% with a global decrease for all antibiotics in 5/9 studies, and CDI incidence rates decreased 33% to >90% with post-intervention rates of 0.3–1.2 cases per 10 000 patient days. In patient-level analyses, use of multiple antibiotics (mean number of classes 1.8 vs 1.4 antibiotics) tended not to be an important risk factor in a prospective study (relative risk, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.23–1.81), while cumulative exposure showed adjusted hazard ratios 2.5 (95% CI, 1.6–4.0), 3.3 (95% CI, 2.2–5.2), and 9.6 (95% CI, 6.1–15.1) for 2, 3, or 4 or ≥5 antibiotics compared to 1.

Objectives

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) poses healthcare challenges and morbidity. Preventing recurrence with prophylactic oral CDI antibiotics lack consensus.

Methods

We used data from the largest healthcare provider in Israel to identify all adults aged 18 years or older diagnosed with a first episode of CDI (Index CDI) between February 2018 and December 2022 and subsequently received a non-CDI antibiotic within 2-8 weeks. Patients who received a concurrent prophylactic CDI antibiotic constituted the CDI prophylaxis group. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association of secondary CDI prophylaxis with CDI recurrence according to the severity of the index CDI (primary objective) and with 4- and 8-week all-cause mortality (secondary objective).

Results

A total of 434 eligible patients were included. Among them, 327 did not receive CDI antibiotic prophylaxis, while 107 did. CDI antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a significant risk reduction of CDI recurrence with an adjusted HR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.27-0.97). The magnitude of the association was modified by the severity of the index CDI episode (P for interaction 0.0182). Specifically, the HR for recurrence was 0.163 (95% CI 0.045-0.593) for non-severe CDI, and 1.242 (95% CI 0.524-2.946) for severe CDI. No significant association was found between CDI antibiotic prophylaxis and 4-8 weeks mortality.

Conclusion

Secondary prophylaxis with CDI antibiotics appears to be associated with a reduced risk of recurrence in patients with previous non-severe CDI episode. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with emphasis on preventing recurrent infection. This review compares current guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

Trial enrichment using gut microbiota derived biomarkers by high-risk individuals can improve the feasibility of randomized controlled trials for prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Here, we report in a prospective observational cohort study the incidence of CDI and assess potential clinical characteristics and biomarkers to predict CDI in 1,007 patients ≥ 50 years receiving newly initiated antibiotic treatment with penicillins plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor, 3 rd /4 th generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones or clindamycin from 34 European hospitals. The estimated 90-day cumulative incidences of a first CDI episode is 1.9% (95% CI 1.1-3.0). Carbapenem treatment (Hazard Ratio (95% CI): 5.3 (1.7-16.6)), toxigenic C. difficile rectal carriage (10.3 (3.2-33.1)), high intestinal abundance of Enterococcus spp. relative to Ruminococcus spp. (5.4 (2.1-18.7)), and low Shannon alpha diversity index as determined by 16S rRNA gene profiling (9.7 (3.2-29.7)), but not normalized urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels, predicts an increased CDI risk.

### Microbiota-based markers predictive of development of Clostridioides difficile infection [^5e243cbd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is the most common cause of infectious antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and is the pathogen responsible for the largest number of healthcare-associated infections world-wide –. C. difficile infection (CDI) is characterized by watery stool accompanied by toxin-mediated inflammation of the bowel where primary risk factors include hospitalization, age, colonization by toxigenic C. difficile, and most importantly, antibiotic exposure where use of fluoroquinolones (FQNs), clindamycin, carbapenems, cephalosporins, and penicillins combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors (PBLs) are associated with increased CDI risk –. However, markers predictive of CDI or AAD development are as yet lacking. Such markers could be utilized to stratify patients into different risk categories and to enrich patient populations for clinical trials assessing preventive measures against or therapeutics for CDI.

Patients suffering from CDI, as well as from other forms of AAD harbor a disrupted intestinal microbiota characterized by reduced diversity and elevated levels of Enterococcus alongside reduced levels of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, and Prevotella spp. during disease manifestation –. 16S rRNA gene profiling provides a useful method for studying changes in microbial composition. More importantly, it might allow identification of microbial markers predictive of the risk of CDI development. Although the microbial composition at CDI onset has been well-studied, the pre-CDI microbiota remains largely unexplored. To our knowledge, only one prospective study has investigated microbial composition as a potential predictor of CDI,. This single-center Canadian study, part of a larger clinical study assessing CDI risk factors, demonstrated that the absence or reduction in Clostridiales, namely members of Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI, in the intestinal microbiota was associated with an increased risk of CDI. Collateral damage on the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment has been further shown to result in reduced alpha diversity, as well as an increase in the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, and long-lasting effects ranging from weeks to years depending on the antibiotic –. Several small studies in healthy adults have investigated specific short-term changes induced by antibiotics, often in combination with multiple compounds –. None of these, however, link antibiotic-induced dysbiosis to development of CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: the role of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship [^b9d6869d]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

There are 2 primary approaches to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in children: prevent transmission and acquisition of the organism and prevent the progression from colonization to disease. The most important interventions to reduce the risk of transmission include contact precautions, hand hygiene, and environmental disinfection. Glove use minimizes contamination of the hands by spores and is associated with reductions in CDI incidence. Hand hygiene with soap and water and disinfection with a sporicidal agent are recommended as the best approaches in hyperendemic settings. Because antibiotic exposure is the most important modifiable risk factor for CDI, antimicrobial stewardship focused on identified high-risk antibiotic classes (including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) is critical to preventing progression from colonization to infection. Despite clear evidence that antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are associated with reduced CDI rates in adults, data demonstrating the ASP impact on pediatric CDI are lacking.

### Epidemiology of community-acquired and recurrentinfection [^58a9f1f7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections with significant morbidity and mortality. For the past decade, the bulk of infection prevention and epidemiologic surveillance efforts have been directed toward mitigating hospital-acquired C. difficile . However, the incidence of community-associated infection is on the rise. Patients with community-associated C. difficile tend to be younger and have lower mortality rate. Rates of recurrent C. difficile infection overall have decreased in the United States, but future research and public health endeavors are needed to standardize and improve disease detection, stratify risk factors in large-scale population studies, and to identify regional and local variations in strain types, reservoirs and transmission routes to help characterize and combat the changing epidemiology of C. difficile .

### Infection prevention approaches for Clostridioides difficile [^9563e88e]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile prevention is challenging as spores are highly resilient and transmission sources diverse. Hand hygiene, contact precautions, and environmental decontamination are fundamental infection prevention strategies. Antimicrobial stewardship is highly effective at reducing C difficile risk at both the individual and institutional level. Supplemental control measures such as no-touch disinfection technologies and screening/isolation of carriers are generally reserved for situations in which fundamental control measures prove insufficient. Reducing host vulnerability through immunization, prophylactic antibiotics directed against C difficile, or products that protect/augment the microbiome may offer promise in the future.

### Association of household exposure to primary Clostridioides difficile infection with secondary infection in family members [^a0ad4bfe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

For each enrollment month, we assigned individuals to 1 of 4 outcome groups based on CDI status and family exposure to CDI. Enrollees were defined to have family exposure to CDI if another family member had any CDI diagnosis during the prior 60 days (regardless of where the prior family member’s index diagnosis occurred). For patients without CDI, we identified family exposure within 60 days prior to the start of the month. For patients with CDI, we considered exposure in the 60-day period prior to the index CDI diagnosis. Thus, in each enrollment month, enrollees were placed into 1 of 4 categories: (1) CDI and prior family exposure, (2) no CDI and prior family exposure, (3) CDI and no family exposure, and (4) no CDI and no family exposure.

Next, we estimated CDI incidence in nonexposed and exposed groups by comparing monthly counts between groups (1) and (2) or between groups (3) and (4), respectively (Figure). Individuals were excluded from analysis (considered not to be at risk) for the 60 days following their index CDI visit and returned to eligibility in the first full month that occurred 60 days following a prior CDI diagnosis.

Figure. 
Study Population by Month of Enrollment

CDI indicates Clostridioides difficile infection.

We used 2 approaches to compare the incidence of CDI in individuals with and without family exposure to CDI. First, we performed a bivariate comparison across multiple confounding factors. Specifically, we compared the incidence rate ratio (IRR) between exposed and nonexposed individuals by age group, sex, prior antibiotic exposure, prior hospitalization, and year. For prior antibiotic exposure, we considered prescriptions filled within 60 days prior to the CDI diagnosis or enrollment month. We created separate categories for high risk of CDI antibiotics (ie, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, or cephalosporins) vs low risk of CDI antibiotics (ie, penicillins, macrolides, sulfonamides, or trimethoprim), as the antibiotics with a high risk of CDI have been shown to pose the greatest risk for community-associated CDI. For prior hospitalization, we identified prior hospitalizations that occurred within 60 days before the CDI diagnosis (or the start of the enrollment month for enrollees without CDI).

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrence—pooled randomized trial subgroup data show that fidaxomicin increased sustained response at 30 days after end of therapy versus vancomycin (RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.05–1.54; low certainty evidence), while no beneficial effect was shown at 90 days (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.9–2.44; very low certainty evidence); initial clinical cure was comparable (RR: 1.03, 95% CI: .94–1.14; low certainty evidence), no reduction in all-cause mortality was demonstrated (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.23–3.08; very low certainty evidence), and evidence for serious adverse events was very uncertain (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.35–1.29; very low certainty evidence). An ad hoc subgroup analysis separating patients with 1 prior CDI recurrence versus 2 or more found a sustained response at 30 days following end of therapy of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.01–1.49) for 1 prior recurrence and 2.0 (95% CI: .88–4.54) for 2 or more prior recurrences, with the latter based on data from 1 study judged at high risk of bias and a very small number randomized (n = 20).

### Strategies to preventinfections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^8be2ae77]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)—antibiotic prophylaxis in very high-risk adults remains uncertain overall; recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses are conflicted about the benefit, but a small, single-center, HCP-blinded randomized controlled trial assessing vancomycin 125 mg by mouth once daily in adults at least 60 years of age who had received antibiotics within 30 days prior to index admission found none (0%) on prophylaxis developed CDI versus 6 (12%) of 50 without prophylaxis (P = .03); a randomized trial of fidaxomicin prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients was associated with reduced risk, and due to limited effectiveness and risk data, antibiotic primary prophylaxis for CDI should only be considered for carefully selected patients at very high risk for CDI and only when CDI incidence is elevated despite implementation of other prevention measures.

### Epidemiology and risk factors for community associated Clostridioides difficile in children [^271ebe8b]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess which risk factors are associated with community-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in children.

Study Design

This case control study was a retrospective review of all children 1-17 years of age with stool specimens sent for C difficile testing from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2016. Cases and controls were children who had C difficile testing performed in the community or first 48 hours of hospital admission and >12 weeks after hospital discharge, with no prior positive C difficile testing in last 8 weeks, without other identified causes of diarrhea, and with clinical symptoms. Cases had positive confirmatory testing for C difficile. Controls had negative testing for C difficile and were matched to cases 1:1 by age and year of specimen collection.

Results

The overall incidence rate of community-acquired CDI in this cohort was 13.7 per 100 000 children per year. There was a substantial increase in community-acquired CDI from 9.6 per 100 000 children per year in 2012 to a peak of 16.9 per 100 000 children per year in 2015 (Cochran-Armitage test for trend P = .002). The risk factors for community-acquired CDI included non-Hispanic ethnicity; amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporin, and clindamycin use within the previous 12 weeks; a previous positive C difficile test within 6 months; and increased health care visits in the last year.

Conclusions

As rates of community-acquired CDI are increasing, enhanced antibiotic stewardship and recognition of health care disparities may ease the burden of community-acquired CDI.

### Incidence and outcomes associated with Clostridium difficile infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9cb7e702]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) is the most common pathogen causing health care–associated infections in the United States, accounting for 15% of all such infections.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on antibiotic resistance threats categorized C difficile as an urgent threat.Antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection (CDI) is often followed by recurrent infection, leading to nontraditional treatments, such as fecal transplant and oral administration of nontoxigenic C difficile spores.

Information about the burden of CDI in the United States could inform investments in prevention and treatment interventions. This information should include the incidence of CDI, how this incidence has changed over time, and poor outcomes associated with CDI. Although prior studies have shown that CDI is associated with poor outcomes, such as recurrence, long hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, and high treatment costs, these results vary by study location and patient population. In addition, many current estimates of the poor outcomes and costs associated with CDI do not take into account the underlying severity of illness among patients who develop CDI and may overestimate the true attributable outcomes.

To address gaps in our understanding of the current burden associated with CDI in the United States, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies conducted in the United States and published after 2000 that evaluated the incidence of CDI and associated LOS. The goals were to describe the recent incidence of CDI and to evaluate LOS attributable to CDI.

### Microbiota-based markers predictive of development of Clostridioides difficile infection [^d6732441]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Antibiotic-induced modulation of the intestinal microbiota can lead to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare-costs globally. Therefore, identification of markers predictive of CDI could substantially contribute to guiding therapy and decreasing the infection burden. Here, we analyze the intestinal microbiota of hospitalized patients at increased CDI risk in a prospective, 90-day cohort-study before and after antibiotic treatment and at diarrhea onset. We show that patients developing CDI already exhibit significantly lower diversity before antibiotic treatment and a distinct microbiota enriched in Enterococcus and depleted of Ruminococcus, Blautia, Prevotella and Bifidobacterium compared to non-CDI patients. We find that antibiotic treatment-induced dysbiosis is class-specific with beta-lactams further increasing enterococcal abundance. Our findings, validated in an independent prospective patient cohort developing CDI, can be exploited to enrich for high-risk patients in prospective clinical trials, and to develop predictive microbiota-based diagnostics for management of patients at risk for CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection evaluation and management in the emergency department [^397c6981]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), characterized primarily by diffuse diarrhea in the setting of recent healthcare and antibiotic exposure, maintains significantly high rates of diagnosis in the U.S., even in the emergency department (ED). Recent updates in the literature concerning CDI should be considered for effective clinical practice in the ED setting.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of current data for the ED-based evaluation and management of CDI.

Discussion

Substantial literature on the risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and treatment regimens have recently published concerning CDI. These studies include evaluation of risks associated with specific antibiotic classes, demonstrating that even single doses of antibiotics pose significant risk of CDI. Disproportional increases in elderly CDI rates show particular vulnerability in this population. Updated literature reveals presenting symptoms with wide ranges in rates of diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and nausea with vomiting. In some patients diarrhea may be altogether absent, clouding clinical suspicion. Classification primarily centers on a non-severe/severe division from the IDSA. Treatment has largely shifted away from metronidazole as a first-line antibiotic, instead focusing on oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, even for an initial episode of CDI in an uncomplicated patient. Attention to hand hygiene and adherence to contact precautions are key to infection prevention.

Conclusions

CDI cause significant illness throughout the U.S. Successful CDI diagnosis and management in the ED require current knowledge of risk, presentation, diagnosis, and proper antibiotic treatment.
