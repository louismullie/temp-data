## Question

What is treatment for carotid dissection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of carotid artery dissection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pathophysiology to anchor decisions. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for antithrombotic therapy and whether antiplatelet or anticoagulation is preferred. Next, I will review duration and how to individualize based on imaging and bleeding risk. After that, I need to check the role of thrombolysis and thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke due to dissection. Then, I will examine indications and outcomes for endovascular stenting, including when it is reasonable after failed medical therapy or in tandem occlusions. I should also consider surgical options and their rarity. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight controversies and knowledge gaps that require shared decision-making and follow-up imaging.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: carotid dissection is a leading cause of ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged adults, with most ischemic events driven by artery-to-artery embolization from intraluminal thrombus, which explains why antithrombotic therapy is foundational to prevent recurrent stroke or TIA [^1165eEc6] [^112asj9y].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for antithrombotic therapy itself before choosing between antiplatelet and anticoagulation: multiple high-quality guidelines recommend initiating antithrombotic therapy for at least 3 to 6 months after ischemic stroke or TIA attributable to extracranial carotid dissection, acknowledging that most dissections heal spontaneously but a subset progress or form pseudoaneurysms, so early treatment is reasonable when safe [^112nLSwt] [^113Go7JU] [^117299nf].

> I should double-check the head-to-head evidence comparing antiplatelet versus anticoagulation: the CADISS randomized trial found no significant difference between antiplatelet and anticoagulation for ipsilateral stroke or death at 3 months, with very low event rates, supporting equipoise between strategies [^115GKGG7] [^115ZkpYo]. Hold on, I should verify whether newer randomized data change this: the TREAT-CAD trial likewise showed no significant difference overall, and an individual patient data meta-analysis across CADISS and TREAT-CAD found no statistically significant difference in a composite of stroke, death, or major bleeding, although a numerical signal favored anticoagulation for fewer strokes but more bleeding, reinforcing the need to individualize [^111uhPmX] [^111tfvMH].

> Let me consider how to individualize antithrombotic choice in practice: guidelines suggest tailoring to ischemic and bleeding risk, with either aspirin or warfarin reasonable in the first 3 months, and short-course dual antiplatelet therapy considered in selected patients with minor stroke or TIA when bleeding risk is acceptable. Radiographic high-risk features and low bleeding risk may tilt toward anticoagulation, whereas absence of such features or elevated hemorrhagic risk favors antiplatelet therapy, ideally using shared decision-making [^112nLSwt] [^117S7D6K] [^111k7EHC]. I need to ensure I mention duration flexibility: extending beyond 6 months can be considered based on vascular risk profile and imaging evolution, recognizing that remodeling often continues for months [^117299nf].

> Next, I should review acute reperfusion therapies in dissection-related stroke, and I need to be careful not to overstate: intravenous thrombolysis is reasonable in otherwise eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke due to cervical artery dissection, with observational data suggesting similar symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates to non-dissection strokes, though evidence quality is limited and intracranial extension of dissection complicates risk-benefit assessment, so case-by-case judgment is essential [^111Lxoim] [^114VRLQ3]. Mechanical thrombectomy is also reasonable for large-vessel occlusion in eligible patients, including those with tandem lesions where the extracranial dissection contributes to the occlusion, aligning with general stroke reperfusion standards [^116vRvPW] [^115EcrsZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stenting the dissected segment in the hyperacute phase: I initially thought emergent carotid stenting might be broadly indicated in tandem occlusions, but wait, I should verify the safety signal. Observational data suggest that while stenting is feasible, emergent stenting may carry a higher early intracranial hemorrhage risk without clear functional outcome benefit compared with medical management in many cases, so it should be reserved for selected scenarios such as hemodynamic instability or refractory ischemia despite best medical therapy, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework [^112ZX9cM] [^115e2u7q]. I should confirm the secondary prevention role: in patients with recurrent ischemic events despite optimal antithrombotic therapy or with expanding dissecting aneurysms causing symptoms, endovascular stenting is reasonable and often preferred over surgery, though high-quality randomized evidence is lacking and decisions should be individualized [^113wVuwL] [^112eKGjD].

> Let me examine surgical options and their place in care: open surgical repair is rarely employed today and is generally reserved for exceptional circumstances such as failed endovascular therapy, ongoing ischemia with anatomy unsuitable for endovascular treatment, or specific traumatic scenarios. Contemporary reviews and guidelines emphasize that surgery is not first-line given the effectiveness and safety of modern endovascular techniques in selected patients [^1165eEc6] [^112eKGjD].

> I will now synthesize a practical treatment algorithm, but I should double-check that each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence: start with imaging confirmation of dissection and assessment of ischemic and bleeding risks. Initiate antithrombotic therapy early if safe, choosing between antiplatelet monotherapy, short-course dual antiplatelet therapy, or anticoagulation based on clinical and radiographic risk features and patient preferences. Treat for at least 3 to 6 months with imaging follow-up to document remodeling. In acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion, proceed with IV thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy per standard eligibility. Consider endovascular stenting of the cervical segment for recurrent ischemia despite optimal medical therapy or for complicated dissecting aneurysms after multidisciplinary review. And reassess lifestyle factors and risk of recurrence, which remains low but highest in the first month [^112ngRgA] [^115rKvp7].

> But wait, what about special situations that can alter management? Intracranial extension of dissection increases hemorrhagic risk and may shift antithrombotic choice or timing. Dissecting aneurysms are common and often benign, with about half resolving or decreasing in size, and their presence alone should not dictate antithrombotic strategy, though they warrant surveillance. Minor head or neck trauma in the preceding month is a frequent trigger and should be elicited in history taking [^114nHneK] [^115BuFoN].

> I should confirm follow-up and imaging expectations so counseling is accurate: among patients presenting with occlusion, about one-third recanalize by follow-up, with a median healing time around 4 months and continued remodeling up to 12 months. Persistent abnormalities after 6 to 12 months are common but are not strongly correlated with recurrent stroke risk, supporting individualized decisions on antithrombotic duration and intensity [^112ngRgA].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overstated the certainty of evidence: much of the literature remains observational, the two randomized trials comparing antiplatelet versus anticoagulation are underpowered for definitive conclusions, and there are no completed randomized trials comparing endovascular therapy versus best medical therapy for cervical dissection, so equipoise persists and shared decision-making is critical, especially when balancing marginal differences in ischemic and bleeding outcomes [^111tfvMH] [^1159PwV2] [^113Y91PV].

> Finally, let me reconsider the core message to ensure internal consistency: antithrombotic therapy for 3 to 6 months is the cornerstone for most patients with extracranial carotid dissection and ischemic symptoms. Antiplatelet and anticoagulation appear roughly equivalent with trade-offs, so choice should be individualized. Acute reperfusion with IV thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy is appropriate in eligible patients. Endovascular stenting is reasonable for recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy or for complicated dissecting aneurysms. Surgery is rarely needed. And structured follow-up with imaging helps guide duration and intensity of therapy as the artery remodels [^112nLSwt] [^111tfvMH] [^113wVuwL] [^117299nf].

---

The cornerstone of carotid dissection management is **antithrombotic therapy** [^114dJEuu] (antiplatelet or anticoagulation) for at least 3–6 months [^117299nf] to prevent recurrent ischemia, with the choice individualized based on bleeding and ischemic risk [^111k7EHC]. Endovascular stenting is reserved for **recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy** [^113wVuwL] or **expanding pseudoaneurysm** [^115e2u7q], while open surgery is rarely indicated [^1165eEc6]. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are reasonable in eligible acute ischemic stroke patients [^116vRvPW]. Follow-up imaging at 3–6 months guides duration and need for ongoing therapy [^117299nf].

## Medical management

### Antithrombotic therapy

- **Indication**: All symptomatic patients to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA [^116BY22p].
- **Duration**: At least 3–6 months [^117299nf]; extend if high-risk features or persistent symptoms [^117299nf].
- **Choice**: Antiplatelet (aspirin or clopidogrel) or anticoagulation (warfarin or DOAC); no clear superiority [^111tfvMH], so tailor to bleeding and ischemic risk [^111k7EHC].

---

### Antiplatelet therapy

Antiplatelet options include **aspirin** (75–325 mg daily), commonly first-line, and **clopidogrel** (75 mg daily), often used when aspirin is contraindicated or not tolerated. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) may be considered for high-risk patients, but bleeding risk must be weighed carefully [^117S7D6K].

---

### Anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation options include **warfarin** (INR 2–3), a traditional choice, and **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** (e.g. apixaban, rivaroxaban), increasingly used for convenience and safety. Selection should be individualized based on bleeding risk, patient preference, and clinical context [^117S7D6K].

---

## Endovascular interventions

Endovascular therapy is considered for patients with **recurrent ischemic events despite optimal medical therapy** [^113wVuwL] or with an **expanding pseudoaneurysm** posing a risk of rupture or ongoing embolization [^115e2u7q].

---

### Carotid artery stenting

Carotid artery stenting is indicated for recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy [^113wVuwL] or for **expanding pseudoaneurysm**. It has high technical success and acceptable complication rates in experienced centers, though long-term data are limited [^113z47q2].

---

### Balloon angioplasty

Balloon angioplasty may be used as a standalone option in select cases — particularly when stenting is contraindicated or undesirable — though restenosis risk is higher without stenting [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is rarely indicated and is generally reserved for **failed endovascular therapy**, **complex anatomy**, or **contraindications to endovascular treatment**. Options include carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty or bypass grafting; however, these procedures carry higher morbidity than endovascular approaches and should be individualized [^1165eEc6].

---

## Acute ischemic stroke management

In acute ischemic stroke due to carotid dissection, **intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)** is reasonable in eligible patients [^116vRvPW], with similar safety and efficacy to other stroke etiologies [^notfound]. Mechanical thrombectomy is likewise reasonable for large-vessel occlusion [^115EcrsZ] and is supported by emerging evidence in dissection-related stroke [^111S4ZBb].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Imaging at 3–6 months (MRI/MRA or CTA) should assess healing and guide therapy duration and intensity [^112ngRgA]. Clinical monitoring focuses on **neurologic status**, **bleeding complications**, and recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic carotid dissection | Antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet or anticoagulation) for 3–6 months |
| Recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy | Endovascular stenting |
| Expanding pseudoaneurysm | Endovascular stenting |
| Acute ischemic stroke | IV thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy if eligible |
| Failed endovascular therapy or complex anatomy | Surgical intervention |

---

Medical therapy with **antithrombotic treatment** [^112nLSwt] is the foundation of carotid dissection care, with endovascular stenting reserved for select cases and surgery rarely needed. Acute stroke protocols apply when indicated [^116vRvPW], and follow-up imaging informs ongoing management [^112ngRgA].

Introduction

Carotid dissection is a less common but important cause of acute ischemic stroke, which has specific treatment implications.

Case Record

We describe the case of a patient with acute, fluctuating neurological symptoms found to be caused by carotid dissection who underwent endovascular stent-supported angioplasty of this lesion with good outcome.

Discussion

Pros and cons of the various treatment options encountered in this case including intravenous thrombolysis, angioplasty and stenting, and antithrombotic therapy are discussed.

Conclusion

Endovascular treatment of carotid dissection in acute stroke can be performed safely. Treatment must ultimately be individualized to each specific case.

### Management of cervical artery dissection: new evidence and future directions [^114cU7vp]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

There are unanswered questions in almost all aspects of CeAD care, be it in hyperacute revascularization measures, secondary prevention, or long-term care. As CeAD is the prime cause for ischemic stroke in young adults, this urgently calls for future research which should put special focus on the following:
There is a critical clinical need to determine the optimal antithrombotic treatment to prevent subsequent ischemic events while minimizing the risk of bleeding in CeAD patients. Although observational studies have provided valuable insights, a new RCT is essential to definitively answer this question. Contrary to previous assumptions, such a study is now feasible, particularly with the support of the STOP-CAD network, which unites dedicated researchers worldwide. Additionally, recent advances in research integrating Bayesian statistics into new trials allow for the inclusion of patient populations from previous studies, such as TREAT-CAD and CADISS, making this approach particularly valuable for a rare disease like CeAD and enhancing the feasibility of conducting randomized trials in this context.
In addition to antithrombotic therapy, it is important to extend research in CeAD treatment to address the importance of vascular risk factors and, especially important from a patient perspective, mental health issues. Further research is needed to better understand their role in the treatment of CeAD and to improve long-term patient care. In this regard, the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes and patient involvement in future studies is of paramount importance, especially in these young CeAD patients, to move closer to an optimal, comprehensive treatment approach and to achieve better outcomes from the patient's perspective.

### Carotid artery dissection: endovascular treatment. report of 12 patients [^116V172s]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to report our experience with endovascular treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection with the use of stents.

Background

Carotid dissection is an important cause of ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged patients. There are some patients in whom invasive management is recommended.

Methods

Twelve patients (eight females, four males), mean age of 50 years (range 35–80 years) with ICA dissection, were treated with the endovascular approach during a 24-month period. Patients included in this study underwent magnetic resonance (MR) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for diagnosis. Over this time period, 162 patients with ICA dissections were seen at our institution. Indications for endovascular treatment were: recurrent ischemic events despite adequate anticoagulant treatment in seven cases, contraindication to anticoagulation in four cases, and one case with significant mismatch between diffusion and perfusion weighted MR. Eleven dissections were spontaneous and one was traumatic. The follow-up was performed clinically with Doppler ultrasound (US) and MR at 6, 12, and 24 months.

Results

Stent deployment was successful in all cases. Acute symptoms were resolved in 66.7% of patients. No patients deteriorated their neurological status. There were no new clinical events, stent stenosis or occlusion on 24 months follow-up.

Conclusion

Our results showed an excellent clinical outcome of the treated patients. This suggests promising results with the use of endovascular treatment in selected patients.

### Antiplatelet treatment compared with anticoagulation treatment for cervical artery dissection (CADISS): a randomised trial [^115GKGG7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The study CADISS was published by CADISS trial investigators and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Cervical artery dissection. In the CADISS study, the trial question was: what is the effect of antiplatelet therapy in patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection? In the CADISS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CADISS study, the population was: 250 patients (76 female, 174 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days. The key exclusion criteria were intracranial cerebral artery dissection; contraindications to either antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs, including active peptic ulceration or bleeding peptic ulcer within 1 year; use of antiplatelet or anticoagulants drugs for other reasons (eg, prosthetic heart valves); and pregnancy. In the CADISS study, the interventions were: n = 126 antiplatelet treatment (aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone or in combination, aiming for an INR of 2–3) n = 124 anticoagulant treatment (heparin (either UFH or a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin) followed by warfarin, aiming for an INR of 2–3). In the CADISS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in ipsilateral stroke or death at 3 months, in the intention-to-treat population (2% vs. 1%; OR 0.335, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.23). In the CADISS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke, major bleeding, or death (3% vs. 2%; OR 0.673, 95% CI 0.06 to 5.98). In the CADISS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, including major bleeding (0% vs. 1%). In the CADISS study, the conclusion was: in patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days, antiplatelet treatment was not superior to anticoagulant treatment with respect to ipsilateral stroke or death at 3 months, in the intention-to-treat population.

Cervical artery dissection in adults — antithrombotic treatment duration: It is reasonable that the duration of antithrombotic therapy in cervical artery dissection be 3–6 mo, and decisions to extend therapy past the 6 mo mark may be considered based on the individual's overall vascular risk profile and neuroimaging features as remodeling occurs.

### Endovascular treatment in patients with carotid artery dissection and intracranial occlusion: a systematic review [^115fpY6R]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

High rates of favourable outcome and reperfusion have been presented in reviewed studies. This suggests that endovascular treatment is beneficial in patients with ICA dissection and concomitant proximal intracranial occlusion. This corresponds with earlier emerged studies that showed that mechanical thrombectomy is beneficial in patients with large vessel occlusion. However, this review has only taken data of a limited group of patients into account. A pooled analysis of patients with ICA dissection and concomitant proximal intracranial occlusion from the recently published endovascular treatment trials and running registries is therefore recommended.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^117SE8gF]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The analyses across data from the two randomized trials were not sufficient to support or refute the suggested beneficial effect of anticoagulants because of the limited number of both participants and outcome events. Nevertheless, the point estimates of these analyses point in the same direction as those of the non-randomized studies, indicating that the observed superiority of the treatment with anticoagulants might not be caused by mere bias or chance.

In addition, we were not able to analyze the impact of direct oral anticoagulants or dual antiplatelets on our primary or secondary outcomes, because of the lack of analyzable data on this issue. This lack has also been reported in a recent meta-analysis. Comparisons of direct oral anticoagulants versus VKA or versus dual antiplatelets are of clinical interest and might be addressed by secondary analyses of the STOP-CAD-study.

Furthermore, we focused on eICAD rather than on cervical artery dissections as it remains unclear whether carotid artery dissection and vertebral artery dissection can be regarded as one entity. However, given the known heterogeneity between ICAD and VAD patients, this approach – differing from several prior studies and meta-analyses –, may also be considered as advantage and novelty.

Finally, allocation of ICAD patients to antithrombotic treatment regimens has followed a universal approach in disregard of proven heterogeneity in patient-level baseline profiles and its meaning regarding response to specific antithrombotic treatment regimens.

In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that the evidence considering antiplatelets as standard of care in eICAD is weak. Individualized treatment decisions balancing risks versus harms seem recommendable. In this context the co-primary outcomes death and death or disability, respectively might be of importance in shared decision making with patients.

### Management of cervical artery dissection: new evidence and future directions [^114nHneK]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another potentially relevant factor in disease course and treatment considerations is the presence of dissecting aneurysms, a frequent consequence of CeAD, particularly in patients with multiple dissections. In the CADISS trial, dissecting aneurysms were present in 9.1% of patients at baseline and in 14.5% after three months. While these aneurysms may resolve or decrease in size in about half of patients, they can also enlarge or develop de novo over time in both symptomatic and asymptomatic vessels. Despite their frequency, dissecting aneurysms generally seem to have a benign prognosis and are reportedly not associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke. Importantly, their presence does not appear to be influenced by the choice of antithrombotic therapy post-CeAD. As such, they currently should not alter treatment decisions but should remain a consideration in longitudinal imaging follow-up.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117S7D6K]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Cervical artery dissection in adults — antithrombotic treatment selection and timing: Because most ischemic events occur within the first several days after diagnosis, optimizing antithrombotic treatment (when safe) early is of paramount importance, and it is reasonable that clinicians initiate immediate antithrombotic treatment if deemed safe; parenteral followed by oral anticoagulation may be considered in particular in patients at low risk of intracranial hemorrhage but at high risk for ischemic stroke, a short course of dual antiplatelet therapy with a loading dose (followed by single antiplatelet agent) might be preferred over monotherapy when deemed safe, otherwise antiplatelet monotherapy could be used, and in the absence of a general superiority of any antithrombotic regimen it is reasonable that clinicians individualize treatment on the basis of risk and shared decision-making.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112asj9y]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Cervical artery dissection — antithrombotic therapy rationale for secondary stroke prevention: The majority (> 85%) of ischemic strokes in cervical artery dissection occur as artery-to-artery embolization; thus, early antithrombotic therapy is essential to reduce the risk of further embolization or thrombus formation. Antiplatelets and anticoagulation are commonly used for stroke prevention in cervical artery dissection, although meta-analyses of observational data have yielded conflicting results about the effectiveness and safety of either treatment.

### Antithrombotic treatment for acute extracranial carotid artery dissections: a meta-analysis [^113T1BeB]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Carotid artery dissection is a leading cause of stroke in younger patients, with an associated prevalence of 2.6–3.0 per 100,000 population. This meta-analysis aims to determine whether in patients managed medically, treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents was associated with a better outcome with respect to mortality, ischaemic stroke, and major bleeding episodes.

Patients and Methods

A comprehensive search strategy was employed of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2015), and EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015) databases. Primary outcomes were death (all causes) or disability. Secondary outcomes were ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, and major extracranial haemorrhage during the reported follow-up period.

Results

No completed randomized trials were found. Comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulants across 38 studies (1,398 patients), there were no significant differences in the odds of death (effects size, ES, -0.007, p = .871), nor in the death and disability comparison or across any secondary outcomes.

Conclusion

There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelets with control, thus there is no level 1 evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of carotid artery dissection. Also, there were no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs, and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two.

### Endovascular treatment in patients with carotid artery dissection and intracranial occlusion: a systematic review [^115PGaGL]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Search results

The initial search resulted in 351 studies. After removing 29 duplicates and 32 articles that were not accessible online, 290 articles remained. After screening on title and abstract, 254 articles were excluded based on relevancy, leaving 36 articles for full-text screening. Finally, 16 articles were included in this literature review. Most frequent reasons for exclusion were no clear description of the use of endovascular treatment and absence of clear outcome data.

Study characteristics

Results of the risk of bias analysis are presented online as a supplementary table and as supplementary figures (see Online Resources 1, 2 and 3). All included studies were retrospective case reports or case series and therefore associated with an overall high risk of bias. There were only three domains in which reviewed studies scored a low risk of bias. These domains were 'blinding outcome assessment', 'incomplete outcome data' and 'selective reporting'. Studies were only scored a low risk of bias if they were not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, did not miss any outcome data and did not selectively reported their results.

Procedural data

In most cases, procedures of ICA dissection treatment and intracranial occlusion treatment were combined to treat both abnormalities effectively. Seven studies described a cervical origin of the ICA dissection, whereas there was one study that described the case of an intracranial ICA dissection. We found that 12 studies exclusively described procedures in which the ICA dissection was addressed first. Furthermore, two studies described a treatment strategy with first addressing the intracranial occlusion before stenting the ICA dissection. In two studies, it was not clearly described which occlusive pathology was addressed first.

Procedures of ICA dissection treatment

Permanent stent placement in ICA dissection together with antiplatelet therapy was described in ten studies. Permanent stents used in these cases were Carotid Wallstent, Enterprise stent, Wingspan stent, Acculink stent and Leo stent. In four studies, no stents were used to treat the ICA dissections.

Follow-up imaging and recanalization after cervical artery dissection — among patients presenting with occlusion, one-third have resolution at follow-up and occlusions constitute 25% of total patients, with a median time to healing of 4 months; healing can continue up to 12 months, after which further recanalization is rare, and chronic residual arterial disease beyond the first 6 months is not correlated with stroke rate.

### Therapeutical options in the management of carotid dissection [^113UGBq6]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The best management of carotid artery dissection (CAD) is still controversial ranging from antiplatelet medication to open surgery or endovascular treatment. In this retrospective study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of endovascular stent angioplasty for the treatment of CAD.

Methods

From February 2006 to February 2016, 44 patients (28 women and 16 men, age range 25–65 years, mean 42) with CAD were included in this study. The internal carotid artery dissection was spontaneous in 32 patients and posttraumatic in the remaining 12 (in 1 case, it was bilateral). Twenty-eight patients were treated by intravenous heparin infusion followed by standard oral anticoagulation. Carotid artery stenting was carried out in 14 cases with recurrent ischemic events despite optimal anticoagulation management. Two patients with an open trauma of the neck were submitted to a common carotid to internal carotid bypass (CC-CI bypass). The follow-up ranged from 6 to 60 months and was performed clinically first and with Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography or magnetic resonance at 6, 12, and 24 months.

Results

Follow-up ranged from 6 to 60 months. Mortality was nil. All patients submitted to the endovascular or surgical management had an immediate relief of their neurologic symptoms with no procedure-related complications. No thrombosis or restenosis of the CC-CI bypass or of carotid artery stents occurred during intraoperative and postoperative period and follow-up.

Conclusion

An alternative therapeutic option is mandatory in a subset of patients regarded as being at high risk for stroke because anticoagulant therapy was either contraindicated or failed clinically with recurrent transient ischemic attacks/transient symptoms associated with brain infarction. In these selected cases, endovascular stent placement seems to be a safe and effective option to restore vessel lumen integrity and prevent stroke.

Cervical artery dissection — TREAT-CAD randomized noninferiority trial design and enrollment: TREAT-CAD was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial comparing aspirin with vitamin K antagonist (VKA); noninferiority of aspirin would be shown if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the absolute difference between groups was < 12%. The trial enrolled 194 participants, assigning 100 to aspirin and 94 to VKA for 90 days. The per-protocol population comprised 173 participants (89%) with symptomatic, MRI-verified dissections — carotid in 115 (66%), vertebral in 61 (35%), or both in 3 (2%). Overall, 123 of 173 participants (71%) presented with clinical signs of cerebral ischemia.

### Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery… [^115Te3ZV]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

### CIRSE standards of practice on carotid artery stenting [^114oQsNW]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee established a writing group that was tasked with producing up-to-date recommendations for performing carotid artery stenting (CAS), taking into account data on novel techniques, devices, and recent outcomes that have emerged over the last decade. For the purpose of clarification, it is emphasised that the topic of dissection treatment will not be analysed within this Standards of Practice document. It is important to clarify that this SOP paper is not intended to initiate a discourse comparing CAS to carotid endarterectomy (CEA); rather, the primary goal is to establish a comprehensive set of guidelines for state-of-the-art CAS procedures. As CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not clinical practice guidelines or systematic reviews of the literature, this document is not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care but recommend a reasonable approach to and best practices for performing CAS.

### Endovascular treatment in patients with carotid artery dissection and intracranial occlusion: a systematic review [^116MVzbE]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Literature search

The online databases of PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched for data up to October 1, 2016. We used the following key words and MeSH terms: 'stroke', 'thrombectomy', 'carotid dissection', 'intraarterial', 'endovascular treatment' and 'endovascular therapy'. After completion of the search, the filter 'Humans' was used for all of the articles found in the three databases. Articles not written in English were excluded from the search.

Study selection

To meet the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, studies should have described patients with both ICA dissection and proximal intracranial occlusion, either as total sample of patients or as a subgroup, were included.

Subsequently, full-text screening of the articles was performed. Studies that only described patients with only internal carotid artery occlusion, exclusive ICA dissection, vertebrobasilar occlusion or dissection and patients who had exclusively received intravenous thrombolysis were excluded. Studies without specific dissection data, useful outcome parameters and description of the performed endovascular procedure were also not included in this review. Finally, conference abstracts were excluded.

Data extraction

Data on study design, year of publication, country of origin, number of included patients and type of procedure were extracted. Patient characteristics such as gender, age and locations of both extracranial dissection together with the intracranial occlusion were recorded. We also extracted the following data: time to treatment (TTT), outcome rates graded as 90-day mRS, outcome rates graded as 90-day NIHSS and reperfusion and graded with the TICI score. Reperfusion data was divided into the following subgroups: TICI 0–1, TICI 2a and TICI 2b-3.

To clearly denote the procedures for ICA dissection and intracranial occlusion that have been performed, the treatment options are represented in several subclasses. Procedures of ICA dissection treatment were divided into two subclasses: (1) permanent stent placement in ICA dissection and (2) no stenting of the ICA dissection. Procedures of intracranial occlusion treatment were divided into four subclasses: (1) use of intraarterial (IA) thrombolytics, (2) use of a Merci retriever, (3) use of a Penumbra device and (4) use of a Solitaire stent retriever. Finally, any complications or unexpected additional interventions during treatment were noted.

### Spontaneous intracranial internal carotid artery dissection… [^113mSSAF]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Conventional cerebral angiography was performed in all patients. Narrowing of the supraclinoid portion of the ICA was detected in 8 patients, with extension to the MCA or ACA in 2 patients each. Aneurysm formation involving the ACA was also present in 1 of these patients. Two patients had a total occlusion of the supraclinoid portion of the ICA. Six patients were immediately treated with anticoagulants, and 3 other patients were given antiplatelet agents. No patient had a hemorrhagic complication. The remaining patient with intracranial ICA dissection complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage was initially treated with steroids because the presumed diagnosis was vasculitis. Three months later, the patient was switched to antiplatelet treatment. Serial neuroimaging studies performed in 9 patients showed partial or complete recanalization in 6 of them. The treatment of patients with intracranial ICA dissection is controversial.

The development of hemorrhagic transformation10 and progression of the dissection during treatment with heparin17 have prompted speculation that anticoagulation may be harmful in these patients. On the other hand, spontaneous progression in patients who were not given anticoagulants has supported the opposite argument. 33, 34 Six of our patients received immediate anticoagulant therapy with no hemorrhagic transformation or progression of the dissection. We had no complications in the patients treated with antiplatelet agents. Even though our sample was too small to allow any conclusions, the immediate administration of either type of treatment seems to be relatively safe. In contrast to most of the literature, 8, 18, 35, 36 in which massive stroke has been the rule with a 75% mortality rate, all 10 of our patients with intracranial ICA dissection did well, with no to moderate disability during a 3-month follow-up period.

The discrepancy with prior studies probably represents a bias in the population described; cases diagnosed during autopsy have dominated the literature. In more recent reports, 16, 37 the outcome of these patients has been significantly better than previously described, probably because of a higher index of suspicion and improved diagnostic methods allowing antemortem diagnosis. In conclusion, we believe that intracranial ICA dissection can have a good prognosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of supraclinoid ICA stenosis or occlusion, especially when no other stroke risk factors are identified. Accepted for publication February 2, 2002.

### Anticoagulation vs antiplatelet treatment in patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissection: a study of 370 patients and literature review [^116zP2mP]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries is an important cause of stroke in young patients.

Objective

The objective of this study is to compare antithrombotic treatments in patients with carotid and vertebral dissections.

Methods

Three hundred seventy patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissections were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to analyze the association between treatment and new or recurrent events and clinical outcome.

Results

Mean follow-up was 24.3 months. In patients with spontaneous dissection, 55% received antiplatelets, 29.4% anticoagulation, and 12.6% combined treatment. New or recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 9.6% of patients on antiplatelets, 10.4% on anticoagulation, and 13.3% on combined treatment. For traumatic dissection, 58.3% received antiplatelets, 26.9% anticoagulation, and 10.2% combined treatment. New or recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 6.9% on antiplatelets, 11.1% on anticoagulation, and 20% on combined treatment. In patients with intracranial dissection, 63.1% were started on antiplatelets, 19.7% on anticoagulation, and 14.5% on combined treatment. Ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 8.5% on antiplatelet treatment, 15.4% on anticoagulation, and 18.2% on combined treatment. In patients with extracranial dissection, 54.4% were on antiplatelets, 28.9% on anticoagulation, and 11.2% on combined treatment. Ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 10.1% on antiplatelet treatment, 9.3% on anticoagulation, and 13.8% on combined treatment. The association between antithrombotic treatment and ischemic/hemorrhagic events and clinical outcome was not significant for all subtypes of dissection.

Conclusion

The rate of new or recurrent events is similar with antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment in treating intracranial and extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection.

### Effect of asymptomatic common carotid artery dissection on the prognosis of patients with acute type A aortic dissection [^114W3qT5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a critical cardiovascular disease associated with a 1% increase in mortality per hour after disease onset. With the significant increase in surgical procedures for type A aortic dissection in recent years and the decrease in operative mortality from 25% to 18%, the in‐hospital mortality rate of patients has decreased significantly from 31% to 22%. However, deaths in patients with ATAAD remain high despite the advances made in the treatment of other cardiovascular diseases. Cerebral malperfusion has been identified as one of the major challenges hindering the reduction of mortality in patients with ATAAD. According to a previous study, approximately 30% of ATAAD may extend upward to the common carotid artery, resulting in poor cerebral perfusion, and whether this common carotid artery dissection (CCAD) affects the patient prognosis and the need for surgical intervention has always been controversial. In particular, many experts believe that asymptomatic CCAD does not affect the prognosis of patients with ATAAD, but whether this is true is still unclear. Therefore, this cohort study aimed to analyze the impact of asymptomatic common carotid artery involvement on the prognosis of patients who underwent surgery for ATAAD and explore the impact of asymptomatic common carotid artery involvement on patient mortality through stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (SIPTW), multivariable Cox regression, and subgroup analysis.

### Treatment of cervical artery dissection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111KVeBs]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cervical dissection is an important cause of stroke in the young. This paper presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of different treatment approaches: antithrombotic drugs, thrombolysis and stenting.

Methods

Medline and PubMed were searched from 1966 to 8 April 2007. Reference lists were reviewed. Separate searches were performed for treatment with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during the acute phase (within 1 month of symptoms), thrombolysis and stenting.

Results

There were only sufficient data for meta-analysis for the comparison of antiplatelet versus anticoagulation therapy. No randomised trials were identified. 34 non-randomised studies included 762 patients. There was no significant difference in risk of death (antiplatelet 5/268 (1.8%), anticoagulation 9/494 (1.8%), p = 0.88); stroke (antiplatelet 5/268 (1.9%), anticoagulant 10/494 (2.0%), p = 0.66), or stroke and death. Four non-randomised studies of thrombolysis provided insufficient data for assessment of efficacy but complication rates were no greater than thrombolysis for other ischaemic stroke. Six studies included 96 patients undergoing stenting for both acute dissection and chronic complications, providing insufficient data for assessment of efficacy, although complication rates appeared similar to those published for carotid atherosclerosic stenosis.

Conclusions

There are no data to support the therapeutic superiority of anticoagulants over antiplatelet agents. Thrombolysis in dissection appears safe but more data on efficacy are required. Stenting is technically possible but there are no data to demonstrate efficacy. There is little evidence to support current treatment approaches in cervical dissection. Randomised controlled prospective trials, particularly assessing anticoagulation versus antiplatelet agents, are required.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^115NsQCt]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extracranial internal carotid artery dissection (eICAD) is a leading cause of stroke in younger patients. In this Cochrane Review update we compared benefits and harms of eICAD-patients treated with either antiplatelets or anticoagulants.

Patients and Methods

Eligible studies were identified through Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE and personal search until December 2023. We included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies comparing anticoagulants with antiplatelets in eICAD-patients. Co-primary outcomes were (i) death (all causes) and (ii) death or disability. Secondary outcomes were ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and major extracranial hemorrhage. Odds ratios (OR) with 95%CIs were calculated for (i) all studies and (ii) separately for RCTs and non-randomized studies.

Results

We meta-analyzed a total of 42 studies (2624 patients) including 2 RCTs (213 patients) for the primary outcome of death and 31 studies (1953 patients) including 1 RCT (115 patients) for the primary outcome of death or disability. Antiplatelet-treated patients had higher odds for death (OR all-studies 2.70, 95%CI 1.27–5.72; OR RTCs 6.80, 95%CI 0.14–345; OR non-randomized studies 2.60, 95%CI 1.20–5.60) and death or disability (OR all-studies 2.1, 95% CI 1.58–2.66; OR RTCs 2.2, 95% CI 0.29–16.05; OR non-randomized studies 2.1, 95%CI 1.58–2.66) than anticoagulated patients. Antiplatelet-treated patients had also higher odds for ischemic stroke, though this reached statistical significance only in the subgroup of RCTs (OR RTC 4.60, 95%CI 1.36–15.51). In turn, antiplatelet-treated patients had less symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR all-studies 0.25, 95%CI 0.07–0.86) and a tendency toward less major extracranial hemorrhage (OR all-studies 0.17, 95%CI 0.03–1.03).

Discussion and Conclusion

The evidence considering antiplatelets as standard of care in eICAD is weak. Individualized treatment decisions balancing risks versus harms seem recommendable.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112nLSwt]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Extracranial carotid or vertebral arterial dissection in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) — antithrombotic and endovascular management: In patients with ischemic stroke or TIA after an extracranial carotid or vertebral arterial dissection, treatment with antithrombotic therapy for at least 3 months is indicated to prevent recurrent stroke or TIA. In patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who are < 3 months after an extracranial carotid or vertebral arterial dissection, it is reasonable to use either aspirin or warfarin to prevent recurrent stroke or TIA. In patients with stroke or TIA and extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection who have recurrent events despite antithrombotic therapy, endovascular therapy may be considered to prevent recurrent stroke or TIA. The most common mechanism of stroke with extracranial dissection is artery-to-artery embolism from an intraluminal thrombus, which is the rationale for using antithrombotic agents to decrease the rate of ischemic stroke, and although most dissections heal spontaneously, a subset of patients will undergo disease progression and arterial complications such as pseudoaneurysm formation.

### Antiplatelet treatment compared with anticoagulation treatment for cervical artery dissection (CADISS): a randomised trial [^114TEdXj]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection is an important cause of stroke, especially in young people. In some observational studies it has been associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Both antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs are used to reduce risk of stroke but whether one treatment strategy is more effective than the other is unknown. We compared their efficacy in the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS), with the additional aim of establishing the true risk of recurrent stroke.

Methods

We did this randomised trial at hospitals with specialised stroke or neurology services (39 in the UK and seven in Australia). We included patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an automated telephone randomisation service to receive antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant drugs (specific treatment decided by the local clinician) for 3 months. Patients and clinicians were not masked to allocation, but investigators assessing endpoints were. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral stroke or death in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with EUDract (2006–002827–18) and ISRN (CTN44555237).

Findings

We enrolled 250 participants (118 carotid, 132 vertebral). Mean time to randomisation was 3·65 days (SD 1·91). The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n = 224) and local symptoms (headache, neck pain, or Horner's syndrome; n = 26). 126 participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus 124 to anticoagulant treatment. Overall, four (2%) of 250 patients had stroke recurrence (all ipsilateral). Stroke or death occurred in three (2%) of 126 patients versus one (1%) of 124 (odds ratio [OR] 0·335, 95% CI 0·006–4·233; p = 0·63). There were no deaths, but one major bleeding (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in the anticoagulant group. Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in 52 patients. Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three (3%) of 101 patients in the antiplatelet group versus one (1%) of 96 patients in the anticoagulant group (OR 0·346, 95% CI 0·006–4·390; p = 0·66).

Interpretation

We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups, and much rarer than reported in some observational studies. Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases, suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice.

Regarding medical management for cervical artery dissection, more specifically with respect to antithrombotic therapy, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating aspirin or warfarin to prevent recurrent stroke or TIA in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within < 3 months after an extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection [^117K5Rcb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Extracranial internal carotid artery dissection can lead to occlusion of the artery and hence cause an ischaemic stroke. It is the underlying stroke mechanism in approximately 2.5% of all strokes. It is the second leading cause of stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age. Anticoagulants or antiplatelets may prevent arterial thrombosis in extracranial internal carotid artery dissection, but these benefits may be offset by increased bleeding.

Objectives

To determine whether antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulation) are effective and safe in the treatment of patients with extracranial internal carotid artery dissection, and which is the better treatment.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 3 October 2002). In addition we performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2002) and EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2002), and checked all relevant papers for additional eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of anticoagulants or antiplatelets for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection, and non-randomised trials, e.g. case series (studies), that reported on any antithrombotic treatment with at least 4 patients, were eligible for inclusion. Data from all eligible studies were extracted independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data on the primary outcome measures were extracted systematically. These were: death (all causes) and death or disability. Secondary outcomes were: first stroke occurrence, stroke recurrence, any stroke during reported follow-up, extracranial haemorrhage, and intracranial haemorrhage. The first choice treatment was taken for analyses.

Main Results

No randomised trials were identified. No reliable comparisons of antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants with control were available. Twenty-six eligible studies including 327 patients (who either received antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants) were to be included in the comparative analysis. There was no significant difference in odds of death comparing antiplatelet drugs with anticoagulants (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 1.59, 95% CI 0.22–11.59). There was also no significant difference in the odds of being dead or disabled (Peto OR 1.94, 95% CI 0.76–4.91). Few intracranial haemorrhages (0.5%) were reported for patients on anticoagulants, none for patients on antiplatelets.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control. There is, therefore, no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs, and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two. We suggest that a randomised trial including at least 1400 patients in each treatment arm with this condition is clearly needed.

### What is the current status of invasive treatment of extracranial carotid artery disease? [^114vK6rk]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Year 2011 sees the publication of U.S. guidelines that recommend expanding indications for carotid artery stenting into "average-risk" patients, whereas guidelines from Australia/New Zealand largely do not. This article reviews the status of invasive treatment of carotid disease and highlights 2 controversial issues that were not really addressed in these guidelines: (1) a lack of emphasis on the importance of intervening rapidly after transient ischemic attack/minor stroke; and (2) why continue to recommend that only "highly selected" asymptomatic patients should undergo intervention when virtually no-one pays any attention?

### Carotid artery dissection and neurological complications after surgery for type 1 aortic dissection [^114rL64E]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a severe emergency condition requiring prompt surgical treatment. Patients with dissection of the aortic arch, that is, DeBakey type 1 aortic dissection, involving the common carotid arteries (CCAs) may have an increased risk of postoperative neurological complications and mortality when blood flow to the cerebral circulation is diverted or reduced. However, controversial findings on the prognostic importance of TAAD-related CCA dissection have been reported as well. Preoperative unstable haemodynamic conditions and anaemia may further reduce the oxygen delivery to the brain in patients with dissection of the carotid arteries, even when carotid artery dissection results in mild vessel stenosis. The possible negative prognostic effect of dissection of the epiaortic vessels is of relevance because surgery of TAAD is frequently complicated by severe neurological complications, and these in turn are associated with high risk of early and late mortality. Noteworthy, carotid artery dissection can be amenable to concomitant surgical treatment, and preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative endovascular treatment can be considered potentially effective treatments to prevent or relieve brain ischaemia. The prognostic impact of TAAD-related CCA dissection on postoperative neurological complications and mortality has been investigated in the present multicentre study.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112sq4FY]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of stroke, particularly in young adults. Data conflict on the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected cervical artery dissection, leading to variability in practice. We aim to provide an overview of cervical artery dissection in the setting of minor or no reported mechanical trigger with a focus on summarizing the available evidence and providing suggestions on the diagnostic evaluation, treatment approaches, and outcomes. Writing group members drafted their sections using a literature search focused on publications between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2022, and included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies, meta-analyses, opinion papers, case series, and case reports. The writing group chair and vice chair compiled the manuscript and obtained writing group members' approval. Cervical artery dissection occurs as a result of the interplay among risk factors, minor trauma, anatomic and congenital abnormalities, and genetic predisposition. The diagnosis can be challenging both clinically and radiologically. In patients with acute ischemic stroke attributable to cervical artery dissection, acute treatment strategies such as thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are reasonable in otherwise eligible patients. We suggest that the antithrombotic therapy choice be individualized and continued for at least 3 to 6 months. The risk of recurrent dissection is low, and preventive measures may be considered early after the diagnosis and continued in high-risk patients. Ongoing longitudinal and population-based observational studies are needed to close the present gaps on preferred antithrombotic regimens considering clinical and radiographic prognosticators of cervical artery dissection.

Cervical artery dissection in adults — intravenous thrombolysis (IVT): In the absence of data suggesting safety concerns and given the proven efficacy of IVT in otherwise eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke, it is reasonable to consider IVT for patients with acute ischemic stroke with cervical artery dissection if they meet other standard criteria as recommended by current guidelines, while for patients with intracranial extension of the dissection the risks and benefits of IVT are not well established.

### Endovascular treatment in patients with carotid artery dissection and intracranial occlusion: a systematic review [^111S4ZBb]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recently, multiple randomised controlled trials showed efficacy of endovascular treatment over traditional care in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to an intracranial anterior circulation occlusion. Internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection with a concomitant intracranial occlusion is a rare but important cause of severe acute ischemic stroke. Although this subtype of acute ischemic stroke is mostly treated with endovascular treatment, treatment outcomes are still sparsely studied. This study assesses the clinical outcome and reperfusion rates by means of a systematic review.

Methods

Electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched up to October 1, 2016 for articles describing endovascular treatment in patients with intracranial artery occlusion and ICA dissection.

Results

Sixteen studies were included in the analysis. Most studies showed favourable outcome and successful reperfusion. However, most included studies had a high risk of bias.

Conclusion

In the reviewed studies, endovascular treatment in patients with ICA dissection and concomitant proximal intracranial occlusion was associated with favourable outcome. This could point in the direction of endovascular treatment being a beneficial treatment method for these patients. However, this review has only taken data of a limited group of patients into account. A pooled analysis of patients from recently published endovascular treatment trials and running registries is therefore recommended.

Clinical diagnostic challenges and symptom profile — because symptoms are often nonspecific, diagnosis is challenging; in a statewide study, 31% of patients were seen in the emergency department for possible related symptoms in the 14 days preceding diagnosis. Evaluation for suspected cervical artery dissection should include a detailed symptom history, questions about minor trauma, and a detailed neurological examination. Common initial symptoms include facial pain, headache (< 65%), and neck pain (≈50%), and isolated pain without cerebral ischemia occurs in 8% to 12% of diagnosed cases. In carotid dissection, pain may be associated with a (partial) Horner syndrome (≈25%) and cranial nerve palsies (≈12%), and both carotid and vertebral dissection can be associated with pulsatile tinnitus (≈8%). A partial Horner syndrome with new or worsening headache may suggest a carotid dissection diagnosis, and headache characteristics are not specific but can rarely be acute and of thunderclap nature.

### Contemporary management and outcomes of carotid artery dissection [^1165eEc6]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery dissection is a significant cause of stroke and the leading etiology of ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged individuals. The management of carotid artery dissection is continually evolving and varies based on the patient's clinical presentation. While carotid dissection is typically managed medically, endovascular intervention may be warranted in certain cases, and open surgical intervention is rarely employed. This qualitative review examines contemporary management strategies for cervical carotid artery dissection, highlighting 3 illustrative cases where endovascular intervention was utilized. We present one case of traumatic etiology with acute stroke symptoms, another traumatic case with progressing dissection and pseudoaneurysm evident on imaging, and a case of iatrogenic carotid dissection. Through these cases, we aim to elucidate the decision-making process and outcomes associated with endovascular treatment in the context of carotid artery dissection.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111Lxoim]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke due to cervical artery dissection — Evidence for IVT remains limited and mostly observational, and in these studies the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 2% to 3% with similar ICH rates compared with patients without cervical artery dissection. A meta-analysis comparing IVT and no IVT did not find an evidence of functional outcome or mortality benefit of thrombolysis, and small case series have not found increased pseudoaneurysm formation or rupture with IVT. In the absence of data suggesting safety concerns and given the proven efficacy of IVT in otherwise eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke, it is reasonable to consider IVT for patients with acute ischemic stroke with cervical artery dissection if they meet other standard criteria, as recommended by current guidelines, while in patients with intracranial extension of the dissection the risks and benefits of IVT are not well established.

American Heart Association scientific statement — cervical artery dissection in adults: In patients with acute ischemic stroke attributable to cervical artery dissection, thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are reasonable in otherwise eligible patients. We suggest that the antithrombotic therapy choice be individualized and continued for at least 3 to 6 months. The risk of recurrent dissection is low, and preventive measures may be considered early after the diagnosis and continued in high-risk patients. Cervical artery (internal carotid or vertebral artery) dissection can occur in the absence of major trauma.

### Medical and interventional outcome of dissection of the cervical arteries: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Y91PV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The management of cervical artery dissections (CADs) is poorly standardized given the scarce number of prospective studies comparing medical and interventional approach to CAD. The aim of the present study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the treatments of CAD.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis (pre-registered on PROSPERO [CRD42022297512] are performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] guidelines searching in three different databases [PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Database]) of studies on medical or interventional approach to CAD. Only prospective studies were selected to reduce the risk of bias for the primary meta-analysis. Secondarily, retrospective studies were also included. The aim was to assess the rate of stroke and of stroke/death/bleeding (major or intracranial) by Der Simonian-Laird weights of random effects model.

Results

After screening 456 articles, 6 prospective and 22 retrospective studies were identified. Two randomized controlled trials and five retrospective studies comparing antiplatelet (APT) vs oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC) for CAD were identified, as well as four prospective and 17 retrospective single-arm studies evaluating stenting for CAD. In the meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing APT vs OAC, 444 patients were considered, and a borderline significant association was identified in terms of stroke/death in the APT vs OAC groups (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94–33.38; p = 0.06; I² = 0%). No differences were found for the stroke/death/bleeding outcome (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.19–8.18; p = 0.81; I² = 0%) between the two treatments. In the meta-analysis including also retrospective studies, overall risk of bias was considered "serious", and 4104 patients were included with no differences in APT vs OAC for stroke (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.53–2.11; p = 0.29; I² = 18%); no other comparisons were possible. The pooled meta-analysis of prospective studies on stenting for CAD included four series, for a total of 68 patients, in whom stenting was adopted primarily after failed medical therapy or after traumatic dissection. The pooled rate of stroke/death was 7% (95% CI, 3%-17%; I² = 0%). The analysis of moderators identified a significant inverse association between the percentage of traumatic dissection and a reduction in postoperative stroke (Y = -1.60–2.02X; p = 0.03). The pooled rate of the composite endpoint of stroke/death/ or major bleeding was 8% (95% CI, 3%-18%; I² = 0%). Secondarily, the meta-analysis also included 17 retrospective studies with overall 457 patients and showed a 2.1% pooled rate of stroke/death (95% CI, 1.0%-3.3%; I² = 0%) and 3.2% stroke/death/bleeding (95% CI, 1.8%-4.7%; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

Few prospective studies on CAD treatment are present in literature. APT and OAC seem to have similar efficacy in reducing the recurrence of stroke after CAD. No definitive conclusion can be drawn for stenting, due to the low number of studies available. More prospective studies are necessary to evaluate its potential additional value over medical therapy alone in the early phase after CAD.

Stenting of the internal carotid artery

The optimal management of extra-intracranial tandem occlusions in patients with CeAD remains debated. In the hyperacute setting, there are currently no evidence-based guidelines or consensus on the indications for carotid artery stenting in the context of CeAD. STOP-CAD emerged with an analysis of 328 patients with occlusive internal carotid artery dissection and anterior circulation ischemic stroke, of which 150 underwent emergent stenting of the extracranial (i.e. CeAD-related) pathology. The median age was 51 (IQR 44–58) years, and 96 patients (29.3%) were female. At 90 days, no significant difference in functional outcomes (mRS available in 84% of the patients; 62.0% versus 59.7%; adjusted OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82–1.86, p = 0.315) or symptomatic ICH rates was observed (7.3% versus 7.9%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.69, 95% CI 0.01–240.6, p = 0.836). However, in the acute phase (i.e. 24 h after endovascular assessment), patients who underwent stenting had a significantly higher risk of any intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.11–3.67, p = < 0.001), which was not significant for symptomatic ICH alone (adjusted OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.41–2.2, p = 0.913). These results suggest that while both treatment strategies are viable, emergent stenting may have a less favorable safety profile due to an increased risk of early hemorrhage, which is consistent with the results of other observational studies. Still, in cases of hemodynamic instability, where cerebral perfusion imaging indicates a potential benefit from restoring blood flow, emergent stenting can be considered. Ultimately, the decision to use emergent stenting remains an individual decision made by the treating physician, taking into account the specific clinical circumstances and patient factors. Given the rarity of CeAD, randomized controlled trials on acute stenting are unlikely to be feasible. Nevertheless, future observational studies or registry-based analyses could help identify subgroups who might benefit, particularly patients with hemodynamic instability, as evidenced by delayed time-to-peak on perfusion imaging or gradual clinical worsening through hypoperfusion-related recurrent cerebral ischemia. Comparing outcomes in such patients with and without stenting could provide valuable insights into the role of revascularization in this setting. The ongoing TITAN trial (Thrombectomy in Tandem Occlusion) will shed more light on further safety and efficacy of emergency stenting in tandem occlusion.

### Thrombolysis in patients with acute stroke caused by cervical artery dissection… [^114duJAU]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Background Results of recently published studies suggest that intravenous thrombolysis and local intra-arterial thrombolysis are feasible procedures in acute stroke after cervical artery dissection. Objectives To describe 9 patients with acute stroke caused by CAD who were treated by LIT or IVT and to review the literature. CERVICAL ARTERY dissection is a common cause of stroke in young patients. 1, 2 Recently, several authors published reports on single cases or small series of patients that suggest that intravenous thrombolysis 3, 4 or local intra-arterial thrombolysis 5–7 can be performed in patients with acute stroke after CAD with limited or no procedure-related morbidity. We describe an additional 9 patients with CAD treated with thrombolysis and review the published literature on this therapeutic approach. Intra-arterial urokinase was administered directly into the occluded intracranial arteries distal to the dissection.

Recanalization on posttreatment angiogram was graded according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial criteria. 9 Intravenous thrombolysis was performed if cervical vessel occlusion precluded access to the target intracranial vessel and only if the procedure could be done within 3 hours of stroke onset, as provided by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke IVT protocol. Clinical assessment was performed at hospital admission using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.
10. In the others, no potential cause could be identified. The 7 LIT patients were treated with urokinase. Treatment effect was documented by arteriography immediately after thrombolysis. Two patients with internal carotid artery occlusion from dissection received intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.

After thrombolytic therapy, 7 patients were treated with heparin in a dose doubling the activated thromboplastin time and 2 were given aspirin daily. After IVT, outcome was good in 7 patients and bad in 10. After LIT, 3 patients had good outcomes and 1 died.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111ZrF6R]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Cervical artery dissection — CADISS randomized comparison of antiplatelet versus anticoagulation reports feasibility and neutral primary outcome signals: CADISS had 250 participants, 118 with carotid dissection and 132 with vertebral artery dissection, recruited 3.7 ± 1.9 (mean ± SD) days after symptom onset with cerebral ischemia in 224 and local symptoms in 26 participants; patients were allocated to anticoagulation (124; vitamin K antagonist with lead-in heparin in 112/124 and 12/124 without bridging) or antiplatelet in 126 for 3 months. Antiplatelet regimens were heterogeneous (aspirin alone 20%, clopidogrel alone 33%, aspirin plus clopidogrel 28%, aspirin plus dipyridamole 16%, dipyridamole alone 1%). Within 3 months, ischemic stroke occurred in 3/126 on antiplatelet and 1/124 on anticoagulation (odds ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.01–4.23]); no major hemorrhage occurred in the antiplatelet group, whereas 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred with anticoagulation. In 20% the diagnosis was not confirmed by central adjudication, and a per-protocol analysis across 197 participants showed no statistically significant difference between groups for the primary outcome; two additional ischemic strokes (1 in each arm) occurred during the subsequent 3- to 12-month observational follow-up period.

50. 9% of the participants received antiplatelet therapy, of whom 24. 3% received dual antiplatelet therapy and
49. 1% received anticoagulation. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the patients with antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation therapy. We found that no regimen was better in any particular subgroup, except for anticoagulants being significantly more effective in participants without a dissecting aneurysm at baseline. However, this finding needs to be treated as hypothesis generating, particularly given the number of subgroups in which comparisons between the 2 regimens were made.

Our analysis provides data comparing anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents in the secondary prevention of stroke after CAD. Furthermore, in both trials, the primary end point assessment was blinded and independently adjudicated, which increases the validity of the datasets used in this analysis. They would have an advantage in cases presenting with local symptoms or minor cerebral symptoms in allowing rapid initiation of therapy and early discharge. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel has been shown to be more effective than aspirin alone in both reducing embolization in symptomatic carotid stenosis26 and preventing early recurrent stroke in patients with minor stroke and transient ischemic attack. 27, 28 Most patients in the CADISS and TREAT-CAD trials had only single antiplatelet agents and it is possible that dual antiplatelet therapy may also be more effective in CAD. Future trials of CAD should therefore include this regimen.

Another possible treatment would be a combined strategy of antiplatelet agents and low-dose anticoagulants, similar to that tested in the COMPASS study. 29 A large observational study is currently under way to compare outcomes with different antithrombotic treatment options, including dual antiplatelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants, in a large CAD cohort of approximately more than 3600 participants, and will provide important results. 30 However definitive data on the optimal regimen for secondary prevention will only be provided by large, well-powered RCTs.

### Endovascular treatment in patients with carotid artery dissection and intracranial occlusion: a systematic review [^113aPJJq]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Assessment of quality

The risk of bias was determined using an adapted version of the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool. This tool represents a domain-based evaluation, which critically assesses various domains. These domains are sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other issues'. The risk of bias for each domain was classified as 'high', 'low' or 'unclear'.

Study outcomes

In the studies included in this review, reperfusion was graded with the TICI score. Accordingly, we defined TICI 2b-3 as successful reperfusion. In cases where reperfusion was described as favourable, we defined this as TICI 2b to prevent overestimation of reperfusion rates. Functional outcome was graded with 90-day mRS and 90-day NIHSS. When studies described both parameters, we chose to present both 90-day NIHSS and 90-day mRS to preserve all found outcome data. Favourable outcome was defined as a mRS score ≤ 2 and a NIHSS score ≤ 1 or improvement by at least 11 points from baseline.

### Cervical arterial dissection: time for a therapeutic trial? [^113JPQsn]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cervical arterial dissection is a major cause of stroke in young adults, yet despite standard treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, its management remains uncertain. The goal of this study was to assess the natural history of the disorder and to decide on the feasibility of a therapeutic trial.

Methods

Collaborating members of the Canadian Stroke Consortium prospectively enrolled consecutively referred patients with angiographically proven acute vertebral or carotid arterial dissection. Data recorded included clinical and radiological details, recurrence of ischemic cerebral events, and medical or surgical treatment.

Results

Of 116 patients, 67 had vertebral and 49 had carotid dissections, with no difference in age or sex. In 68 (59%), trauma occurred at the time of dissection. During the course of a 1-year follow-up, at least 17 patients (15%) had recurrent transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death, mainly in the weeks immediately after the dissection. In 105 patients with complete follow-up, the event rate in those treated with anticoagulants was 8.3% and in those treated with aspirin was 12.4%, a nonsignificant difference of 4.1%. Using these data, we calculate that for a 2-arm trial (aspirin versus anticoagulants) with 80% power and 5% significance, 913 patients are needed in each group.

Conclusions

From our data indicating an initial relatively high recurrence rate, a multicenter trial of anticoagulants versus aspirin involving a total of 2000 patients is feasible.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^113HdJd1]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extracranial (cervical) internal carotid artery dissection (eICAD) is a leading cause of stroke in young patients (up to 25% in patients < 50 years) – but also occurs in subjects aged 60 years and older.

Antithrombotic medication for stroke prevention is the mainstay of management of patients with eICAD. However, it is still unclear whether to use antiplatelets (AP) or anticoagulation (AC), as superiority of either treatment modality is still to be proven. Two recently published randomized controlled clinical trials comparing AP to AC in cervical artery dissections (CADISS and TREAT-CAD), as well as meta-analyses on the study leveland based on individual-patient data of both trialsdid not find superiority of either approach. However, both randomized trials and two recent meta-analyses, did not stratify their findings in patients with ICAD versus those with VAD. –,

The approach chosen for this research is different to that of the aforementioned meta-analyses as it focused on the antithrombotic treatment response solely for ICAD (rather than for cervical artery dissection – as the combination of VAD and ICAD). This approach takes into account that ICAD differs from VAD in several aspects. Compared to VAD patients, ICAD patients were predominantly maleand older, had a recent infection more often, presented with stroke, or with occlusive dissectionless often, have more severe strokes, and a poor functional outcome. Furthermore, ICA originates from the neural crest, while VA originates from the mesoderm.

In addition, since the last update, the use of both dual antiplatelets as well as direct oral anticoagulants has been employed, in eICAD. The objective of this updated systematic review, using the Cochrane methodology, was to evaluate the current evidence about benefits and harms of anticoagulants (AC) versus antiplatelets (AP) in patients with eICAD.

Conclusions for cervical artery dissection — acute thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are reasonable in otherwise eligible acute ischemic stroke patients due to dissection. We suggest that the antithrombotic therapy choice be individualized and continued for at least 3 to 6 months, and because the risk of recurrent dissection is low, preventive measures may be considered early after diagnosis and continued in high-risk patients.

### Comprehensive analysis of intra-arterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to cervical artery dissection [^111Jd3BZ]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a recognized cause of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), characterized by intramural hematoma produced by subintimal tear of the carotid and vertebral arterial walls. CeAD is uncommon in the general stroke population accounting for just 2–2.5% of all AIS, but is a major cause of stroke in the young, responsible for 10–25% of all AIS.

Patients presenting with CeAD are traditionally managed with antithrombotic therapy, including anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation agents. There is debate as to whether anticoagulation is superior to antiplatelet aggregation agents; the findings from the first published randomized controlled trial comparing antithrombotic therapies found no difference in efficacy, although this pilot trial's outcomes were rare occurrences. CeAD should not be considered a contraindication to acute treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) because IVT has been shown to be beneficial across all causes of stroke in inducing recanalization of the thrombosis and distal emboli.

Intra-arterial treatment (IAT) may be a complementary option to IVT and antithrombotic therapy in patients with AIS due to CeAD. There are several case reports and small case series of IAT in patients with CeAD, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. However, the safety and efficacy of IAT with CeAD has not been formally studied. In light of the recent groundbreaking randomized controlled trials (RCTs)demonstrating the superiority of IAT over IVT in selected patients with AIS caused by proximal intracranial occlusion in the anterior circulation, our purpose was to examine the safety and efficacy of IAT for AIS caused by CeAD.

### Cerebrovascular dissections – a review part I: spontaneous dissections [^116yhcwN]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrovascular dissections are subintimal or subadventitial cervical carotid and vertebral artery wall injuries and are the cause of as many as 2% of all ischemic strokes. Spontaneous dissections are the leading cause of stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age, accounting for almost one fourth of strokes in this population. A history of some degree of trivial trauma is present in nearly one fourth of cases. Subsequent mortality or neurological morbidity is usually the result of distal ischemia produced by emboli released from the injury site, although local mass effect produced by arterial dilation or aneurysm formation also can occur. The gold standard for diagnosis remains digital subtraction angiography. Computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and ultrasonography are complementary means o evaluation, particularly for injury screening or treatment follow-up. The annual rate of stroke after injury is approximately 1% or less per year. The currently accepted method of therapy remains antithrombotic medication, either in the form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents; however, no class I medical evidence exists to guide therapy. Other options for treatment include thrombolysis and endovascular therapy, although the efficacy and indications for these methods remain unclear.

Cervical artery dissection — antithrombotic therapy outcomes are based on expert opinion and randomized evidence showing no clear difference between antiplatelets and anticoagulants. CADISS randomized 250 patients with extracranial dissection within 7 days from symptom onset to receive either antiplatelets or anticoagulants in the following 3 months, with stroke or death in 3 patients (2%) assigned to antiplatelets versus 1 patient (1%) in the anticoagulation group (OR, 0.335 [95% CI, 0.006–4.233]; P = 0.63), and at the 1-year follow-up 3.2% in the antiplatelet group versus 1.6% in the anticoagulant group (OR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.10–3.21]; P = 0.51); this trial supports that there is equipoise between antiplatelets and anticoagulants in the first 3 months after a cervical artery dissection.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^113BZhop]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The new search yielded 2 completed randomized trials, CADISS and TREAT-CAD, and 6 new non-randomized studies. – Together with the previously included 36 studies this review is based on a total of 44 studies (Figure 1), of which 42 studies (death) and 31 studies (death or disability), respectively provided data on the co-primary outcomes while 2 studies, provided data only on the secondary outcomes. Details about each individual included study, including duration of follow-up and sources of data can be found in the. Forty-nine (49) studies were excluded, the reasons for each exclusion are shown in the review's flow chart (Figure 1) and a complete comprehensive table of all excluded studies can be found in the).

Figure 1.
Flow chart for included studies and reasons for exclusion.

Risk of bias

The risk of bias of both RCTs was considered low in all categories with the exception of performance bias. Due to the absent blinding to the allocated treatment, the risk of performance bias was considered high (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Risk of bias in the included studies.

For all non-randomized studies, the risk of bias was rated serious as all were observational, retrospective and none reported results from a pre-defined treatment protocol. Furthermore, the choice whether to use antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment was decided by the treating physician and/or the patients, leading to a serious risk of allocation and selection bias. Even though an effort was done in most studies to minimize confounders, we assume that preference of patients (e.g. for AP rather than AC) and personal experience of physicians (e.g. bleed under AC in severely affected patients) as well as difference in cost (AC is usually more expensive than AP) may act as confounding factors. Furthermore, the length of follow up was heterogeneous among studies and varied within studies. Finally, due to absence of pre-defined and standardized procedures about screening, inclusion and treating patients and about the mode of outcome assessment, we assume that the risk of a reporting bias is substantial. As we do not consider the risk of bias to be on a critical level (all studies were published in peer-reviewed journals), all selected non-randomized studies were included in the analysis.

### Current indications, results, and technique of carotid angioplasty / stenting [^112NTMHd]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the treatment of choice for most patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis. Certain patient subsets, including those with severe cardiac and pulmonary disease and those with local/anatomic risk factors (including recurrent stenosis following CEA, cervical radiation therapy, prior radical neck dissection, and surgically inaccessible lesions) are at increased risk of stroke, cranial nerve injury and non-Q myocardial infarction following CEA, and may be better served by carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). Procedural success is dependent upon proper patient selection and meticulous attention to detail. The use of cerebral embolic protection appears to reduce the risk of peri-procedural stroke following CAS.

### Surgical and radiological interventions for treating symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection [^1159PwV2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a pathological bleed or tear, or both, in the wall of the carotid or vertebral arteries as they course through the neck, and is a leading cause of stroke in young people.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of surgical and radiological interventions versus best medical treatment alone for treating symptomatic cervical artery dissection.

Search Methods

We performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched March 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2020, Issue 4, in the Cochrane Library (searched March 2020), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 2020). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of either surgical or endovascular intervention for the management of symptomatic CeAD were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke and disability. Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies.

Main Results

We did not find any completed RCTs or CCTs undertaken in this area of research.

Authors' Conclusions

No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone.

### The 6-months follow-up of the TREAT-CAD trial: aspirin versus anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with cervical artery dissection [^115TCobR]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a major cause of stroke in young individuals. – For stroke prevention, either antiplatelets or anticoagulants are used. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) – CADISS, and TREAT-CAD, – compared early antiplatelet with anticoagulation therapy in CeAD. None of the trials nor a meta-analysis across both trials showed superiority of either approach. Additionally, optimal duration of antithrombotic treatment is unknown. Current guidelines recommend continuing antithrombotic treatment for at least 3–6or even 6–12 monthsbased on expert opinions. Both CADISS and TREAT-CAD evaluated primary outcomes after 3 months of randomly allocated treatment, while there are few data on the occurrence of ischemic or hemorrhagic events beyond 3 months after CeAD.

In TREAT-CAD, which in contrast to CADISS used clinical and MR-imaging outcome, participants could continue on antithrombotic medication and obtained a standardized assessment on the occurrence of new clinical and MRI imaging outcomes at 6 months as foreseen in the protocol. These data allow to compare benefits and harms of aspirin versus anticoagulants in the extended follow-up period from 3 until 6 months after CeAD.

In detail, we report on the frequency of both clinical and MR-imaging outcomes between 3 and 6 months after CeAD among the per-protocol participants of the TREAT-CAD trial, in whom follow-up until 6 months was available. Comparisons include type of treatment (aspirin vs anticoagulant) and type of outcome event (ischemic and hemorrhagic).

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^1178m7pj]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage

Thirty-one studies with 1341 patients provided data about symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage stratified on the type of antithrombotic treatment. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages were present in 15 of 1341 patients (1.1%), 4/531 (0.8%) in the AP and in 11/810 (1.4%) in the AC group. The Peto odds ratio of 0.25 with a 95% CI of 0.07–0.86 indicated a significant difference between the treatment options in favor of the AP group (p = 0.03). There was no significant heterogeneity between the included studies (I 2 = 0%; Figure 3(d)).

In the subgroup of RCTs (2 trials, 213 patients), no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages occurred.

For the subgroup of non-randomized studies (29 studies, 1128 patients), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages were present in 15 of 1128 patients (1.3%). The Peto odds ratio of 0.25 with a 95% CI of 0.07–0.86 indicated a difference between the treatment options in favor of the AP group (p = 0.03; Figure 3(d)).

### The diagnosis and management of supraaortic arterial dissections [^111oS8bX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent advances in understanding supraaortic arterial dissections and their diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

Dissection of the supraaortic arteries, including the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and intracranial arteries, is increasingly identified as an important cause of stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common cause likely involves minor trauma with preexisting arteriopathy. The imaging diagnosis of dissection is complicated by the wide range of pathological changes that occur after dissection. Modalities include ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, computed tomography angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. The choice of method is best tailored to each patient individually. Similarly, treatments may vary from antiplatelet medications to complex endovascular techniques. There are limited data to guide treating patients with strokes due to arterial dissections. Conservative management is likely optimal for most patients with cervical dissections, endovascular treatments being reserved for the rapidly deteriorating patient only. However, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a dissecting aneurysm require urgent endovascular or surgical treatment of the aneurysm.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of supraaortic arterial dissections is complex, and a variable multidisciplinary approach will likely yield the best outcome.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^117T28v5]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this systematic review was first published in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 4, 1998; CD Number: CD000255. There have been no amendments to the protocol. This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Data not published within the article are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Eligibility criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), non-randomized studies including case series with at least four patients with symptomatic eICAD that allowed comparisons between antithrombotic treatments for eICAD were eligible. We included all studies that reported at least one primary outcome comparing patients treated with AC versus those treated with AP. In line with prior versions of this review, studies reporting on a single treatment modality, including three or fewer cases, consisting of reviews summarizing case reports, series with data repetition from former citations (we included only the most recent series) or studies where we could not make the distinction between dissections of internal carotid artery, common carotid artery, vertebral artery, or intracranial carotid artery dissection were excluded.

Patients' symptoms included: stroke, transient ischemic attacks or pure local neurological deficits. Studies with patients whose diagnosis of eICAD was made by arterial angiography, duplex scanning, computer tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating specific features of dissection were eligible. We accepted the following angiographic signs consistent with eICAD: mural hematoma, dissecting aneurysm, long tapering stenosis, intimal flap, double lumen, or occlusion more than 2 cm above the carotid bifurcation revealing a dissecting aneurysm or a long tapering stenosis after recanalization, applying widely accepted criteria.

Antithrombotic treatment was defined as administration of any AP drug or combinations thereof (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ticlopidine, clopidogrel, sulfinpyrazone, dipyridamole, ticagrelor, prasugrel) or administration of full dose AC (such as intravenous or subcutaneous fractionated or unfractionated heparin and/or oral coumarin or DOACS).

We only analyzed the initially used antithrombotic treatment and excluded the patients from the case series for whom surgical intervention or stenting was mentioned as a treatment modality.

In patients receiving thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy, the first antithrombotic agent used thereafter was deemed the "initially used antithrombotic treatment". In cases of bleeding complications among such patients, we sought information on whether the bleed was associated with the thrombolytic/thrombectomy treatment (rather than with the antithrombotic treatment).

### Antiplatelet therapy vs anticoagulation therapy in cervical artery dissection: the cervical artery dissection in stroke study (CADISS) randomized clinical trial final results [^115ZkpYo]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection is an important cause of stroke, particularly in younger individuals. In some but not all observational studies, it has been associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Both antiplatelet agents (APs) and anticoagulants (ACs) are used to reduce stroke risk, but whether 1 treatment strategy is more effective is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether AP or AC therapy is more effective in preventing stroke in cervical dissection and the risk of recurrent stroke in a randomized clinical trial setting. A secondary outcome was to determine the effect on arterial imaging outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, prospective, open-label international multicenter parallel design study with central blinded review of both clinical and imaging end points. Recruitment was conducted in 39 stroke and neurology secondary care centers in the United Kingdom and 7 centers in Australia between February 24, 2006, and June 17, 2013. One-year follow-up and analysis was conducted in 2018. Two hundred fifty participants with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with symptom onset within the last 7 days were recruited. Follow-up data at 1 year were available for all participants.

Interventions

Randomization to AP or AC (heparin followed by warfarin) for 3 months, after which the choice of AP and AC agents was decided by the local clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was ipsilateral stroke and death. A planned per protocol (PP) analysis was performed in patients meeting the inclusion criteria following central review of imaging to confirm the diagnosis of dissection. A secondary end point was angiographic recanalization in those with imaging confirmed dissection.

Results

Two hundred fifty patients were randomized (118 carotid and 132 vertebral), 126 to AP and 124 to AC. Mean (SD) age was 49 (12) years. Mean (SD) time to randomization was 3.65 (1.91) days. The recurrent stroke rate at 1 year was 6 of 250 (2.4%) on ITT analysis and 5 of 197 (2.5%) on PP analysis. There were no significant differences between treatment groups for any outcome. Of the 181 patients with confirmed dissection and complete imaging at baseline and 3 months, there was no difference in the presence of residual narrowing or occlusion between those receiving AP (n = 56 of 92) vs those receiving AC (n = 53 of 89) (P = 0.97).

Conclusions and Relevance

During 12 months of follow-up, the number of recurrent strokes was low. There was no difference between treatment groups in outcome events or the rate of recanalization.

### Primary stenting for the acute treatment of carotid artery dissection [^113EbztT]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review and evaluate our experience with carotid artery stenting in the acute treatment of carotid artery dissection (CAD).

Patients and Methods

Reviewing the charts of our hospital between 2000 and 2001, we found two consecutive patients who benefited from primary stenting for the acute treatment of spontaneous extracranial internal CAD.

Results

Primary stenting of the internal carotid artery was successful in both cases without any post-operative complications. Clinical and US duplex scan follow-up confirmed the absence of neurological symptoms and the patency of the internal carotid artery with complete disappearance of the dissection at 36 and 42 months after the procedure, respectively.

Conclusion

Despite the small number of patients, primary stenting for acute CAD seems to be safe and effective.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^111uhPmX]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Extracranial internal carotid artery dissection (eICAD) is a leading cause of stroke in younger patients. In this Cochrane Review update we compared benefits and harms of eICAD-patients treated with either antiplatelets or anticoagulants.

Patients and methods:

Eligible studies were identified through Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE and personal search until December 2023. We included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies comparing anticoagulants with antiplatelets in eICAD-patients. Co-primary outcomes were (i) death (all causes) and (ii) death or disability. Secondary outcomes were ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and major extracranial hemorrhage. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were calculated for (i) all studies and (ii) separately for RCTs and non-randomized studies.

Results:

We meta-analyzed a total of 42 studies (2624 patients) including 2 RCTs (213 patients) for the primary outcome of death and 31 studies (1953 patients) including 1 RCT (115 patients) for the primary outcome of death or disability. Antiplatelet-treated patients had higher odds for death (OR all-studies 2.70, 95% CI 1.27–5.72; OR RTCs 6.80, 95% CI 0.14–345; OR non-randomized studies 2.60, 95% CI 1.20–5.60) and death or disability (OR all-studies 2.1, 95% CI 1.58–2.66; OR RTCs 2.2, 95% CI 0.29–16.05; OR non-randomized studies 2.1, 95% CI 1.58–2.66) than anticoagulated patients. Antiplatelet-treated patients had also higher odds for ischemic stroke, though this reached statistical significance only in the subgroup of RCTs (OR RTC 4.60, 95% CI 1.36–15.51). In turn, antiplatelet-treated patients had less symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR all-studies 0.25, 95% CI 0.07–0.86) and a tendency toward less major extracranial hemorrhage (OR all-studies 0.17, 95% CI 0.03–1.03).

Discussion and conclusion:

The evidence considering antiplatelets as standard of care in eICAD is weak. Individualized treatment decisions balancing risks versus harms seem recommendable.

### Cervical artery dissection: pathology, epidemiology and management [^1164riSq]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical artery dissection is often treated with anticoagulants to prevent ischemic stroke. The risk-benefit ratio of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy is unclear.

Objectives

To provide an educational review of current data on the disease to explain the rationale for the treatment options and to explore the results of management studies in order to determine if anticoagulation is justified.

Methods

We searched the databases MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as bibliographies for information on anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in cervical, i.e. carotid and/or vertebral artery, dissection.

Results

There are no randomized controlled trials on the treatment. One systematic review from 2003 identified 20 case series or cohort studies. We identified 9 additional studies with a total of 1,033 patients. Of those, 731 received anticoagulation sometimes followed by platelet inhibition vs. 282 patients treated with antiplatelet agents alone. The rate of ischemic stroke was 2.3% vs. 6.9% and bleeding complications were reported in 0.7% vs. 0%.

Conclusion

It cannot be excluded that there is a net benefit from anticoagulant therapy in cervical dissection, but the studies are flawed by considerable bias. Very ill patients at a high risk of ischemic stroke may have been given aspirin due to fear of hemorrhagic complications. A randomized controlled trial is planned and will be crucial to resolve this issue.

### Horner syndrome due to carotid dissection [^115jeWaZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Internal carotid artery dissection typically presents with a clear history of blunt cranial-cervical trauma. Presenting symptoms include headache, focal cerebral ischemic symptoms, and oculosympathetic paresis (Horner syndrome). It is usually thought that internal carotid dissection is a serious but infrequent cause of Horner syndrome.

Objective

A review of the literature reveals that carotid dissection is under-recognized as a cause of Horner syndrome, and outcome is thought to be compromised by diagnostic delay.

Case Report

This case report describes a patient who presented to the Emergency Department with a traumatic Horner syndrome caused by internal carotid dissection.

Summary

The etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment options of carotid dissection are discussed.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection: updated systematic review [^115T6z63]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In this context, it is a challenge to understand the observed benefit of anticoagulants over antiplatelet regarding death and death or disability. We were not able to study, the impact of the occurrence of ischemic stroke versus bleeding complications on the co-primary outcomes of death and death or disability, respectively. One might speculate, that ischemic strokes – the complication for which anticoagulants seemed to be the more powerful preventive means – are the most frequent complication and/or have a bigger impact on functional outcome than the bleeding complications (for the prevention of which antiplatelets seemed preferable).

Our findings regarding ischemic stroke and major hemorrhages are in line with a recently published meta-analysis comparing AC with AP treatment of patients with cervical artery dissection – that is, ICAD combined with VAD. In this study, AC was superior to AP in reducing ischemic stroke but carried a higher major bleeding risk. Our research added that these findings seem applicable also to the group of patients with ICAD. More importantly and as a refinement, our analyses suggested that – in addition – AC might be superior to AP also in preventing death or disability.

We are aware of other important limitations. Outcome measurement was not applied uniformly in the included non-randomized studies which also differed in their focus. This included that some studies reported on "any ischemic stroke" while others only on "ipsilateral ischemic stroke". It is therefore likely that there are important biases. Nonrandomized studies are known to be highly susceptible to bias and outcome events may be under-represented. Such biases encountered in the reported studies may be: reporting favorable cases; reports on selected cases as well as editorial biases, such as not allowing reports on already published issues by different authors; the choice of treatments may have been biased by the preference of the treating physicians. Moreover, the retrievable baseline data did not allow to stratify the analyses neither by type of presenting symptom nor by stroke severity in those patients presenting with stroke. This prevented us from studying whether imbalances in baseline variables might have influenced the seemingly better result for the anticoagulation group in avoiding death and death or disability.

### Endovascular treatment of iatrogenic and traumatic carotid artery dissection [^113EPVnV]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

This paper reports on the early and midterm results of endovascular treatment of acute carotid artery dissections, its specific problems, and its limitations. We encountered seven patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid artery dissection, three cases of which occurred after carotid endarterectomy, two after carotid angioplasty and stenting, and two after trauma. Balloon-expandable and self-expanding stents were placed using a transfemoral approach. Success in restoring the carotid lumen was achieved in all patients. No procedure-related complications occurred. All patients experienced significant clinical improvement while in the hospital and achieved complete long-term recovery. At follow-up (mean, 22.4 months), good luminal patency of the stented segments was observed. In conclusion, in this small series, primary stent-supported angioplasty seems to be a safe and effective strategy in the treatment of selected patients having acute traumatic extracranial carotid artery dissection, with excellent early and midterm results. Larger series and longer-term follow-up are required before definitive recommendations can be made.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115rKvp7]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Cervical artery dissection — risk and timing of recurrent dissection summarizes that reported recurrence rates range from 0.7% to 1.9% per patient-year; a prospective multicenter study (n = 1194) found a 3.3% recurrence over a mean of 34 months with median time 3 months; in combined cohorts of 1958 patients evaluating the first 6 months, 1.5% with single-artery involvement and 2% with multiple arterial dissections had recurrent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, with median time 1.45 ± 1.09 months and 48.6% within the first month; in a prospective ultrasound follow-up cohort of 238 participants, 9.2% had recurrent dissection within the first month; later recurrences occurred in 7.1% (n = 17) and > 40% were asymptomatic.

### Antithrombotic drugs for carotid artery dissection [^113geAuj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Extracranial internal carotid artery dissection (eICAD) is a leading cause of stroke in younger patients.

Objectives

1. To determine whether, in patients with eICAD, treatment with anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents or control was associated with a better functional outcome. 2. To compare, among patients treated with either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents, the risk of ischaemic strokes and major bleeding episodes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 3 October 2009). In addition, we performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2009), checked all relevant papers for additional eligible studies and contacted authors and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and non-randomised studies (if they reported on outcome stratified by antithrombotic treatment and included at least four patients) of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. Two review authors independently extracted data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcomes were death (all causes) and death or disability. Secondary outcomes were ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, and major extracranial haemorrhage during the reported follow-up period. The first choice treatment was taken for analyses.

Main Results

We did not find any completed randomised trials. Comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulants across 36 observational studies (1285 patients), there were no significant differences in the odds of death (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.60), or the occurrence of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86) (34 studies, 1262 patients). For the outcome of death or disability, there was a non-significant trend in favour of anticoagulants (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.22; P = 0.06) (26 studies, 463 patients). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (5/627; 0.8%) and major extracranial haemorrhages (7/425; 1.6%) occurred only in the anticoagulation group; however, for both these outcomes, the estimates were imprecise and indicated no significant difference between the two treatment modalities.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control, thus there is no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two.

### Endovascular treatment in patients with carotid artery dissection and intracranial occlusion: a systematic review [^115WYK7s]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is a major cause of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the young, responsible for 10–25% of all strokes occurring in this population, whereas this severe cause of AIS only account for up to 2% in the total stroke population. Before the introduction of intraarterial therapy, only few patients with extracranial ICA dissection together with an intracranial vessel occlusion were reported to fully recover after intravenous administration of rt-PA. Over the past years, multiple studies on alternative ways of treatment such as intravenous fibrinolysis combined with endovascular treatment have been performed. As a result of the publication of multiple randomised controlled trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, THRACE and PISTE), intraarterial treatment has been proven effective over traditional treatment and has become the new standard for exclusive proximal intracranial occlusions. However, although patients with ICA dissection in combination with concomitant intracranial vessel occlusion are mostly treated with endovascular treatment, the clinical outcome and reperfusion rates are still sparsely studied, and therefore, this type of treatment is still unproven to be beneficial.

In this review, we assessed outcome for patients with ICA dissection in combination with intracranial vessel occlusion after use of endovascular treatment. We searched the available literature for cases describing patients with ICA dissection in combination with intracranial occlusion who received endovascular treatment and analysed clinical outcome and reperfusion rates.

### Diagnosis and management of acute conditions of the extracranial carotid artery [^111kJscp]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic carotid stenosis and carotid dissection are acute conditions of extracranial cerebrovascular vessels determining transient ischemic attack or stroke. Medical, surgical, or endovascular management are different options to treat these pathologies. This narrative review focused on the management, from symptoms to treatment, of the acute conditions of extracranial cerebrovascular vessels, including post-carotid revascularization stroke. Symptomatic carotid stenosis (> 50% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria) with transient ischemic attack or stroke benefits from carotid revascularization-primarily with carotid endarterectomy associated with medical therapy-within 2 weeks from symptom onset to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence. Different from acute extracranial carotid dissection, medical management with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy can prevent new neurologic ischemic events, considering stenting only in case of symptom recurrence. Stroke after carotid revascularization can be associated with the following etiologies: carotid manipulation, plaque fragmentation, or clamping ischemia. Medical or surgical management is therefore influenced by the cause and timing of the neurologic events after carotid revascularization. Acute conditions of the extracranial cerebrovascular vessels include a heterogeneous group of pathologies and correct management can reduce symptom recurrence substantially.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of carotid artery stenting for the treatment of cervical carotid artery dissection [^113z47q2]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of carotid artery stenting for the treatment of extracranial carotid artery dissection (CAD).

Data Sources

Systematic review using Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

Review Methods

A systematic search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis statement. Data from the eligible studies were extracted and meta-analysed. Primary endpoints included post-operative mortality, cerebrovascular events (CEs), and modified Rankin Score for neurological disability (mRS) at 90 days. Subgroup analyses were performed between stenting of spontaneous and traumatic CAD, primary stenting vs. stenting after failed medical therapy (FMT), and stenting of CAD in the presence of tandem occlusions vs. stenting of isolated extracranial CAD.

Results

Twenty-four studies with 1 224 patients were included. Pooled post-operative mortality, CE, and mRS 0–2 rates were 1.71% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83–2.80), 6.45% (95% CI 2.80–11.10), and 76.13% (95% CI 64.15–86.50), respectively. The pooled stroke rate was 2.16% (95% CI 0.0–6.64). Spontaneous vs. traumatic CAD mortality rates were 3.20% (95% CI 1.80–4.88) and 0.00% (95% CI 0.00–1.59) while CE rates were 14.26% (95% CI 6.28–24.36) and 1.64% (95% CI 0.0–6.08). Primary stenting and stenting after FMT mortality rates were 0.63% (95% CI 0.0–5.63) and 0.0% (95% CI 0.0–2.24), while CE rates were 5.02% (95% CI 0.38–12.63) and 3.33% (95% CI 0.12–9.03). Mortality rates for tandem occlusions and isolated extracranial CAD were 5.62% (95% CI 1.76–10.83) and 0.23% (95% CI 0.0–1.88), respectively, while CE rates were 15.28% (95% CI 6.23–26.64) and 1.88% (95% CI 0.23–4.51). The methodological index for non-randomised studies score was 8.66 (low).

Conclusion

Both primary stenting and stenting of spontaneous CAD yielded unfavourable results with respect to stent thrombosis and stroke rates. Conversely, stenting following FMT had acceptable mortality and complication rates corroborating the use of stenting in the setting of CAD as a second line treatment. Due to the low quality of the included studies, definite conclusions cannot be drawn necessitating further research.

### Antithrombotic treatment for cervical artery dissection: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^111tfvMH]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Cervical artery dissection is the most common cause of stroke in younger adults. To date, there is no conclusive evidence on which antithrombotic therapy should be used to treat patients.

Objective

To perform an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing anticoagulants and antiplatelets in prevention of stroke after cervical artery dissection.

Data Sources

PubMed.gov, Cochrane database, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to August 1, 2023.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that investigated the effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic treatment (antiplatelets vs anticoagulation) in patients with cervical artery dissection were included in the meta-analysis. The primary end point was required to include a composite of (1) any stroke, (2) death, or (3) major bleeding (extracranial or intracranial) at 90 days of follow-up.

Data Extraction/Synthesis

Two independent investigators performed a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and inconsistencies were resolved by a principal investigator.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of (1) ischemic stroke, (2) death, or (3) major bleeding (extracranial or intracranial) at 90 days of follow-up. The components of the composite outcome were also secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses based on baseline characteristics with a putative association with the outcome were performed. Logistic regression was performed using the maximum penalized likelihood method including interaction in the subgroup analyses.

Results

Two randomized clinical trials, Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study and Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study and the Biomarkers and Antithrombotic Treatment in Cervical Artery Dissection, were identified, of which all participants were eligible. A total of 444 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population and 370 patients were included in the per-protocol population. Baseline characteristics were balanced. There were fewer primary end points in those randomized to anticoagulation vs antiplatelet therapy (3 of 218 [1.4%] vs 10 of 226 [4.4%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.33 [95% CI, 0.08–1.05]; p = 0.06), but the finding was not statistically significant. In comparison with aspirin, anticoagulation was associated with fewer strokes (1 of 218 [0.5%] vs 10 of 226 [4.0%]; OR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.02–0.61]; p = 0.01) and more bleeding events (2 vs 0).

Conclusions and Relevance

This individual patient data meta-analysis of 2 currently available randomized clinical trial data found no significant difference between anticoagulants and antiplatelets in preventing early recurrent events.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111k7EHC]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Cervical artery dissection — antithrombotic selection and bleeding management states that radiographic high-risk features in patients with low bleeding risk may warrant anticoagulation therapy, whereas patients without such features or with elevated hemorrhagic risk may be better suited for antiplatelet therapy, with either antiplatelet monotherapy or a short course of dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 to 90 days if considered safe, followed by single antiplatelet therapy; if bleeding occurs, it is reasonable to hold antithrombotic treatment and weigh anticoagulation reversal against risks of recurrent stroke and worsening hemorrhage.

### Antiplatelets vs anticoagulation for dissection: CADISS nonrandomized arm and meta-analysis [^112tNKx2]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the results of the nonrandomized arm of the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS-NR) trial, comparing anticoagulation and antiplatelets for prevention of recurrent stroke after carotid and vertebral dissection, and perform a meta-analysis of these results with previously published studies comparing the 2 therapeutic strategies.

Methods

A total of 88 patients from 22 centers with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection were recruited within 1 month of symptom onset. The primary endpoint was recurrent stroke at 3 months. A systematic review was performed, and results of published studies included in a meta-analysis with the CADISS-NR results.

Results

In CADISS-NR, one patient in each group had recurrent ischemic stroke (antiplatelet 1/59 [1.69%], anticoagulation 1/28 [3.57%]). At the primary endpoint of 3 months, 3 (5.08%) antiplatelet patients had recurrent TIA, compared with none in the anticoagulation group. For meta-analysis, there were data from 40 nonrandomized studies including 1,636 patients. There was no significant difference between the 2 treatments in recurrent stroke risk (antiplatelet 13/499 [2.6%], anticoagulant 20/1,137 [1.8%], odds ratio [OR] 1.49) or risk of death (antiplatelet 5/499 [1.00%], anticoagulant 9/1,137 [0.80%], OR 1.27).

Conclusion

There is no evidence for superiority of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy in prevention of stoke after carotid and vertebral artery dissection; however, all data are from nonrandomized studies and randomized studies are required. The nonrandomized CADISS data show a lower rate of recurrent stroke than reported in some previous studies.

### Management of cervical artery dissection: new evidence and future directions [^116ei4Go]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical Artery Dissection (CeAD) is a leading cause of ischemic stroke in young adults, occurring at a mean age of 45 years. However, its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. CeAD is most commonly hypothesized to result from an interaction of individual (e.g. hereditary predisposition), and environmental factors (e.g. infection, trauma), connective tissue alterations, and comorbidities (such as migraine and hypertension). All of these factors are thought to contribute to arterial wall weakness or act as triggers, thereby increasing susceptibility to CeAD.

Fortunately, despite the limited understanding of its underlying mechanisms, knowledge of CeAD patient care has seen an incremental increase over the past two decades. This review highlights new evidence in the hyperacute and (sub-)acute treatment of CeAD. Additionally, it identifies gaps in current CeAD management that have hitherto been overlooked, such as the value of vascular risk factor treatment and the inclusion of mental health in long-term post-CeAD care. These areas represent key opportunities for future research and will be essential to improve patient-relevant CeAD outcomes.

### Carotid artery dissection and neurological complications after surgery for type 1 aortic dissection [^115oL9Sf]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the present study, the involvement of the carotid arteries by DeBakey type 1 aortic dissection increased the risks of major neurological complications and in-hospital mortality. However, such risks were limited to patients with bilateral dissection of the CCAs. The use of hypothermic circulatory arrest in these patients without cerebral malperfusion might have contributed to an increase in the rate of neurological complications. These findings suggest that surgical and perfusion strategies for aortic repair could be possibly tailored based on the status of the carotid arteries to reduce the very high rate of postoperative neurological complications in patients with DeBakey type 1 aortic dissection. The present findings should be considered hypothesis-generating and should be confirmed by further studies also evaluating the preoperative status of the subclavian arteries and vertebral arteries. Considering the relatively high prevalence and negative prognostic impact of CCA dissection in TAAD patients, the possible benefits and harms of concomitant surgical or endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection should be investigated.

### Endovascular reconstruction for progressively worsening carotid artery dissection [^1141d2iW]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Carotid artery dissection is an important cause of stroke in young patients. Selection criteria for endovascular repair have not been well defined and limited data exist on long-term outcomes of stent reconstruction.

Objective

To report the immediate and long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients treated with stent placement for progressively worsening symptomatic carotid arterial dissection despite antithrombotic therapy.

Methods

A single institution neuro-endovascular database was accessed to identify consecutive cases in which carotid artery dissection was treated with endovascular repair between 2006 and 2012. Clinical, demographic, radiographic, and procedural data were obtained through chart review.

Results

A total of 22 patients were identified and included 27 carotid artery dissection repairs with stent implantation. The mean age was 43years (± 8.7) with 13 patients being women. Traumatic dissections were seen in 9 (40.9%) patients and spontaneous dissections in 13 (59.1%) patients. All patients were symptomatic and were started on antithrombotic therapy on diagnosis. Most common indications for treatment included recurrent ischemia despite antithrombotic therapy in 15 (55.5%) arteries and enlarging dissecting aneurysm in 4 (14.8%) arteries. Mean degree of stenosis was 79.1%. Mean number of stents used was 1.88 (range 1–4). There was 1 (4.5%) asymptomatic peri-procedural thromboembolic event. Median clinical follow-up was 14months (range 3–40) and median imaging follow-up was 14months (range 3–38). There was 1 (4.5%) case of recurrent transient ischemic attack. There was no death, significant restenosis or stroke in the territory of the treated vessel during the duration of the follow-up.

Conclusions

Endovascular stent reconstruction for the treatment of selected patients with progressively worsening carotid dissection despite medical management is feasible with acceptable immediate and long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes. To be able to draw more robust conclusions, further evaluation with larger number of patients and longer follow-up is needed.

### Surgical treatment of localized dissection of the internal carotid artery [^115zz9Ui]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Dissection of the internal carotid artery is very rare; however, it is diagnosed more frequently with increasing radiographic diagnostic tools. Patients may be completely asymptomatic or may present with symptoms ranging between localized pain to severe cerebral ischemic events. Treatment is usually medical or with interventional radiographic tools. In this report, we present surgical management of internal carotid artery dissection in a 61-year-old female patient.
