## Question

Tmj with headaches and visual changes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders presenting with headaches and visual changes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of the triad and whether visual symptoms fit with TMJ pathology. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis, especially red flags that mandate urgent action. Next, I will outline a focused history and examination strategy, followed by a staged diagnostic workup including when to image and what labs to order. After that, I will consider management pathways for TMJ-related headache versus other etiologies, and finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of TMJ disorders coexisting with headache and visual symptoms. TMJ disorders commonly present with jaw pain, dysfunction, and referred headaches, and they frequently overlap with primary headaches such as tension-type and migraine, so the headache component is biologically plausible and well documented, whereas visual changes are not a typical TMJ manifestation and should prompt careful screening for secondary causes or concurrent primary headache disorders with aura or autonomic features [^94b32cd8] [^36645b06] [^22ff1b4b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to check the differential diagnosis systematically. Visual symptoms raise concern for migraine with aura, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, giant cell arteritis in older adults, and less commonly intracranial pathology or TMJ lesions with intracranial extension; TMJ disorders themselves can produce referred facial and temporal pain but do not directly cause visual loss, so visual complaints should trigger a parallel evaluation for these entities rather than attributing them to TMJ alone [^08ce5980] [^96eb5f22] [^efb8f38e] [^d99f3e28] [^c5cf0380].

> I will now examine the history elements that sharpen the differential. I should confirm the headache phenotype, including location, quality, duration, frequency, associated nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and autonomic features, and I should ask about jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms, and constitutional features to screen for giant cell arteritis, especially in patients over 50, because jaw claudication with new headache and visual symptoms is a red flag for GCA even with normal inflammatory markers early on [^36e6da87] [^d99f3e28] [^85372d98]. I need to check for transient visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus, and positional worsening to assess for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and I should review medication overuse and trauma history to avoid missing secondary causes [^efb8f38e] [^b6270bb6].

> Next, I should review the focused physical examination. For TMJ, I will inspect mandibular range of motion, listen for joint sounds, palpate the TMJ and masticatory muscles for tenderness, and assess for malocclusion or deviation, while remembering that crepitus and clicks can occur in asymptomatic individuals and are not diagnostic by themselves [^b7024e4c]. For the head and neck, I will palpate temporal arteries, assess cervical range of motion and tenderness, and perform a focused neurologic exam including cranial nerves, visual acuity, fields, and funduscopy to look for papilledema or optic disc pallor, because these findings redirect the workup toward GCA or IIH rather than isolated TMJ disease [^b6270bb6] [^efb8f38e].

> Let me think about the initial diagnostic workup and when to escalate. If the history and exam are classic for TMJ-related headache without red flags, I should proceed with conservative management and avoid immediate imaging; however, if there are visual symptoms, focal neurologic deficits, age over 50 with new headache, cancer or immunocompromise, thunderclap onset, or progressive worsening, I should obtain brain imaging and targeted labs per red flag algorithms [^81f89b23] [^19a6762e]. Wait, let me verify the imaging sequence: for sudden severe headache, CT head is first-line to exclude hemorrhage, with CTA if thunderclap persists beyond 6 hours; for suspected IIH, MRI/MRV is preferred; for suspected GCA, duplex ultrasound of temporal arteries and consideration of temporal artery biopsy are indicated even if ESR/CRP are normal early on [^19a6762e] [^efb8f38e] [^d99f3e28].

> I should double-check the laboratory strategy. Basic evaluation can include CBC, ESR, and CRP, recognizing that up to a minority of biopsy-proven GCA cases can have normal ESR/CRP early, so normal results do not exclude vasculitis when clinical suspicion is high; if IIH is suspected, I should consider lumbar puncture with opening pressure after neuroimaging excludes mass effect [^d99f3e28] [^85372d98] [^efb8f38e]. But wait, what if the visual symptoms are migrainous aura rather than structural disease? In that case, neuroimaging is not routinely required if the phenotype is classic and there are no atypical features or red flags, though I should remain vigilant for overlapping diagnoses [^notfound].

> Now, I will consider management if TMJ-related headache is most likely. Conservative therapy is first-line and includes patient education on parafunctional habits, soft diet, thermal modalities, NSAIDs, short-term muscle relaxants, cognitive behavioral strategies, and occlusal splints as indicated; most patients improve with these measures, and I should set expectations about symptom fluctuation and the need for multimodal care [^94b32cd8] [^44243b2c]. I need to ensure I address comorbid primary headaches because TMJ and headache disorders frequently coexist and can amplify each other; coordinating with a headache specialist can improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary dental or TMJ procedures [^36645b06] [^e47ffe16].

> If visual symptoms persist or worsen, I should verify that I am not missing a sight-threatening process. For suspected GCA, I should initiate high-dose glucocorticoids urgently while arranging temporal artery imaging and biopsy, because delays risk irreversible visual loss; for IIH, weight loss, acetazolamide, and close ophthalmologic monitoring are foundational; for migraine with aura, I should confirm the diagnosis with ICHD-3 criteria and initiate evidence-based migraine prevention and acute therapy while avoiding medication overuse [^d99f3e28] [^3d167724] [^08ce5980]. Hold on, I should verify that I have not overlooked a TMJ lesion with intracranial extension; if imaging shows a TMJ-origin lesion abutting the skull base, multidisciplinary surgical planning is essential to prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate interventions [^c5cf0380].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. If the patient has TMJ pain with a typical tension-type or migraine-pattern headache and no visual symptoms, I should treat conservatively and monitor; if visual symptoms are present, I should screen for red flags and, if any are present, obtain brain imaging and targeted labs urgently; if no red flags are present but visual symptoms are atypical or progressive, I should still consider MRI brain and MRV to exclude IIH or other secondary causes; if the patient is over 50 with new headache and any jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, or visual symptoms, I should treat suspected GCA emergently while confirming with ultrasound and biopsy [^81f89b23] [^d99f3e28] [^efb8f38e]. I should confirm that I revisit the diagnosis if symptoms fail to respond to appropriate therapy or if new red flags emerge, because early diagnostic closure can be dangerous in this space [^b6270bb6].

> Key takeaway, and I need to ensure I state this clearly: TMJ disorders commonly coexist with headaches, but visual changes are not a direct TMJ manifestation and should trigger evaluation for primary headache disorders with aura, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, giant cell arteritis, or intracranial pathology. A structured history, examination, and staged diagnostic approach with explicit red flag screening prevents delays in treating sight- or life-threatening conditions while allowing effective conservative management of TMJ-related pain [^36645b06] [^08ce5980] [^81f89b23] [^d99f3e28].

---

TMJ disorders can cause **headaches** (often temporal or periauricular) via trigeminal nociception and muscle tension, but **visual changes are not typical** and should prompt evaluation for other causes [^36645b06] [^94b32cd8]. Visual symptoms (blurred vision, diplopia, transient loss) suggest migraine with aura, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, giant cell arteritis, or intracranial pathology and require urgent assessment [^08ce5980] [^efb8f38e] [^d99f3e28]. TMJ-related headaches are diagnosed clinically and managed conservatively (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, bite guards, physical therapy) [^94b32cd8] [^44243b2c]; visual symptoms warrant neuro-ophthalmology or neurology referral and imaging (MRI/CT) to exclude serious disease [^81f89b23] [^19a6762e].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking TMJ disorders to headaches

TMJ disorders contribute to headaches through **shared trigeminal pathways** and muscle tension:

- **Trigeminal nerve involvement**: The TMJ is innervated by the trigeminal nerve, which also supplies the face, jaws, and head. TMJ inflammation or dysfunction can activate trigeminal nociceptive pathways, leading to referred pain in the temporal, frontal, or occipital regions [^36645b06].

- **Muscle tension and bruxism**: TMJ disorders often involve masticatory muscle hyperactivity (e.g. bruxism), causing muscle tension and spasms that can radiate to the head, producing tension-type headaches or exacerbating migraines [^b61f3f21].

- **Central sensitization**: Chronic TMJ pain can lead to central sensitization, lowering pain thresholds and amplifying headache perception [^9b23093c].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association between TMJ disorders and headaches

Multiple studies and reviews document a **strong association** between TMJ disorders and headaches:

- **Prevalence**: Headaches are reported in 60–80% of patients with TMJ disorders, with tension-type headaches being most common, followed by migraines [^notfound].

- **Bidirectional relationship**: Headaches, particularly migraines, increase the risk of developing TMJ disorders, and vice versa, indicating a reciprocal relationship [^e47ffe16].

- **Diagnostic criteria**: The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) recognizes "headache attributed to temporomandibular disorder", defined by pain in the temple area that varies with jaw movement or is provoked by temporalis palpation or jaw movement [^1ec2197a].

---

## Visual changes associated with TMJ disorders

Visual changes are **not a typical feature** of TMJ disorders; when present, they usually reflect coexisting conditions:

- **Migraine with aura**: Visual aura (scintillations, fortification spectra, transient visual loss) can accompany migraines, which may coexist with TMJ disorders [^08ce5980].

- **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)**: Headaches with visual obscurations, diplopia, or papilledema suggest IIH, a condition unrelated to TMJ pathology [^efb8f38e].

- **Giant cell arteritis (GCA)**: In patients over 50, new headaches with jaw claudication and visual symptoms (amaurosis fugax, diplopia) require urgent evaluation for GCA, a medical emergency [^d99f3e28].

- **Intracranial pathology**: Mass lesions or vascular anomalies can cause headaches and visual symptoms, necessitating neuroimaging when suspected [^81f89b23].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential to distinguish TMJ-related headaches from other causes:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history: headache characteristics, jaw symptoms, visual changes, systemic features, medication use [^1e87889a] |
| 2 | Physical examination: TMJ palpation, mandibular range of motion, masticatory muscle tenderness, cranial nerve exam [^b7024e4c] |
| 3 | Diagnostic criteria: Apply ICHD-3 criteria for TMJ-related headache; consider primary headache disorders (migraine, tension-type) [^1ec2197a] [^36e6da87] |
| 4 | Red flags: Identify visual symptoms, neurologic deficits, systemic signs, or age > 50 with new headache [^81f89b23] |
| 5 | Imaging: MRI or CT if red flags, atypical features, or refractory symptoms; consider MRI for suspected IIH or intracranial pathology [^81f89b23] [^efb8f38e] |
| 6 | Referral: Neuro-ophthalmology or neurology for visual symptoms or suspected secondary causes [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **TMJ-related headaches**: Conservative therapy is first-line, including NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, bite guards, physical therapy, and behavioral interventions (stress management, biofeedback) [^94b32cd8] [^44243b2c].

- **Migraine**: Acute treatment with triptans or NSAIDs, and preventive therapy (beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, CGRP inhibitors) as indicated [^92c55424].

- **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension**: Weight loss, acetazolamide, and serial lumbar punctures; neurosurgical intervention if refractory [^3d167724].

- **Giant cell arteritis**: High-dose corticosteroids initiated urgently to prevent vision loss, with temporal artery biopsy for confirmation [^d99f3e28].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

With appropriate management, TMJ-related headaches generally have a **favorable prognosis**, with symptom improvement or resolution in most patients [^00ca4d80]. Persistent or atypical symptoms warrant re-evaluation for alternative diagnoses or coexisting conditions [^b6270bb6].

---

TMJ disorders can cause headaches via trigeminal and muscular mechanisms, but **visual changes are not typical** and should trigger evaluation for migraine, IIH, GCA, or intracranial pathology. A structured diagnostic approach and targeted management — including conservative care for TMJ and urgent referral for visual symptoms — are essential for optimal outcomes.

After a thorough review of the history and presentation of a child's facial pain, a targeted head and neck examination is critical to the appropriate diagnosis of facial pain and temporomandibular joint disorders. It is critical to distinguish between the structural (trauma, degenerative disease, and tumor) and nonstructural (neurogenic, myogenic, and psychological) causes of pain, which will allow for incorporation of appropriate strategies of medical, psychological, dental, and surgical therapies.

### Temporomandibular joint syndrome from an ear versus dental-related standpoint [^00ca4d80]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a prominent reason for visits to medical providers. The presentation of headaches within this population remains a challenging diagnosis, given the prevalence and overlap of symptomatology of both conditions. The literature demonstrates an undeniable association between headaches and TMD. Regardless of causality and etiology, the literature supports that prompt diagnosis and treatment results in improvement or resolution of symptoms, including headaches. Treatment of TMD headaches should begin with conservative measures, including medical management with NSAIDs, heat therapy, and muscle-stretching exercises.

### Headache and facial pain: differential diagnosis and treatment [^1e87889a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Headaches affect 90% of the population sometime during their life. Most are benign and fleeting, some are serious and life-threatening, and others require ongoing medical consultation and treatment. A careful history and physical is necessary to establish a differential diagnosis and to guide the choice of testing to make an accurate diagnosis. The most common types of headaches are discussed in this review. They are divided into primary and secondary headache disorders as classified by the International Headache Society. Primary headache disorders include migraine without and with aura, cluster and tension-type headaches. Secondary headaches are those that occur as a result of some other disorder and include brain tumors, rhinosinusitis, diseases of intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and temporomandibular joint disease.

Diagnosis of concussion — the diagnosis is challenging and based on clinical assessment; it is complicated by a lack of validated, objective diagnostic tests, reliance on self-reported symptoms, and confounding symptoms from other conditions; nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, mood changes, "fogginess," dizziness, visual changes, fatigue, and neck pain may also originate from other etiologies; symptoms may be delayed or initially unrecognized, and concussion remains a clinical diagnosis made by synthesizing history and physical examination findings as the injury evolves.

### Sinus, disabling tension-type, and temporomandibular joint headaches [^713d4fb0]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinicians frequently face questions from headache patients regarding the roles played by sinus issues, muscle tension, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems. This review highlights new concepts regarding the diagnosis and management of these headache conditions and their differentiation from migraine.

Recent Findings

Recent research has clarified the roles played by pathology in the paranasal sinuses and TMJ in patients reporting headache. Additional information from physiologic studies in patients with tension-type headache (TTH) has improved the understanding of this condition.

Summary

Improved understanding of sinus headache, disabling TTH, and TMJ headache and their differentiation from migraine will lead to reductions in unnecessary diagnostic procedures and unwarranted medical and surgical procedures. More expedient recognition of the origin of headache should lead to improved therapeutic outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders [^94b32cd8]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a heterogeneous group of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions involving the temporomandibular joint complex, and surrounding musculature and osseous components. TMD affects up to 15% of adults, with a peak incidence at 20 to 40 years of age. TMD is classified as intra-articular or extra-articular. Common symptoms include jaw pain or dysfunction, earache, headache, and facial pain. The etiology of TMD is multifactorial and includes biologic, environmental, social, emotional, and cognitive triggers. Diagnosis is most often based on history and physical examination. Diagnostic imaging may be beneficial when malocclusion or intra-articular abnormalities are suspected. Most patients improve with a combination of noninvasive therapies, including patient education, self-care, cognitive behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and occlusal devices. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants are recommended initially, and benzodiazepines or antidepressants may be added for chronic cases. Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is indicated for refractory cases.

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^d99f3e28]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Jaw claudication predicts the likelihood of developing permanent visual loss. The combination of headache and jaw pain should always raise suspicion of GCA. Reassuringly, the incidence of visual symptoms and complications in patients with GCA has reduced in the last 50 years, and this may be in part due to greater clinician awareness, improved diagnostic methods and recognition of the need for prompt treatment.

Classically, ESR is a diagnostic indicator for GCA and a normal ESR reduces the likelihood of biopsy positive GCA. However, as in this case, elevated inflammatory markers may not always be present. Other cases report similar findings, with one case of a 73 year old with GCA, in whom ESR was only mildly elevated at 27 mm/hour. Similarly, a 74 year old with right-sided temporal headaches and initially normal inflammatory markers (CRP < 5 mg/L), re-presented 6 months later with scalp tenderness, jaw claudication and biopsy proven GCA. Another elderly woman who presented with headaches, visual symptoms and jaw claudication was found to have normal ESR and CRP on repeated occasions. Despite this, US and biopsy assessment revealed GCA. Rana et al also reported a case of delayed diagnosis of GCA. An 81-year-old woman was presented with chronic headaches and an unremarkable CT head. Subsequently, she also presented to ophthalmology with a history of jaw claudication and irreversible visual symptoms.

Classification and research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders

International classifications have been updated in recent decades, thus adapting to new clinical diagnoses and research. The etiology of TMD is multifactorial, which is due to related functional, structural, and psychological factors.–In regard to the clinical presentation of TMD, one of the most frequent symptoms is pain. Pain can affect such areas as ears, eyes, and/or throat, producing neck pain, facial pain, and headaches. Among the physical factors, inflammatory problems, such as traumatic secondary synovitis, infection, and irritation, can be found. TMD can also be associated with disk dysfunction, with or without reduction.

The Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) have been one of the most commonly used and recognized classifications by the international scientific community for diagnosis, evaluation, and categorization of TMD to date. Their importance is highlighted by the fact that they have been translated into various languages. The RDC/TMD are based on a biobehavioral model of pain, including two main axes: physical signs and symptoms (axis I) and psychological and disability factors (axis II). Included in axis I are painful myofascial disorders, disk subluxation, or luxation and arthritis or arthrosis, given painful myofascial disorders are included in the most frequent diagnoses observed in the literature. The most recent published version of this classification was in 2014, named Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD), and aimed to improve the sensibility and specificity of the previous RDC/TMD through more comprehensive instruments for axis I and axis II that can be used by researchers and clinicians.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^96eb5f22]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) migraine with aura — diagnosis requires at least 2 attacks fulfilling B and C; one or more fully reversible aura symptoms (visual, sensory, speech and/or language, motor, brainstem, or retinal); and at least 3 of 6 characteristics: at least 1 aura symptom spreads gradually over ≥ 5 minutes, two or more aura symptoms in succession, each individual aura symptom lasts 5–60 minutes, at least 1 aura symptom is unilateral, at least 1 aura symptom is positive, and the aura is accompanied, or followed within 60 minutes, by headache; not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Notes add that when 3 symptoms occur during an aura the acceptable maximal duration is 3 × 60 minutes and motor symptoms may last up to 72 hours.

### Clinical reasoning: a 62-year-old woman with transient vision loss [^426ffb70]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### The role of the otolaryngologist in the evaluation and management of headache [^941740ac]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Headaches are a global health problem and are encountered by a variety of specialties, including otolaryngologists. These patients can present as a challenge, but an understanding of primary and secondary headache disorders and the accompanying broad differential diagnosis is critical. For secondary headache disorders, a differential diagnosis categorized by anatomic location can help organize the evaluation of these patients, which can then be narrowed by the history and examination findings. Additional ancillary tests such as laboratories and imaging can further aid in diagnosis but are not always necessary.

### Temporomandibular dysfunction: an often overlooked cause of chronic headaches [^8fe82ef3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss the role of temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) as a cause of chronic headaches and facial pain.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A literature review was performed using the PubMed database for English-language articles published between January 1, 1981, and August 31, 2006, using the following keywords: temporomandibular dysfunction, temporomandibular disorder, temporomandibular joint, and chronic headache. Additional information was obtained from a review of current medical texts.

Results

Allergists and immunologists are frequently called on to evaluate patients with chronic headaches and facial pain. TMD is known to cause recurrent facial discomfort and headaches. Many individuals with the disorder present with headache or facial discomfort as their only chief complaint. They mistakenly think it is a "sinus" headache. Nearly 10 million Americans are affected by the disorder, and early studies estimate that TMD pain is the cause of chronic headaches in 14% to 26% of individuals with recurrent headaches.

Conclusions

TMD is a likely underdiagnosed cause of chronic headache and facial discomfort. As such, many patients with the disorder are routinely mislabeled as experiencing chronic sinusitis and are unnecessarily subjected to multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics and other unnecessary therapy. TMD can be readily diagnosed by a careful history and physical examination. Patients typically respond well to conservative therapy, which includes behavioral modification and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The disorder should be suspected in individuals with a long-standing history of chronic daily headaches and facial pain without objective evidence of sinus, neurologic, or intracranial abnormalities.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^0358d904]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

TMD

"TMD" defines a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the TMJ, and associated structures.TMD is considered to be a subclassification of musculoskeletal disordersand is the most prevalent condition for which patients seek treatment. The careful evaluation of these facial structures in conjunction with clinical symptoms is crucial in forming a proper differential diagnosis. The patient may present with jaw ache, earache, toothache, facial pain, and/or headache; however, the complaint may be as benign as general facial fullness or pressure. Treatment planning depend on various factors, including the chief complaint, medical history, presenting symptoms, examination, and diagnosis. In the past, TMD cases have sometimes been considered to be difficult to diagnose and problematic to treat; however, thanks to ongoing research in orofacial pain and pain management, clinicians are able to use a more standardized classification and better diagnostic and therapeutic methods to offer patients a wide range of treatment modalities with higher success rates.

Natural history and epidemiology of TMD

Most epidemiological studies clearly demonstrate that TMD symptoms are more commonly seen in women than in men, and that many symptoms seem to arise in adolescence or the early twenties and may continue intermittently, well into middle age; however, TMD symptomatology does get better with time, supporting a conservative management approach. In a study by Solberg et al,76% of subjects aged 18–25 years had one or more signs associated with TMD and 26% had at least one symptom associated with TMD. Of this group, only 10% had symptoms that were considered by the subjects to be severe enough to seek treatment. Rasmussenfound that most cases of a clicking TMJ did not evolve into an open or closed locking state. Rasmussen noted that, in the natural progression of internal derangement, acute TMD symptoms lasted a mean of 5.5 years and that, although joint noises generally did not disappear, most painful and disabling symptoms subsided in time. Similar results were shown by Könönen et al, who followed 128 Finnish adults over 9 years, in whom the incidence of clicking increased with age. None of the patients, however, developed locking. In a more recent study, the presence of degenerative joint disorders was found to be the discriminating factor in two different age subgroups: patients with a mean age range of 52 years presented a prevalence of crepitus, while patients with a mean age range of 38 years did not.

### Clinical reasoning: a teenager with right-sided headache and periorbital changes [^24677038]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

While migraine is the most common headache disorder in children and adolescents presenting to a neurologist, other primary headache disorders are important to recognize. Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias represent a rare group of primary headache disorders with different characteristics, workup, and management. In this study, we present an adolescent with 1 common and 1 unique headache phenotype, followed by a guided discussion of the differential diagnoses, workup, treatments, and a brief summary of further management considerations.

### Temporomandibular disorders and headache [^9b42570a]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and primary headaches can be perpetual and debilitating musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. The presence of both can affect up to one-sixth of the population at any one time. Initially, TMDs were thought to be predominantly musculoskeletal disorders, and migraine was thought to be solely a cerebrovascular disorder. The further understanding of their pathophysiology has helped to clarify their clinical presentation. This article focuses on the role of the trigeminal system in associating TMD and migraine. By discussing recent descriptions of prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of headache and TMD, we will further elucidate this relationship.

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^570c1a74]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

An 80-year-old man presented repeatedly to his general practitioner with 3 months of unexplained persistent frontal headaches. CT head revealed no diagnosis. His dentist diagnosed his co-existing jaw pain as bruxism. Three months later, the patient happened to attend a routine ophthalmology follow-up appointment. During this routine appointment, features of giant cell arteritis (GCA) including worrying visual complications were first noted. His inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were not significantly raised — contrary to the norm. A temporal artery ultrasound and biopsy were performed, in light of the history. This confirmed GCA. He was commenced on high-dose oral prednisolone and was managed by ophthalmology and rheumatology. At 4 weeks, symptoms resolved with no permanent visual loss despite a prolonged initial symptomatic period. Multiple symptomatic presentations to different specialties should therefore alert clinicians to a unifying diagnosis, for example, vasculitis. Serious illnesses may present with severe symptoms despite normal screening investigations.

### Red ear syndrome: perspectives for the otolaryngologist [^f6a059f1]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Red ear syndrome (RES) is an unusual, often unrecognized condition that has rarely been reported in the otolaryngology literature despite the presence of symptoms and associated disorders of relevance to the otolaryngologist. When present, RES may have diagnostic value when uncertainties arise in cases of sinus headache and referred otalgia. Despite the appearance of a distinctive red ear, as well as symptoms and associated disorders relating to otolaryngology, discussion of RES is generally limited to neurology-based publications. A red ear is typically the one constant finding in RES while clinical presentation, rate of occurrence, duration, manner of onset, and response to treatment vary on a case-by-case basis. RES may have value as a diagnostic tool in cases of sinus headache and referred otalgia. In recognizing that RES is commonly associated with migraine and not sinus-related headaches, the presence of RES could help confirm a diagnosis of migraine and remove sinus headache from consideration. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder and cervical pathology are commonly encountered in both RES and referred otalgia. When identifying the cause of referred otalgia proves problematic, the presence of RES should prompt the clinician to concentrate on either TMJ or cervical pathology as the more likely diagnostic possibilities.

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^d1463421]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

An 80-year-old man presented repeatedly to his general practitioner with 3months of unexplained persistent frontal headaches. CT head revealed no diagnosis. His dentist diagnosed his co-existing jaw pain as bruxism. Three months later, the patient happened to attend a routine ophthalmology follow-up appointment. During this routine appointment, features of giant cell arteritis (GCA) including worrying visual complications were first noted. His inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were not significantly raised-contrary to the norm. A temporal artery ultrasound and biopsy were performed, in light of the history. This confirmed GCA. He was commenced on high-dose oral prednisolone and was managed by ophthalmology and rheumatology. At 4weeks, symptoms resolved with no permanent visual loss despite a prolonged initial symptomatic period. Multiple symptomatic presentations to different specialties should therefore alert clinicians to a unifying diagnosis, for example, vasculitis. Serious illnesses may present with severe symptoms despite normal screening investigations.

### Application of ICHD-II criteria for headaches in a TMJ and orofacial pain clinic [^22ff1b4b]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to identify and diagnose headache in a temporomandibular joint and orofacial pain clinic population using the second edition of The International Classification of Headache Disorder criteria. In 502 temporomandibular disorder and orofacial pain patients, 246 patients (49%) were diagnosed with tension-type headache (TTH), followed by migraine without aura (14.5%), probable migraine (12.9%), migraine with aura (7%), probable TTH (4.8%) and cluster headache (0.2%). The prevalence of headaches was compared between male and female patients, and the prevalence of migraine was found to be higher in women than in men. In evaluating by age, the prevalence of migraine was highest in patients in their 20s and 30s and declined as age increased above 40. TTH showed the highest rate throughout all age groups, but it also decreased as age increased. In this study, the prevalence of migraine was lower than that reported in Dr Kim et al.'s study, and the prevalence of TTH much higher than that reported in the previous study. Of the headache patients, 81.1% presented with masseter muscle pain and 47.8% with temporal muscle pain. This finding suggests that pericranial muscle pain may be an inducing factor of primary headache.

### Hemicrania continua: clinical review, diagnosis and management [^327a3ea8]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

In Rossi et al's series, 32% patients with HC fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CH during the exacerbations. Differentiation of HC with PH or CH depends on two factors: 1) recognition of continuous background headache and 2) variable exacerbations. A few attacks in CH and PH patients may fall beyond the criteria prescribed by ICHD-3β for CH and PH. However, if a patient with CH or with PH has several attacks beyond the defined duration in the criteria, think about a possibility of HC.

On the contrary, if exacerbations are not severe or physicians focus only on continuous pain (ignoring exacerbation part), the differential diagnosis could be new daily persistent headache (NDPH), chronic tension-type headache (CTTH), atypical facial pain and various local pathologies. Side-locked NDPH with migrainous features may mimic HC. Approximately 11%–18% NDPH patients may be side locked. Up to one-third of patients with NDPH may have migrainous feature. Mild autonomic features have also been reported with NDPH. If patients remember the exact onset of their headaches (first day of continuous headache), a possibility of NDPH is likely. In doubtful cases, a trial of indomethacin can be given to find out HC.

Dental lesions, temporomandibular joint pathologies, sinus pathologies, neck pathologies and eye abnormalities may cause continuous pain in the trigeminal or surrounding distribution. All these structural pathologies are dealt with different experts of the medical field. Therefore, because of the wrong history or unawareness to HC, a diagnosis of secondary headaches may be made. The patients may be subjected to even interventional surgeries for the incidental or unrelated pathologies.

### Temporomandibular disorders: rapid evidence review [^44243b2c]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders affect between 5% and 12% of the population and present with symptoms such as headache, bruxism, pain at the temporomandibular joint, jaw popping or clicking, neck pain, tinnitus, dizziness, decreased hearing, and hyperacuity to sound. Common signs on physical examination include tenderness of the pterygoid muscles, temporomandibular joints, and temporalis muscles, and malocclusion of the jaw and crepitus. The diagnosis is based on history and physical examination; however, use of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended if the diagnosis is in doubt. Nonpharmacologic therapy includes patient education (e.g., good sleep hygiene, soft food diet), cognitive behavior therapy, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclobenzaprine, tricyclic antidepressants, and gabapentin. Injections of the temporomandibular joints with sodium hyaluronate, platelet-rich plasma, and dextrose prolotherapy may be considered, but the evidence of benefit is weak. A referral to oral and maxillofacial surgery is indicated for refractory cases.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders… [^b7024e4c]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Evaluation DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of TMD is based largely on history and physical examination findings. The symptoms of TMD are often associated with jaw movement and pain in the preauricular, masseter, or temple region. Another source of orofacial pain should be suspected if pain is not affected by jaw movement. Adventitious sounds of the jaw may occur with TMD, but also occur in up to 50% of asymptomatic patients. 1 A large retrospective study conducted by a single examiner over 25 years noted that the most common presenting signs and symptoms were facial pain, ear discomfort, headache, and jaw discomfort or dysfunction. 13 Other symptoms may include dizziness or neck, eye, arm, or back pain. Chronic TMD is defined by pain of more than three months' duration.

Physical examination findings that support the diagnosis of TMD may include — but are not limited to — abnormal mandibular movement, decreased range of motion, tenderness of masticatory muscles, pain with dynamic loading, signs of bruxism, and neck or shoulder muscle tenderness. Clinicians should assess for malocclusion, which can contribute to the manifestation of TMD. Cranial nerve abnormalities should not be attributed to TMD. Reproducible tenderness to palpation of the TMJ is suggestive of intra-articular derangement. Tenderness of the masseter, temporalis, and surrounding neck muscles may distinguish myalgia, myofascial trigger points, or referred pain syndrome. Deviation of the mandible toward the affected side during mouth opening may indicate anterior articular disk displacement.
15.

IMAGING Imaging can assist in the diagnosis of TMD when history and physical examination findings are equivocal. Computed tomography is superior to plain radiography for evaluation of subtle bony morphology. Magnetic resonance imaging is the optimal modality for comprehensive joint evaluation in patients with signs and symptoms of TMD. Although there is a 78% to 95% correlation between magnetic resonance imaging findings and joint morphology in symptomatic patients, 15, 19–21 false-positive findings occur in 20% to 34% of asymptomatic patients.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^36645b06]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Headache and TMD

It is known that headache and orofacial pain disorders, such as TMD, are highly prevalent conditions in the general population. Evidence suggests that a clinical comorbidity between primary headaches and TMD exists. Epidemiological studies have shown that TMD symptomatology is more common in patients with primary headaches such as migraine, episodic TTH, and chronic daily headache, where the prevalence of primary headache, particularly migraine, was increased in patients with TMD. In addition, patients with headache and orofacial pain disorders of musculoskeletal origin also present a higher disability impact. It can be hypothesized that extracranial trigeminal nociceptive inputs arising from the craniofacial structures as a result of a TMD may influence the activation of the trigeminovascular system, since these nociceptive inputs convey in TNC where intracranial inputs do. Existing TMD may, therefore, influence and/or exacerbate a headache disorder, and a headache disorder may exacerbate a TMD condition (Figure 4). It is very important, therefore, that, during treatment, such comorbidity is addressed. A relationship between the orofacial pain specialist and the neurologist (headache specialist) must be established, as management should be focused on addressing both, the headache and the TMD condition, since they considerably increase the prevalence of each other.

Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs)

Cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicranias, and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing are severe headaches that are not as common as migraine and that are characterized for their notorious parasympathetic autonomic symptoms. The typical localization of these headaches are the orbital, temporal or supraorbital regions but they can be present in the orofacial region such as in the mandible, TMJ, and dental areas. These headaches require neurological evaluation and management; therefore, it is of fundamental importance to make an appropriate differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary dental treatments or being misdiagnosed as other types of orofacial pains of non neurovascular etiology. Detailed reviews of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and their treatment can be found elsewhere.–

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^85372d98]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

This case provides a warning on how easily common presentations may be dismissed, and serious diagnoses delayed if a broad list of differentials including additional systemic involvement is not considered.

This case illustrates how unexplained persistent headaches should raise the index of suspicion of atypical causes such as vasculitis. A judgement on the likelihood of vasculitis can be made at the time of clinical review with focused questions. This patient visited three different health professionals before a correct diagnosis was reached. Piecing together different symptoms and a patient timeline could have led to an earlier diagnosis. Asking 'red flag' questions is paramount in ensuring serious conditions are not missed. This is particularly important in systemic diseases, as patients are not necessarily aware of which symptoms are relevant. Thus, they may not volunteer the relevant clinical information unless prompted. This last point enabled the ophthalmologist to consider giant cell arteritis (GCA) as a diagnosis.

We demonstrate that although investigation results may be characteristic, they cannot always be relied on to exclude systemic diseases. In this case, inflammatory markers were not significantly raised, an unusual but well-documented occurrence. This is supported by a study that identified 167 patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for GCA over a 48-year period. Of these patients, nine had a reported erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of less than 40 mm/hour. Six of the nine patients had an ESR of < 30 mm/hour. All nine of these patients had a positive temporal artery biopsy. History taking and clinical judgement should therefore always take precedence in forming a diagnosis, and diagnoses not to be ruled out on the basis of normal tests; an important message in today's investigation-driven medical practice.

In the case of GCA, important screening questions to consider should include: scalp tenderness, temporal headaches, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, polymyalgia and constitutional symptoms.

### Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) devices… [^ce386460]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders refer to an orofacial pain condition in which pain and discomfort affect the temporomandibular joint, the muscles, or the contiguous tissue components. Updates on TMD Devices The TMJ is the part of the lower jaw, in front of the ear where the lower jaw connects to the to the skull. There is a TMJ on each side of the jaw. The TMJ is composed of three parts.
- Mandibular condyle
- the part of the joint located in the lower jaw.
- Glenoid fossa
- the part of the joint located at the base of the skull.
- Meniscus
- a small disc-shaped piece of cartilage, which serves as a cushion between the mandibular condyle and glenoid fossa. For some patients, the pain in the TMJ is severe and unrelenting.

Symptoms can include clicking or popping of the TMJ, pain in or around the TMJ and muscles, locking or limited opening of the mouth, headaches, pain behind the eyes, dizziness, earaches or ringing in the ears, clenching or grinding of the teeth, neck, shoulder or back pain, and numbness or tingling of the fingers. Treatment Options TMD is a complex medical condition which can be difficult to treat. Non-surgical treatment options include:

- Behavioral changes
- Short term use of pain medication
- Devices that may help relieve pain, such as ice packs
- Bite guards
- Laser devices used to relieve muscle-related jaw pain. Surgical treatment options, which are more invasive, include: TMJ Implants TMJ implants are intended to be implanted in the jaw to replace all or part of the temporomandibular joint.

The purpose of these types of implants is to restore TMJ function, including opening and closing the mouth and chewing.

### Temporomandibular disorders: old ideas and new concepts [^9b23093c]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is an umbrella term for pain and dysfunction involving the masticatory muscles and the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). TMD is the most common orofacial pain condition. Its prominent features include regional pain in the face and preauricular area, limitations in jaw movement, and noise from the TMJs during jaw movements. TMD affects up to 15% of adults and 7% of adolescents. Chronic pain is the overwhelming reason that patients with TMD seek treatment. TMD can associate with impaired general health, depression, and other psychological disabilities, and may affect the quality of life of the patient. Assessment Evaluations indicate that the recently published Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) are reliable and valid. These criteria cover the most common types of TMD, which include pain-related disorders (e.g., myalgia, headache attributable to TMD, and arthralgia) as well as disorders associated with the TMJ (primarily disc displacements and degenerative disease). As peripheral mechanisms most likely play a role in the onset of TMD, a detailed muscle examination is recommended. The persistence of pain involves more central factors, such as sensitization of the supraspinal neurons and second-order neurons at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus, imbalanced antinociceptive activity, and strong genetic predisposition, which also is included in DC/TMD. Conclusion The etiology is complex and still not clearly understood, but several biological and psychosocial risk factors for TMD have been identified. Several studies indicate that patients with TMD improve with a combination of noninvasive therapies, including behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and occlusal appliances. More stringently designed studies, however, are needed to assess treatment efficacy and how to tailor treatment to the individual patient.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) clinical assessment — Diagnosis is based on both the clinical presentation and a detailed history and physical examination. Typical symptoms include neck stiffness; pain in the cervical, thoracic or lumbar vertebral area; subjective hearing symptoms; visual disturbances; and vertigo. Headaches are frequently reported after childbirth, but only a minority may be attributed to PDPH. Headache may be worse with coughing or a Valsalva maneuver, and visual disturbances may be associated with cranial nerve palsy, with the abducens and facial nerve most affected, typically accompanied with diplopia and facial weakness.

Clues from the history

Headaches are common and can be highly variable (see later). They may be of new onset or more chronic, particularly in those with previous migraine. Visual symptoms include blurred or double vision. Patients can describe transient loss of vision and/or 'greying out' of vision: so-called 'transient visual obscurations'. They usually relate to postural changes; and are usually brief, typically only seconds. Patients may report horizontal diplopia from a false-localising abducens nerve palsy. There may be pulsatile tinnitus — a rhythmic 'whooshing' sound heard in either or both ears synchronous with the patient's heartbeat, and often present only on lying down. Many patients do not volunteer this symptom unless directly asked.

### Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) lesions with intracranial extension: illustrative cases from a systematic review of the literature and our institution [^c5cf0380]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intracranially extending temporomandibular joint (TMJ) lesions may be radiologically misinterpreted as primary intracranial or skull base pathologies, leading to diagnostic delays or inappropriate management.

Purpose

This systematic review aimed to characterize the clinical and imaging features of such TMJ lesions and evaluate the impact of radiologic misclassification. We also aimed to develop a diagnostic framework for when to consider an intracranially extending TMJ lesion, based on clinical and radiologic features.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Embase, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, yielded 2,255 records.

Study Selection

After screening with a pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 128 studies involving 152 patients were included in the final analysis.

Data Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software. We also identified 3 patient cases through our institutional neuroradiology practice who were clinically and radiologically assessed for intracranially extending TMJ lesions.

Data Synthesis

Patients had symptoms for an average of 34 months prior to diagnosis (47% female, mean age 50 years). The most common pathologies were pigmented villonodular synovitis/tenosynovial giant cell tumor (43%) and synovial chondromatosis (24%). Neurological symptoms were reported in 48% of cases, most frequently hearing loss (70%). Nearly one-third (33%) of cases with an imaging differential did not list a TMJ pathology (18/55). In cases with accurate imaging diagnosis, 90% had both CT and MRI performed. Most lesions were non-enhancing (CT 83%, MRI 75%) and demonstrated no adjacent brain edema (96%). In two cases, a TMJ ganglion cyst and pseudogout were misdiagnosed as intracranial tumors, resulting in unnecessary intervention, including repeat craniotomy and radiotherapy.

Limitations

Inherent biases of case report literature, including variability in the reporting of the imaging and clinical features, management and follow-up.

Conclusions

TMJ lesions with intracranial extension often present with non-specific symptoms and can mimic extra-axial tumors, leading to misdiagnosis on imaging. Recognition of hallmark imaging features, including lack of parenchymal invasion and distinct imaging patterns, may help improve radiologic accuracy and prevent overtreatment. We propose a diagnostic framework outlining when to suspect intracranially extending TMJ lesions based on clinical and imaging features, and how to avoid common diagnostic pitfalls.

### A review of current perspectives on facial presentations of primary headaches [^d5695ba8]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

According to ICHD-3, the primary headaches consist of migraines, tension-type headaches, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) and a mixed group termed other primary headaches disorders (Table 1). Each of these groups is subdivided into separate entities if relevant and subsequently into temporally dependent subgroups defined by the frequency of attacks. A primary headache is a disorder, not caused by or attributed to another disorder. This is in sharp contrast to a secondary headache which is caused by another underlying disorder. Thus, in theory, and often in practice, a headache may have the characteristics of a primary headache, but a causative disorder is detected. Therefore, it would be diagnosed as a secondary headache.

Table 1
Classification of Primary Headache Disorders Based on the ICHD-3*

Relative to headache, the prevalence of facial pain is much lower, with an incidence rate of 38.7 per 100,000 person-years. The anatomical definition of headache (V1) vs facial pain (V2, V3) is clear and seems internationally accepted. However, the clinical borders between headache and facial pain are often blurred, questioning the exact prevalence of each discrete disorder. Migraine pain may extend to V2, sometimes even to the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve. Even rarer, some patients experience facial migraine – defined as attacks fulfilling the criteria for migraine located exclusively in the V2/V3 dermatomes. In these patients, the atypical (V2 or V3) location of a "headache" may lead to misdiagnosis or unnecessary treatment. On the other hand, myofascial pain in a temporomandibular disorder is considered to be the most common cause of chronic facial pain, featured by ongoing pain that can be reproduced by pressure over at least the masseter and temporalis muscle. Pain in the temporalis muscle is clearly a "headache" and pain in the masseter a "facial pain". Is myofascial pain then a head or facial pain?

ASCO guideline — Polymyalgia-like syndrome with ICPI therapy: Workup includes "Complete rheumatologic history regarding differential diagnosis and examination of all joints and skin," screen for "symptoms of temporal arteritis, such as headache, visual disturbances, or jaw claudication," and arrange "Urgent referral to ophthalmologist if present and consider temporal artery biopsy as permanent visual loss can occur within days of symptom onset;" obtain "ANA, RF, and anti-CCP," "CK," and "Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)," with "Monitoring: ESR and CRP." For G1 mild stiffness and pain — "Continue ICPI" and "Initiate analgesia with acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs if there are no contraindications." For G2 moderate stiffness and pain limiting instrumental ADL — "Consider holding ICPI and resuming upon symptom control, prednisone < 10 mg;" "Initiate prednisone 20 mg/d or equivalent," taper "after 3–4 weeks" if improved, and "If no improvement or need for higher dosages after 4 weeks, escalate to G3," with rheumatology referral. For G3–4 severe stiffness and pain limiting self-care ADL — "Hold ICPI and may resume, in consultation with rheumatology, if recover to ≤ G2," refer to rheumatology, and "Should initiate prednisone 40 mg/d or equivalent;" if insufficient response or prolonged higher dosing, "may offer a steroid sparing agent such as synthetic drugs (eg, methotrexate) or biologic agents (eg, IL-6 antagonists)," noting "IL-6 inhibition can cause intestinal perforation" and "it should not be used in patients with immune-related colitis," and "Consider admission of patients with severe symptoms." Additional considerations state "IL-6 antagonists may be the preferred steroid-sparing agents for management of polymyalgia-like syndrome as they are already approved for use in patients with GCA."

### Condylar resorption of the temporomandibular joint: how do we treat it? [^cb8f579f]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Condylar resorption (CR) is a common sequela of some temporomandibular joint (TMJ) abnormalities. CR can result in jaw deformities and dysfunction, malocclusion, pain, headaches, and airway obstruction. Most cases can be classified into 1 of 4 categories based on cause: (1) adolescent internal CR; (2) reactive (inflammatory) arthritis; (3) autoimmune and connective tissue diseases; and (4) other end-stage TMJ pathologic abnormality. MRI is helpful in differentiating the cause and defining treatment options. This article presents the nature and progression of the different TMJ CR pathologic abnormalities, clinical and imaging characteristics, and treatment options to produce predictable and stable outcomes.

### The association between specific oral behaviors and the number of temporomandibular disorder symptoms in the general population: a cross-sectional study [^b61f3f21]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) contain a series of conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the masticatory muscles and associated hard and soft tissues. TMD is reported as the second most common musculoskeletal disorder causing pain and disability, impacting approximately 7–23% of the population.TMD symptoms are more prevalent in females and tend to peak between the aged of 20 to 40 years. Common symptoms of TMD encompass orofacial pain in the facial and periauricular areas, temporal headaches, TMJ noises, jaw opening and closed locking. As one of the most common symptoms and major initial manifestations of TMD in clinical practice, painful symptoms are generally characterized by discomfort in the joint and masticatory muscles, impairing the life quality.TMD-related pain radiates intermittently or chronically into surrounding regions and is usually accompanied by other TMD symptoms. The etiology of TMD is multifactorial, encompassing biophysical, psychological, and social environment factors. Biophysical factors are mainly ascribed to dysfunction or structural lesions of the intra-joints and related tissues. The secretion of inflammatory factors in the peripheral joint, secondary to excessive mechanical force, exacerbates progression of TMD. In addition, psychosocial factors such as anxiety, depression, and other emotional states have long been a hot topic in TMD research. It's widely accepted that TMD symptoms, especially orofacial pain and headaches, are strongly correlated with negative psychological conditions, including depression, stress and anxiety. Moreover, pain intensity and duration were positively correlated with stress scores in cross-section research. Various prospective studies have reported that psychological conditions are risk factors for the onset and perpetuation of TMDs as well. Some scholars categorize temporomandibular disorders (TMD) into two main types: pain-related TMDs, which include conditions like joint pain or headaches, and intra-articular TMDs, which involve symptoms such as joint sounds or limited mouth opening. In addition, patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) may experience symptoms that overlap with other chronic pain conditions, such as headaches, fibromyalgia, and neurological disorders. This is likely attributed to central sensitization, particularly manifesting as allodynia and hyperalgesia.

### Hemicrania continua: case series presenting in an orofacial pain clinic [^5afea1c8]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Aim Of Investigation

Hemicrania continua (HC) is an uncommon primary headache and little is known of the characteristics of such patients managed in an orofacial pain setting. This study provides clinical features of HC, its association with other disorders, and treatment outcomes of patients managed in the TMD and Orofacial Pain Clinic at the University of Minnesota.

Methods

A retrospective review of patient records was undertaken. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of HC and confirmation at follow-up.

Results

Six of the 1617 new patients seen between 2015 and 2017 met the selection criteria. Four patients presented with "facial pain", one with "toothache" and one with "jaw pain". All were female with mean age 55 ± 10.5 years (range = 41–69). Headache characteristics included unilateral (R:L = 1:1) pain of moderate intensity with severe exacerbations in the distribution of V 1 (1/6), V 1 +V 2 (3/6) and V 1 +V 2 +V 3 (2/6). Lacrimation and photophobia were the most common associated symptoms. Patient presentations were complicated by multiple medical and comorbid diagnoses. All were diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Indomethacin alone was sufficient for adequate headache control in 2/6 patients with several add-on medications providing sustained pain relief.

Conclusions

Comorbid pain conditions can be expected in patients with HC presenting to orofacial pain clinics. Symptom presentation varies, and multimodal treatment approach is necessary for success.

### Ganglion cyst of the temporomandibular joint mimicking auriculotemporal neuralgia [^49bdfc9b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Ganglion cysts within the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), although uncommon, typically present with swelling, pain, trismus, and difficulty with mastication. The authors report an unusual case of a ganglion cyst in the TMJ of a 52-year-old man who presented with chief complaints of severe headaches and dizziness that had not subsided following treatment with medication, trigger point injections, or sphenopalatine ganglion blocks. The cyst appeared as a nonenhancing, T2 hyperdensity adjacent to the left TMJ condyle on magnetic resonance imaging, supported by the presence of chronic erosion and remodeling of the anterior aspect of the left condylar head on computed tomography. The cyst was surgically removed, and the patient reported that the migraines and accompanying dizziness had ceased 6 months postoperatively. The patient's presentation and improvement following surgery suggest that the location of the cyst in the TMJ and its proximity to the course of the auriculotemporal nerve may have caused auriculotemporal neuralgia, mimicking the symptoms of migraine.

### Neurovascular pains: implications of migraine for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon [^290659ce]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic studies have shown that migraine headaches are a common finding in the general population, often associated with a high degree of disability. Additionally, migraine has a reported comorbidity with other medical conditions, most notably with chronic pains, such as temporomandibular disorders. The pathophysiologic mechanisms involved with migraine are suggestive of an increased and prolonged hyperexcitability to stimuli, especially within the trigeminal distribution. Because migraine is mediated by branches of the trigeminal nerve it has the potential to mimic other types of pains, such as toothache or sinusitis. It is therefore recommended that oral and maxillofacial surgeons be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for migraine headaches to identify and appropriately treat such individuals who present to their clinics.

### Orofacial pain in juvenile idiopathic arthritis is associated with stress as well as psychosocial and functional limitations [^6f550012]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Why orofacial pain in the JIA patients?

Less than half of the JIA patients, reported orofacial pain. Among these, pain in the masticatory muscles, including headache attributed to TMD, was more common than TMJ arthralgia. Only two of the healthy individuals reported orofacial pain.

A difficult question to answer is to what extent the orofacial pain is related to the JIA disease, or due to other factors, like masticatory muscle hypertension. JIA is a systemic inflammatory condition that not always will result in TMJ inflammatory activity, causing signs and symptoms from the jaw system. A common feature of JIA, and most rheumatologically disorders, is that pain, when present, is rarely limited to the joint(s) but is also located in the surrounding musculoskeletal system. This is most likely due to sensitization, peripheral and central, of the joints and adjacent areas and contributes to pain, including orofacial pain.

The incidence of TMD pain in the general population has been found to rapidly increase from the age of 13–14 years in girls. TMD pain is uncommon before the age of 13. Most of the patients included in our study population were younger than 13–14 years, why the likely cause of the orofacial pain may be JIA. However, many children, particularly girls, develop other chronic pains that orofacial pains before the age of 13.

TMJ arthritis

JIA can cause TMJ arthritis and arthritis may cause pain, cartilage and bone tissue destruction and growth inhibition. There are no established diagnostic criteria for TMJ arthritis in JIA and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is usually considered as the gold standard for assessing TMJ arthritis. The classical criteria for inflammation (swelling, redness, pain, warmth, loss of function) are not applicable regarding the TMJ since these are rare events in TMJ arthritis compared to other peripheral joints. Of these signs, TMJ pain is most common but still not common in JIA. The aim of this study did not include assessment of TMJ arthritis per se, but rather description and analysis of clinical and psychosocial factors related to JIA and orofacial pain. There is, however, an urgent need to develop clinical criteria to enable early identification of JIA patients with established or a risk for TMJ arthritis.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 36-year-old man who sought evaluation for a persistent headache and numbness on the cheek. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Prevalence of clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities at diagnosis of acromegaly: a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines [^1807dc58]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

While oral changes (macroglossia, jaw enlargement with increased tooth gap and denture size) were common in acromegaly at time of diagnosis, these were not often presenting complaints. The same accounts for erectile dysfunction, which were the presenting complaint that led to follow-up in about 6% of patients, while they were reported in one out of five men at time of diagnosis. Conversely, menstrual disorders appeared to be the (early) presenting complaint quite frequently, accounting for almost one in ten patients, while the prevalence of these disorders was estimated to be 16% at time of diagnosis. Headaches, due to GH hypersecretion and/or local tumor effects (also including visual defect) were highly prevalent at time of diagnosis and also the presenting complaint in about one third of the acromegaly patients. We further found that papillary thyroid cancer frequently led to the diagnosis of acromegaly, but this was based on only one small study including thirteen elderly acromegaly patients aged between 65 and 78 years. Besides typical physical features, local tumor effects, menstrual disorders and galactorrhea, hypertension, carpal tunnel syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and hyperhidrosis, most of the presenting symptoms or comorbidities were only mentioned in one or two studies. Tseng et al. also reported among those who presented with a specific symptom, sign or comorbidity, this feature eventually led to the diagnosis of acromegaly. Highest were: facial changes (99%), growth of hands and feet (98%), osteoarthritis (89%), sweaty and oily skin (86%), skin thickening (84%), deepening of the voice (82%), headache (80%), arthralgia (77%), excessive sweating (76%) and visual loss (76%). They also compared the age at the onset of features, and top 5 early symptoms were: galactorrhea (33 ± 9 years), amenorrhea (34 ± 10 years), sweaty and oily skin (37 ± 12 years), weight gain (38 ± 11 years) and headache (38 ± 12 years); while late symptoms or comorbidities were: carpal tunnel syndrome (42 ± 11 years), depressive syndrome (42 ± 14 years), arthralgia (43 ± 12 years), osteoarthritis (44 ± 11 years) and sleep apnea (45 ± 12 years). Our subanalysis also showed that the prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome was higher in older versus recent studies (25% versus 7%), which might reflect a more extensive clinical presentation due to more diagnostic delay, whilst differences in prevalence of the other mentioned late symptoms and comorbidities (depressive syndrome, arthralgia and sleep apnea) between the two groups were lacking. Shortening of diagnostic delay may also have led to the found decreased prevalence of various cardiovascular comorbidities in more recent versus older studies. Another explanation could be the general improvement of cardiovascular care over the last decades.

### Temporal change in headache and its contribution to the risk of developing first-onset temporomandibular disorder in the orofacial pain: prospective evaluation and risk assessment (OPPERA) study [^e47ffe16]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

While cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an association between headache and temporomandibular disorder (TMD), whether headache can predict the onset of TMD is unknown. The aims of this study were to evaluate the contribution of headache to the risk of developing TMD and describe patterns of change in headache types over time. An initially TMD-free cohort of 2410 persons with low frequency of headache completed quarterly questionnaires assessing TMD and headache symptoms over a median 3.0-year follow-up period. First-onset TMD was confirmed by clinical examination in 199 participants. Baseline reports of migraine (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–2.62) or mixed headache types (HR = 4.11, 95% CI: 1.47–11.46), or headache frequency (HR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.31–3.48) predicted increased risk of developing TMD. In addition, headache dynamics across the follow-up period before the TMD onset were evaluated in a nested case-control study where 248 incident TMD cases were matched to 191 TMD-free controls. Both headache prevalence and frequency increased across the observation period among those who developed TMD but not among controls. Patients with TMD were more likely to experience worsening in the headache type compared with that by controls, eg, prevalence of definite migraine among TMD cases increased 10-fold. Among all headache types experienced by patients with TMD before the TMD onset, migraine had the highest odds of progression relative to remission (odds ratio = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.6–4.8), whereas for controls this ratio was significant only for the tension-type headache (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2–3.9). The important clinical implication of these findings is that adequate treatment of migraine may reduce the risk for developing TMD.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^3d167724]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

How do we treat case 1 with mild optic nerve oedema, normal visual function and headaches?

Start by asking permission to talk about body weight. Explain the condition and association of body weight change and IIH. Then recommending weight reduction (5–15% of current weight as discussed above), and agree how that could be achieved. In addition conservative treatment for headaches may be best, the headaches have only been present for 8 weeks and they may settle once the ICP settles. Advice regarding the use of simple analgesics to treat headaches should be given and highlight that taking too many pain killers could lead to medication overuse headache.

In Case 1 with mild optic nerve oedema and normal visual function the joint decision was made to start a weight management programme with a nutritionist, increase physical activity and monitor the clinical signs and symptoms. Should the person have an increase of weight, or escalating symptoms, they should be instructed to contact the clinic for advice.

### Diagnostic criteria for headache attributed to temporomandibular disorders [^1ec2197a]. Cephalalgia (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

We assessed and compared the diagnostic accuracy of two sets of diagnostic criteria for headache secondary to temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

Methods

In 373 headache subjects with TMD, a TMD headache reference standard was defined as: self-reported temple headache, consensus diagnosis of painful TMD and replication of the temple headache using TMD-based provocation tests. Revised diagnostic criteria for Headache attributed to TMD were selected using the RPART (recursive partitioning and regression trees) procedure, and refined in half of the data set. Using the remaining half of the data, the diagnostic accuracy of the revised criteria was compared to that of the International Headache Society's International Classification of Headache Diseases (ICHD)-II criteria A to C for Headache or facial pain attributed to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder.

Results

Relative to the TMD headache reference standard, ICHD-II criteria showed sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 33%. The revised criteria for Headache attributed to TMD had sensitivity of 89% with improved specificity of 87% (p < 0.001). These criteria are (1) temple area headache that is changed with jaw movement, function or parafunction and (2) provocation of that headache by temporalis muscle palpation or jaw movement.

Conclusion

Having significantly better specificity than the ICHD-II criteria A to C, the revised criteria are recommended to diagnose headache secondary to TMD.

### Are headache and temporomandibular disorders related? A blinded study [^5f56be2e]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

To investigate overlaps between headache and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in a clinical headache population and to describe the prevalence of TMD in headache patients, 99 patients referred to a specialized headache centre were diagnosed according to Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) and classified in headache groups according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, second edition for headache diagnoses in a blinded design. The prevalence of TMD in the headache population was 56.1%. Psychosocial dysfunction caused by TMD pain was observed in 40.4%. No significant differences in TMD prevalence were revealed between headache groups, although TMD prevalence tended to be higher in patients with combined migraine and tension-type headache. Moderate to severe depression was experienced by 54.5% of patients. Patients with coexistent TMD had a significantly higher prevalence of depression-most markedly in patients with combined migraine and tension-type headache. Our studies indicate that a high proportion of headache patients have significant disability because of ongoing chronic TMD pain. The trend to a higher prevalence of TMD in patients with combined migraine and tension-type headache suggests that this could be a risk factor for TMD development. A need for screening procedures and treatment strategies concerning depression in headache patients with coexistent TMD is underlined by the overrepresentation of depression in this group. Our findings emphasize the importance of examination of the masticatory system in headache sufferers and underline the necessity of a multidimensional approach in chronic headache patients.

### Sinus headache: differential diagnosis and an evidence-based approach [^77b96192]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis "sinus headache" has been reclassified as "headache attributed to disorder of the nose or paranasal sinuses" by the International Headache Society, but the term is still commonly used by patients and primary care doctors alike. Rhinologic symptoms and headache disorders are common, and they may coexist without a causative relationship. Patients may undergo unnecessary medical interventions because of inadequate understanding of the classifications and management of various headache disorders. Otolaryngologists frequently treat patients with these complaints, and a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis and utilization of a multidisciplinary approach are critical in providing optimal patient care.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the temporomandibular joint in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^47c81251]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

For more than a century, it has been known that juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) can affect the temporomandibular joint. With advances in medical imaging in more recent decades, there has been an increase in awareness of the spectrum of pathology that can affect the temporomandibular joint in children with JIA. This pathology can lead to symptoms ranging from decreased chewing ability, jaw and facial pain, headaches and malocclusion to craniofacial morphological changes such as a retrognathic mandible. The purpose of this review is to suggest an MR imaging protocol for the temporomandibular joint and to illustrate normal and abnormal appearances of the joint in children with JIA.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^d2b7c5f6]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

The ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria outline the cardinal features of the TN phenotype. However, the clinician's appreciation of the detailed phenotype aids the diagnostic process particularly with regard to alerting to atypical features that warrant consideration of other diagnosis or further investigations.

Laterality and site of pain

The right side of the face (60%) is affected more than the left side. Bilateral simultaneous pain in TN is rare (1.7%–5%) and more often these patients experience side-alternating unilateral pain paroxysms. In view of its rarity, bilateral simultaneous or side-alternating trigeminal paroxysmal pains should raise concern about an underlying neurological disorder or a non-neurological disorder affecting the cranium. It therefore warrants careful exclusion of secondary pathology. If investigations are normal, then idiopathic cases of constant or long-lasting bilateral trigeminal pain include: temporomandibular joints dysfunction, persistent idiopathic facial pain and rarely migraine with facial pain. In cases with paroxysmal short-lasting pain episodes, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias such as short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNHA) should be considered if pain is associated with cranial autonomic symptoms or idiopathic stabbing headache if the pain is predominantly in the ophthalmic (V1) trigeminal distribution.

The pain of TN most frequently affects the distribution of the maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions of the trigeminal nerve, though approximately a quarter of the cases have ophthalmic (V1) division involvement.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^92c55424]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^810d4d0e]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Orofacial pain disorders

Orofacial pain disorders are highly prevalent and debilitating conditions involving the head, face, and neck. These conditions represent a challenge to the clinician since the orofacial region is complex and therefore, pain can arise from many sources. The clinician needs to have solid knowledge of the pain conditions that arise from these structures for proper diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach of management is strongly recommended.

The orofacial pain classification as outlined by Okeson, is divided into physical (Axis 1) and psychological (Axis 2) conditions. Physical conditions comprise temporomandibular disorders (TMD), which include disorders of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and disorders of the musculoskeletal structures (eg, masticatory muscles and cervical spine); neuropathic pains, which include episodic (eg, trigeminal neuralgia [TN]) and continuous (eg, peripheral/centralized mediated) pains and neurovascular disorders (eg, migraine). Psychological conditions include mood and anxiety disorders. This review focuses on the current perspectives in orofacial pain management, and only TMD, neuropathic pains, and headaches will be discussed. For a more comprehensive discussion about pathophysiology and diagnosis of the disorders depicted in this classification and other painful disorders arising from the head, face, and neck, other texts should be reviewed.

### Aura in trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia is probably mediated by comorbid migraine with aura [^2f265617]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Aura and association with headaches

Among the 17 TAC patients with aura, aura was always (100%) associated with headache attacks in four, in another two never (0%) associated with headache, whereas 13 patients reported the presence of aura in 5–80% headache attacks. Aura developed before the headache attacks in six, during the headache attacks in eight, and with a variable temporal relationship in three. Of the 17 patients, visual aura was present in 12 (70.6%), sensory aura in five (29.4%), and motor (5.9%) or aphasic aura in one (5.9%), respectively. Of note, one patient had three different types of auras (visual, aphasic, and sensory). Thirteen of the 17 patients had an aura that lasted 5–60 min, whereas the other four patients had aura length longer than 60 min (68 min, 90 min, 150 min, 180 min, respectively). Notably, 16 from 17 patients had a side-locked aura, only one with an aura that shifted side.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^49190297]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The finding in this series that headache was the most common presenting symptom occurring in 78% (25/32) is similar to other studies which report its presence in over 60% of patients at disease onset. Headache in Susac syndrome can be indistinguishable from migraine which explains why migraine was a common initial diagnosis in our study and why patients with headache and visual disturbance had a longer time to diagnosis than other presentations. It is argued that Susac syndrome should be considered in any patient with new onset migraine with visual symptoms and an MRI brain showing white matter lesions involving the corpus callosum, or if associated with diffusion‐weighted imaging change and/or gadolinium enhancement. It is advocated that these patients also have an ocular review and audiology specifically to exclude Susac syndrome or another BEE syndrome.

Previous reports suggest that 40% of patients have auditory and/or visual disturbance at presentation. In this series 63% (20/32) had vestibulocochlear disturbance and 38% (12/32) visual disturbance at presentation. Patients with visual disturbance at presentation had a longer delay in time to diagnosis than those with vestibulocochlear presentations (5.25 vs. 3 months). Vestibulocochlear symptoms were common at presentation yet were only fully investigated with quantitative neuro‐otology testing at presentation in 30% of patients (6/20). SNHL in Susac syndrome can be acute or subacute, unilateral or bilateral, simultaneous or sequential in nature, and typically affects low‐ to mid‐frequencies. A potential diagnostic dilemma is the commonly encountered overlap of vestibular migraine and Ménière's disease, particularly in young females, which also presents with headache, vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss. It is suggested that, in addition to MRI of the internal acoustic canals to exclude a retrocochlear lesion in any patient who presents with headache, vertigo and documented low‐ to mid‐frequency asymmetric SNHL, a full MRI of the brain should also be obtained concurrently with a view to excluding Susac syndrome. Visual symptoms were investigated with FFA in only 42% (5/12) of patients at presentation. Furthermore, one of the five patients who underwent FFA had the FFA inaccurately reported at the time of presentation, leading to a 1‐month delay in diagnosis.

### Aura in trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia is probably mediated by comorbid migraine with aura [^6b663f92]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Certain limitations must be addressed: i) this study is conducted in a tertiary medical center; the patient population may deviate from the community-based population. Indeed, the clinical setting and patient recruitment may be a major confounding factor explaining the discrepancy of aura presence between different studies. The generalizability of the results must therefore be prudent; ii) the differentiation between typical visual aura and other transient visual phenomena may sometimes be blurred. Some questionnaires may help to validate an aura from other visual phenomena but remain rarely used in clinical routine. Therefore, the diagnosis of "aura" depends on the clinicians' judgment, and this may be another factor in the inter-study differences. In our study, the diagnosis of TAC and aura were made by headache specialists with more than 10 years of experience; iii) even though we enrolled nearly five hundred patients with TAC, the events number of auras remained low. This study hence lacks the statistical power to inform on the differences (if any) between different forms of TAC diagnoses (e.g. CH vs. HC); iv) a second type of headache (e.g. milder migraine without aura) may sometimes be obscured by the prominent features of TAC and hence underestimated. Nonetheless, there is no evidence to suggest that such "potential" underestimation differs in TAC patients with vs. without aura. The odds ratio (migraine without aura in TAC patients with aura/migraine without aura in TAC patients without aura) should therefore remain unchanged.

### Neck pain: revision 2017 [^68da5a37]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck pain — Component 2 classification (impairment patterns and re-evaluation): Differential evaluation of musculoskeletal clinical findings is used to determine the most relevant physical impairments associated with the patient's reported activity limitations and medical diagnosis, and for neck pain are classified according to the key impairment(s) of body function, along with the characteristic and distribution of pain associated with that classification. For neck-related headaches, clinicians are encouraged to refer to the International Classification of Headache Disorders for a more inclusive list of headache types/classifications and to The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for additional signs, symptoms, and conditions that should be considered in patients who present with a headache in addition to neck pain. Overall, classification is critical for matching the intervention strategy that is most likely to provide the optimal outcome for a patient's condition, but patients with neck pain often exhibit signs and symptoms that fit more than 1 classification, and the most relevant impairments of body function and the associated intervention strategies often change during the patient's episode of care; thus, continual re-evaluation of the patient's response to treatment and the patient's emerging clinical findings is important for providing the optimal interventions throughout the patient's episode of care.

### Unusual visual symptoms in a patient with bilateral vertebral artery dissection: a case report [^b7399e73]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We present a previously unreported set of symptoms in a patient found to have bilateral vertebral dissections. Although visual symptoms are common in vertebral dissection, their pattern does not typically mimic those that commonly precede or accompany migraine headache. When they do occur, they usually take the form of diplopia or blurred vision. The patient we describe had visual symptoms that varied over three episodes of headache and included transient visual field loss and scintillations ("lightning bolts"), both common in migraine. However, our patient's new visual symptoms represented a change in pattern from those that had accompanied her previous migraines. This detailed history-taking prompted an evaluation for an etiology other than migraine and prevented a further delay in diagnosis and treatment.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^b4ff4bea]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Some of the most prevalent and debilitating pain conditions arise from the structures innervated by the trigeminal system (head, face, masticatory musculature, temporomandibular joint and associated structures). Orofacial pain (OFP) can arise from different regions and etiologies. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are the most prevalent orofacial pain conditions for which patients seek treatment. Temporomandibular disorders include a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or both. Trigeminal neuropathic pain conditions can arise from injury secondary to dental procedures, infection, neoplasias, or disease or dysfunction of the peripheral and/or central nervous system. Neurovascular disorders, such as primary headaches, can present as chronic orofacial pain, such as in the case of facial migraine, where the pain is localized in the second and third division of the trigeminal nerve. Together, these disorders of the trigeminal system impact the quality of life of the sufferer dramatically. A multidisciplinary pain management approach should be considered for the optimal treatment of orofacial pain disorders including both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities.

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^6c95807c]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 80-year-old man with a medical history of glaucoma, hypertension and first degree heart block presented with a 3-month history of frontal headaches. A routine CT head was requested by his general practitioner (GP). This showed no intracranial masses or bony lesions but incidentally revealed a mature lacunar infarct of the left ventral thalamus. There was no radiographic cause determined for his headaches.

Alongside his headaches, the patient developed bilateral jaw pain with claudication. He independently sought advice from his dentist and returned with a diagnosis of bruxism.

Three days after the CT scan (3 months after initial presentation to healthcare), the patient visited ophthalmology for a routine glaucoma follow-up appointment. The ophthalmologist elicited episodes of diplopia, amaurosis fugax and significant weight loss in the preceding months. There was no history of scalp tenderness, fever or proximal muscle pain and stiffness. Examination revealed bilateral tender, nodular and weakly pulsatile temporal arteries. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect or anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.

In light of the ongoing headaches, jaw claudication, diplopia, amaurosis fugax and weight loss, a diagnosis of GCA was suspected. The patient was referred the same day to the rheumatology department for prompt review.

### Interpretable machine learning integrates multi-source biomarkers for osteoarthritis diagnosis and mechanistic insights: a temporomandibular joint model [^da0a65b1]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a pan-joint degenerative disorder characterized by cartilage degradation and subchondral bone remodeling. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) offers a unique model for early OA due to its anatomy and early-onset disease. Current diagnostics rely on late-stage changes, underscoring the need for biomarker integration. We hypothesized that machine learning (ML) combining imaging, molecular, and clinical data would improve diagnostic accuracy, and that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) would clarify key predictors and interactions, enhancing mechanistic understanding of disease heterogeneity.

Design

A case-control study of 162 participants (81 TMJ OA and 81 age- and sex-matched controls) integrated clinical, high-resolution imaging (radiomics, trabecular architecture, joint space), and systemic/articular biomarkers (serum and saliva). Seventy-seven ML combinations were evaluated via nested 10-fold cross-validation.

Results

The final ensemble model achieved strong diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.828, 95% CI: 0.757–0.892). SHAP analysis revealed top predictors such as headache severity, trabecular thickening, restless sleep, muscle soreness, limited mouth opening and joint space narrowing. Mechanistic interactions captured early inflammatory, structural, and neurovascular changes, including radiomics-cartilage degradation links (e.g., condyle grey level nonuniformity with saliva CXCL-16), clinical-molecular associations (e.g., headaches with saliva VE-cadherin), and subchondral microstructure correlations (e.g., grey level nonuniformity with run length nonuniformity).

Conclusions

This study presents a clinically useful, explainable AI model for OA diagnosis. Key predictors and cross-domain interactions improved accuracy and clarified early disease mechanisms. Although cross-validation minimized overfitting risk, external validation is needed. These findings support biomarker-driven precision diagnostics and highlight multi-tissue predictors as potential targets for early OA intervention.

Barany diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine (VM) state that diagnosis requires "At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours," plus a "Current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)," and "One or more migraine features with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes" (headache with "at least two of the following characteristics: one sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity," "photophobia and phonophobia," or "visual aura"), and episodes "Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis." Probable vestibular migraine requires "At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours," but with "Only one of the criteria B and C for vestibular migraine is fulfilled (migraine history or migraine features during the episode)" and also "Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis." Qualifying vestibular symptoms include "Spontaneous vertigo including: o Internal vertigo, a false sensation of self-motion, and o External vertigo, a false sensation that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing," "Position vertigo, occurring after a change in head position," "Visually-induced vertigo, triggered by a complex or large moving visual stimulus," "Head motion-induced vertigo, occurring during head motion," and "Head motion-induced dizziness with nausea"; severity is "moderate" when they "interfere with but do not prohibit daily activities" and "severe" if "daily activities cannot be continued." Visual auras "typically expand over 5–20 minutes and last for less than 60 minutes."

### Upper respiratory tract and orofacial manifestations of new-onset giant cell arteritis: results from a large, prospective inception cohort study [^a6b38b8b]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) often features upper respiratory tract (URT) and orofacial manifestations, which signal the involvement of external carotid artery branches. In this study, we aimed to describe the frequency of various URT/orofacial symptoms at GCA onset, as well as the main characteristics of patients presenting these symptoms.

Methods

We included all patients who were newly diagnosed with GCA between 1976 and April 2022 at the Internal Medicine Department of a tertiary-care hospital. Ten URT or orofacial symptoms were prospectively examined systematically in each patient. We used multivariate analyses to identify the GCA characteristics, including URT/orofacial symptoms, associated with temporal artery biopsy (TAB) positivity.

Results

At least 1 URT/orofacial symptom was present in 68.6% of the 599 patients (3 or more symptoms in 30% of cases). Jaw claudication, maxillary pain, and pain during mouth opening were the most prevalent symptoms. Dry cough was recorded in 17% of cases. GCA patients with URT/orofacial symptoms had more clinical abnormalities of the temporal artery bed and ischaemic ophthalmological complications, but less large-vessel vasculitis according to imaging. The likelihood of a positive TAB was increased in patients with an abnormal temporal artery upon clinical examination (OR 4.16; CI 2.75–6.37, p < 0.001) or jaw claudication (OR 2.18; CI 1.35–3.65, p = 0.002), and decreased in those with hoarseness (OR 0.47; CI 0.26–0.87, p = 0.02) or earache (OR 0.54; CI 0.31–0.95, p = 0.03). Isolated URT/orofacial presentation (i.e., without headache or visual signs) accounted for 5.2% of the entire cohort.

Conclusions

Oral-facial symptoms were present in two-thirds of GCS cases. Thus, they could serve as leading clinical clues for a GCA diagnosis, and are a risk factor for permanent visual loss. Several URT/orofacial symptoms such as jaw claudication, hoarseness, and earache influenced the likelihood of a positive TAB. Isolated URT/orofacial presentation of GCA is a rare but potentially challenging occurrence.

### Muscle pain in the head: overlap between temporomandibular disorders and tension-type headaches [^bdd98833]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A variety of painful problems can affect the muscles in the head and face. Both temporomandibular disorders and tension-type headaches are believed to have a significant contribution from the skeletal muscles and have several clinical features in common. It still unclear, however, to what extent these two prevalent disorders are separate entities or have similar pathophysiological background.

Recent Findings

There is now reasonably good evidence that myofascial temporomandibular disorder patients are more likely to have a tension-type headache problem and vice versa, but the overlap is not complete. Studies have documented similarities regarding sensitization of the nociceptive pathways, dysfunction of the endogenous pain modulatory systems as well as contributing genetic factors, but there are also a number of distinct differences between temporomandibular disorders and tension-type headaches that need to be considered.

Summary

Using the current classification systems, myofascial temporomandibular disorder pain and tension-type headache disorders do overlap and appear to share many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms, but it would be premature to consider them as identical entities since the importance of, for example, the affected muscles and associated function and genetic background needs to be established. Orofacial pain and headache specialists should collaborate to further develop diagnostic procedures and management strategies of temporomandibular disorders and tension-type headaches.

### Classification and differential diagnosis of oral and maxillofacial pain [^99adab02]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pain in the orofacial region is a common presenting symptom. The majority of symptoms are related to dental disease and the cause can readily be established, the problem dealt with, and the pain eliminated. However, pain may persist and defy attempts at treatment. Intractable oral or facial pain can be diagnostically challenging. To make a definitive diagnosis and initiate proper treatment, a rigorous protocol for evaluation includes a thorough history and an appropriate comprehensive clinical examination and diagnostic testing, including chief complaint, history of present illness, medical history, physical examination, diagnostic studies, including imaging, and psychosocial evaluation.

### Migraine and tension-type headache: an assessment of challenges in diagnosis [^89acff2c]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The difficulty in distinguishing episodic tension-type headache from migraine headache is widely acknowledged. The misdiagnosis of migraine as tension-type headache has potentially significant consequences because it may preclude patients with disabling headaches from receiving appropriate treatment. This article explores the symptomatologic, epidemiologic, and pathophysiologic relationships among migraine and tension-type headaches with the aim of elucidating ways to improve their diagnosis and treatment. Clinical, epidemiologic, and pharmacologic data converge to suggest that rigid adherence to the IHS criteria in diagnosing migraine and tension-type headache may result in misdiagnosis of some headaches. Many migraine attacks are accompanied by tension headache-like symptoms, such as neck pain. Conversely, IHS-defined tension-type headaches are often accompanied by migraine-like symptoms, such as photophobia or phonophobia and aggravation by activity. The health-care provider caring for patients with headache should be cognizant of these overlaps and their implications for the management of patients with headache.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) research priorities emphasize that the efficacy of new drugs and, in particular, surgical interventions, needs to be determined in well- designed RCTs, and that randomized treatment allocation and independent outcome assessment would go a long way to establish the efficacy of the surgical techniques. Surgical comparison is proposed to be answered with a prospective study comparing long- term outcomes in patients with TN undergoing microvascular decompression with and without neurovascular contact identified on preoperative high-resolution MRI. The optimal timing of surgical referral remains a crucial question, including the clinical uncertainties "How many different drugs should be tried before referring a patient for surgery?" and "What is the likelihood that a patient with TN failing OXC or CBZ will respond to alternative drugs?", which could be answered by a large prospective cohort survey of patients with TN treated in a standardized, stepwise fashion.

Primary headache phenotypes — tension-type headache (TTH), migraine, and cluster — are differentiated by associated features and diagnostic criteria. For TTH, photophobia/phonophobia can be limited to "one but not both," nausea/vomiting are absent, and autonomic features are none; diagnosis requires "at least 10 headache episodes lasting 30 minutes to 7 days" with specified characteristics, and if all but one criterion are met the diagnosis would be probable TTH. For migraine, photophobia and phonophobia are both present, nausea/vomiting may be either or both, autonomic features might occur but are often subtle, and diagnosis requires "at least five headache episodes lasting 4–72 hours" with required features; if all but one criterion are met the diagnosis would be probable migraine. For cluster headache, photophobia/phonophobia are variably present, nausea/vomiting might be present, and prominent ipsilateral autonomic features occur; diagnosis requires "at least five headache episodes" of severe unilateral orbital/supraorbital/temporal pain "lasting 15–180 minutes" and occurring "once every other day to more than eight times a day," and "either or both autonomic features and a feeling of restlessness or agitation are required." Autonomic features include "nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or both; periorbital edema; miosis, ptosis, or both; conjunctival injection, lacrimation, or both." The guideline notes, "The Work Group suggests that providers should not withhold therapy when patients do not meet all criteria" and that "Providers should continually reassess patients during therapy."

Baseline Clinical Features

Visual manifestations, which are the main object of the present study, are described in detail below, whereas the main clinical features of our GCA patients at the time of diagnosis are summarized, for the sake of brevity, in Figure 1 and Table 1. Fever, defined as a body temperature ≥ 38°C, was recorded in 41%, and constitutional symptoms including weakness, fatigue, and anorexia, were described by 82%, followed in terms of decreasing frequency by tenderness to palpation of the temporal artery (77%), headache of new onset localized in the temporal region or more rarely in the occipital area (75%), jaw claudication (55%), tongue pain during mastication (23%), and scalp tenderness (28%) that resulted in large eschars in one male patient (Figure 2). However, 3 of the 56 patients had either no or only vague general symptoms and were diagnosed with occult GCAbased on an ophthalmologic examination, performed to determine the cause of visual disturbances, and a positive temporal artery biopsy (TAB).

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^3345f048]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

### MRI thresholds for discrimination between normal and mild temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^85a48924]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Quantitative signal to noise ratios of the degree of temporomandibular joint synovial and condylar marrow enhancement using static MRI in the coronal plane generate thresholds and tendencies and offer an additional tool in conjunction with subjective visual assessment to aid in the diagnosis of mild active temporomandibular joint involvement. Such quantitative measures may also allow us to more accurately compare imaging findings to assess responses to treatments and help us to direct further interventions, as needed, for children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In addition, osteochondral changes and synovial thickening may not be reliable indicators of active disease and should be differentiated from synovial enhancement, as discussed in previous literature, when evaluating for active TMJ involvement in JIA patients to determine the need for treatment. This re-iterates the importance of accurately distinguishing TMJs with mild synovial enhancement from those without.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^c1ed37d5]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Headache

Another source of nonodontogenic toothaches and orofacial pains may present as a disturbance of the trigeminovascular system. Migraine is commonly thought of as a headache that is unilateral and that causes pain behind the eye, neck, and cranium; however, migraine headaches can also present in the lower part of the face, particularly in the teeth.–It is very important that the orofacial pain clinician is aware of the possibility of this localization in addition to the clinical features that a migraine presents to avoid misdiagnosis as an odontogenic toothache or other type of orofacial pain, leading to improper management.

Primary headaches, such as migraine and TTH, are also disorders mediated by the trigeminal system that can be chronic and disabling, affecting over 15% of the US population at any one time and costing the US economy over $19.6 billion a year. Migraine is a primary disorder of the brain explained as a neurovascular disorder in which neural events result in meningeal blood vessel dilation, which results in further nociceptive activation of the trigeminovascular system. The pathophysiology of migraine is still not completely understood, but it is known that key anatomical peripheral and central structures are involved. The trigeminovascular system consists of the dura mater that surrounds the meninges and spinal cord, the dural meningeal blood vessels (cranial vasculature), and the innervations of these structures provided by the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve and its afferent connection to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in the central nervous system, in addition to a reflex connection from the trigeminal nucleus to the parasympathetic outflow to the cranial vasculature through the superior salivatory nucleus.

Diagnostic imaging is sometimes necessary to supplement the clinical findings in patients with suspected temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). However, the interpretation of pathology in the imaging findings is often complicated by the presence of similar findings in asymptomatic volunteers, as well as by the use of inadequate imaging techniques and poor image quality. This article focuses on these issues and gives guidance on the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging in patients with suspected TMD.

### Are signs of temporomandibular disorders stable and predictable in adolescents with headache? [^2977b541]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to study changes in signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and factors predicting TMD signs in adolescents with and without headache. A population-based sample (n = 212) of 13-year-olds with and without headache was re-examined at the age of 16. The study included a questionnaire, face-to-face interview and somatic examination. In addition, a neurological examination, a muscle evaluation and a stomatognathic examination were performed. Significant changes were seen in TMD signs during the follow-up, but TMD signs at the end of the follow-up could not be predicted by baseline headache, sleeping difficulties, depression or muscle pain. TMD signs at the age of 16 were associated with female gender and muscle pain. We conclude that considerable changes in TMD signs occur in the follow-up of adolescents with and without headache. Headache-related TMD are not predictable in adolescents with and without headache.

1 Introduction

Migraine is a disease affecting approximately one billion people worldwide that presents as a significant public health burden. This type of primary episodic headache is characterised by recurrent episodes of severe throbbing pain, most commonly affecting only one side of the head and often aggravated by habitual physical activity. In addition to pain, patients often experience hypersensitivity to light and noise, as well as vegetative symptoms such as nausea or vomiting.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified migraine as one of the most disabling disorders in the human population, with approximately 80% of patients having experienced some degree of headache‐related disability. From an epidemiological perspective, according to the survey conducted by the Global Burden of Disease research group, migraine has an estimated global prevalence of 14.7%, making it one of the most common neurovascular disorders worldwide. Migraine can be divided into two distinct types: migraine without aura and migraine with aura. Aura refers to transient visual, sensory, or language neurological symptoms that may precede or accompany the headache. It is categorised as chronic migraine (CM) when the headache occurs for ≥ 15 days per month for more than 3 months, with at least 8 days meeting migraine criteria. CM is a phenomenon in which headache frequency gradually increases over months or even years and affects approximately 2.5% of individuals with migraine annually.

Although migraine is not life‐threatening, it is the sixth leading cause of disability, as measured by Disability‐Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Significantly, it ranks as the second leading cause of DALYs in women.

Multiple risk factors have been identified that may be associated with CM, including overuse of medications for acute migraine treatment, lack of efficacy of acute therapies, presence of obesity, manifestation of depressive symptoms, lower educational levels, and exposure to stressful life events. Despite this phenomenon, the exact mechanisms leading to migraine pathogenesis have yet to be fully determined. It has been hypothesised that cortical spreading depression (CSD) and neuroinflammation via the trigeminal vascular pathway activate various inflammatory mediators, thus triggering the onset of migraine. Recent research suggests a multifactorial model for the development of migraines; at the systemic level, it has been linked to hormonal changes (such as pregnancy) and endocrine‐metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity, all of which involve changes in cortisol and the regulation of important neurotransmitters such as serotonin.
