## Question

Txa factor 11 deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how tranexamic acid (TXA) is used in Factor XI (FXI) deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying whether the question refers to congenital FXI deficiency versus the new class of FXI inhibitors used as anticoagulants. Then, I should review bleeding phenotype and predictors of risk in FXI deficiency. Next, I will outline hemostatic options, starting with antifibrinolytics like TXA, followed by plasma replacement and when FXI concentrates or rFVIIa are considered. After that, I need to check perioperative and obstetric considerations, monitoring, and inhibitor development. Finally, I will consider thrombosis trade-offs and summarize a practical approach, keeping safety front and center.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scope. The shorthand "TXA factor 11 deficiency" most plausibly refers to managing congenital FXI deficiency and when to use tranexamic acid, not to bleeding management on therapeutic FXI(a) inhibitors, which are investigational anticoagulants; distinguishing these is essential because the latter scenario follows a "bypass plus antifibrinolytic" paradigm derived from FXI deficiency but is not identical to congenital care [^114VJ6fG] [^112wRGQv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should review the bleeding phenotype. FXI deficiency usually causes provoked bleeding after trauma or procedures, especially in tissues with high fibrinolytic activity like the oral, nasal, and genitourinary tracts, and there is a poor correlation between FXI activity level and bleeding severity, so history trumps the number when planning prophylaxis; the disorder is rare overall but more prevalent in Ashkenazi populations [^112kNTNz] [^115iaCpB] [^116DwLE8] [^117Lybco].

> I need to ensure my risk stratification is evidence-based. Personal bleeding history is the strongest predictor of perioperative or obstetric bleeding; higher FXI levels may be associated with lower risk, but no reliable cutoff rules bleeding out, which means individualized planning around the procedure type and fibrinolytic burden is required rather than a rigid level-based algorithm [^115W6paB] [^116DwLE8].

> Next, I should review the place of TXA. Antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid are first-line in FXI deficiency for mucosal bleeding and low-to-moderate risk procedures, and they are often sufficient alone for dental and ENT work; pediatric surgical series also show good outcomes when TXA is used, frequently obviating the need for plasma replacement in lower-risk settings [^112kNTNz] [^112rDSsB].

> Wait, let me verify replacement options for higher-risk scenarios. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) remains the most widely available replacement to raise FXI perioperatively, though the volume load is a limitation; perioperative case reports describe administration of several units pre- and intraoperatively with uneventful courses when combined with local measures and antifibrinolytics, underscoring feasibility when concentrates are unavailable [^1142A1UH] [^112mfSX5] [^1115GiCY].

> I should confirm the role and risks of FXI concentrates. Plasma-derived FXI concentrates can be effective but carry a nontrivial risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation and are not available in the United States; when they are used elsewhere, the thrombotic risk must be weighed carefully against procedure-specific bleeding risk, and alternatives should be preferred when reasonable [^112kNTNz] [^1142A1UH].

> Let me consider bypass strategies if replacement is contraindicated or unavailable. Low-dose recombinant activated factor VII can be used as an adjunct in high-fibrinolytic procedures or when FXI concentrates are avoided, and it is part of the proposed strategy for patients with FXI inhibitors or those on FXI(a) inhibitor therapy who bleed, typically together with antifibrinolytics rather than FXI replacement [^112kNTNz] [^114VJ6fG].

> But wait, what if repeated plasma exposure becomes necessary in severe deficiency. I should double-check inhibitor risk. In patients with very low FXI levels, repeated plasma exposure can rarely provoke alloantibody development against FXI, particularly in specific genotypes, which then necessitates a bypass plus antifibrinolytic approach and careful hematology follow-up [^115MWYiD].

> Next, I should review obstetric and neuraxial anesthesia considerations. Personal bleeding history drives management in pregnancy and delivery; TXA and careful local hemostasis are central, and large obstetric cohorts suggest neuraxial anesthesia can be performed safely with appropriate assessment and planning, without routine FXI replacement solely for the epidural unless other risk factors are present [^115W6paB] [^111n6hvK] [^115iaCpB].

> I will now examine the thrombotic backdrop and anticoagulation interactions. FXI deficiency is associated with lower rates of VTE and ischemic stroke at the population level, but it does not clearly protect against myocardial infarction, and limited observational data suggest that standard anticoagulation can often be administered without excess major bleeding in FXI deficiency, though individualized assessment is prudent [^114YPw1k] [^117822Uq] [^116edDJF] [^116fKBsP].

> Let me verify the practical perioperative workflow. Preoperatively, confirm FXI activity and review detailed bleeding history; if levels are low and the history suggests bleeding with prior challenges or the upcoming procedure is high-fibrinolytic, plan TXA with or without FFP depending on risk, monitor aPTT and FXI activity where feasible, and re-assess intraoperatively for additional support, recognizing that a prolonged aPTT merits targeted investigation and should not be ignored when unexplained [^1115GiCY] [^113Uiqqi].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought desmopressin might be a routine adjunct as in von Willebrand disease, but let me reconsider because contemporary reviews emphasize antifibrinolytics, FFP, and selective use of FXI concentrates or rFVIIa rather than desmopressin as standard therapy in FXI deficiency, so DDAVP would not be first-line here [^112kNTNz] [^111X2S1h].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the plan matches procedure risk and patient phenotype: use TXA alone for low-risk mucosal procedures, add FFP for higher-risk or high-fibrinolytic surgeries, avoid FXI concentrates when possible due to thrombosis risk and unavailability in some regions, consider rFVIIa when replacement is contraindicated or inhibitors emerge, and anchor decisions in personal bleeding history rather than FXI level alone while maintaining vigilant monitoring and multidisciplinary planning for obstetric and perioperative care [^112kNTNz] [^116DwLE8] [^115W6paB] [^1142A1UH].

Factor XI deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with **unpredictable bleeding** [^115iaCpB] that correlates poorly with FXI levels, and **spontaneous bleeding is rare** [^112kNTNz]; bleeding typically occurs after trauma or surgery, especially in tissues with high fibrinolytic activity [^115iaCpB]. Diagnosis relies on **prolonged APTT** with normal PT/TT and reduced FXI activity [^115iaCpB], confirmed by genetic testing [^1146DQqq]; **management is individualized**, using antifibrinolytics for minor procedures and FFP or FXI concentrate for major surgery [^112kNTNz], with rFVIIa [^114VJ6fG] as an alternative when needed [^112kNTNz]. FXI deficiency is associated with a lower risk of thrombotic events [^114YPw1k], and FXI inhibitors are being developed as safer anticoagulants [^112wRGQv] [^112SvBML].

---

## Genetic basis and inheritance

Factor XI deficiency follows an **autosomal recessive inheritance** pattern and is more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews due to founder mutations [^115iaCpB] [^1146DQqq]. The F11 gene on chromosome 4q35 encodes FXI, with more than 190 mutations — missense, nonsense, insertions/deletions, and splice-site changes — identified [^1146DQqq]. In Ashkenazi Jews, the Glu117Stop and Phe283Leu variants are particularly prevalent [^1146DQqq].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Bleeding phenotype**: Unpredictable and variable, with poor correlation to FXI levels [^115W6paB] [^111diNG9].
- **Common bleeding sites**: Oral cavity, nasal passages, urinary tract, and postpartum hemorrhage [^115iaCpB].
- **Spontaneous bleeding**: Rare, even in severe deficiency [^115MLGjg].
- **Bleeding triggers**: Trauma, surgery, dental procedures, and childbirth [^115iaCpB].

---

## Laboratory diagnosis

- **Screening test**: Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) with normal prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) [^115iaCpB].
- **Confirmatory test**: Reduced FXI activity (FXI:C) measured by specific coagulation assays [^112kNTNz].
- **Genetic testing**: Identifies causative mutations in the F11 gene [^1146DQqq].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

- **Individualized management**: Based on bleeding history, FXI levels, and planned procedures [^116DwLE8].
- **Antifibrinolytics**: Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for minor procedures or mucosal bleeding [^112kNTNz].
- **Replacement therapy**: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or FXI concentrate for major surgery or significant bleeding [^112kNTNz] [^1142A1UH].
- **Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa)**: Alternative when FXI concentrate is unavailable or contraindicated [^114VJ6fG].

---

### Perioperative management

Perioperative care includes detailed preoperative assessment of bleeding history and FXI levels to guide individualized risk stratification [^115iaCpB]. Prophylaxis with FFP or FXI concentrate is used to **maintain FXI levels above 30%** during surgery [^112kNTNz]. Postoperative monitoring focuses on delayed bleeding, especially in tissues with high fibrinolytic activity [^112rDSsB].

---

## Complications and risks

Complications include unpredictable bleeding during surgery, trauma, or childbirth [^115iaCpB]. Although **overall thrombotic risk is lower** than in the general population [^114YPw1k], thrombotic events may occur, particularly with FXI concentrate use [^1142A1UH] [^112kNTNz]. Rarely, patients develop inhibitors to FXI, complicating management [^115MWYiD].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Emerging strategies include **FXI inhibitors** — monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, and small-molecule inhibitors — under development as safer anticoagulants [^112wRGQv] [^1139RnN9]. Gene therapy approaches targeting the F11 gene are under experimental exploration. FXI-targeted anticoagulants may offer effective thrombosis prevention with **reduced bleeding risk** [^112SvBML].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Prognosis is generally **favorable** with appropriate management, but unpredictable bleeding can impact quality of life [^112rDSsB]. Anxiety related to this unpredictability, particularly during surgery or childbirth, further affects **quality of life** [^112kNTNz].

---

Factor XI deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by unpredictable bleeding, especially after trauma or surgery [^115iaCpB]. Management is **individualized**, and emerging therapies targeting FXI are being developed as safer anticoagulants [^112wRGQv].

### Clinical evaluation of Factor XIa inhibitor drugs: JACC review topic of the week [^112wRGQv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Factor XI/XIa (FXI/FXIa) represents a potential target for improved precision in anticoagulation because it is involved primarily in thrombus formation and plays a much smaller role in clotting and hemostasis. This suggests that the inhibition of FXI/XIa could prevent pathologic thrombi from forming, while largely preserving a patient's ability to clot in response to bleeding or trauma. This theory is supported by observational data showing that patients with congenital FXI deficiency have lower rates of embolic events without an increase in spontaneous bleeding.

Small phase 2 trials of FXI/XIa inhibitors have offered encouraging data regarding bleeding and safety, and evidence of efficacy for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. However, larger clinical trials across multiple patient groups are needed for this emerging class of anticoagulants to understand their possible role in clinical use. Here, we review the potential clinical indications for FXI/XIa inhibitors, data available at the time of writing, and consider future trials.

Factor XI deficiency and its clinical implications

FXI deficiency is a rare disorder inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Patients exhibit markedly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times, yet even individuals with extremely low FXI levels may remain asymptomatic, indicating a complex relationship between FXI levels and clinical manifestations. Bleeding in FXI-deficient patients typically occurs following trauma or surgery, particularly in tissues with high fibrinolytic activity, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, and the urinary tract. This pattern of bleeding underscores the role of FXI in clot stabilization rather than initiation, aligning with its involvement in the later stages of the coagulation cascade. Treatment options for FXI deficiency include antifibrinolytics, fresh-frozen plasma, plasma-derived FXI concentrates, and low-dose recombinant activated factor VII. However, despite cautious usage, especially in the perioperative period, FXI concentrates were associated with a risk of thrombotic complications, as evidenced by rare instances of transient ischemic attack and pulmonary embolism in treated patients.

- **Low factor XI levels: available data**: Evidence consistently points to a lower thrombotic risk among individuals with lower FXI levels. Patients with severe FXI deficiency had a significantly reduced incidence of deep vein thrombosis compared to the general population, indicating a potential protective effect. Similarly, a study suggested specific protection against ischemic stroke. Another cohort study further supported these findings.

### Biological determinants of bleeding in patients with heterozygous factor XI deficiency [^111diNG9]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Bleeding risk is not predictable in patients with factor XI (FXI; F11) deficiency. In this prospective study, our objectives were to determine the biological determinants for bleeding risk in patients with heterozygous FXI deficiency. Patients were classified as either bleeding patients or non-bleeding patients by calculating the bleeding score (BS) described for von Willebrand disease.

- **Primary haemostasis, thrombin generation, thromboelastometry, procoagulant proteins, inhibitors, fibrinolysis, and F11 gene mutations** were compared between bleeding and non-bleeding patients. Thirty-nine patients were included in the study. The BS significantly correlated with clinical assessment (P = 0.001), and a score over 3 discriminated between bleeding (n = 15) and non-bleeding (n = 24) patients (P = 0.034). Despite normal values, von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thrombomodulin (TM) plasma levels were significantly lower in bleeding patients than non-bleeding patients [ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) = 80.6 ± 29.7 iu/dl and 101.8 ± 29.5 iu/dl respectively, P = 0.043; and VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) = 84.0 ± 28.0 iu/dl and 106.3 ± 36.1 iu/dl respectively, P = 0.035; and TM = 17.7 ± 11.7 ng/ml and 23.6 ± 9.7 ng/ml respectively, P = 0.043].

When considering BS as a continuous variable, only VWF:RCo remained significant (P = 0.042), which accounted for 11% of the variability in BS.

### Obstetric and perioperative management of patients with factor XI deficiency: A retrospective observational study [^116DwLE8]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

Irrespective of an early series published in 1997 demonstrating a strong negative correlation between bleeding and FXI levels (r = −0.36, P = 0.0001), more recent studies have failed to establish such an association. Our data do not provide an unequivocal answer as to how to interpret FXI levels in this context. We found a statistically significant but weaker association between FXI concentration and bleeding risk (OR, 0.72 for 10 U/dL of FXI level increase). Although an FXI level cutoff of 40 U/dL can predict a lower bleeding risk with reasonable specificity (75%), no clear FXI level is adequately sensitive to detect all patients who are at an increased risk of bleeding.

The lack of a reliable correlation between FXI levels and bleeding risk renders the management of patients with mild FXI deficiency without a bleeding history particularly challenging when screening patients for prophylactic interventions. This calls for the development of a disease-specific bleeding score (BS) that can assist in standardizing this assessment. A recent Dutch study assessing bleeding severity in rare bleeding disorders showed no correlation between the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool (BAT) score and FXI activity. A specific Rare Bleeding Disorders BAT developed by the European Network of Rare Bleeding Disorders group was shown to have a higher predictive power when compared to the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis BAT for rare bleeding diathesis. However, this remains to be validated in FXI deficiency.

### One case of surgical treatment of coagulation factor XI deficiency complicated with esophageal cancer: A case report [^113ENqJb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor XI deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic disease with a low incidence rate. The prevalence of severe FXI deficiency is reported to be 1:1,000,000 worldwide, and mild-to-moderate FXI deficiency is more common, with a prevalence of 1:10,000–50,000. The bleeding symptoms are milder than those of hemophilia A and hemophilia B, and spontaneous bleeding is rare. This article summarizes a recent case of coagulation factor XI deficiency with lower esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated in our center, and the report is as follows.

### Factor XI deficiency is associated with lower risk for cardiovascular and venous thromboembolism events [^114YPw1k]. Blood (2017). High credibility.

Factor XI deficiency is one of the rare inherited coagulation factor deficiencies, with a notably high incidence within the Ashkenazi Jewish community. Because factor XI displays both procoagulant and antifibrinolytic activities, it has been postulated that an underlying cardiovascular benefit may exist with factor XI deficiency. This historical cohort study was performed using the electronic database of Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare provider in Israel. All adults tested for factor XI activity between 2002 and 2014 were included in the study. Factor XI activity was classified into three categories: normal (activity > 50%), mild deficiency (activity = 30%-50%), and moderate-severe deficiency (activity ≤ 30%). The cohort was followed until 31 December 2015 for the incidence of cardiovascular events (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack) and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Of the 10,193 included patients, 8,958 (88.9%) had normal factor XI activity, 690 (6.8%) had mild deficiency, and 542 (5.3%) had moderate-severe deficiency. Compared with individuals with normal activity, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular events was 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.31–0.87) in those with mild deficiency, and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.35–0.93) in those with moderate-severe factor XI deficiency. The incidence of VTE was lower in those with factor XI deficiency (activity < 50%) compared with those with normal activity; adjusted HR = 0.26 (95% CI, 0.08–0.84). In summary, factor XI deficiency is associated with a decreased incidence of cardiovascular events and VTE.

### Hemophilia therapy: The future has begun [^116kTF1e]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Among the more than 6,000 human diseases caused by single-gene defects, the plasma deficiencies of coagulation proteins are of great importance to the hematologist, as they entail a lifelong bleeding tendency that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not adequately managed. Inherited coagulation deficiencies are classified as rare diseases according to the definitions adopted in the United States (fewer than 200,000 cases nationwide) and Europe (fewer than 5 cases per 10,000 persons in the general population). The hemophilias are clinically relevant rare diseases: hemophilia A (HA), which results from the deficiency or dysfunction of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), and hemophilia B (HB), which involves factor IX (FIX). Both conditions are due to mutations in genes located on chromosome X, thus primarily affecting males, with bleeding symptoms roughly proportional to the degree of factor deficiency in plasma. The main sites of spontaneous bleeding are joints and muscles. If inadequately treated, this causes chronic damage to the musculoskeletal system, resulting in severe handicaps and disability. Furthermore, trauma and surgical interventions can lead to uncontrolled bleeding.

A recent report on the worldwide distribution shows that hemophilias are more frequent than previously estimated: 17.1 cases per 100,000 males with HA for all degrees of FVIII deficiency, and 3.8 cases per 100,000 for HB. There is a prevalence of 6 per 100,000 for HA and 1.1 per 100,000 for HB in cases with complete plasma factor deficiency, indicating a more severe clinical phenotype.

### The use of prophylaxis in the treatment of rare bleeding disorders [^114ootCP]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) are a heterogeneous group of coagulation factor deficiencies. They include fibrinogen, prothrombin, α2-antiplasmin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and factors II, V, V/VIII, VII, X, XI, and XIII. The incidence of these disorders varies, typically ranging from 1 in 500,000 to 1 per million population. Symptoms also vary depending on the disorder and the residual level of the clotting factor, and they can range from relatively minor issues, such as epistaxis, to life-threatening conditions, such as intracranial hemorrhage.

Rapid treatment of bleeding episodes in individuals with severe bleeding phenotypes is essential to preserve life or limb and to prevent long-term sequelae. Therapeutic options depend on the deficiency and range from plasma-derived products (e.g. fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, factor X concentrate) to highly purified and recombinant single factor concentrates. The rarity of these disorders limits the feasibility of conventional prospective clinical trials. Instead, clinicians rely upon registries, published case reports/series, and clinical experience to guide treatment.

In some disorders, long-term prophylactic therapy is administered based on an individual patient's bleeding phenotype or the known natural history and severity of the deficiency. Intermittent prophylaxis may be required surrounding events such as surgery, pregnancy, labor, and menstruation to prevent or control excessive bleeding. This review summarizes therapeutic options, guidelines, recommendations, and observations from the published literature for long-term and surgical prophylaxis.

### Congenital factor X deficiencies with a defect only or predominantly in the extrinsic or in the intrinsic system: A critical evaluation [^114j6hJw]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Congenital Factor X deficiency is commonly classified as type I, where there is a concomitant decrease of activity and antigen (CRM negative), and type II, in which activity is low but antigen is normal or near normal (CRM positive). During the past decades, it was shown that type II is very heterogeneous. Some forms show a defect in all three assay systems (extrinsic, intrinsic, and RVV dependent), whereas others display a defect only in two of the three systems. Molecular biology analysis, whenever available, has failed to supply clear explanations for these discrepancies.

The purpose of the present article is to correlate the clotting activities seen in these two defects with other clotting, chromogenic, immunological assays, and molecular biology results. Literature documents 10 families that show a predominant defect in the extrinsic system and four families with a predominant defect in the intrinsic system. All patients showed a normal, near normal, or reduced level of antigen that is always definitively higher than the clotting counterpart. Molecular biology studies revealed mutations in different exons, specifically 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. These mutations do not allow clear genotype-phenotype conclusions but indicate that mutations in different exons may give rise to the same phenotype.

The study underlines the importance of a multipronged evaluation of all cases with Factor X deficiency. Only through this approach can an acceptable classification of the defect be reached.

### Reproductive health and hemostatic issues in women and girls with congenital factor VII deficiency: A systematic review [^113p4LV3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of factor VII (FVII) deficiency are gathered from the literature. FVII deficiency is indicated by prolongation of the prothrombin time and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time, confirmed by specific assays for FVII clotting activity and antigen. Guidelines for managing FVII deficiency were retrieved from five articles; however, three focused more broadly on women with rare bleeding disorders, and one addressed FVII deficiency in both men and women. This indicates a lack of detailed consensus guidance specifically for women with FVII deficiency. Additionally, none of the five articles provided guidance on identifying women at most risk of gynecological and obstetric bleeding symptoms.

- **Gynecological bleeding**: Hormonal or antifibrinolytic treatments were considered sufficient to manage heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). Management of HMB-associated anemia was also considered important.

- **Pregnancy in women with FVII deficiency**: Recommendations regarding prophylaxis use varied. Decisions should be based on factor levels, bleeding history, and mode of delivery, as surgical delivery methods such as caesarean section may require prophylaxis. Notably, increases in FVII levels are often observed in women with mild deficiency, so measuring FVII activity in the third trimester is crucial in defining the need for prophylaxis in these patients. Prophylactic options recommended in the publications include plasma-derived intravenous FVII and off-label recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa).

### Factor XI deficiency in a patient with cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^112mfSX5]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

A case report was conducted to summarize the clinical manifestations and treatment of Factor XI deficiency in a patient with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.

Factor XI deficiency is a rare genetic bleeding disorder caused by reduced levels and insufficient activity of coagulation factor XI. It is known to be associated with significant bleeding during trauma and surgery, regardless of the FXI level. This report discusses the first known case of a patient with Factor XI deficiency and cervical spondylotic myelopathy.

- **Methods**: A case was investigated retrospectively, and the relevant literature was reviewed.

- **Results**: A 66-year-old man experienced a 2-month history of impaired finger dexterity and gait disturbance and was referred to our department. He had no personal or family history of bleeding or coagulation disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed spinal canal stenosis from C3/4 to C5/6 and intramedullary hyperintensity at C3/4 on the T2-weighted image (T2WI). Preoperative examination showed no abnormal findings except for a severely prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 139.8 seconds. A coagulation factor activity assay revealed a severe deficiency of Factor XI (< 0.1%). Based on a hematologist's recommendation, four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were transfused the day before surgery, and APTT was reassessed the morning of the surgery, showing improvement to 70.5 seconds. An additional four units of FFP were transfused during surgery, reducing APTT further to 60 seconds. The postoperative course was uneventful.

### Coagadex [^111vQAu4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:

- **Mechanism of action**: Coagadex temporarily replaces the missing Factor X needed for effective hemostasis. Factor X is an inactive zymogen, which can be activated by Factor IXa (via the intrinsic pathway) or by Factor VIIa (via the extrinsic pathway). Factor X is converted from its inactive form to the active form (Factor Xa) by the cleavage of a 52-residue peptide from the heavy chain. Factor Xa associates with Factor Va on a phospholipid surface to form the prothrombinase complex, which activates prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of calcium ions. Thrombin then acts upon soluble fibrinogen and Factor XIII to generate a cross-linked fibrin clot.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The administration of Coagadex increases plasma levels of Factor X and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect in these patients, as reflected by a decrease in the aPTT and PT.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: In a clinical study of Coagadex in subjects with severe or moderate Factor X deficiency (basal FX:C < 5 IU/dL), the pharmacokinetics of Coagadex were assessed after intravenous infusion (mean [range] infusion rate 5.9 [1.3–17.1] mL/min) of 25 IU/kg Coagadex. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated from plasma Factor X:C activity measurements after subtraction of the pre-dose value. The PK assessment was repeated at least 6 months after the first dose. The PK parameters following a single dose are summarized in Table 3. The pharmacokinetics of Coagadex were similar following the single and repeat dosing.

Incremental recovery in children under 12 years of age was assessed.

### United States' Factor XI-deficiency patients need a safer treatment [^1142A1UH]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

A replacement factor for Factor XI that is virally inactivated is not available in the U.S. However, elsewhere, an inactivated concentrate has been used. A review of the experience over 15 years suggests that this product is safe and effective, indicating its potential use in the U.S. The most serious complication associated with the factor was a slight increase in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombotic events.

### Exploring the global landscape of genetic variation in coagulation factor XI deficiency [^1146DQqq]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Factor XI (FXI) deficiency is an autosomal bleeding disorder, typically manifesting post-trauma or post-surgery, characterized by reduced levels of coagulation FXI in plasma. The disease is highly prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews, with a heterozygote frequency of approximately 9%, whereas it is considered a rare condition in most populations, with a prevalence of severe deficiency of 1 in 10⁶ in the white population. Over 190 causative mutations have been identified throughout the F11 gene.

To present a global landscape of genetic variation of F11, we explored publicly available exome-based data obtained from over 60,000 individuals belonging to different ethnicities, utilizing the Exome Aggregation Consortium resource. This analysis revealed profound differences in heterozygote frequencies among populations, with allele frequencies being: African = 0.0016; East Asian = 0.0045; European = 0.0036; Finnish = 0.00030; Latino = 0.0021; and South Asian = 0.0015. Additionally, a significantly higher prevalence than previously reported was observed, exemplified by a calculated prevalence of severe deficiency in Europeans being 12.9 in 10⁶.

Furthermore, this analysis allowed us to identify region and ethnic-specific mutations: p. Phe223Leu in Africans, accounting for 23.5% of all mutated alleles; p. Gln263X and p. Leu424CysfsX in East Asians, accounting for 28.2% and 20.5% respectively; and p. Ala412Thr in Latinos, accounting for 25%.

### SPL drug information for Factor VIIa (recombinant) [^112PPFQS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of factor VIIa (recombinant) IV for the treatment of bleeding episodes in adults with congenital factor VII deficiency is 15–30 mcg/kg IV every 4–6 hours until hemostasis is achieved.

### Patient-centered approach to managing factor XIII deficiency [^116cXNW1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Factor XIII (FXIII) is a thrombin-activated protransglutaminase that plays a key role in blood clot formation. Congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency represents a rare bleeding disorder that affects one in 2–3 million individuals worldwide and is treated with recombinant FXIII (rFXIII). However, due to the rarity of the disease, clinicians are often left to weigh individual variation in FXIII activity and/or symptoms to optimally guide dosing.

Cases often become further complicated when patients experience refractory bleeding, which can be difficult to treat. This report describes an approach to rFXIII dosing in two patients who required deviation from standard protocols to maintain therapeutic FXIII troughs. We highlight limitations in our understanding of FXIII deficiency management, while also providing an example of the application of pharmacokinetic data to individualize therapy for improved outcomes.

Finally, the case reminds us of the importance of patient-centered, cost-conscious care and multidisciplinary teamwork in complex cases.

### C1 inhibitor deficiency: 2014 United Kingdom consensus document [^1125J9Df]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

We present here an updated UK consensus for the management of patients with C1 inhibitor deficiency. The consensus was developed using the Delphi method, an established process for the collation of opinion from a group of experts. According to this process, respondents indicate agreement with statements in rounds; after each round, facilitators collate and anonymize the responses to guide the amendment of the statements for future rounds. The process is completed when predefined levels of consensus are reached. This method was pursued in order to produce guidelines that are complementary to recent publications and with an emphasis on UK services.

The consensus has evolved significantly since the previous 2005 UK document. A particularly important development is an improved evidence base to guide the management of acute attacks. The dosing of C1 inhibitor concentrate (statement 17) was particularly emphasized, given the availability of guidance from robust trial data. However, clinical experience suggests that individualized dosing is appropriate, including higher doses where treatment is delayed and lower doses when treatment is immediately available (statement 18).

In keeping with other recent guidelines, the document supports the wider use of acute treatment for disabling attacks (statement 3) rather than limiting treatment to severe episodes. Statement 2 indicates that the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) should follow international guidance and standards, while considering the resources available in the United Kingdom. Additionally, statement 12 advises that patients should take medication according to clinical recommendations.

### Prevalence, causes, and characterization of factor XI inhibitors in patients with inherited factor XI deficiency [^115MWYiD]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Factor XI deficiency, an injury-related bleeding disorder, is rare worldwide but common in Jews, in whom two mutations, Glu117Stop (type II) and Phe283Leu (type III), prevail. Mean factor XI activities in homozygotes for Glu117Stop and for Phe283Leu are 1 and 10 U/dL, respectively. Inhibitors to factor XI in patients with severe factor XI deficiency have been reported in a small number of instances. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of acquired inhibitors against factor XI in patients with severe factor XI deficiency, discern whether these inhibitors are related to specific mutations, and characterize their activity. Clinical information was obtained from unrelated patients with severe factor XI deficiency, and blood was analyzed for factor XI activity, inhibitor to factor XI, and causative mutations.

- **Immunoglobulin G testing**: Immunoglobulin G purified from patients with an inhibitory activity was tested for binding to factor XI, effects on activation of factor XI by factor XIIa and thrombin, and activation of factor IX by exogenous factor XIa.

Of 118 Israeli patients, seven had an inhibitor; all belonged to a subgroup of 21 homozygotes for Glu117Stop who had a history of plasma replacement therapy. Three additional patients with inhibitors from the United Kingdom and the United States also had this genotype and were exposed to plasma. The inhibitors affected factor XI activation by thrombin or factor XIIa and activation of factor IX by factor XIa. The results imply that patients with a very low factor XI level are susceptible to the development of an inhibitor following plasma replacement.

### The hemostatic role of factor XI [^113teAvZ]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor (F)XI has been described as a component of the early phase of the contact pathway of blood coagulation, acting downstream of factor XII. However, patients deficient in upstream members of the contact pathway, including FXII and prekallikrein, do not exhibit bleeding complications, while FXI-deficient patients sometimes experience mild bleeding, suggesting FXI plays a role in hemostasis independent of the contact pathway. Further complicating the picture, bleeding risk in FXI-deficient patients is difficult to predict because bleeding symptoms have not been found to correlate with FXI antigen levels or activity. However, recent studies have emerged to expand our understanding of FXI, demonstrating that activated FXI is able to activate coagulation factors FX, FV, and FVIII, and inhibit the anti-coagulant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Understanding these activities of FXI may help to better diagnose which FXI-deficient patients are at risk for bleeding. In contrast to its mild hemostatic activities, FXI is known to play a significant role in thrombosis, as it is a demonstrated independent risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. Recent translational approaches have begun testing FXI as an antithrombotic, with one promising clinical study showing that an antisense oligonucleotide against FXI prevented venous thrombosis in elective knee surgery. A better understanding of the varied and complex role of FXI in both thrombosis and hemostasis will help to allow better prediction of bleeding risk in FXI-deficient patients.

### New products for the treatment of haemophilia [^115jdnQ1]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Developments in haemophilia therapy are directed at two therapeutic targets: reduction of injection frequency and reduction or bypassing of inhibitors. A variety of new molecules addressing these aims are now completing clinical trials and are ready to enter clinical use.

- **Factor modifications**: First amongst these are modified Factor VIII (FVIII) and Factor IX (FIX) molecules with extended half-lives. FIX modifications have achieved a five-fold prolongation of half-life, while effects on FVIII have been more modest, at less than two-fold. We now face the problem of integrating these into clinical practice. Other approaches have generated chemically modified FVIII molecules with altered activation profiles.

- **Alternative methods**: An alternative way of correcting the haemophilia defect is to reduce the activity of natural anticoagulants in an attempt to restore the balance of haemostasis. These methods are also giving promising results, but, as with all new approaches, it will be some time before they all find their place in practice.

### Obstetric and perioperative management of patients with factor XI deficiency: A retrospective observational study [^115iaCpB]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Factor XI (FXI) deficiency, also known as hemophilia C, is a rare bleeding disorder first described by Rosenthal and Dreskin in 1955. It was distinguished from the more commonly known hemophilia A and B by its autosomal inheritance, which means it occurs in both genders, its milder bleeding tendency, and the finding that the laboratory defect could be corrected by mixing tests with hemophilia A and B plasma.

Although FXI deficiency is uncommon in the general population, with a frequency of approximately 1 per million, it is more prevalent among Ashkenazi and Iraqi Jewish populations, where the rate of heterozygosity can be as high as 8% to 9%. With advancements in prenatal genetic profiling and direct-to-consumer genetic testing, individuals with or without a bleeding history are increasingly recognized as having FXI deficiency, indicating a need for a deeper understanding of this condition.

In existing literature, a severe deficiency in homozygous or compound heterozygous carriers is classified as FXI activity of less than 20 international units (IU)/dL, whereas a partial deficiency in heterozygous carriers is defined as FXI levels between 20 and 70 IU/dL. Despite its severity, coagulation factor deficiency in FXI does not typically cause a spontaneous bleeding tendency, unlike severe FVIII or FIX deficiency; hence, it is not usually classified as a severe bleeding disorder. Bleeding in FXI deficiency is typically associated with injuries or surgery, particularly in areas with high local fibrinolytic activity, such as the genitourinary tract, nasal cavity, and oral cavity.

### Coagulation factor XI as a novel target for antithrombotic treatment [^1139RnN9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor (F) XI was first described as a member of the contact pathway of coagulation. However, the 'classic' theory of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway has been revised, and FXI was found to be activated by thrombin and to play a role in sustained thrombin generation and fibrinolysis inhibition. Recent studies have highlighted a disproportionate role of FXI in thrombosis and hemostasis. Observations indicate that human congenital FXI deficiency is generally accompanied by mild and injury-related bleeding and that experimental, provoked bleeding in animals is unaffected by FXI deficiency or FXI inhibition. These suggest that the FXI amplification pathway is less important for normal hemostasis in vivo.

In contrast, elevated plasma levels of FXI may contribute to human thromboembolic disease, and the antithrombotic efficacy of FXI inhibition has been demonstrated in numerous animal models of arterial, venous, and cerebral thrombosis. Whether severe FXI deficiency in humans protects against thromboembolic events remains unclear, although some evidence exists that the occurrence of ischemic stroke or venous thrombosis is low in severely FXI-deficient patients.

Because of its distinctive function in thrombosis and hemostasis, FXI is an attractive target for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolism. A novel strategy for FXI inhibition is the use of antisense technology, which has been studied in various thrombosis and bleeding animal models. The results are promising and support the concept that targeting FXI might serve as a new, effective, and potentially safer alternative.

### Recombinant factor XIII prophylaxis is safe and effective in young children with congenital factor XIII-A deficiency: International phase 3b trial results [^114tiPLC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). High credibility.

Prophylaxis is the standard of care for congenital factor XIII-A (FXIII-A) deficiency. Six children with FXIII-A deficiency received once-monthly prophylaxis with recombinant FXIII-A. Prophylaxis was well tolerated, and no anti-FXIII antibodies were detected. It was effective with an annualized bleeding rate of zero.

- **Background**: Factor XIII deficiency is a rare, severe congenital bleeding disorder. Monthly prophylaxis with recombinant FXIII A-Subunit (rFXIII) has demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy in patients aged ≥ 6 years and may similarly benefit younger children.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of rFXIII in children aged < 6 years with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.

- **Patients/methods**: Six children, who had previously completed a single-dose pharmacokinetic trial of rFXIII, received 35 IU kg⁻¹ rFXIII every 28 days (± 2 days) for a minimum of 52 weeks and were evaluated for bleeding and adverse events. The Berichrom FXIII activity assay was used to monitor FXIII activity.

- **Results**: The children, three girls and three boys, had an average age of 3.0 years (range: 1–4 years) at enrollment. The total treatment duration was 1.8–3.5 years, giving a total of 16.6 patient-years. No antibody development, thromboembolic events, or allergic reactions occurred. There were 93 mild and seven moderate adverse events. Two adverse events (lymphopenia and gastroenteritis) were reported as probably or possibly related to rFXIII in two children. Two serious adverse events, unrelated to rFXIII, were reported in a single child.

### Treatment of patients with rare bleeding disorders in the Netherlands: Real-life data from the RBiN study [^114CSike]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

In contrast to many coagulation factor deficiencies, no specific factor concentrate is currently available for the treatment of FV-deficient patients. Replacement therapy is therefore mainly accomplished through fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or Omniplasma. All three surgical procedures performed with hemostatic treatment in patients with a relatively high FV activity level were accompanied by bleeding; these patients were, however, all treated with tranexamic acid only. Furthermore, the clinical phenotype of FV-deficient patients might be influenced by plasma levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor and platelet FV, which will be further analyzed in another part of the RBiN study.

In patients with fibrinolytic disorders, the majority of medical interventions performed without hemostatic treatment were associated with bleeding. Periprocedural use of hemostatic agents was linked to a significant decrease in bleeding rate in PAI-1 deficiency and hyperfibrinolysis. However, in surgical procedures performed after diagnosis in α2-AP deficiency, bleeding complications occurred more frequently in procedures carried out with hemostatic treatment. Half of these bleeding patients were treated with a combination of tranexamic acid and plasma, which is currently not recommended as standard therapy in α2-AP deficiency.

These results from the RBiN study emphasize that the individual bleeding phenotype upon invasive procedures not only depends on the activity level of the deficient factor but probably also on other pro- and anti-coagulant factors and variability in individual patient characteristics.

### Reduced incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with severe factor XI deficiency [^117822Uq]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of hemostasis are natural models for investigating mechanisms of thrombosis and the development of antithrombotic therapy. Because mice with total factor XI deficiency are protected against ischemic stroke and do not manifest excessive bleeding, we investigated the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with severe inherited factor XI deficiency. The incidence of ischemic stroke in 115 patients aged 45 years or more with severe factor XI deficiency (activity less than 15 U/dL) was compared with the incidence in the Israeli population as estimated from a stroke survey of 1,528 patients. Adjustment for major risk factors of stroke — hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking — was based on comparison of their prevalence in the stroke survey to an Israeli health survey of 9,509 subjects. The incidence of myocardial infarction in the factor XI cohort was also recorded. After adjustment for the four major risk factors of ischemic stroke, the expected incidence of ischemic stroke was 8.56 compared with one observed (P = 0.003). The reduced 1:115 incidence of ischemic stroke contrasted with a 19:115 incidence of myocardial infarction, similar to the expected incidence. Thus, severe factor XI deficiency probably is protective against ischemic stroke but not against acute myocardial infarction.

### The evolving dilemma of factor XI in pregnancy: Suggestions for management [^1111VCb4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

A case of a patient with severe factor XI (FXI) deficiency who presented for her seventh labor and delivery is detailed within the context of this study. The nature of FXI deficiency, its prevalence, and issues related to genetic screening are discussed. Published literature on the topic is reviewed, covering criteria developed to assess bleeding, laboratory tools used to estimate bleeding risk, and available treatments. Specific recommendations are provided for the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum stages of pregnancy, taking into account both FXI levels and the history of any abnormal bleeding.

- **Antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum stages**: While there are effective treatments available, it is important to consider that institutional multidisciplinary protocols are needed to manage this complex disorder. More work is needed to define the best management protocols.

### Successful perioperative management in a patient with factor XI deficiency [^112n5fdM]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Factor XI (FXI) deficiency is an autosomal disorder characterized by bleeding of varying severity. While homozygotes typically experience more dramatic bleeding symptoms, heterozygotes may also experience clinically significant bleeding following surgical procedures or trauma, indicating that the condition is not purely recessive. The clinical significance of FXI deficiency is complicated because FXI levels do not correlate well with bleeding severity. The bleeding risk is variable for an individual in response to different hemostatic challenges.

We present the case of a 74-year-old man of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage with a family and personal history of bleeding during surgical procedures. He presented with excessive bleeding following total thyroidectomy and was found to have an FXI level of 52% (low normal). Genetic testing revealed that he was heterozygous for the c.403G > T mutation. This case demonstrates the successful work-up and perioperative management of a patient with FXI deficiency.

### Factor xi contributes to thrombin generation in the absence of factor xii [^113qv5vg]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

During surface-initiated blood coagulation in vitro, activated factor XII (fXIIa) converts factor XI (fXI) to fXIa. Whereas fXI deficiency is associated with a hemorrhagic disorder, factor XII deficiency is not, suggesting that fXI can be activated by other mechanisms in vivo. Thrombin activates fXI, and several studies suggest that fXI promotes coagulation independent of fXII. However, a recent study failed to find evidence for fXII-independent activation of fXI in plasma.

Using plasma in which fXII is either inhibited or absent, we show that fXI contributes to plasma thrombin generation when coagulation is initiated with low concentrations of tissue factor, factor Xa, or alpha-thrombin. The results could not be accounted for by fXIa contamination of the plasma systems. Replacing fXI with recombinant fXI that activates factor IX poorly, or fXI that is activated poorly by thrombin, reduced thrombin generation. An antibody that blocks fXIa activation of factor IX reduced thrombin generation; however, an antibody that specifically interferes with fXI activation by fXIIa did not.

The results support a model in which fXI is activated by thrombin or another protease generated early in coagulation, with the resulting fXIa contributing to sustained thrombin generation through activation of factor IX.

### Pro-coagulant haemostatic factors for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in people without haemophilia [^117LnTDp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Some hospital patients may be at risk of or may present with major bleeding. Abnormalities of clotting (coagulation) are often recorded in these individuals, and the traditional management has been through transfusions of blood components, either to prevent bleeding (prophylactic) or to treat bleeding (therapeutic). There is a growing interest in the use of targeted therapies with specific pro-coagulant haemostatic factor concentrates, which aim to stop bleeding and keep blood within damaged blood vessels, in place of plasma.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects and safety of pro-coagulant haemostatic factors and factor concentrates in the prevention and treatment of bleeding in people without haemophilia.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2018, issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1948), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1938), PubMed (publications in process to 18 April 2018), PROSPERO, Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), LILACS (from 1980), IndMED (from 1985), KoreaMed (from 1934), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (from 1990), and ongoing trial databases up to 18 April 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared intravenous administration of a pro-coagulant haemostatic factor concentrate, either with placebo, best or standard treatment, or another pro-coagulant haemostatic factor concentrate, for the prevention or treatment of bleeding. There was no restriction on the types of participants. We excluded studies of desmopressin, tranexamic acid, and aminocaproic acid.

### Cardiac surgery in patients with hemophilia: is it safe [^114B5Cd8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Hemophilia comprises a group of inherited bleeding disorders caused by low concentrations of specific coagulation factors. Hemophilia A and B are hereditary X-linked bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency or absence of coagulation factors VIII or IX, respectively. Factor XI deficiency, originally called hemophilia C, is less common and occurs primarily among Ashkenazi Jews. In contrast to hemophilia A and B, there is no relationship between the risk of bleeding and the extent to which there is a factor XI deficiency.

Recently, there have been remarkable strides in the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia patients, especially regarding the development of safer and newer generations of factor concentrates. As a result, the life expectancy of these patients has increased, bringing it in line with that of the general population. However, with this increase in life expectancy, more hemophilia patients are confronted with age-related comorbidities, including ischemic heart disease and degenerative valves, which necessitate surgical intervention. The deficiency of coagulation factors in hemophilia patients may provide a protective effect against thrombus formation but does not influence the mechanism of atherosclerotic development. This explains why hemophilia patients are not protected against arterial cardiovascular disease. In a recent study, Miesbach et al. found that approximately 30% of patients over the age of sixty with moderate or severe hemophilia were diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases.

Cardiac surgery is associated with coagulation abnormalities.

### Activated factor XI increases the procoagulant activity of the extrinsic pathway by inactivating tissue factor pathway inhibitor [^113AgS6F]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

The activation of coagulation factor XI (FXI) may play a significant role in hemostasis. The primary substrate of activated FXI (FXIa) is FIX, which leads to the activation of FX (FXa) and thrombin generation. However, recent studies suggest that the hemostatic role of FXI may not be limited to the activation of FIX. We explored whether FXI could interact with and inhibit the activity of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). TFPI is an essential reversible inhibitor of activated factor X (FXa) and also inhibits the FVIIa-TF complex.

We found that FXIa neutralized both endothelium- and platelet-derived TFPI by cleaving the protein between the Kunitz (K) 1 and K2 domains (Lys86/Thr87) and at the active sites of the K2 (Arg107/Gly108) and K3 (Arg199/Ala200) domains. The addition of FXIa to plasma was able to reverse the ability of TFPI to prolong TF-initiated clotting times in FXI- or FIX-deficient plasma, as well as FXa-initiated clotting times in FX-deficient plasma. Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with FXIa increased the generation of FXa and promoted TF-dependent fibrin formation in recalcified plasma. Together, these results suggest that the hemostatic role of FXIa may be attributed not only to the activation of FIX but also to promoting the extrinsic pathway of thrombin generation through the inactivation of TFPI.

### Targeting coagulation factor XII as a novel therapeutic option in brain trauma [^115nKRot]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

FXII deficiency or inhibition does not increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. To prove whether blockade of FXII activity may be associated with an increased risk for cerebral hemorrhage after brain trauma, we used repeated MRI monitoring on days 1 and 7 after weight-drop injury. These analyses, using bleeding-sensitive MRI sequences, detected no signs of hemorrhages in the contused brain parenchyma of FXII −/− mice. In contrast, bleedings were evident in the traumatized brain tissue of mice deficient for FXI, the primary substrate of FXIIa in the intrinsic coagulation cascade. This is in line with the observation that FXI −/− humans have a mild to moderate bleeding phenotype.

The FXI −/− mice also showed increased hemoglobin content in the lesioned brain hemispheres after cryolesion, whereas no increase was detected in the brain tissue of FXII −/− or wild-type mice treated with rHA-Infestin-4 compared with sham-operated control mice. In accordance, MRI hypointense areas in brain tissue, indicating intracerebral hemorrhage after focal cryolesion, were absent in both wild-type and FXII −/− mice.

### A proposal for managing bleeding in patients on therapeutic factor XI(a) inhibitors [^114VJ6fG]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Several drugs reduce functional levels of the plasma protease zymogen factor XI (FXI) or inhibit its activated form (FXIa) and are being evaluated as treatments to prevent thrombosis. It is anticipated that therapeutic FXI(a) inhibitors will have a smaller impact on hemostasis than anticoagulants targeting thrombin or factor Xa. This expectation is based on the observation that individuals with inherited FXI deficiency have a relatively mild bleeding disorder. However, even if FXI(a) inhibitors are determined to be safer than currently used anticoagulants, some patients on these drugs will experience abnormal bleeding or require emergent surgery. Strategies for dealing with such situations are required.

Treatment with antifibrinolytic agents and low doses of recombinant factor VIIa has been effective in preventing abnormal bleeding in FXI-deficient patients with alloantibody inhibitors to FXI undergoing surgery. We propose that a similar strategy can be used for patients on therapeutic FXI(a) inhibitors who are bleeding or require invasive procedures.

### Factor XI deficiency in Iranians: its clinical manifestations in comparison with those of classic hemophilia [^115MLGjg]. Haematologica (2002). Low credibility.

In patients with factor XI (FXI) deficiency, the bleeding tendency is poorly correlated with plasma factor levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not this discrepancy is also present in a large series of patients from Iran, a previously unexplored ethnic group.

- **Design and methods**: In 28 FXI-deficient patients, bleeding symptoms and their relation to FXI levels were compared with those of 100 patients with factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency (classic hemophilia), matched for severity of factor deficiency.

- **Results**: Spontaneous bleeding was definitely less frequent in FXI deficiency than in hemophilia, whereas postoperative and post-traumatic bleeding occurred with comparable frequencies. Among FXI-deficient patients, the severity of symptoms was poorly correlated with FXI levels, with mildly deficient patients bleeding almost as frequently as those severely deficient. In contrast, in patients with classic hemophilia, there was a close relation between the severity of bleeding and the degree of FVIII deficiency.

- **Interpretation and conclusions**: As in other ethnic groups, in Iranians, factor XI deficiency is less severe than classic hemophilia, and the bleeding tendency is poorly correlated to plasma factor levels.

### Pediatric severe factor XI deficiency: A multicenter study [^112rDSsB]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Factor XI (FXI) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. Only scarce publications address its clinical features in children. The increased prevalence of FXI deficiency in Israel enabled data collection for this large multicenter cohort study.

- **Objective**: Some hemostatic challenges may be unique or more common in children, such as bleeding in the neonatal period or trauma-related injury. The study was designed to explore the potential impact of these differences in children with severe FXI deficiency.

- **Methods**: Medical files of all children with FXI level under 15% followed at five tertiary centers were evaluated. The retrieved data comprised demographic and clinical characteristics, including bleeding episodes, surgical interventions, treatment strategies, as well as laboratory features.

- **Results**: Sixty children, whose median age at diagnosis was 4.2 years and their median FXI level was 4%, were included. Three children experienced triggered intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and two children had major bleeds. No bleeding complications occurred in surgeries where hemostatic treatment, consisting mostly of tranexamic acid or fresh frozen plasma, was applied (n = 45). In contrast, excessive bleeding was noted in 25% of surgical procedures performed without hemostatic preparation (p = 0.002).

- **Conclusion**: This study's findings confirm the generally favorable outcome of this rare bleeding disorder, with no spontaneous bleeds or cases of perinatal ICH. Nonetheless, proper diagnosis and adequate hemostasis in the surgical setting are imperative.

### Factor XI deficiency protects against atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E/factor XI double knockout mice [^111ohXH9]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). High credibility.

Atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis remain significant causes of mortality in the Western world, despite the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering medications. Recently, an association between local thrombin generation and atherosclerotic burden has been reported. This study explores the role of factor XI (FXI) deficiency in the process of atherosclerosis in mice.

Apolipoprotein E/FXI double knockout mice were created for the first time in our laboratory. There was no difference in cholesterol levels or lipoprotein profiles between apolipoprotein E knockout and double knockout mice. Nevertheless, in 24-week-old double knockout mice, the atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic sinus was reduced by 32% (P = 0.004) compared to apolipoprotein E knockout mice. In 42-week-old double knockout mice, FXI deficiency significantly inhibited atherosclerosis progression in the aortic sinus (25% reduction, P = 0.024) and in the aortic arch (49% reduction, P = 0.028), with a prominent reduction of macrophage infiltration in the atherosclerotic lesions.

FXI deprivation was shown to slow down atherogenesis in mice. The results suggest that the development of atherosclerosis can be prevented by targeting FXI.

### Nonsense mutation in exon V of the factor XI gene does not abolish platelet factor XI expression [^114WSWbc]. British Journal of Haematology (2000). Low credibility.

Factor XI (FXI) is a plasma glycoprotein produced by the liver that plays an essential role in blood coagulation. Individuals deficient in this protein are prone to bleeding following trauma or surgery. Well-washed platelets possess FXI-like activity and FXI antigen that differs in molecular weight from plasma FXI and is associated with FXI mRNA from platelets in which exon V is absent. Some individuals deficient in plasma FXI produce the platelet form of the protein. The molecular basis for the presence of platelet FXI in plasma FXI-deficient patients is unknown.

In the study, to help determine the mechanism for this differential expression, the FXI genotype was determined for three plasma FXI-deficient individuals who express platelet FXI. All three individuals had a nonsense mutation encoding a stop codon in exon V of the FXI gene that would result in a severely truncated polypeptide. An exon V nonsense mutation in the FXI gene combined with the absence of exon V in platelet FXI mRNA provides a plausible mechanism for the differential expression of platelet FXI in plasma FXI-deficient patients.

### Factor XI: Hemostasis, thrombosis, and antithrombosis [^116yTgNv]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor FXI (FXI), a plasma serine protease zymogen, has important roles in both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways and bridges the initiation and amplification phases of plasmatic hemostasis. Recent studies have provided new insight into the molecular structure and functional features of FXI and have demonstrated distinct structural and biological differences between activated factor XII (FXIIa)-mediated FXI activation and tissue factor/thrombin-mediated FXI activation. The former is important in thrombosis; the latter is more essential in hemostasis. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) artificially reflects FXIIa-initiated intrinsic coagulation pathways in vitro. Conversely, FXIIa-inhibited diluted thromboplastin time assay may reflect tissue factor/thrombin-mediated FXI activation in vivo.

Further explication of the genetic mutations of FXI deficiency has improved the understanding of the structure-function relationship of FXI. Besides its procoagulant activity, the antifibrinolytic activity of FXI was well documented in a wealth of literature. Finally, the new emerging concept of inhibiting FXI as a novel antithrombotic approach with an improved benefit-risk ratio has been supported through observations from human FXI deficiency and various animal models. Large- and small-molecule FXI inhibitors have shown promising antithrombotic effects. The present review summarizes the recent advancements in the molecular physiology of FXI and the molecular pathogenesis of FXI deficiency and discusses the evidence and progress of FXI-targeting antithrombosis.

### Novel horizons in anticoagulation: The emerging role of factor XI inhibitors across different settings [^111nU86R]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

The diversity of FXI inhibitor regimens, especially those of extended activity, underscores the need for a clear understanding of their implications for bleeding risk and, as with anticoagulants, establishing reversal protocols is essential. In cases of bleeding or the need for urgent surgery, evidence indicates that, similar to the management in FXI deficiency, antifibrinolytics and, in some cases, recombinant activated factor VII can effectively address bleeding without the need for FXI replacement. This approach is expected to be applicable for those undergoing therapy with FXI inhibitors. Currently, there is active evaluation of fully human antibody Fab fragments, known for their remarkably high affinity for FXIa inhibitors, focused on determining their ability to counteract the anticoagulant effects of the inhibitors. However, these strategies currently lack validation for reversal of FXI inhibitors and need to be further assessed in randomized controlled trials. Any development of specific antidotes should take into account the varied mechanisms of action and unique pharmacokinetic properties of FXI inhibitors, ensuring targeted and effective reversal strategies, thereby optimizing safety and therapeutic outcomes.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of abelacimab (MAA868), a novel dual inhibitor of Factor XI and Factor XIa [^112SvBML]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). High credibility.

Despite the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), bleeding remains a clinical concern. There is an unmet medical need for novel anticoagulants with a superior safety profile over existing agents, particularly for patients at risk for thrombosis. These patients may be undertreated or not treated at all due to an increased risk of bleeding associated with advanced age, severe kidney disease, or other chronic medical conditions.

Targeting Factor XI (FXI), a blood coagulation factor that is part of the intrinsic pathway, may offer the potential for effective anticoagulation that spares hemostasis and thus carries a lower risk of bleeding. Existing anticoagulants, such as DOACs and warfarin, exert their effects by targeting components of the common coagulation pathway. These components, however, are also important for physiologic hemostasis. Consequently, these agents have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding events, some of which can be severe and sometimes fatal.

There is a growing appreciation that coagulation factors of the intrinsic pathway, such as FXI, play a non-essential role in physiologic hemostasis even though they strongly contribute to pathologic thrombosis. This suggests that the pathways involved in hemostasis and thrombosis are distinct and separable. The uncoupling of physiologic hemostasis from pathologic thrombosis is illustrated by individuals with severe FXI deficiency. Individuals with severe FXI deficiency appear to be protected from developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and ischemic stroke compared to the general population.

### Polyphosphate is a cofactor for the activation of factor XI by thrombin [^1116iuGK]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Factor XI deficiency is associated with a bleeding diathesis, but factor XII deficiency is not, indicating that, in normal hemostasis, factor XI must be activated in vivo by a protease other than factor XIIa. Several groups have identified thrombin as the most likely activator of factor XI, although this reaction is slow in solution. Although certain nonphysiologic anionic polymers and surfaces have been shown to enhance factor XI activation by thrombin, the physiologic cofactor for this reaction is uncertain. Activated platelets secrete the highly anionic polymer polyphosphate, and our previous studies have shown that polyphosphate has potent procoagulant activity. We now report that polyphosphate potently accelerates factor XI activation by α-thrombin, β-thrombin, and factor XIa and that these reactions are supported by polyphosphate polymers of the size secreted by activated human platelets. We therefore propose that polyphosphate is a natural cofactor for factor XI activation in plasma that may help explain the role of factor XI in hemostasis and thrombosis.

### Coagulation factor XII haploinsufficiency is protective against venous thromboembolism in a population-scale multidimensional analysis [^115c6Duv]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Patients who experience venous thromboembolism (VTE) require treatment with anticoagulant medication, and guidelines recommend lifelong therapy for patients with unprovoked VTE or persistent major risk factors. However, all existing anticoagulant agents are associated with an increased risk of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding, which ranges between 4% and 15% per year. This means that a large proportion of treated patients will experience bleeding, and many others cannot receive therapy at all due to pre-existing risk factors for this complication.

Within this context, coagulation factor XII (FXII, F12) represents a potential drug target that could "decouple" hemostasis from therapeutic anti-thrombotic effects. Severe congenital FXII deficiency in humans (activity < 1%) does not cause a bleeding diathesis, while FXII deletion or inhibition in preclinical models consistently protects against thrombosis without increasing bleeding. These observations suggest that therapeutic FXII blockade could address a major unmet need by providing an anti-thrombotic effect without a heightened risk of hemorrhage. However, despite the potential clinical importance of FXII, human data to support its role in VTE are limited. At the time of writing, only two small epidemiologic studies have been performed to evaluate this question, one in the Netherlands and the other in the United States. Neither revealed an association between circulating FXII levels and VTE. Both studies were limited by small sample size and the use of spot measurements of plasma FXII levels without germ.

### Obstetric and perioperative management of patients with factor XI deficiency: A retrospective observational study [^115W6paB]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

**Key points**: Personal history of bleeding strongly predicts perioperative or obstetric bleeding risk in patients with FXI deficiency. Higher FXI levels may be associated with lower bleeding risk; however, there is no optimal sensitivity level to rule out bleeding risk.

### Acquired factor VIII inhibitors: Pathophysiology and treatment [^114CL8cc]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Hemophilia A is classically caused by a congenital deficiency of factor VIII, but an acquired form due to inhibitors to factor VIII (FVIII) typically presents later in life. Patients who develop such acquired factor VIII inhibitors may present with catastrophic bleeding episodes, despite having no prior history of a bleeding disorder. Though the disorder is rare, it is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on what is currently known about acquired hemophilia A, its pathogenesis, its associated etiologies, and its treatment.

### Andexxa [^115UZP67]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dose**: For intravenous (IV) use only, there are two dosing regimens. The safety and efficacy of an additional dose have not been established. The recommended dosing of Andexxa is based on the specific FXa inhibitor, dose of FXa inhibitor, and time since the patient's last dose of FXa inhibitor.

- **Reconstitution**: The reconstituted solution contains coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Reconstituted Andexxa in vials is stable at room temperature for up to eight hours or may be stored for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Reconstituted Andexxa in IV bags is stable at room temperature for up to eight hours.

	- **IV bolus preparation**: Discard the syringe and needle. Discard the vials, including any unused portion.

	- **Continuous IV infusion preparation**: Follow the same procedure outlined above for IV bolus preparation. Reconstitute the total number of vials needed based on the dose requirements. More than one 40 to 60 mL syringe, or an equivalent 100-mL syringe, may be used for transfer of reconstituted solution to the IV bag. Infusion will require a 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone or equivalent low protein-binding filter.

- **Administration**: Upon reconstitution, the parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Administer Andexxa intravenously, using a 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line filter.

### International recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of acquired hemophilia A [^113Uiqqi]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

A prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is not specific to factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency; other causes of APTT prolongation are much more common. Therefore, a prolonged APTT does not constitute a good predictive biomarker for bleeding, as evidenced by UK guidelines recommending against routine testing in unselected patients. However, we recommend that an unexplained APTT prolongation should not be ignored if it is encountered before surgery or in bleeding patients. Measuring normal FVIII, factor IX (FIX), or factor XI (FXI) levels will exclude a bleeding diathesis in such cases, and testing for conditions that prolong the APTT but do not pose a bleeding risk, such as lupus anticoagulant (LA) and factor XII deficiency, may be performed.

We recommend that the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A (AHA) should be considered whenever an acute or recent onset of bleeding is accompanied by an unexplained prolonged APTT (GRADE 1B).

We recommend that unexplained APTT prolongation prior to surgery should be investigated and not ignored (GRADE 1C).

- **Mixing tests**: Coagulation factor deficiencies or coagulation factor inhibitors, including autoantibodies, LA, or pharmacological anticoagulants, may result in a prolonged APTT. To distinguish a factor deficiency from the presence of an inhibitory substance, mixing tests may be conducted if FVIII:C is not immediately available. AHA FVIII inhibitors are time- and temperature-dependent, so APTT results obtained immediately following the mixture of normal and patient plasma and following a 2-hour incubation should be compared. These tests are poorly standardized and cannot be used to establish or exclude AHA.

### Inherited factor XI deficiency confers no protection against acute myocardial infarction [^116edDJF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Factor XI (FXI) contributes to thrombin generation, thereby affecting fibrin formation, and to the downregulation of fibrinolysis by activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). This study aimed to evaluate whether patients with severe FXI deficiency are protected against acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

- **Methods**: The incidence of AMI in patients with severe FXI deficiency (FXI activity less than 15 U dL⁻¹) aged 35 years or more was compared to that in age and gender-matched individuals from the general population. Atherosclerotic risk factors were assessed in FXI-deficient patients, and blood was tested for prothrombotic parameters such as FV Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, lupus anticoagulant, and platelet membrane polymorphisms. The common mutations causing FXI deficiency in Jews were also examined.

- **Results**: Of 96 patients with severe FXI deficiency (55 women and 41 men), 16 had a history of AMI (6 women and 10 men). The median age at the time of AMI was 64.5 years for women and 58 years for men. The calculated annual rate of AMI in men was similar to the expected rate in the general Israeli population, whereas in women it was almost twofold higher, though this difference did not reach statistical significance. One or more atherosclerotic risk factors were observed in 13 of 16 patients (81.3%) with AMI compared to 44 of 79 patients (55.7%) without AMI (P < 0.001). However, the frequency distributions of platelet polymorphisms and prothrombotic polymorphisms were not different between patients with severe FXI deficiency who experienced AMI and those who did not.

### Treatment of rare factor deficiencies other than hemophilia [^111X2S1h]. Blood (2019). Low credibility.

The deficiency of fibrinogen, prothrombin, factor V (FV), FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, and FXIII, called rare coagulation disorders (RCDs), may result in coagulopathies leading to spontaneous, post-trauma, and post-surgery hemorrhages. RCDs are characterized by a wide variety of symptoms, from mild to severe, which can vary significantly from one disease to another and from one patient to another. The most typical symptoms of all RCDs are mucosal bleedings and bleeding at the time of invasive procedures, whereas other life-threatening symptoms such as central nervous system bleeding and hemarthroses are mostly present only in some deficiencies (afibrinogenemia, FX, and FXIII).

In contrast to hemophilia A and B and von Willebrand disease, RCDs are much less prevalent, ranging from one case in 500,000 to one in 2 million in the general population. Their clinical heterogeneity, combined with the low number of patients, has led to delays in the development of appropriate therapies. Indeed, similar heterogeneity is also found in the treatment products available, ranging from specific recombinant proteins to treat FVII- and FXIII-deficient patients to the complete absence of specific products for treating patients with FII or FV deficiencies. For these patients, prothrombin complex concentrates or fresh frozen plasma are currently the only options.

The recent development of novel hemostatic approaches for hemophilia, such as the use of nonsubstitutive therapy like RNA interference, anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and gene therapy aimed at improving the patient's quality of life, may also offer potential advancements in RCD treatment strategies.

### Anticoagulant therapy in patients with congenital FXI deficiency [^116fKBsP]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Bleeding risk of FXI deficiency on anticoagulation is unknown. We report 15 of 269 FXI-deficient subjects receiving VKA and/or DOACs. No major bleeding was observed for over 1000 months of anticoagulation. Drug dose, monitoring, and management were unaffected by FXI deficiency.

### Obstetric and perioperative management of patients with factor XI deficiency: a retrospective observational study [^112sJewb]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

The management of bleeding episodes and prevention of bleeding related to surgery are complex due to the risks associated with currently available therapies and the significant differences in the availability of FXI concentrates across different regions worldwide. These FXI concentrates carry a significant thrombotic risk and are not available for use in the United States. Additionally, the rarity of this bleeding disorder and its underdiagnosis, owing to its intrinsically unpredictable clinical presentation, contributes to a scarcity of data, with fewer than 500 cases reviewed in the last decade.

This study aimed to expand the existing database to identify factors associated with increased bleeding risk, assess the safety of neuraxial anesthesia, and analyze the impact of prophylactic administration of hemostatic agents on the incidence and severity of clinically significant bleeding.

### Obstetric and perioperative management of patients with factor XI deficiency: A retrospective observational study [^111n6hvK]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

Traditionally, blood group O has been associated with a higher bleeding risk attributed to lower baseline von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels, with a suboptimal rise of VWF levels during pregnancy and a higher risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). More recently, a large observational study on the association of ABO blood group with bleeding severity in patients with bleeding of unknown cause showed that blood group O was associated with increased bleeding severity, independently of VWF and FVIII levels. According to the authors, the lack of an explanation for the increased bleeding severity in patients with blood group O was the greatest limitation of the study. In our study, no association between blood group type and the risk of bleeding was identified.

- **Neuraxial anesthesia and clinical dilemmas**: In an attempt to further identify and describe the most commonly encountered clinical dilemmas in this patient population, we specifically assessed patients undergoing neuraxial anesthesia. In our analysis, no significant adverse events resulted from this procedure, and there were no instances of epidural or spinal hematoma in 174 cases. These data are in line with growing evidence supporting the safety of epidural/spinal anesthesia during delivery in this population. In our study, a substantial majority (81.5%) of deliveries were performed under neuraxial anesthesia. This is higher than what was previously reported in other studies on patients with FXI deficiency.

- **Systematic review**: The systematic review conducted by Davies et al. in 2016, which looked at the use of labor analgesia in six different studies totaling 236 deliveries, showed no reported complications in any of the cases.

### Pharmacokinetics of recombinant factor XIII at steady state in patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency [^114QZFDA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Use of monthly recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII) recently demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy for congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency patients aged ≥ 6 years (mentor(™) 1 trial), although the pharmacokinetics (PK) were not fully evaluated.

- **Objectives**: To comprehensively evaluate the steady-state PK of rFXIII in patients aged ≥ 6 years with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency.

- **Patients/methods**: mentor(™) 2 is an ongoing, multinational safety and efficacy trial in which patients are receiving monthly rFXIII (35 IU kg⁻¹) for ≥ 52 weeks. For this 28-day PK analysis, blood samples were collected immediately pre-dosing, and 1 h, 2 h, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postdosing. FXIII activity was measured, and PK parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis, without prior baseline adjustment. Information regarding adverse events and bleeding was collected at each visit. Antibody assessments were performed pre-dosing and at day 28.

- **Results**: PK analysis in 23 patients revealed first-order elimination of rFXIII with a geometric mean half-life of 13.6 days. Mean FXIII activity was > 0.1 IU mL⁻¹ throughout the 28-day period, with a geometric mean peak activity of 0.87 IU mL⁻¹ and a trough of 0.16 IU mL⁻¹. The geometric mean clearance was 0.15 mL h⁻¹ kg⁻¹. No bleeding episodes occurred during the PK session, and no anti-rFXIII antibodies were detected. Peak and trough FXIII activities were constant over time, compared with previous activities (≥ 10 rFXIII doses) in the same patients.

- **Conclusions**: Clearance of rFXIII is unaffected over time.

### Anticoagulant therapy in patients with congenital FXI deficiency [^1159UPZt]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

The relevance of factor XI (FXI) deficiency has undergone significant change since its discovery in 1953 by Rosenthal et al. in a Jewish family in the United States. FXI deficiency was thought to be similar to hemophilia and therefore was named "hemophilia C". Nevertheless, further evaluation revealed that bleeding is usually mild and more commonly occurs at sites of injury and/or highly fibrinolytic tissues. Moreover, unlike hemophilia, the bleeding phenotype of FXI deficiency is unpredictable. Neither FXI antigen nor activity is a prognostic marker.

On the other hand, FXI deficiency confers antithrombotic protection, a fact that has been proved in animal models and human cohorts. Preis et al. identified 1,235 FXI-deficient subjects in Israel and demonstrated that they had a lower incidence of thrombosis than non-deficient individuals. These observations have encouraged the development of FXI inhibitors (anti-FXI), which may offer the opportunity to prevent major bleeding by dissociating "pathological" from "hemostatic" coagulation.

Given the aforementioned considerations, it has been suggested that anticoagulant therapy might not represent such a high-risk factor for bleeding in FXI deficiency. Indeed, a review suggests that FXI-deficient patients can be safely treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). However, no systematic study has investigated bleeding in FXI-deficient individuals on anticoagulant therapy. Besides, there is no information on the effect of FXI deficiency in VKA dosing or management, nor on the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in this setting.

### One case of surgical treatment of coagulation factor XI deficiency complicated with esophageal cancer: A case report [^1115GiCY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with coagulation factor XI deficiency complicated with surgical diseases are relatively rare, making the identification and diagnosis of coagulation factor XI deficiency crucial. Monitoring APTT and FXI:C, along with other indicators tailored to the individual differences of patients, can effectively prevent and treat perioperative bleeding. FFP-based alternative therapy provides a guarantee for surgery. However, patients with coagulation factor XI deficiency undergoing surgical treatment are rare, and related perioperative replacement therapy still requires further exploration.
