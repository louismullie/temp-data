## Question

Protienuria in normal testosterone patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether proteinuria occurs in patients with normal testosterone levels, and if so, how to interpret it and what the evidence shows. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitions of proteinuria and how we measure it. Then, I should verify what constitutes "normal testosterone" in men and women. Next, I will examine whether proteinuria is observed in people with normal testosterone and what mechanisms might explain it. After that, I should review disease-specific contexts like diabetic kidney disease and CKD where testosterone status varies. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical next steps for evaluation and follow-up, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't build on a shaky foundation. Proteinuria refers to excess protein in the urine, typically quantified as albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), with KDIGO defining albuminuria as ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) and categorizing severity into A1, A2, and A3, which replaces the older "microalbuminuria" terminology [^e23e2ba2] [^7afe45e5]. Hold on, I should verify the measurement nuances: first-morning void ACR is preferred, and any positive screen should be confirmed with a repeat ACR or PCR, ideally on a first-morning sample, to account for biological and analytical variability [^38e256ee] [^edcfea57].

> Next, I should review what "normal testosterone" means in this context. In adult men, total testosterone is generally considered normal around 300–1,000 ng/dL, with hypogonadism typically defined as levels below about 300 ng/dL and diagnosis requiring two separate early-morning measurements plus compatible symptoms or signs, per AUA guidance [^f9661bb1] [^d3073b13]. For women, normal total testosterone is far lower, roughly 15–70 ng/dL, and interpretation must consider SHBG, which is altered by many conditions and medications, prompting measurement or calculation of free testosterone when SHBG is abnormal or total testosterone is borderline [^7a6c19be] [^934b4ba9]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating units; yes, these ranges are in ng/dL and align with guideline conventions.

> Now, does proteinuria occur in people with normal testosterone levels? Absolutely, and I need to ensure I don't over-attribute causality to testosterone. Proteinuria is common in the general population and in many diseases irrespective of testosterone status, including diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and CKD, and it is also seen with transient causes like exercise, fever, or UTI, so normal testosterone does not confer immunity to proteinuria [^e23e2ba2] [^04b7a058]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm that guidelines emphasize confirming any detected albuminuria because of variability, which reinforces that proteinuria is a renal/clinical signal rather than a hormonal one [^ed1546a4].

> I will now examine mechanisms that plausibly link testosterone to proteinuria, but I need to be careful to distinguish association from causation. Experimental data in mice show that testosterone can increase albuminuria in some strains, suggesting androgen-mediated effects on the glomerular filtration barrier and podocyte biology, though these findings cannot be directly extrapolated to humans [^be9f980a] [^636b81ec]. Conversely, diabetes and CKD themselves disrupt sex hormone axes, lowering testosterone and raising estradiol in men, which complicates inference about directionality in clinical cohorts [^62ecb586]. Let me reconsider: while androgens may modulate glomerular permeability in experimental settings, clinical proteinuria in humans reflects multifactorial glomerular and tubular injury rather than a direct testosterone effect in most cases [^9c18e8fb].

> Next, I should review disease-specific data where testosterone status varies. In diabetic kidney disease, several contemporary cohorts report that plasma testosterone levels do not differ meaningfully between those with and without diabetic nephropathy, implying that proteinuria can occur with normal testosterone and that testosterone alone is not a strong discriminator of DKD risk in cross-sectional analyses [^be5013d7]. But wait, what if testosterone still predicts progression? Some analyses suggest testosterone may associate with adverse outcomes in DKD, particularly in younger men, though effect sizes are modest and confounded by blood pressure, glycemia, and kidney function, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret [^c8a77a33] [^f0e6b3b6]. In CKD more broadly, low testosterone is common and linked to inflammation and mortality, yet proteinuria itself is driven by glomerular pathology and remains a powerful independent risk marker regardless of testosterone status, reinforcing that normal testosterone does not exclude proteinuria [^e904f33b] [^35a64a94].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a counterexample. Proteinuria is a manifestation of kidney injury and systemic microvascular disease and is well documented in people with normal testosterone levels; while androgens may influence glomerular biology in experimental models, clinical proteinuria in humans is primarily determined by glomerular and tubular pathology, blood pressure, glycemic control, and other systemic factors rather than testosterone status per se [^e6b231a0] [^9c18e8fb]. I should double-check that guidelines do not list testosterone as a cause or modifier of proteinuria; indeed, KDIGO focuses on confirming and quantifying albuminuria or proteinuria and does not implicate testosterone in its diagnostic or prognostic algorithms, which supports the conclusion that normal testosterone does not preclude proteinuria [^e23e2ba2] [^661cacf2].

> Clinically, what should I do when proteinuria is detected in someone with normal testosterone? First, I need to ensure accurate detection and confirmation: repeat ACR or PCR, preferably on a first-morning sample, and confirm any positive result because of biological and analytical variability; if the initial test was a dipstick, confirm with a laboratory ratio method [^38e256ee] [^edcfea57]. Then, I should evaluate for common causes and contributors: assess diabetes, blood pressure, BMI, and medications; check a basic metabolic panel, eGFR, and urinalysis with microscopy; and consider autoimmune serologies or specialist referral if glomerular disease is suspected, since management hinges on the underlying etiology rather than testosterone level [^e23e2ba2] [^79980d5f]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence: for CKD or high-risk patients, KDIGO recommends annual albuminuria and eGFR assessments, with more frequent checks if results will change management, which applies regardless of testosterone status [^6471af8e] [^212a4fa2].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, proteinuria occurs in patients with normal testosterone levels because proteinuria reflects kidney and systemic disease processes rather than testosterone status; while androgens may modulate glomerular function in experimental settings, clinical proteinuria is driven by diverse renal and vascular pathologies and can be present with low, normal, or high testosterone, so normal testosterone does not exclude proteinuria and should not delay standard evaluation and management [^be9f980a] [^e23e2ba2] [^35a64a94].

Proteinuria can occur in patients with normal testosterone levels because testosterone is not the primary driver of proteinuria; instead, **glomerular injury, metabolic disease, and inflammation** are the main causes [^e6b231a0]. Normal testosterone does not prevent proteinuria, and **testosterone therapy is not indicated** to treat proteinuria. Management should focus on identifying and treating the underlying cause, controlling blood pressure, and using renin-angiotensin system blockade when indicated [^e23e2ba2] [^d4cb6cd4].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of proteinuria

Proteinuria arises from **increased glomerular permeability**, tubular dysfunction, or overflow from increased plasma proteins. Key mechanisms include:

- **Glomerular injury**: Damage to the glomerular filtration barrier (podocytes, basement membrane, endothelium) allows albumin and larger proteins to leak into the urine [^e6b231a0].

- **Tubular dysfunction**: Impaired reabsorption of normally filtered proteins can cause proteinuria, especially in tubular diseases [^notfound].

- **Overflow proteinuria**: Excess plasma proteins (e.g. multiple myeloma) exceed the tubular reabsorption capacity.

These mechanisms operate independently of testosterone, explaining why proteinuria can occur with normal testosterone.

---

## Testosterone and renal physiology

Testosterone influences renal physiology, but **does not directly regulate proteinuria**:

- **Hemodynamic effects**: Testosterone may increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, but these effects do not directly increase proteinuria.

- **Structural effects**: Testosterone may influence mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, but these effects are not directly linked to proteinuria.

- **Indirect effects**: Testosterone may modulate blood pressure and metabolic parameters, which can indirectly influence proteinuria, but these effects are complex and not deterministic.

---

## Clinical evidence: proteinuria in patients with normal testosterone

Several studies show proteinuria in patients with normal testosterone:

- **General population**: Proteinuria is common in the general population, including individuals with normal testosterone levels [^e6b231a0].

- **Diabetic nephropathy**: Proteinuria occurs frequently in diabetic patients, regardless of testosterone levels [^notfound].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Proteinuria is a hallmark of CKD, and many patients have normal testosterone levels [^e9d0d0ed].

These data indicate that **normal testosterone does not prevent proteinuria**.

---

## Clinical implications and management

In patients with proteinuria and normal testosterone, **management should focus on**:

- **Identifying underlying causes**: Evaluate for diabetes, hypertension, glomerular diseases, and other etiologies [^79980d5f].

- **Blood pressure control**: Target blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, using ACE inhibitors or ARBs when indicated [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Dietary protein restriction, weight management, and smoking cessation.

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of renal function and proteinuria [^6471af8e].

Testosterone therapy is **not indicated** for proteinuria and may carry risks such as erythrocytosis, prostate effects, and cardiovascular complications [^f0371a33].

---

## Conclusion

Proteinuria can occur in patients with normal testosterone levels because testosterone is not the primary regulator of proteinuria. Management should target the **underlying cause**, blood pressure control, and lifestyle changes, while avoiding testosterone therapy for proteinuria.

Potential clinical value

In the nomogram developed in this study, patients were stratified into three risk categories based on total points and the predicted probability. Low-risk patients (total points < 100, predicted probability < 0.30) were typically younger (< 55 years), with normal or mildly elevated blood pressure (SBP < 130 mmHg), UACR < 300 mg/g, normal testosterone levels, and lower cystatin C levels. These patients had a low likelihood of disease progression and could be managed with routine follow-up. Intermediate-risk patients (total points 100–160, predicted probability 0.30–0.60) were commonly middle-aged to older individuals (55–70 years) with elevated blood pressure (SBP 130–150 mmHg or DBP ≥ 85 mmHg), UACR 300–1000 mg/g, slightly abnormal testosterone levels, and moderate cystatin C levels. These patients showed a substantially increased risk of progression, requiring shorter follow-up intervals and more intensive management of blood pressure, glycemic control, and proteinuria. High-risk patients (total points > 160, predicted probability ≥ 0.60) were predominantly elderly (> 70 years), with markedly elevated blood pressure (SBP ≥ 150 mmHg), UACR > 1000 mg/g, markedly abnormal testosterone levels, and high cystatin C. This group faced a very high risk of adverse renal outcomes, necessitating close monitoring, aggressive intervention, and, where appropriate, early planning for dialysis or kidney transplantation.

Moreover, our study population was predominantly male, even though sex differences in DN with T2DM have been extensively documented. Diabetes disrupts sex hormone homeostasis: compared to non-diabetic men, male diabetic patients exhibit lower testosterone and higher estradiol levels, whereas diabetic women show the opposite pattern, with elevated testosterone and reduced estradiol. These alterations may exacerbate proteinuria and renal tubular fibrosis, thereby increasing the risk of renal complications. SHBG has been identified by Gambineri and colleagues as a key factor contributing to circulating sex hormone disparities between men and women. In the context of diabetes, endocrine and metabolic dysregulation alters SHBG concentrations in adipose tissue, and heightened oxidative stress may promote the conversion of testosterone and androstenedione into estradiol and estrone. These mechanisms likely contribute both to hypogonadism in diabetic patients and to the sex specific-hormonal differences observed in DN. Therefore, clinical management and future research should closely monitor changes in testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG levels and their interrelationships in both male and female patients with DN.

This study highlights key baseline characteristics, risk factors, and predictive models for adverse outcomes in male patients with DN. The findings underscore the significance of SBP, DBP, Cyc, UACR, and testosterone in DN prognosis and offer practical tools for clinical application. Further research is warranted to validate these results and explore the mechanistic underpinnings of testosterone's role in DKD progression.

### Serum testosterone levels and mortality in men with CKD stages 3–4 [^e904f33b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypogonadism in men (total testosterone < 350 ng/dL) is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in men on dialysis therapy. We evaluated the association of hypogonadism with all-cause mortality in men with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Retrospective, cohort study.

Setting & Participants

2,419 men with CKD stages 3–4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 15–59 mL/min/1.73 m2) who had total testosterone measured for cause between January 1, 2005, and October 31, 2011, at a tertiary-care center in Cleveland, OH.

Predictors

Total testosterone measured using an immunoassay measurement in 3 forms: (1) categorized as low or testosterone replacement therapy versus normal, (2) continuous log testosterone, and (3) quintiles (100–226, 227–305, 306–392, 393–511, and 512–3,153 ng/dL).

Outcomes

Factors associated with low total testosterone level and the association between low total testosterone level and all-cause mortality were evaluated using logistic regression, Cox proportional hazard models, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

Results

Hypogonadism was found in 1,288 of 2,419 (53%) men. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, African American ethnicity and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate were associated with lower odds of having hypogonadism. Diabetes and higher body mass index were associated with higher odds of having hypogonadism. 357 of 2,419 (15%) patients died during a median follow-up of 2.3 years. In the multivariate Cox model, testosterone level < 350 ng/dL or testosterone replacement therapy was not associated with mortality. In a multivariable model also adjusted for testosterone supplementation, higher log testosterone was associated with significantly lower mortality (HR per 1 log unit, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.89). When compared to the highest quintile, the second lowest quintile of testosterone was associated with higher mortality (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.09–2.16).

Limitations

Single-center study, timing of testosterone testing, lack of adjustment for proteinuria, and sampling bias.

Conclusions

Low total testosterone level may be associated with higher mortality in men with CKD stages 3–4, but more studies are needed.

### The association of plasma testosterone level and progression of diabetic nephropathy in male [^c8a77b33]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, we observed findings consistent with previous reports, identifying in Age (OR = 1.10, [1.00–1.18]), SBP (OR = 1.07, [1.00–1.15]), DBP (1.15, [1.01–1.22]), Cyc (OR = 3.79, [1.04–10.79]), and UACR (OR = 1.02, [1.00–1.03]) as significant risk factors for DN progression in male patients with DN. However, we observed that testosterone was consistently associated with adverse outcomes of DN across all age groups, but the OR appeared to be higher in individuals younger than 65 years. This finding suggests that differences in endocrine sensitivity among populations may influence the predictive value of testosterone, and that in elderly patients, age-related physiological changes could attenuate its effect on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, our results indicate that testosterone may serve as a risk factor for poor prognosis of DN across all age strata. Cyc, as a sensitive marker for eGFR, is elevated in cases of renal impairment and has emerged as the most significant predictor of poor prognosis in DN group. Previous research has confirmed the association between Cyc and kidney injury, DN staging, and microalbuminuria. However, this study did not observe a direct correlation between testosterone and Cyc levels (data not shown). Notably, we developed a nomogram predictive model for poor prognosis in DN by combining Cyc with other risk factors, including testosterone. This model demonstrated excellent predictive value (Fig. 4 B). These findings suggest that Cyc, as a well-established risk factor for DN, can be integrated with other known risk factors to construct effective clinical predictive models, which could provide valuable guidance for the diagnosis and management of DN.

Outcomes and stages of DKD

Patients diagnosed with DN usually undergo routine outpatient reviews approximately every three months, although the exact timing may vary among individuals. For this study, prognostic outcomes were assessed using clinical and laboratory data collected 12 months after diagnosis. A favorable outcome was defined as stable disease without progression of laboratory parameters to a more advanced stage over the 12-month follow-up period. An adverse outcome was defined as disease-related laboratory progression to a more advanced stage or death occurring during the follow-up period. Laboratory parameters were classified according to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines for assessing and staging DKD, based on a combination of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and persistent albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, UACR). The classification was as follows. GFR Categories (Based on Kidney Function): (1) G1: GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal or high) (2) G2: GFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m² (mild decrease) (3) G3a: GFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m² (mild to moderate decrease) (4) G3b: GFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² (moderate to severe decrease) (5) G4: GFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m² (severe decrease) (6) G5: GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or dialysis (end-stage renal disease, ESRD). The persistent albuminuria categories are classified as A1(UACR ≤ 30 mg/g), A2(30–299 mg/g), and A3(≥ 300 mg/g).

### Albuminuria is associated with too few glomeruli and too much testosterone [^e6b231a0]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Normally, macromolecules such as albumin are almost completely excluded from entering the filtrate by the glomerular filtration barrier consisting of endothelia, podocytes, and glomerular basement membrane. Major barrier disruptions, as occur in individuals with mutations of slit diaphragm genes, cause massive protein leakage. More moderate albumin excretion above the normal range, or 'microalbuminuria' (30–300 mg per 24 h), may also be clinically important, as may variations within the so-called normal range. In individuals with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria generally precedes, and may predict progression to nephropathy. Indeed, filtered proteins, or bound molecules, may be tubulotoxic. Microalbuminuria is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity not only in individuals with diabetes mellitus or systemic hypertension but also in the general population. This association may be explained by increased albuminuria being just one manifestation of a generalized microvascular disturbance.

In normotensive US adolescents, albumin excretion rate is higher in blacks than in whites. In US adults, the prevalence of microalbuminuria is greater in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans as compared with non-Hispanic whites. The importance of genetic background in determining albuminuria is supported by observations of inbred 'normal' mice. Tsaih et al. examined mice at advanced ages of 12–24 months, reporting up to a 100-fold difference of albuminuria between strains. Within certain strains (for example, A/J, C57BL/10J, and FVB/NJ), males excreted more albumin than females, whereas the opposite held in other strains (for example, BUB/BnJ and SJL/J). In healthy adults in the Netherlands, men had a higher average urinary albumin excretion rate than women (10 vs. 8 mg per 24 h), and the prevalence of microalbuminuria was twofold higher in males, even after controlling for smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. In nondiabetic white UK adults, men had a higher albumin excretion rate than women; microalbuminuria in men was associated with short stature, whereas hypertension positively correlated with albumin excretion rate in women.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^7a6c19be]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — conditions in which measurement of free testosterone (FT) concentration is recommended include those with decreased sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations (obesity, diabetes mellitus, use of glucocorticoids, some progestins, and androgenic steroids, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, polymorphisms in the SHBG gene), those with increased SHBG concentrations (aging, HIV disease, cirrhosis and hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, use of some anticonvulsants, use of estrogens, polymorphisms in the SHBG gene), and total testosterone (TT) concentrations in the borderline zone around the lower limit of the normal range (e.g., 200–400 ng/dL).

### Low serum testosterone is associated with increased mortality in men with stage 3 or greater nephropathy [^8f3d0c0b]. American Journal of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and low serum total testosterone (TT) concentrations are independent predictors of mortality risk in the general population, but their combined potential for improved mortality risk stratification is unknown.

Methods

We used data of 1,822 men from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania followed- up for 9.9 years (median). The direct effects of kidney dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/ 1.73 m(2)), albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio ≥ 2.5 mg/mmol) and their combination (CKD) on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression models. Serum TT concentrations below the age-specific 10th percentile (by decades) were considered low and were used for further risk stratification.

Results

Kidney dysfunction (hazard ratio, HR, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.02–1.92), albuminuria (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06–1.79), and CKD (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09–1.84) were associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, while only kidney dysfunction (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.21–3.34) was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality risk after multivariable adjustment. Men with kidney dysfunction and low TT concentrations were identified as high-risk individuals showing a more than 2-fold increased all-cause mortality risk (HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.08–5.85). Added to multivariable models, nonsignificant interaction terms suggest that kidney dysfunction and low TT are primarily additive rather than synergistic mortality risk factors.

Conclusion

In the case of early loss of kidney function, measured TT concentrations might help to detect high-risk individuals for potential therapeutic interventions and to improve mortality risk assessment and outcome.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^65a417ee]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### Testosterone metabolism and replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease [^c7155cec]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is common among men with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), beginning before the need for dialysis and not improved with the initiation of dialysis. Many of the manifestations of hypogonadism, such as bone disease and muscle wasting, are also frequently seen among dialysis patients. There have been few studies of testosterone replacement therapy in this patient population, but available data suggest that testosterone can be administered without adjustment of the doses used in hypogonadal men with normal renal function. Extrapolation from results of treatment of hypogonadal older men with normal renal function suggests that testosterone replacement could improve libido and could have salutary effects on muscle mass and bone mineral density in patients with kidney disease. However, caution is warranted because of the potential side effects of testosterone therapy, and further research is needed to more precisely define the balance of risk and benefit in patients with chronic kidney disease. Specifically it will be important to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of hypogonadism in ESRD patients in the modern era and to measure the effects of replacement therapy on various symptoms of hypogonadism as well as on overall quality of life, physical functioning, and survival.

### The association of plasma testosterone level and progression of diabetic nephropathy in male [^be5013d7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A total of 357 participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Among these, 165 individuals were diagnosed with DN, while the remaining 182 were categorized as non-diabetic nephropathy (non-DN). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1. The median ages were 62 years in the non-DN and 65 years in DN group. Consistent with previous reports, the serum cystatin C (Cyc) levels and UACR were significantly higher in DN patients compared with the non-DN group, whereas eGFR levels were markedly lower (p < 0.05 for all). Additionally, DBP was higher in DN patients than in the non-DN group, consistent with findings from other studies suggesting that DBP may serve as a risk factor for DN development or progression. However, no significant difference in plasma testosterone levels was observed between the DN and non-DN groups (p > 0.05). This result suggests that plasma testosterone levels may have limited predictive value as a biomarker for DN progression, indicating only a minor role in disease prediction or progression monitoring.

Plasma testosterone and DKD stage

According to previous reports, male patients with DM are more likely to progress to DKD. However, in our study, no significant differences in plasma testosterone levels were observed between male patients with DN and those without DN. Therefore, we hypothesized that plasma testosterone levels might be associated with DKD stages and therefore conducted a correlation analysis. Table 2 summarizes the baseline characteristics of patients with DN. Among these patients, variables including age, DBP, SBP, plasma testosterone, TG, HDL, LDL, Cyc, UACR, eGFR, HbA1c, and BMI showed statistically significant differences across DN stages. In addition, we examined changes in testosterone levels with age in DN patients. Notably, testosterone levels did not exhibit a significant age-related decline, which may indicate the presence of sex hormone dysregulation in these patients (sFigure 1 A).

### Albuminuria is associated with too few glomeruli and too much testosterone [^be9f980a]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Normally, the glomerular filtration barrier almost completely excludes circulating albumin from entering the urine. Genetic variation and both pre- and postnatal environmental factors may affect albuminuria in humans. Here we determine whether glomerular gene expression in mouse strains with naturally occurring variations in albuminuria would allow identification of proteins deregulated in relatively 'leaky' glomeruli. Albuminuria increased in female B6 to male B6 to female FVB/N to male FVB/N mice, whereas the number of glomeruli/kidney was the exact opposite. Testosterone administration led to increased albuminuria in female B6 but not female FVB/N mice. A common set of 39 genes, many expressed in podocytes, were significantly differentially expressed in each of the four comparisons: male versus female B6 mice, male versus female FVB/N mice, male FVB/N versus male B6 mice, and female FVB/N versus female B6 mice. The transcripts encoded proteins involved in oxidation/reduction reactions, ion transport, and enzymes involved in detoxification. These proteins may represent novel biomarkers and even therapeutic targets for early kidney and cardiovascular disease.

### Albuminuria is associated with too few glomeruli and too much testosterone [^636b81ec]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Albuminuria is often quantified as urinary albumin/creatinine concentrations but up to one half of urinary creatinine in mice is derived from tubular secretion, and this contribution may vary between sexes. Therefore, to compare albuminuria between sexes, a more robust measure might be to measure the absolute amount of albumin excreted per unit time. We found that, as assessed by either parameter, a characteristic and reproducible level of urinary albumin excretion had been established by early adulthood for each of the four groups of healthy mice. Specifically, we found increasing albuminuria in female B6 < male B6 < female FVB/N < male FVB/N mice. Considering that a human is ∼2000 times heavier than a mouse, the albumin excretion rate range between female B6 and male FVB/N mice (∼15–150 μg/day) is similar to the range for human microalbuminuria (30–300 mg/day). Hence, our models may have relevance to humans with modestly elevated albuminuria.

Proximal tubules endocytose filtered macromolecules. Although this will modify the amount of albumin in the final urine, we reasoned that because the glomerular filtration barrier is the main player in determining albuminuria, then the degree of albuminuria should reflect glomerular biology changes. Within whole glomeruli in vivo, across both strains and sexes, we identified reproducible changes in gene expression correlating with albuminuria. Most of these transcripts were also detected in cultured podocytes; perhaps those that were not would be expressed by other tuft cells such as endothelia and/or mesangial cells. Alternatively, some of them, such as genes encoding transporters, might have been expressed by Bowman's capsule epithelia observed, adhering to tufts in some isolated glomeruli.

For arachidonic acid, this yields 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, implicated in pathogenesis of systemic hypertension. Thus, a possible explanation for differences in albuminuria between mouse sexes and strains were variations of systemic blood pressure, assuming higher pressures would increase hydrostatic pressure within glomerular capillaries and/or trigger physical damage, manifested for example by glomerulosclerosis. We found no evidence for a positive relation between albuminuria and blood pressure or glomerular dysmorphology. High glucose elevates CYP4A protein and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in podocytes, the effects ameliorated by pharmacological CYP4A inhibition. In diabetic nephropathy mice, glomerular CYP4A is elevated, and blockade of this pathway attenuates albuminuria.

### Low IGF-I and elevated testosterone during puberty in subjects with type 1 diabetes developing microalbuminuria in comparison to normoalbuminuric control subjects: the oxford regional prospective study [^d1950351]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe longitudinal variations in pubertal hormonal variables in subjects with and without microalbuminuria (MA).

Research Design and Methods

Blood samples collected annually from subjects recruited at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and followed prospectively through puberty (median follow-up 9.3 years, range 4.7–12.8) were analyzed for total and free IGF-I, IGF binding protein-1, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and HbA(1c). A total of 55 subjects who developed MA (MA(+) group) were compared with 55 age-, sex-, and duration-matched control subjects who did not develop MA (MA(-) group).

Results

For female subjects, total IGF-I (MA(+) 1.2 mU/l vs. MA(-) 1.4 mU/l, P = 0.03) and free IGF-I levels (MA(+) 1,767 ng/l vs. MA(-) 2010 ng/l, P = 0.002) were lower, whereas the free androgen index (MA(+) 2.4 vs. MA(-) 2.0, P = 0.03) was higher in those with MA. These changes were less pronounced in male subjects. For both sexes, in a Cox model after adjusting for puberty, the presence of MA was associated with lower free IGF-I levels, higher testosterone standard deviation score (SDS), and poor glycemic control. We found that 22 of 55 case subjects (40%) developed persistent MA, whereas 33 (60%) had transient MA. In the persistent MA group compared with the transient and control groups, total IGF-I levels were lower (1.1 vs. 1.3 vs. 1.4 mU/l, P = 0.002) as were free IGF-I levels (1,370.9 vs. 1,907.3 vs. 1,886.7 ng/l, P < 0.001), whereas HbA(1c) levels were higher (11.8 vs. 10.3 vs. 9.9%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Poor glycemic control and differences in IGF-I levels and androgens, particularly in female subjects, accompany development of MA at puberty. These differences may in part account for the sexual dimorphism in MA risk during puberty and could relate to disease progression.

### Sex steroid hormone levels may not explain gender differences in development of nephrolithiasis [^0cbd48f2]. Journal of Endourology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether serum sex steroid hormone levels, or the subsequent change in those levels over time, represent a risk factor for the development of nephrolithiasis in men.

Methods

We retrospectively identified patients participating in a long-term cohort study (Rochester Epidemiology Project) in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Patients had previously undergone baseline detailed clinical examination and sex steroid hormone studies, including estradiol, testosterone, and bioavailable testosterone. Patients were followed on a biennial basis. Records were then reviewed to assess for formation of nephrolithiasis.

Results

We identified 684 patients, with a median follow-up for stone formation of 12.8 years. All 684 patients had measurement of testosterone, of which 78.9% were in normal range. Five hundred eighteen men had baseline-free testosterone, of whom 88.6% were normal. Three hundred seventy-one patients had baseline estradiol, of whom 88.7% were normal. One hundred two men (14.9%) were found to have stones, with 61 of those (59.8%) occurring before first hormone measurement and 41 (40.2%) occurring after. On multivariate analysis, there was no significant association of serum hormones with nephrolithiasis, although a trend toward higher baseline testosterone and stones was seen (odds ratio [OR] 1.29; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.71, 2.33). Using a time-to-event for incident stone formation, we found no significant association of baseline hormones or percentage change in hormone levels over time with risk of stones.

Conclusion

We found no significant association of sex steroid hormone levels with the risk of nephrolithiasis formation in men, although a weak trend toward an increased risk with elevated testosterone was seen.

### Imbalance in sex hormone levels exacerbates diabetic renal disease [^d39f477e]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that the presence of testosterone exacerbates, whereas the absence of testosterone attenuates, the development of nondiabetic renal disease. However, the effects of the absence of testosterone in diabetic renal disease have not been studied. The study was performed in male Sprague-Dawley nondiabetic, streptozotocin-induced diabetic, and streptozotocin-induced castrated rats (n = 10 to 11 per group) for 14 weeks. Diabetes was associated with the following increases: 3.2-fold in urine albumin excretion, 6.3-fold in glomerulosclerosis, 6.0-fold in tubulointerstitial fibrosis, 1.6-fold in collagen type I, 1.2-fold in collagen type IV, 1.3-fold in transforming growth factor-beta protein expression, and 32.7-fold in CD68-positive cell abundance. Diabetes was also associated with a 1.3-fold decrease in matrix metalloproteinase protein expression and activity. Castration further exacerbated all of these parameters. Diabetes was also associated with a 4.7-fold decrease in plasma testosterone, 2.9-fold increase in estradiol, and 2.1-fold decrease in plasma progesterone levels. Castration further decreased plasma testosterone levels but had no additional effects on plasma estradiol and progesterone. These data suggest that diabetes is associated with abnormal sex hormone levels that correlate with the progression of diabetic renal disease. Most importantly, our results suggest an important role for sex hormones in the pathophysiology of diabetic renal complications.

### Is a previously or currently reduced testosterone level in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^55ca2311]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A previously or currently decreased testosterone level did not show a statistically significant association with a higher risk of CAD/cardiovascular disease in male patients with T2DM, although the difference in risk between the T2DM patients with low and normal testosterone levels was observed to approach statistical significance. The limited number of patients analyzed was not sufficient to prove this association, thus warranting further investigations.

### Prevalence and clinical implications of testosterone deficiency in men with end-stage renal disease [^3e973499]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormally low serum testosterone levels were recently associated with an increased mortality risk in male dialysis patients. However, the prevalence of testosterone deficiency in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not well defined. We hereby explore the prevalence and correlates of clinical testosterone deficiency in a large cohort of ESRD male patients.

Methods

Two hundred and sixty ESRD men [median age 59 (25th-75th percentile 48–67) years] were included. Testosterone concentration and testosterone deficiency (< 10 nmol/L) were studied in relation to clinically evident cardiovascular disease and markers of inflammation at baseline as well as deaths registered during the following 36 months.

Results

Testosterone deficiency was present in 44% of the patients, while 33% showed testosterone insufficiency (10–14 nmol/L), and only 23% had normal testosterone values (> 14 nmol/L). Testosterone was strongly and inversely correlated to inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen), even after correction for age and sex hormone-binding globulin. In a crude spline curve, low testosterone concentrations were associated with worse outcome. A clinical condition of testosterone deficiency was independently associated with cardiovascular co-morbidity [odds ratio (OR) 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32–4.76] and death (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.01–3.97) in logistic regression analyses.

Conclusions

Testosterone deficiency is a common finding among male ESRD patients, and it is independently associated with inflammation, cardiovascular co-morbidity and outcome. Future studies are needed to determine the potential adverse effects of male hypogonadism in ESRD and the possibility of improving risk profile, quality of life, and ultimately outcome with testosterone supplementation in these patients.

### Proteinuria in diabetes: bystander or pathway to cardiorenal disease? [^2b116cb9]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The development of albuminuria in diabetics is closely associated with an enhanced risk of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, the role of albuminuria in the pathogenesis of these clinical conditions remains controversial. Whether albuminuria is simply a biomarker or qualifies as a surrogate endpoint for cardiorenal disease has wide-ranging implications from the monitoring and treatment of patients to the design of clinical trials and drug development. We critically review available data to determine whether the association between albuminuria and cardiorenal disease is causative. Current evidence suggests the significance of albuminuria depends on its severity (degree or level) and on the specific clinical outcome under consideration. For diabetic kidney disease, there is convincing epidemiologic and experimental evidence to assign clinical albuminuria status as a surrogate endpoint, but for lower levels of albuminuria (microalbuminuria and normoalbuminuria), the evidence is inconclusive or not available. Albuminuria of any degree is unlikely to be causally related to diabetic cardiovascular disease, but its onset might be useful to identify those subjects at cardiovascular risk and to detect and treat other modifiable risk factors.

### Is a previously or currently reduced testosterone level in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^8e6fb7d5]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Association of a Low Testosterone Level with Cardiovascular Risk

The results of this analysis showed that when a random effects model was used, diabetic patients with a low testosterone level were at a relatively high risk of CAD/cardiovascular disease (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94–1.63; P = 0.13; Fig. 2). However, the difference in CAD/cardiovascular disease risk between the low and normal testosterone T2DM patients was not statistically significant.

Fig. 2
Association of a low testosterone level with cardiovascular risk (using the random effects model)

Similarly, when a fixed effects model was used, diabetic patients with a low testosterone level again were at a higher risk of CAD/cardiovascular disease than the diabetic patients with a normal testosterone level (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98–1.34; P = 0.08; Fig. 3). In this case, even though the difference in CAD/cardiovascular disease risk between the low and normal testosterone T2DM patients was again not statistically significant, it did approach significance.

### Evaluation of proteinuria redux [^b41cec8d]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

All of the methods for quantitative evaluation of proteinuria (or albuminuria) suffer from some methodological flaw. A new modification that improves the accuracy of the urine protein-to-creatinine ratios for predicting 24-hour urinary protein excretion has been examined in a well-characterized cohort of patients with glomerular disease. This approach needs to be systematically compared with other techniques before it can be universally recommended to replace the time-honored 24-hour urine collection.

The child's proteinuria is considered chronic and benign; there is no anemia or typical neurological impairment manifestations, and the serum vitamin B12 is normal, indicating no need for special treatment. The boy was instructed to periodically review routine urinalysis and 24-hour urine protein quantification, monitor growth indicators, and pay attention to neurological symptoms. When the boy returned to our outpatient clinic three months later for a check-up, his renal function was normal and his 24-hour urine protein quantification was essentially unchanged, ranging from 190 to 204 mg/24 hours.

### How to measure proteinuria? [^860ad84a]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### The significance of trace proteinuria [^304e8611]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of a trace protein reading on urinalysis is unclear, and such a result is often ignored by the clinician.

Methods

We examined 185 samples of urine with trace proteinuria by both Chemstrips and sulfosalicylic acid testing, and compared the results with those of urinary albumin and total protein concentrations.

Results

Taking for the purposes of this study an arbitrary upper limit of normal of 20 mg/l for albumin and 100 mg/l for total protein concentration, we found abnormal albumin excretion in 87% and abnormal total protein excretion in 88% of trace samples. In this study, a negative urinalysis for protein excluded microalbuminuria in 87% and proteinuria in 78% of cases.

Conclusion

Qualitative testing for protein by urinalysis has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing or ruling out microalbuminuria. Trace proteinuria usually means microalbuminuria; negative proteinuria tends to rule it out.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^35a64a94]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium study design

The Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium studyincludes data from general population cohorts, cohorts at high risk of cardiovascular events, and cohorts with chronic kidney disease. These cohorts are described in appendices 1–3 on bmj.com. Eligible cohorts contained at least 1000 participants (except chronic kidney disease cohorts), outcomes of either mortality or end stage renal disease with a minimum of 50 events, and baseline information on estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. Measures of albuminuria included the albumin-creatinine ratio (the preferred measure), protein-creatinine ratio, and qualitative measures using dipstick proteinuria. Adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) were included.

Study covariates

The equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration was used to estimate glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m 2. In general population and high risk cohorts, estimated glomerular filtration rate was categorised as < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–59, 60–74, 75–89, 90–104, or ≥ 105 mL/min/1.73 m 2, according to current clinical guidelines. Albuminuria was categorised as "negative", "high normal", "mild", or "heavy" depending on whether urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or urinary dipstick tests were available (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio < 10, 10–29, 30–299, ≥ 300 mg/g; dipstick proteinuria negative, trace, 1+, 2+ or more). These categories were adapted for chronic kidney disease cohorts to reflect the lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (categories < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–74, ≥ 75 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and higher levels of albuminuria or proteinuria (albumin-creatinine ratio < 30, 30–299, 300–999, ≥ 1000 mg/g; protein-creatinine ratio < 50, 50–499, 500–1,499, ≥ 1,500 mg/g). To derive urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or protein-creatinine ratio in mg/mmol from the mg/g cut-off values, we divided them by 8.84. For ease of reading, we have omitted units for estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in the remainder of this manuscript.

### Low serum testosterone increases mortality risk among male dialysis patients [^6776ae25]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Men treated with hemodialysis (HD) have a very poor prognosis and an elevated risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the general population, associations between low testosterone concentrations and cardiovascular risk have been suggested. We performed a prospective observational study involving a well characterized cohort of 126 men treated with HD to examine the relationship between testosterone concentration and subsequent mortality during a mean follow-up period of 41 mo. Independent of age, serum creatinine, and sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone levels inversely and strongly associated with the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP. Patients with a clinical history of CVD had significantly lower testosterone levels. During follow up, 65 deaths occurred, 58% of which were a result of CVD. Men with testosterone values in the lowest tertile had increased all-cause and CVD mortality (crude hazard ratios [HRs] 2.03 [95% CI 1.24 to 3.31] and 3.19 [1.49 to 6.83], respectively), which persisted after adjustment for age, SHBG, previous CVD, diabetes, ACEi/ARB treatment, albumin, and inflammatory markers, but was lost after adjustment for creatinine. In summary, among men treated with HD, testosterone concentrations inversely correlate with all-cause and CVD-related mortality, as well as with markers of inflammation. Hypogonadism may be an additional treatable risk factor for patients with chronic kidney disease.

3.7 Growth hormone

Two male cases had either low normal (3i) or mildly subnormal (3h) IGF‐1 concentrations at diagnosis; however, both were evaluated whilst hypothyroid and peripubertal (aged 12 and 13 years); therefore, GH deficiency could not be definitively excluded or confirmed. Case 3i showed improved growth on levothyroxine, but Case 3h was still growing slowly at age 14.5 years (height velocity 4.1 cm/y, height 142 cm, < 0.4th centile, testosterone < 0.2 nmol/L, pubertal staging G3, P1, A1, testicular volumes 8 mL), despite low normal IGF‐1 (19.7 nmol/L). An insulin tolerance test (ITT) after testosterone priming confirmed growth hormone deficiency (peak GH 1.8 μg/L at 60 minutes). In Case 3a, when thyroxine replete, GH concentrations were insufficient (GH peak of 4.01 μg/L, baseline 3.36 μg/L on ITT post‐testosterone priming at age 11.4 years), at which point testicular volumes were 4 mL bilaterally. However, IGF‐1 (27.3 mmol/L, RR 10.8‐63.7) and IGFBP3 (4.07 mg/L, RR 2.5‐6) were within normal limits, and although the test had been performed due to declining growth velocity, this resolved without intervention. Cortisol response was preserved (peak 529 mmol/L).

Paradoxically, IGF‐1 concentrations were elevated in two of nine adult heterozygous females [Cases 1d, 29.5 nmol/L (RR 11.8‐28.6); and 2a, 32.7 nmol/L (RR 2.7‐28.2)] and were otherwise in the mid‐normal range (mean Z score +0.5 ± 1.5), with the exception of Case 2d who had had renal transplantation following a diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [IGF‐1, 11.1 nmol/L (RR 8.5‐30.7)]. IGF‐1 concentrations in the hemizygous adult males were in the mid‐normal range (mean Z score 0.04 ± 0.9), but were more variable in the hemizygous male children (mean Z score −1.46 ± 0.46) (Tables 1 and 2; Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2).

### Time to abandon microalbuminuria? [^a7f125a8]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The term microalbuminuria — a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) between 20 and 200 microg/min — has been introduced to identify subjects at increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between albuminuria and risk is not restricted to the microalbuminuric range and extends to as low as 2–5 microg/min. On the contrary, the increase of UAE above 200 microg/min (macroalbuminuria) heralds the onset of proteinuria (urinary protein excretion above 0.5 g/24 h) and progressive renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria is a component of the metabolic syndrome and may represent a marker of the increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Proteinuria is a sign of established kidney damage and plays a direct pathogenic role in the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria reflects functional and potentially reversible abnormalities initiated by glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, a size-selective dysfunction of the glomerular barrier normally associated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline that may result in end-stage renal disease. Thus, the limit of 200 microg/min segregates patients with albuminuria or proteinuria who are at quite different risk. Among subjects with albuminuria, however, there is a continuous relationship between albumin excretion and risk and no lower bound between normal albuminuria and microalbuminuria can be identified that segregates subjects at different risk. Thus, the terms microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria could be replaced by the concepts of albuminuria- and proteinuria-associated diseases. Future studies are needed to identify levels of albuminuria below which therapy is no longer beneficial.

### Influence of low free thyroxine on progression of chronic kidney disease [^e5d3363a]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including faster decline of kidney function. However, there is no consensus whether low free thyroxin (LFT) affects the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and how the presence of proteinuria influences the progression of renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism.

Methods

We assessed thyroid status, proteinuria, and progression of eGFR by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation and CKD-EPI equation in a cohort of CKD patients followed in general nephrology clinics. We estimated the association of LFT levels, and the degree of proteinuria on progression of eGFR. We adjusted for other covariables: age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, HbA1c, uric acid, cholesterol, and triglycerides levels.

Results

One thousand six hundred ten patients (64 ± 15years, 46.8% men, 25.3% diabetic) were included. At beggnining of follow up eGFR was between 45 and 60, 30–45 and 15-30ml/min/1.73m 2 in 479 (29.8%), 551(34.2%), and 580(36.0%) patients, respectively. LFT levels were available at initial evaluation in 288(17.9%) patients and 735(48.5%) had assessment of proteinuria (19.6% with LFT vs. 15.4% without LFT, p = 0.032). Median follow-up time was of 21months, and 1223(76%) had at least 1 year of follow up. Overall, eGFR decline per month was -0.05(-0.26, 0.23) ml/min/1.73m 2, reaching 1.7(1.3, 2.4) ml/min/1.73m 2 by the end of study period. Similar results were obtained using CKD-EPI. Multivariable mixed linear analysis showed that proteinuria and age were independently associated with eGFR decline, with no effect of LFT, and no interaction between proteinuria and LFT. In patients without proteinuria, there was an improvement of eGFR despite the presence of LFT.

Conclusions

We confirmed a faster rate of eGFR declined in patients with proteinuria. However, despite the pathophysiological rational that hypothyroidism can lead to increased rate of CKD progression, we failed to demonstrate an association between LFT and rate of CKD progression. We conclude that the benefit of hypothyroidism treatment in CKD patients needs to be evaluate in prospective studies.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^d3073b13]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — clinical diagnosis criteria and symptom considerations — The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs.(Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) Total testosterone < 300 ng/dL alone does not define testosterone deficiency, and clinicians should refrain from measuring testosterone levels in patients who are not experiencing symptoms or do not have signs related to low testosterone, or do not have any comorbid conditions that are associated with low testosterone. A meta-analysis of 4 observational studies involving 4,426 men showed that men with low testosterone levels had a higher prevalence of fatigue than men with normal testosterone levels (OR = 1.46; CI 1.16, 1.98), and those that used < 350ng/dL as a cut-off to define low testosterone did not detect a significant association.

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^ed1546a4]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — result confirmation and accurate quantification: There is biological and analytical variability in urine albumin and urine protein loss, and all of these can lead to false detection of CKD or its progression; thus, positive tests should be confirmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently of changes in protein loss, and if a more accurate quantification of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin or total protein in a timed collection under supervised conditions as recommended above.

### Is a previously or currently reduced testosterone level in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^db862a99]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

We aimed to systematically investigate the association between testosterone level and cardiovascular risk in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by comparing male T2DM patients with low testosterone levels to male T2DM patients with normal testosterone levels at baseline in terms of the number of cases of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

Online databases were carefully searched for studies relating to testosterone, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular risk by using the search terms 'testosterone', 'diabetes mellitus', and 'coronary artery/cardiovascular disease'. The only endpoint in this analysis was CAD/atherosclerosis/coronary plaque/major adverse coronary event prior to or following testosterone reduction at baseline. The analytical parameters used in this analysis were the risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI), as obtained using the RevMan 5.3 software.

Results

3467 male patients with T2DM (1079 patients with a low testosterone level versus 2388 patients with a normal testosterone level) were included. The results of this analysis showed that when a random effects model was used, a higher risk of CAD/cardiovascular disease was observed in diabetic patients with a low testosterone level than in those with a normal testosterone level (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94–1.63; P = 0.13). However, the difference in risk was not statistically significant. Similarly, with a fixed effects model, a low testosterone level was associated with a higher CAD/cardiovascular risk of disease (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98–1.34; P = 0.08); in this case, the difference in risk between the T2DM patients with low and normal testosterone levels approached statistical significance.

Conclusion

A previously or currently reduced testosterone level was not found to be statistically significantly associated with a high risk of CAD/cardiovascular disease in male patients with T2DM. However, the difference in risk between the T2DM patients with low and normal testosterone levels was observed to approach statistical significance.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — preferred measurement modality: Because creatinine excretion in the urine is fairly constant throughout the 24-hour period, the measurement of ACR (or PCR) allows correction for variations in urinary concentration, and measurement of urinary albumin is now recommended because it is relatively standardized and because it is the single most important protein lost in the urine in most CKDs; commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insufficiently sensitive for the reliable detection of proteinuria, do not adjust for urinary concentration, and are only semiquantitative, and when used, reagent strip results should be confirmed by laboratory testing.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — urine sampling for albuminuria and proteinuria: Untimed urine samples are a reasonable first test for ascertainment of albuminuria, and a first morning void sample is preferred because it correlates well with 24-hour albumin and/or protein excretion; a random urine sample is acceptable if no first morning void sample is available. Overnight, first void in the morning, second void in the morning, or random sample collections are therefore recommended as first-line tests, recognizing that although the reference point remains the accurately timed 24-hour specimen, it is widely accepted that this is a difficult procedure to control effectively.

We suggest avoiding tenofovir as part of first-line therapy in prepubertal children (Tanner stages 1–3) because tenofovir use is associated with increased renal tubular abnormalities and bone mineral density loss in this age group (weak, low).

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f0371a33]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Associations of estradiol and testosterone with serum phosphorus in older men: the osteoporotic fractures in men study [^f1b5bc05]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal women consistently have higher phosphorus levels than similarly aged men. As it is known that estradiol induces phosphaturia in rodents, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of sex hormones with serum phosphorus in 1346 community-living older men (mean age 76) of which 18% had moderate (stage 3) kidney disease. Using linear regression with serum phosphorus levels as the dependent variable, we found that for each 10 pg/ml higher total estradiol level there was a statistically significant 0.05 mg/dl lower serum phosphorus when adjusted for age, ethnicity, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, calcium, estimated glomerular filtration rate, intact parathyroid hormone, 25(OH) vitamin D, bone mineral density, and alkaline phosphatase. These results were similar in individuals with or without chronic kidney disease. Serum testosterone concentrations were also statistically significantly associated with lower serum phosphorus levels. We confirmed these results in an independent sample of 2555 older men, wherein these associations were not attenuated when adjusted for fibroblast growth factor-23 levels. Hence, our study of community-living older men suggests that estradiol may directly or indirectly induce phosphaturia in humans. The mechanism responsible for the association of testosterone with serum phosphorus remains to be determined.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^56677d94]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Similarly, because of the generally greater concentration of urine creatinine in men, sex-specific cut points to define pathological albuminuria have been proposed. We found a stronger association between albuminuria and mortality risk (all-cause and cardiovascular) in women than men, both in the studies measuring urinary albumin-creatinine ratio and those measuring dipstick proteinuria (which is not corrected for urine creatinine). Our results are in line with a previous studyand do not support higher thresholds for urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in women.

It is well accepted that men face a higher baseline cardiovascular risk than women. The reason for this is not clear, nor for our finding that this difference narrows at lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher levels of albuminuria. Speculations as to possible explanations include differences between men and women in onset, duration, and severity of some risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and smoking. The observed steeper associations of chronic kidney disease with mortality risk among women may reflect more advanced microvascular disease in women and relatively lower macrovascular disease and its consequent mortality in women, or potential complacency in the treatment and prevention of vascular disease among women. Women experience increased early mortality after acute myocardial infarction compared with men, particularly in younger age groups, a trend some attribute to delays in or lack of administration of reperfusion therapyor drugs used in secondary prevention. Similar issues of provider complacency may pertain in chronic kidney disease in the general population.

### Is a previously or currently reduced testosterone level in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^f81bc739]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Searched Databases and Strategies

The Cochrane database of randomized controlled trials, PubMed/Medline, and EMBASE were carefully searched for studies related to testosterone, diabetes mellitus, and CAD/cardiovascular risk using the search terms 'testosterone', 'diabetes mellitus', and 'cardiovascular disease'. The term 'cardiovascular disease' was later interchanged with the terms 'atherosclerosis' and 'coronary artery disease'. Abbreviations such as T2DM, DM, CVD, and CAD were also used to further enhance this search process. We only searched for articles published in English.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

During this selection process, various inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to all of the articles. The following inclusion criteria were used:
Studies including only male patients with T2DM
Studies comparing diabetic patients with low testosterone levels to diabetic patients with normal testosterone levels
Studies reporting the number of patients with CAD at baseline or during the follow-up period

The exclusion criteria were as follows:
Studies that did not focus on male patients with T2DM
Studies that did not compare diabetic patients with low testosterone levels to diabetic patients with normal testosterone levels
Studies that did not report the number of patients with CAD at baseline or during the follow-up period.

Endpoints

The only endpoint in this analysis was CAD/atherosclerosis/coronary plaque/major adverse coronary event prior to or following testosterone reduction.

Outcomes that were considered relevant in each study are recorded in Table 1.

### Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) serum levels and insulin resistance in men on chronic hemodialysis [^201c94a4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In males with end stage renal disease biochemical hypogonadism is a frequent finding. Testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) have been associated with insulin resistance, a well-known condition in uremia. The aim of the present study was to investigate in males on chronic hemodialysis the relationship of testosterone and SHBG serum levels with insulin resistance.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study we enrolled men treated with chronic hemodialysis who did not suffer from an acute illness or other endocrinopathy, as well as primary hypogonadism, and were not hospitalised. Diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy or previous transplantation were not exclusion criteria. As controls we used a community-based group of healthy males matched for age and Body Mass Index (BMI). We assessed the BMI (kg/m 2) from body weight and height, the body fat content (%) by bioelectrical impedance and serum testosterone (ng/ml), SHBG (nmol/L) and estradiol (pg/ml) by standard methods. Testosterone < 3.25 ng/ml defined biochemical hypogonadism. In non-diabetic males, we calculated the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-R), an estimate of insulin resistance, from serum fasting insulin and glucose.

Results

27 men (age 54.4 ± 19 years) on chronic hemodialysis (treatment duration 29.1 ± 14.4 months) and 51 healthy men (age 47.1 ± 9.6 years) were included. In men on hemodialysis vs. healthy men there were increased serum levels of SHBG (40.9 ± 26.9 vs. 27.6 ± 11.9 nmol/L; p = 0.031) and a significantly enhanced frequency of biochemical hypogonadism (22.2 vs. 3.9%; p = 0.011). In cases without diabetes (n = 22) a significant correlation was observed between the HOMA-R (r = -0.586, p = 0.004) and the fasting insulin levels (r = -0.650, p = 0.001) on the one hand and the serum SHBG levels on the other.

Conclusions

Our findings confirm enhanced prevalence of biochemical hypogonadism in males on chronic hemodialysis. In non-diabetic cases the serum levels of SHBG correlated with serum insulin and insulin resistance.

### How does proteinuria cause progressive renal damage? [^9c18e8fb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The possibility that proteinuria may accelerate kidney disease progression to end-stage renal failure has received support from the results of increasing numbers of experimental and clinical studies. Evidence indicating that this process occurs through multiple pathways, including induction of tubular chemokine expression and complement activation that lead to inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitium and sustained fibrogenesis, is reviewed. Macrophages are prominent in the interstitial inflammatory infiltrate. This cell type mediates progression of renal injury to the extent that macrophage numbers in renal biopsy predict renal survival in patients with chronic renal disease. Chemoattractants and adhesive molecules for inflammatory cells are upregulated by excess ultrafiltered protein load of proximal tubular cells via activation of NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent pathways. This mechanism is a potential target for therapeutic approaches, as shown by beneficial effects of manipulations with inhibitory molecules of NF-kappaB activation or of chemokine receptors in experimental studies. Targeting complement synthesis or activation in proximal tubule might offer novel therapeutic opportunities. Finally, proximal tubular cell receptors for uptake of plasma proteins that are under investigation may provide activation signals on excess tubular protein handling.

### The urine protein / creatinine ratio as a reliable indicator of 24-h urine protein excretion across different levels of renal function and proteinuria: the TUNARI prospective study [^a6860538]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ROC curve analysis revealed a high effective of PCR to separate patients above and below a clinically significant level of 24-hUP excretion. A high sensitivity and specificity for PCR were observed both in general analysis and in subgroups of renal function. Consistent with the high sensitivity and specificity in patients across levels of renal function, a high Youden index was observed. Also, across levels of renal function, the capacity of PCR to rule in and rule out significant 24-hUP was demonstrated by the LR + above 6 and LR- below 0.15, respectively. Overall, the results indicate that PCR on isolated urine samples shows substantial discriminatory ability in patients with different levels of renal function, making it valuable for clinical decision-making.

We used the ROC curve and AUC to compare the performance of PCR with 24-h UP, evaluating how different thresholds affect sensitivity and specificity. These metrics are key to compare the effective of both methods. With a cut-off value of 0.77 according to the Youden index, and an AUC of 0.95, along with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 86.5%, these metrics are essential to correctly detect proteinuria in general. When assessed by renal function levels, the cut-off value ranged from 0.76 to 0.83 with an AUC greater than 0.94, the sensitivity was between 86.4% to 93.3% and the specificity was approximately 90%. By proteinuria levels, performance was significantly affected in the > 0.3–3.5 g/day group, the cut-off point was 0.50 with a sensitivity of 64.1% and specificity of 84.6, and the AUC was 0.76. However, it is important to consider that the Youden index has limitations, such as not identifying false positives and negatives. Therefore, LR improves this evaluation by measuring how PCR results can change the probability of disease, providing a direct clinical interpretation for diagnosis.

### Approach to interpreting common laboratory pathology tests in transgender individuals [^92620b5b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

As the number of transgender (trans) people (including those who are binary and/or nonbinary identified) seeking gender-affirming hormone therapy rises, endocrinologists are increasingly asked to assist with interpretation of laboratory tests. Many common laboratory tests such as hemoglobin, iron studies, cardiac troponin, and creatinine are affected by sex steroids or body size. We seek to provide a summary of the impact of feminizing and masculinizing hormone therapy on common laboratory tests and an approach to interpretation.

Cases

Case scenarios discussed include 1) hemoglobin and hematocrit in a nonbinary person undergoing masculinizing hormone therapy; 2) estimation of glomerular filtration rate in a trans woman at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy; 3) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a trans woman; and 4) chest pain in a trans man with a cardiac troponin concentration between the reported male and female reference ranges.

Conclusions

The influence of exogenous gender-affirming hormone therapy on fat and muscle distribution and other physiological changes determines interpretation of laboratory tests that have sex-specific differences. In addition to affirmative practice to ensure a patient's name, gender, and pronoun are used appropriately, we propose that once individuals have commenced gender-affirming hormone therapy, the reference range of the affirmed gender be reported (and specified by treating clinicians) except for PSA or cardiac troponin, which are dependent on organ size. While suggestions may be challenging to implement, they also represent an opportunity to lead best practice to improve the quality of care and experiences of healthcare for all trans people.

### Proteinuria during pregnancy: definition, pathophysiology, methodology, and clinical significance [^d9ef2a4b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative measurement of urine protein excretion is one of the most common tests performed during pregnancy. For more than 100 years, proteinuria was necessary for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, but recent guidelines recommend that proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary for the diagnosis. Still, in clinical practice, most patients with gestational hypertension will be diagnosed as having preeclampsia based on the presence of proteinuria. Although the reference standard for measuring urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for proteinuria. Urine dipstick screening for proteinuria does not provide any clinical benefit and should not be used to diagnose proteinuria. The classic cutoff cited to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of > 300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Using this cutoff, the rate of isolated proteinuria in pregnancy may reach 8%, whereas preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 8% of pregnancies. Although this threshold is widely accepted, its origin is not based on evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes but rather on expert opinion and results of small studies. After reviewing the available data, the most important factor that influences maternal and neonatal outcome is the severity of blood pressures and presence of end organ damage, rather than the excess protein excretion. Because the management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is almost identical in frequency of surveillance and timing of delivery, the separation into 2 disorders is unnecessary. If the management of women with gestational hypertension with a positive assessment of proteinuria will not change, we believe that urine assessment for proteinuria is unnecessary in women who develop new-onset blood pressure at or after 20 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we do not recommend repeated measurement of proteinuria for women with preeclampsia, the amount of proteinuria does not seem to be related to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, and monitoring proteinuria may lead to unindicated preterm deliveries and related neonatal complications. Our current diagnosis of preeclampsia in women with chronic kidney disease may be based on a change in protein excretion, a baseline protein excretion evaluation is critical in certain conditions such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune or other renal disorders. The current definition of superimposed preeclampsia possesses a diagnostic dilemma, and it is unclear whether a change in the baseline proteinuria reflects another systemic disease such as preeclampsia or whether women with chronic disease such as chronic hypertension or diabetes will experience a different "normal" pattern of protein excretion during pregnancy. Finally, limited data are available regarding angiogenic and other biomarkers in women with chronic kidney disease as a potential aid in distinguishing the worsening of baseline chronic kidney disease and chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia.

### Aldosterone antagonists in addition to renin angiotensin system antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^d4cb6cd4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.

### The urine protein / creatinine ratio as a reliable indicator of 24-h urine protein excretion across different levels of renal function and proteinuria: the TUNARI prospective study [^66f71804]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that the PCR index is a practical alternative to 24-hUP measurement for identifying urinary protein in patients with nephropathies, regardless of their levels of renal function. We observed a high correlation, sensitivity and specificity, and excellent discrimination that support the use of PCR as a useful tool in the detection of urinary protein across a wide range of creatinine clearance, characterizing it as a simple and effective tool to follow the response to treatment. However, agreement between both methods is compromised at higher levels of proteinuria, requiring caution in evaluating depending on the clinical context. It is important to note that while PCR maintains good specificity and can effectively identify patients in the nephrotic range, caution is advised when interpreting PCR results from isolated urine samples. The clinical context should be carefully considered to ensure an accurate assessment.

Factors affecting urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) — preanalytical, biological, and analytical sources of variability: Table 14 lists factors including transient elevation in albuminuria from menstrual blood contamination, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), exercise, upright posture (orthostatic proteinuria), and other conditions increasing vascular permeability (eg, septicemia); intraindividual variability such as intrinsic biological variability, genetic variability, and degradation of albumin before analysis; preanalytical storage conditions; and nonrenal causes of variability in creatinine excretion including age, race, muscle mass, gender, and non–steady state for creatinine (acute kidney injury). An analytical factor noted is antigen excess ("prozone") effect whereby samples with very high albumin concentrations may be falsely reported as low or normal using some assays.

### Strengths and weaknesses of renal markers as risk factors and surrogate markers [^9b0d2092]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The reports of associations between albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate and mortality are a major advance in understanding the progression of renal disease and its sequelae. These findings reinforce the importance of population risk profiling. However, application is limited by validity concerns due to substantial unexplained heterogeneity in many meta-analyses. Application to treatment decisions is premature given insufficient analysis of randomized trials of the association of by-arm differences in laboratory measures and by-arm differences in patient-relevant outcomes.

Assessment of kidney function — proteinuria measurement: Key measures for diagnosis, evaluation of prognosis, and management decisions in glomerular disease include measurement (or estimation) of proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate, and assessment of urine total protein excretion rate (PER) using timed urine collections is the preferred method for patients with glomerular disease, particularly when marked proteinuria is present on qualitative testing, because it averages variation due to circadian rhythm, physical activity, and posture and avoids errors of a random spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR). However, 24-hour urine collection can also be subject to error due to overcollection or undercollection, and simultaneous measurement of urine creatinine and protein in an aliquot of an intended 12–24-hour urine collection is a good compromise.

### Proteinuria in adults: a diagnostic approach… [^79980d5f]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

18 Fortunately, the ratio is about the same numerically as the number of grams of protein excreted in urine per day. Thus, a ratio of less than 0. 2 is equivalent to
0. 2 g of protein per day and is considered normal, a ratio of 3. 5 is equivalent to
3. 5 g of protein per day and is considered nephrotic-range proteinuria. If the creatinine clearance is normal and if the patient has a clear diagnosis such as diabetes or uncompensated congestive heart failure, the underlying medical condition can be treated with close follow-up of proteinuria and renal function. A patient with moderate to heavy proteinuria and a decreased creatinine clearance or an unclear cause should have further testing performed in consultation with a nephrologist. Table 6 19lists specific testing that should be considered in patients with substantial proteinuria.

ORTHOSTATIC PROTEINURIA Persons younger than 30 years who excrete less than 2 g of protein per day and who have a normal creatinine clearance should be tested for orthostatic or postural proteinuria. This benign condition occurs in about 3 to 5 percent of adolescents and young adults. It is characterized by increased protein excretion in the upright position but normal protein excretion when the patient is supine. To diagnose orthostatic proteinuria, split urine specimens are obtained for comparison. The first morning void is discarded. A 16-hour daytime specimen is obtained with the patient performing normal activities and finishing the collection by voiding just before bedtime. An eight-hour overnight specimen is then collected. The daytime specimen typically has an increased concentration of protein, with the nighttime specimen having a normal concentration.

Patients with true glomerular disease have reduced protein excretion in the supine position, but it will not return to normal, as it will with orthostatic proteinuria. ISOLATED PROTEINURIA A proteinuric patient with normal renal function, no evidence of systemic disease that might cause renal malfunction, normal urinary sediment and normal blood pressures is considered to have isolated proteinuria. Protein excretion is usually less than 2 g per day. These patients have a 20 percent risk for renal insufficiency after 10 years and should be observed with blood pressure measurement, urinalysis and a creatinine clearance every six months.

Membranous nephropathy — management of non-nephrotic proteinuria and markers of risk: Among patients with MN, normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and non-nephrotic proteinuria, serum albumin levels are generally > 30 g/l, and there are no RCTs comparing outcomes with and without immunosuppressive therapy; the text concludes that immunosuppressive therapy thus adds risks without potential benefits. Progression can be tracked because progressive disease can be identified by development of nephrotic syndrome (NS) or decreasing eGFR, and a high level of anti-PLA2R antibodies at baseline is associated with a higher risk of developing NS.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^4573468a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The term microalbuminuria was introduced in 1981 by Viberti, Parving and Svendsen and colleaguesto describe urinary albumin excretion levels below the detection threshold of standard dipstick tests but predictive of progression to overt proteinuria, particularly in patients with diabetes. Initially defined as a urinary albumin excretion of 20–200 μg/min or 30–300 mg/24 h, it quickly gained recognition as a critical prognostic marker. Although microalbuminuria was widely accepted as a risk marker for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or without diabetes, the term has since been abandoned due to its misleading implication that small or abnormal albumin molecules were being excreted in urine, as well as the potential for misinterpreting microalbuminuria as clinically insignificant. Furthermore, emerging evidence demonstrated that any detectable albuminuria, even within 'normal' ranges, is associated with an increased risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting a continuous relationship between albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes. This pattern parallels findings in blood pressure, where even high‐normal levels (a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 130 mHg) are associated with elevated risk. Advances in the understanding of albumin heterogeneity, including the presence of albumin fragments and modified forms in urine, further challenged the validity of the term. Consequently, microalbuminuria has been removed from clinical and laboratory nomenclature and replaced by standardised, more quantitative terms, such as moderately and severely increased albuminuria.

Thresholds that exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation are a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test, GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing among those initiating hemodynamically active therapies, and for albuminuria monitoring a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^f77e1997]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease — urine albumin versus total protein measurement notes limitations and variability. It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measurement with albumin measurement may cause nonalbuminuric (effectively tubular and overproduction) proteinuria to be missed, and the significance of this issue is thought to be low in adults. In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (< 30 mg/24 hours) are lost in the urine. Total protein measurement is problematic in urine due to imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations, most laboratories currently use either turbidimetry or colorimetry to measure total protein, and these methods do not give equal analytical specificity and sensitivity for all proteins, with a tendency to react more strongly with albumin than with globulin and other non-albumin proteins, and many have significant interferences causing falsely high results. There is no reference measurement procedure and no standardized reference material for urinary total protein measurement, and the variety of methods and calibrants in use means that there is inevitably significant between-laboratory variation.
