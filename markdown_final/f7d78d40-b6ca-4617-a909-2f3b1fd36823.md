## Question

Management of stage III lung cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial staging and diagnostic workup to confirm resectability. Then, I should classify disease into potentially resectable versus unresectable and consider patient fitness. Next, I will evaluate neoadjuvant options for resectable disease, followed by adjuvant therapy decisions after resection. After that, I need to address definitive chemoradiation for unresectable disease, including dosing, agents, and consolidation immunotherapy. Finally, I should consider special populations, summarize a practical algorithm, and note key evidence gaps and controversies, making sure to double-check any areas where older data conflict with newer updates or where post hoc subgroup findings might be overinterpreted [^113E4QLv].

> Let me first confirm the critical initial steps in staging and diagnostic workup because management hinges on accurate resectability and fitness assessments. I need to ensure invasive mediastinal staging is performed when imaging suggests N2/N3 disease, given PET-CT false positives and the implications for curative intent, and I should also confirm baseline brain MRI to exclude occult metastases and obtain comprehensive biomarker testing, including PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, HER2, RET, and KRAS, prior to any treatment because this influences both systemic choices and the role of targeted consolidation therapy [^115eo4MS] [^115fNknK] [^115rVcrg]. Hold on, I should verify that all decisions are made in a multidisciplinary setting before therapy; ASCO explicitly recommends MDT review prior to treatment due to improved outcomes and alignment of modality selection with patient-specific factors, and ASTRO's summary reiterates this principle for stage III NSCLC care [^115k22wg] [^1123g4cm].

> Next, I should classify disease as potentially resectable versus unresectable, and I need to check which T/N profiles fit each category. Potentially resectable disease includes T3–4N0–1 lesions amenable to lobectomy with clear margins and single-station, non-bulky N2 disease with favorable anatomy, whereas bulky multi-station N2, N3, T4 invasions requiring pneumonectomy, or poor baseline pulmonary reserve are generally unresectable; these distinctions are supported by ASCO and historical ACCP guidance emphasizing anatomical feasibility and the need for lobectomy-capable scenarios when surgery is considered [^113tBAwC] [^114r9nyX] [^113NCHiQ]. Wait, let me verify the fitness component: good performance status, minimal weight loss, and adequate cardiopulmonary function are prerequisites for curative-intent multimodality therapy, with PS 0–1 strongly favored for concurrent chemoradiation or surgical approaches, while PS 2 or > 10% weight loss necessitates caution and individualized balancing of risks and benefits [^112VjeDo] [^114jN3nY].

> For potentially resectable stage III NSCLC, I will now examine neoadjuvant strategies. Initially, I thought "standard neoadjuvant therapy remains platinum-based doublet chemotherapy alone", but wait, I should verify the most current recommendation; the 2023 ASCO rapid update endorses neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation as acceptable options for planned surgery, reflecting KEYNOTE-671 and CheckMate 816 data showing improved event-free survival and pathologic responses with pembrolizumab or nivolumab plus chemotherapy, and superior compliance compared with adjuvant-only approaches in earlier analyses [^116zF1Ja] [^111Dqzgi] [^116nZWWq]. I should double-check the evidence signal: these trials predominantly enrolled stage IB–IIIA/IIIB NSCLC with substantial representation of stage III, and although overall survival in KEYNOTE-671 was only marginally significant at early follow-up, EFS and pathologic response benefits are robust, supporting neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy as a new standard for suitable candidates pending mature OS data [^116nZWWq]. For superior sulcus tumors, I need to ensure we plan neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation given historical chemoradiation–surgery sequences and local control considerations [^1163dDSU].

> Let me consider adjuvant therapy after surgical resection, and I should confirm the sequence. If neoadjuvant systemic therapy was not given, adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy should be offered and is associated with an approximate 5% absolute 5-year survival benefit in pooled analyses, with cisplatin preferred when feasible and carboplatin acceptable when cisplatin is contraindicated; if postoperative radiation is contemplated, it should follow chemotherapy sequentially, not concurrently, to avoid excessive toxicity [^114fti76] [^114Eq2mQ] [^113PNhcx] [^116wNmqD]. Hold on, I should verify the role of PORT for N2 disease; meta-analytic and guideline data show PORT improves local control but has not demonstrated a consistent survival benefit and may carry harm in unselected cohorts, so PORT should not be routine for completely resected N2 disease without extracapsular extension, though it may be considered selectively in high-risk scenarios after MDT review [^115MYXyz] [^116qP8Wt]. I need to ensure I also incorporate targeted therapy where appropriate; after platinum-based chemotherapy for completely resected EGFR-mutant stage III NSCLC, adjuvant osimertinib is now recommended given improved disease-free outcomes, and ongoing studies will clarify overall survival implications [^116qP8Wt] [^115fNknK].

> For unresectable stage III NSCLC with good performance status, I should confirm the backbone is concurrent chemoradiation rather than sequential therapy. Concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation improves median survival by roughly 2–3 months and yields superior long-term survival compared with sequential chemoradiation, albeit with higher acute toxicity; thus, concurrent therapy is the standard for PS 0–1 patients who can tolerate it [^112VjeDo] [^113ZF2TD]. Wait, I need to check radiation dosing; definitive thoracic radiation should be 60 Gy in standard fractionation, as dose escalation beyond 60 Gy has not improved survival in randomized trials and may increase toxicity, though careful selection and modern planning may allow consideration of 60–70 Gy in select cases with attention to cardiac, esophageal, and pulmonary constraints [^116FnLBH] [^111929nD] [^113E4QLv]. If concurrent therapy is not feasible, sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation is preferred over radiation alone, which still improves survival versus radiotherapy alone in pooled analyses [^114oXZDM].

> Next, I should review consolidation therapy, and I need to ensure timing and eligibility are correct. Patients without progression after completing concurrent chemoradiation should receive durvalumab for up to 12 months based on PACIFIC, which doubled median progression-free survival and improved overall survival with manageable toxicity; durvalumab should start within 42 days of completing radiation, and although benefits persist across PD-L1 strata, post hoc signals suggest attenuated benefit in PD-L1–negative and EGFR-mutant subgroups, prompting ongoing debate about universal versus PD-L1–restricted use outside the US [^1135KaPv] [^115GZ555]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guideline statements note insufficient evidence to alter durvalumab use solely by PD-L1 status or driver mutations, but clinicians should discuss uncertainties and consider clinical trials, particularly for EGFR-mutant or PD-L1–negative disease [^1135KaPv].

> I will now examine special populations and recent updates that change practice. For EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation, consolidation osimertinib is now recommended following the LAURA trial, which showed a dramatic PFS benefit; overall survival remains immature and crossover was high, so I should counsel patients accordingly and align with MDT preferences and access considerations [^115rVcrg] [^111ETPGc]. For patients with poor performance status or comorbidities precluding combined-modality therapy, definitive radiation alone or hypofractionated regimens can be considered with supportive care priorities, and sequential chemoradiation remains a reasonable compromise when concurrent therapy is unsafe; prophylactic cranial irradiation should not be used outside trials given lack of benefit in modern practice [^1125FzZT] [^111KZP3X] [^115SC8By]. Let me reconsider one more nuance: when surgery is contemplated for stage III disease, it should generally be in centers with low operative mortality and the ability to achieve lobectomy with mediastinal clearance, and patients with T4N0 presentations may be appropriate surgical candidates in select circumstances after careful MDT review [^114r9nyX] [^113NCHiQ] [^1163dDSU].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. First, confirm stage III by invasive mediastinal staging, PET-CT, and brain MRI, and obtain full biomarker testing before any therapy; then convene MDT to classify resectability and performance status, as this triage determines the entire pathway. If potentially resectable and PS adequate, favor neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by lobectomy with nodal dissection; if neoadjuvant therapy was not given, offer adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, consider adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR-mutant disease, and reserve PORT for selected high-risk N2 scenarios after MDT discussion. If unresectable or PS 2, proceed with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation to 60 Gy, then offer durvalumab consolidation if no progression; if concurrent therapy is not feasible, use sequential chemotherapy then radiation, and consider consolidation osimertinib after chemoradiation for EGFR-mutant disease per LAURA. Throughout, enroll patients in clinical trials when available and ensure shared decision-making regarding trade-offs in toxicity, logistics, and potential benefit [^115eo4MS] [^115fNknK] [^116zF1Ja] [^116wNmqD] [^116qP8Wt] [^1135KaPv] [^115J41oq] [^115rVcrg] [^116sKLQD].

> Finally, I should acknowledge key evidence gaps and controversies and verify where my earlier assumptions need correction. There remains no phase III evidence that adding surgery to chemoradiation improves overall survival compared with definitive chemoradiation alone, although surgery may improve local control and PFS in selected patients; thus, patient selection and institutional expertise are paramount, and many advocate trials to define who truly benefits from trimodality therapy [^111HXKP1] [^113E4QLv]. I initially implied that neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone remained the default, but the 2023 rapid update elevates chemoimmunotherapy as a standard option pending mature OS, which I should emphasize while counseling patients about benefit–risk and access to surgical expertise [^116zF1Ja] [^116nZWWq]. Additionally, the role of PORT remains unsettled for unselected N2 patients, and the magnitude of durvalumab benefit in PD-L1–negative or EGFR-mutant subgroups is uncertain; clinicians should individualize and, when possible, offer trial participation to advance the field and optimize outcomes [^115MYXyz] [^1135KaPv] [^116sKLQD].

Stage III NSCLC requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^115k22wg] and is divided into **resectable** and **unresectable** categories. For resectable disease, **neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy** [^116zF1Ja] or chemoradiation [^1113kxHG] followed by surgery is standard, with adjuvant chemotherapy [^114Eq2mQ] and osimertinib for EGFR-mutated tumors [^116qP8Wt]. For unresectable disease, **concurrent chemoradiation** [^112VjeDo] to 60 Gy [^116FnLBH] with a platinum doublet [^112KnHgv] is standard, followed by durvalumab for up to 12 months [^1135KaPv]. EGFR-mutated unresectable disease should receive consolidation osimertinib after chemoradiation [^115rVcrg]. Sequential chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone is reserved for patients unable to tolerate concurrent therapy [^114oXZDM] [^1123g4cm]. All patients should have **biomarker testing** [^115fNknK] and be discussed in a **multidisciplinary tumor board** [^115k22wg] before treatment.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and staging

Accurate staging is essential to guide therapy; **PET-CT** [^1142K2qn] and **brain MRI** [^notfound] are standard to detect occult metastases, and invasive mediastinal staging (EBUS, mediastinoscopy) is required to confirm nodal disease [^115eo4MS]. Biomarker testing for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, HER2, RET, KRAS, and PD-L1 is mandatory [^notfound] to inform systemic therapy selection [^115rVcrg].

## Treatment strategies

### Resectable stage III NSCLC

#### Neoadjuvant therapy

- **Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy**: Recommended for planned surgical resection [^116zF1Ja], with KEYNOTE-671 showing improved event-free survival and pathological response rates [^111Dqzgi].

- **Neoadjuvant chemoradiation**: Consider for N2 disease or superior sulcus tumors [^1163dDSU] [^1123g4cm].

- **Adjuvant therapy**: Platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended after resection if not given neoadjuvantly [^114Eq2mQ]; osimertinib is recommended for EGFR-mutated tumors after platinum chemotherapy [^116qP8Wt].

---

### Unresectable stage III NSCLC

#### Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT)

- **Standard of care**: CCRT with a platinum-based doublet (e.g. cisplatin/etoposide, carboplatin/paclitaxel) [^112KnHgv] to 60 Gy [^116FnLBH] is recommended for patients with good performance status [^112VjeDo].

- **Sequential chemoradiation**: For patients unable to tolerate CCRT, sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation is recommended over radiation alone [^114oXZDM].

- **Radiation alone**: Consider for patients unable to tolerate chemotherapy, with dose escalation or hypofractionation as options [^111KZP3X].

---

#### Consolidation therapy

Consolidation durvalumab is recommended for up to 12 months following CCRT without progression [^1135KaPv], with significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival [^1135KaPv]. For EGFR-mutated disease, consolidation osimertinib after CCRT is recommended based on the LAURA trial [^115rVcrg].

---

## Special considerations

- **Performance status**: Patients with PS 2 or substantial weight loss may require modified or less intensive regimens [^114r9nyX].

- **Oncogenic driver mutations**: Targeted therapies (e.g. osimertinib) are recommended for EGFR-mutated tumors [^116qP8Wt] [^115rVcrg].

- **Clinical trials**: Participation in clinical trials is encouraged to advance care and access novel therapies [^116sKLQD].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Resectable stage III NSCLC | - Neoadjuvant **chemoimmunotherapy** or **chemoradiation** <br/> - Followed by surgery <br/> - Then adjuvant chemotherapy and **osimertinib** for EGFR-mutated tumors [^116zF1Ja] [^1113kxHG] [^116qP8Wt] |
| Unresectable stage III NSCLC | - Concurrent **chemoradiation** to 60 Gy <br/> - Followed by **durvalumab** consolidation <br/> - Osimertinib for **EGFR-mutated tumors** [^112VjeDo] [^1135KaPv] [^115rVcrg] |
| Poor performance status | - Sequential chemoradiation or radiation alone [^114oXZDM] [^114r9nyX] |

---

Stage III NSCLC management is **multimodality and biomarker-driven**, with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy or CCRT plus surgery for resectable disease and definitive CCRT with consolidation immunotherapy for unresectable disease. Individualized decisions via multidisciplinary review and biomarker testing are essential to optimize outcomes [^115fNknK] [^115k22wg].

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing clinicians on management of patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods

An Expert Panel of medical oncology, thoracic surgery, radiation oncology, pulmonary oncology, community oncology, research methodology, and advocacy experts was convened to conduct a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials published from 1990 through 2021. Outcomes of interest included survival, disease-free or recurrence-free survival, and quality of life. Expert Panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

Results

The literature search identified 127 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline.

Recommendations

Evidence-based recommendations were developed to address evaluation and staging workup of patients with suspected stage III NSCLC, surgical management, neoadjuvant and adjuvant approaches, and management of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/thoracic-cancer-guidelines.

Objectives

Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) describes a heterogeneous population with disease presentation ranging from apparently resectable tumors with occult microscopic nodal metastases to unresectable, bulky nodal disease. This review updates the published clinical trials since the last American College of Chest Physicians guidelines to make treatment recommendations for this controversial subset of patients.

Methods

Systematic searches were conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database for Systematic Review up to December 2011, focusing primarily on randomized trials, selected meta-analyses, practice guidelines, and reviews.

Results

For individuals with stage IIIA or IIIB disease, good performance scores, and minimal weight loss, treatment with combined chemoradiotherapy results in better survival than radiotherapy alone. Consolidation chemotherapy or targeted therapy following definitive chemoradiation for stage IIIA is not supported. Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery is neither clearly better nor clearly worse than definitive chemoradiation. Most of the arguments made regarding patient selection for neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection provide evidence for better prognosis but not for a beneficial impact of this treatment strategy; however, weak comparative data suggest a possible role if only lobectomy is needed in a center with a low perioperative mortality rate. The evidence supports routine platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy following complete resection of stage IIIA lung cancer encountered unexpectedly at surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy improves local control without improving survival.

Conclusions

Multimodality therapy is preferable in most subsets of patients with stage III lung cancer. Variability in the patients included in randomized trials limits the ability to combine results across studies and thus limits the strength of recommendations in many scenarios. Future trials are needed to investigate the roles of individualized chemotherapy, surgery in particular cohorts or settings, prophylactic cranial radiation, and adaptive radiation.

### Which patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer should undergo surgical resection? [^114NXb56]. The Oncologist (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC remains controversial. Stage III NSCLC comprises a fairly heterogeneous group of tumors, and furthermore only sparse data from randomized clinical trials exist to guide therapy decisions. This review article proposes a management algorithm for patients with stage III NSCLC that is based upon the currently available data on surgical therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. By necessity, given the paucity of strong data, a good deal of opinion is offered. The choice to proceed with aggressive, combined modality treatment is presented in light of extent of local disease as well as patient performance status.

### Management of stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: ASCO guideline [^113E4QLv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Management of stage III NSCLC — limitation of the research and future research highlights key gaps and priorities: there are several gaps in understanding optimal treatment, no single randomized trial can define treatment for the entire spectrum, patient selection for surgical versus nonsurgical management is not well-defined by high-level evidence, and most comparative trials predated minimally invasive techniques and advances and were conducted before the PACIFIC consolidative immunotherapy era. Currently, no randomized phase III trial has demonstrated a survival benefit to the inclusion of surgery, and well-designed studies are needed to better define which patients with stage III NSCLC, if any, benefit from the inclusion of surgery. The role of immunotherapy in resectable stage III disease remains under active investigation, and in unresectable disease ongoing studies are evaluating concurrent immunotherapy with chemoradiation or dual checkpoint blockade in the adjuvant setting; patient selection for consolidative immunotherapy is also not fully defined. The PACIFIC trial included patients with PD-L1–negative disease and those with oncogenic driver mutations, and subsequent analyses have called into question the use of immunotherapy for those patients. Although RTOG 0617 found no benefit to radiation dose escalation for the unresectable stage III population as a whole, ongoing studies seek to identify subgroups that might benefit from higher doses. ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.

### Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112JtBV6]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete resection — we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with completely resected NSCLC with incidentally detected stage III disease unless there is reason to believe the risk of chemotherapy-related complications is unusually high on the basis of performance status or comorbidities. Reported benefit is about 5% absolute 5-year survival benefit, with the risk of a chemotherapy-related death < 1%. Trials have required that chemotherapy be started within 8 to 12 weeks of surgery, and it appears reasonable to suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy involve cisplatin-based doublets for three to four cycles started within 12 weeks of surgery. Age by itself probably should not factor heavily into the decision.

Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management — ACCP evidence-based guideline abstract — reports that for individuals with stage IIIA or IIIB disease, good performance scores, and minimal weight loss, treatment with combined chemoradiotherapy results in better survival than radiotherapy alone. Consolidation chemotherapy or targeted therapy following definitive chemoradiation for stage IIIA is not supported, and neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery is neither clearly better nor clearly worse than definitive chemoradiation, although weak comparative data suggest a possible role if only lobectomy is needed in a center with a low perioperative mortality rate. The evidence supports routine platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy following complete resection of stage IIIA lung cancer encountered unexpectedly at surgery, and postoperative radiotherapy improves local control without improving survival. The guideline is based on systematic searches conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database for Systematic Review up to December 2011, focusing primarily on randomized trials, selected meta-analyses, practice guidelines, and reviews. Multimodality therapy is preferable in most subsets of patients with stage III lung cancer.

### ASTRO radiation therapy summary of the ASCO guideline on management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer [^1123g4cm]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop a radiation therapy summary of recommendations on the management of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on the Management of Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Guideline, which was endorsed by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).

Methods

The American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASTRO, and the American College of Chest Physicians convened a multidisciplinary panel to develop a guideline based on a systematic review of the literature and a formal consensus process, that has been separately published. A new panel consisting of radiation oncologists from the original guideline as well as additional ASTRO members was formed to provide further guidance to the radiation oncology community. A total of 127 articles met the eligibility criteria to answer 5 clinical questions. This summary focuses on the 3 radiation therapy questions (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and unresectable settings).

Results

Radiation-specific recommendations are summarized with additional relevant commentary on specific questions regarding the management of preoperative radiation, postoperative radiation, and combined chemoradiation.

Conclusions

Patients with stage III NSCLC who are planned for surgical resection, should receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation. The addition of neoadjuvant treatment is particularly important in patients planned for surgery in the N2 or superior sulcus settings. Postoperatively, patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be offered adjuvant chemotherapy. The use of postoperative radiation for completely resected N2 disease is not routinely recommended. Unresectable patients with stage III NSCLC should ideally be managed with combined concurrent chemoradiation using a platinum-based doublet with a standard radiation dose of 60 Gy followed by consolidation durvalumab in patients without progression after initial therapy. Patients who cannot tolerate a concurrent chemoradiation approach can be managed either by sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation or by dose-escalated or hypofractionated radiation alone.

### Foreword to' the current status and future perspectives on the management of stage III NSCLC: a focus on unresectable cancer treatment paradigms' [^1135aqUY]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease that presents a number of challenges for achieving optimal treatment outcomes. Stage III disease affects approximately one-third of patients diagnosed with NSCLC each year and prognosis is poor, with a low cure rate. The optimal treatment regimen for patients with NSCLC is most frequently multi-modal, with systemic and local therapies for distant and local disease control, respectively. The exact sequence and modality used is debated and case-specific. The first and most important question in the management of stage III NSCLC, whether the disease is potentially resectable or not, can often be difficult to answer. If the disease is resectable, surgery after preoperative treatment (chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT)) is an option, particularly in patients with optimal pulmonary function, mediastinal tumour clearance following upfront treatment and no requirements for pneumonectomy. However, for the remaining patients, or those who have been diagnosed with unresectable stage III NSCLC, platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) is the standard of care versus sequential CRT.

Stage III multimodality therapy — decision considerations and care setting emphasize that as the data do not permit the selection of one option or the other as superior, patient values and preferences should factor significantly in the decision, and all multimodality therapy should be performed in centers with experienced multidisciplinary teams that track their relevant clinical outcomes and are capable of minimizing and managing the toxicity and complications involved; further identification of patients more likely to benefit from surgical resection after induction therapy is not possible based upon pretreatment characteristics, and decisions to pursue surgical resection after induction therapy should be made prior to initiation of any therapy.

Future research priorities for stage III non-small cell lung cancer identify needs to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy at preventing systemic metastases, including interventions to reduce toxicity and improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy and studies that led to biomarker-based selection of optimum chemotherapeutic agents, and to define the role, if any, of consolidation therapy after combined chemoradiation, including a role for so-called targeted agents, with or without biomarker-based selection, in reducing the incidence of metastasis and prolonging overall survival. Additional priorities are to define the role, if any, of induction therapy prior to chemoradiation, including a role for so-called targeted agents, with or without biomarker-based selection, in reducing the incidence of metastasis and prolonging overall survival; define patient and tumor-specific characteristics that support the use of surgery for local control and that lead to improved outcomes compared with regimens that use radiotherapy as the means of local control; and define the role of IMRT or alternative fractionation schedules in improving the therapeutic index of thoracic radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy.

Stage III NSCLC patient selection caveats — bias and timing of factors: Patients are often selected for surgery because they have characteristics that predict a good prognosis, and this good prognosis is often incorrectly attributed to surgery; another issue is out-of-context application of data, including use of outcomes such as treatment response or mediastinal downstaging that cannot be used to predict results for all patients embarking on multimodality treatment; to guide treatment planning, selection factors must be identifiable at the time the treatment decision is made, and postresection final pathology is of no use for selecting patients for surgery.

Stage III non-small cell lung cancer management — chemoradiotherapy sequencing, surgical selection, and incidental N2 disease — states that administration of PCI or more aggressive chemoradiotherapy approaches should be done in the context of clinical trials, and sequential chemoradiotherapy can also be considered in patients with comorbid conditions or a poor performance status, but the balance of toxicity must be considered carefully. Palliative therapy (including thoracic radiotherapy) is appropriate for patients with an ECOG performance status of ≥ 2 in whom combination therapy would be prohibitively toxic. In patients with discrete nodal enlargement, the same approach of concurrent chemoradiotherapy is applicable, and similar results can be obtained with multimodality treatment that includes surgery; however, although groups have been suggested for surgery or in whom this should be avoided, the arguments are based on flawed or out-of-context data, and the only subgroup for which there are suggestive data comprises patients in whom complete resection can be achieved with a lobectomy. The choice of a multimodality treatment approach with or without surgery should be made according to patient preferences, a demonstrated institutional low operative mortality rate, and factors influencing the ability to achieve local control, and surgery as the primary or only treatment should not be undertaken. In patients thoroughly staged preoperatively but with N2 involvement discovered intraoperatively or postoperatively, resection should be carried out unless an R0 resection is not possible; adjuvant chemotherapy should be given, but the role of adjuvant radiotherapy is unclear.

### The current treatment landscape in the UK for stage III NSCLC [^115uym6L]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

For stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), approximately a third of patients survive up to 5 years, with decreasing 5-year survival rates for stage IIIB and stage IIIC disease. Although curable, stage III NSCLC encompasses a diverse range of disease presentation, with an equally complex range of multi-modal treatment options, including systemic and local therapies for distant and local disease control, respectively. This complexity results in a number of challenges for the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) in achieving optimal treatment outcomes for patients. As multi-modality treatment is the preferred treatment strategy for all stage III disease, the focus of this article is the key surgical, chemotherapy and radiotherapy clinical trials as well as guidelines that currently outline radical therapy options for patients with both potentially resectable and unresectable stage III NSCLC.

Stage III NSCLC curative‑intent strategies and randomized evidence: Curative‑intent treatment involves multimodal treatment; surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy alone is not optimal. Both chemoradiotherapy without surgery and chemotherapy (with or without radiation) with surgery are treatment options, and randomized controlled trials comparing multimodal treatment with or without surgery have demonstrated equivalent overall survival; trial eras and comparators varied, with three trials accruing mainly from 1990 to 2000 and two from 2000 to 2010, comparing surgery‑inclusive strategies against definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy in two trials and against sequential chemotherapy then radiotherapy in three trials.

ASCO stage III NSCLC sequential chemoradiation versus radiation alone — strong recommendation and supporting evidence: Recommendation 5.3 states patients not candidates for concurrent chemoradiation but candidates for chemotherapy "should be offered sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy over radiation alone" (Type: Evidence based; benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). A meta-analysis and systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials (1,936 patients) showed higher overall survival (pooled HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.84; P < .001) and higher progression-free survival (pooled HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.89; p = 0.002) with chemotherapy plus radiation versus radiation alone. In randomized trials, Dasgupta et al assigned 103 patients to radiation alone (65 Gy in 30 fractions) versus chemotherapy plus radiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions) with additional chemotherapy, and the chemotherapy-containing radiation arm had a decrease in distant metastases (48.6% v 62.5%). Kim et al randomized 101 patients to induction platinum-based chemotherapy followed by radiation versus radiation alone (60–65 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy fractions), with a trend toward improved overall survival (median 13.8 v 8.5 months) and, in stage IIIB nonsquamous, median survival 11.6 months with sequential chemoradiotherapy versus 8 months with radiotherapy alone (P = 0.046).

ASCO stage III NSCLC — unresectable disease, Recommendation 5.1: "Patients with stage III NSCLC who are medically or surgically inoperable and with good performance status should be offered concurrent instead of sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Type: Evidence based; benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)". Supporting data include pooled median survival 16.3 months with concurrent chemoradiation versus 13.9 months with sequential chemoradiation (median ratio 1.17; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.26) and decreased locoregional relapses (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.87). An individual-patient meta-analysis of six trials (1,205 patients) with median follow-up of 6 years showed a survival benefit for concurrent therapy (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.95; p = 0.004) with absolute survival benefits of 5.7% at 3 years and 4.5% at 5 years and reduced locoregional progression (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95; p = 0.01). Toxicity was higher with concurrent therapy, including hematologic and nonhematologic events; pooled RTOG trials (461 patients) reported more severe late nonhematologic toxicities (26% v 14%; p = 0.046). In RTOG 9410, concurrent standard-fractionation chemoradiation improved outcomes over sequential treatment (concurrent median 17.0 months, 5-year OS 16% and sequential median 14.6 months, 5-year OS 10%; p = 0.046). "Patients with a good performance status should receive concurrent chemoradiation over sequential chemoradiation", and "multidisciplinary tumor board review is recommended to assess patient fitness and risk of morbidities with concurrent as opposed to sequential therapy".

ASCO stage III non–small-cell lung cancer — consolidation durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation: Patients with stage III NSCLC receiving concurrent chemoradiation without disease progression during the initial therapy should be offered consolidation durvalumab for up to 12 months (Type: Evidence based; benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: high; benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: strong). There is insufficient evidence to alter this recommendation for molecularly defined subgroups (namely, patients with an oncogenic driver alteration or those with low or no expression of programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]). In the phase III randomized PACIFIC trial, consolidation durvalumab for 1 year versus placebo in 713 patients after definitive platinum-based chemoradiotherapy improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); patients were randomly assigned within 42 days of completing thoracic radiation. Median PFS was 16.8 months (95% CI, 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P < .001), and grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% in the durvalumab arm. With a median follow-up of 34.2 months, OS (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89) and PFS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.68) benefits persisted, with median OS 47.5 months versus 29.1 months, 5-year OS 42.9% versus 33.4%, and 5-year PFS 33.1% versus 19.0%, favoring durvalumab. A post hoc analysis of patients with PD-L1 data (63% of the trial; PD-L1–negative 20%) suggested a lack of benefit in PD-L1–negative tumors (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.62) and in EGFR-mutated patients (6% of the study population, n = 43; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.40 to 2.33), and certain authorities outside of the United States have restricted consolidation durvalumab to PD-L1–positive patients only.

The guideline notes that there have been multiple randomized controlled trials of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection, most included stage I-II NSCLC with older staging so data must be extrapolated to focus on stage III patients, and overall the results have been mixed, with several studies showing a benefit whereas others show little or mixed survival benefit. Representative trials include ANITA, which showed a 5-year OS benefit of 8.6% with adjuvant chemotherapy; IALT, which also showed a 5-year OS benefit although the effect was more muted at 4%; and ALPI, which did not demonstrate an OS benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.13; p = 0.589).

Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) after resected stage III (N2) NSCLC — meta-analyses in resected NSCLC indicated a survival detriment, and one meta-analysis suggested neither benefit nor harm for patients with N2 involvement; a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database review in 7,465 subjects suggested a survival benefit in N2. A small randomized controlled trial closed prematurely after enrolling only 40 patients and no trend toward a survival difference was seen. Although it appears that PORT might benefit some patients with N2 disease, presently, it cannot be recommended for unselected patients; it should be considered in selected patients at risk for local recurrence, especially as assessed by the surgeon performing the resection. The emphasis should be placed on administering adjuvant chemotherapy, which does have a proven survival benefit, and if radiotherapy is to be used, it should be given sequentially.

Stage III non-small cell lung cancer — platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (stages I-III) showed benefit over surgery alone (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97; p = 0.022), corresponding to an absolute benefit of 6% to 7% in stages IB to IIIA and 3% to 5% in IIIB. When European intergroup trial data were added, significance was lost (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–1.01; p = 0.07), and restricting to stage III yielded an HR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.51–1.07; p = 0.1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that surgery as the primary therapy for preoperatively identified N2 involvement is inferior to approaches involving neoadjuvant treatment.

### The role of surgery in stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer [^113bTAnj]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

For most patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a combination of chemotherapy and radiation represents the current treatment of choice. Recent developments include the use of adjuvant chemotherapy after up-front surgery in subgroups of patients who have stage III disease, as well as innovative ways to deliver concurrent chemoradiotherapy or combinations of chemotherapy with higher-dose conformal radiotherapy techniques. This article focuses on patients who have stage IIIA NSCLC and reviews the different possibilities for their treatment. Special emphasis is given to the inclusion of surgery into the different approaches to this disease stage. The current literature on this topic is reviewed, and the different aspects of surgical treatment in the management of stage IIIA NSCLC are discussed.

The landscape of care for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer continues to evolve. While some of the developments do not seem as dramatic as what has occurred in advanced disease in recent years, there is a continuous improvement in our ability to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately. We have an increased understanding of the diversity of early-stage disease and how to better tailor treatments to make them more tolerable without impacting efficacy. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Journal of Thoracic Oncology publish this annual update to help readers keep pace with these important developments. Experts in the care of early-stage lung cancer patients have provided focused updates across multiple areas including screening, pathology, staging, surgical techniques and novel technologies, adjuvant therapy, radiotherapy, surveillance, disparities, and quality of life. The source for information includes large academic meetings, the published literature, or novel unpublished data from other international oncology assemblies.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer [^112aZcp5]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is diagnosed in about 15% to 20% of lung cancer patients at presentation. In order to provide clinicians with guidance in decision making for early-stage NSCLC patients, the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria Lung Cancer Panel was recently charged with a review of the current published literature to generate up-to-date management recommendations for this clinical scenario. For patients with localized, mediastinal lymph node-negative NSCLC, optimal management should be determined by an expert multidisciplinary team. For medically operable patients, surgical resection is the standard of care, with generally no role for adjuvant therapies thereafter. For patients with medical comorbidities making them at high risk for surgery, there is emerging evidence demonstrating the availability of low toxicity curative therapies, such as stereotactic body radiotherapy, for their care. As a general statement, the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The current treatment landscape in the UK for stage III NSCLC [^112qGo6L]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) describes 'locally advanced' lung cancer where there are adverse prognostic features within the primary tumour (based on size, distribution or relationship to adjacent structures) and/or the presence of metastatic disease only within regional lymph nodes. A significant proportion of stage III NSCLC is made up of patients with N2 disease, where the primary tumour has metastasised to the ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes. Despite this burden of local disease, there are no distant metastases in stage III NSCLC and therefore treatment with radical intent can be considered. Stage III NSCLC is highly heterogeneous with a wide spectrum of disease distribution and an equally complex range of treatment options. In general, the optimal treatment regimen is multi-modal with systemic and local therapies for distant and local disease control, respectively. The exact sequence and modality used is keenly debated and highly case specific. Although treatment with radical intent is recommended in stage III NSCLC, the outcomes remain poor with only a small fraction of patients achieving a long-term response. In studies that evaluated multi-modality treatment in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and a good performance status (PS; defined as an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0–1), utilising modern day staging and treatment techniques, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 20%. New treatment regimens and techniques as well as fair and equal access to optimal treatment and expert teams, to minimise the risks and complications from treatment and to standardised practice, are key goals in addressing this critical issue.

POSTOPERATIVE TREATMENT

Postoperative radiotherapy

Radiotherapy is not indicated in patients with stage I and II N0-N1 tumours, if excision was complete (standard, level of evidence: A).

Lung cancer is one of the most lethal cancers, causing more deaths of men and women than any other cancer in the United States. Non-small-cell lung cancers account for most the newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer. Many patients with non-small-cell lung cancer present with advanced-stage disease and are not appropriate candidates for combined modality therapy. Although these patients have incurable disease, they have a chance of achieving improved 1-year survival rates and palliation of symptoms with chemotherapy. The performance status of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is the most important determinant of response to chemotherapy.

### Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, stage IIIB: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^113tBAwC]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based guidelines on best available treatment options for patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods

A review was conducted of published English-language (abstract or full text) phase II or phase III trials and guidelines from other organizations that address management of the various categories of stage IIIB disease. The literature search was provided by the Duke University Center for Clinical Health Policy Research and supplemented by any additional studies known by the authors.

Results

Surgery may be indicated for carefully selected patients with T4N0–1M0. Patients with N3 nodal involvement are not considered to be surgical candidates. For individuals with unresectable disease, good performance score, and minimal weight loss, treatment with combined chemoradiotherapy results in better survival than radiotherapy (RT) alone. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy seems to be associated with improved survival compared with sequential chemoradiotherapy. Multiple daily fractions of RT when combined with chemotherapy have not been shown to result in improved survival compared with standard once-daily RT combined with chemotherapy. The optimal chemotherapy agents and the number of cycles of treatment to combine with RT are uncertain.

Conclusion

Prospective trials are needed to answer important questions, such as the role of induction therapy in patients with potentially resectable stage IIIB disease. Future trials are needed to answer the questions of optimal chemotherapy agents and radiation fractionation schedule. The role of targeted novel agents in combination with chemoradiotherapy is just starting to be investigated.

### Combined modality therapy for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer [^116RRpFW]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

With 40,000 to 50,000 patients diagnosed annually, stage III lung cancer represents approximately one third of all non-small-cell lung cancer cases. It is a heterogeneous disease stage encompassing stage IIIa, for which surgery in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy represents a treatment strategy for select patients, and stage IIIb, for which chemoradiation represents the prevailing standard of care. Overcoming unacceptably high rates of intrathoracic tumor failures remains a central obstacle. Current clinical trial efforts focus on targeted therapies, new chemotherapy regimens, dose-escalated radiation therapy, and improvements in radiation therapy treatment delivery.

### Management of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111Fa2vS]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer remains the number one cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States and much of the world. This CHEST guideline examines the literature on primary treatment of patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the treatment options for patients with stage I/II NSCLC and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and grading of recommendations. A modified Delphi approach was used to reach consensus on recommendations.

Results

Based on 578 studies, the panel developed 17 recommendations.

Conclusions

The best treatment for average or low operative risk patients with stage I NSCLC remains surgical resection. In patients with stage I NSCLC, a minimally invasive approach is preferred over thoracotomy. For the first time, a meta-analysis comparing overall survival for patients with stage I lung cancer reveals an association between minimally invasive surgery and better patient outcomes. New evidence reveals equivalent overall survival for patients with peripheral ≤ 2 cm non-small cell lung cancer treated with a sublobar resection compared to lobectomy. To have confidence in the generalizability of these trials it is important to perform systematic intraoperative mediastinal and hilar lymph node sampling or dissection during operations for patients with stage I and II NSCLC. Use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected stage II NSCLC plus checkpoint inhibitors, including those patients with ≥ 4 cm node negative tumors, improves overall survival. In patients with resected stage IB (≥ 3 cm) and II epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancers, adjuvant targeted therapy improves overall survival. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is the preferred approach to patients with stage I NSCLC who are not considered appropriate candidates for surgical resection.

### Summary of' the current status and future perspectives on the management of stage III NSCLC: a focus on unresectable cancer treatment paradigms' [^1152iiGk]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment decisions with curative intent for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often require a complex decision process, and benefit from continuous communication of expertise among, and between, lung cancer teams. In stage III NSCLC that is deemed unresectable, and in some resectable cases, the ongoing consensus is that concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) is the most appropriate treatment. Despite this, there are still low numbers of patients with stage III disease who undergo multi-modality cCRT treatment in the United Kingdom, in comparison with other parts of the Europe. The poor outcomes and lack of access to optimal treatment is a call to arms for UK lung cancer teams to improve patient outcomes, through prehabilitation and rehabilitation, to ensure that patients have the best physiological reserve for multi-modality treatment. An experienced multi-disciplinary team is required to assess patient eligibility and deliver cCRT to ensure maximum access for this potentially curative strategy.

Radiotherapy is a modulator of the immune response and tumour microenvironment; emerging evidence suggests that radiotherapy triggers the patients' immune system to recognise the increase in T cell diversity. The synergistic effect between radiation and immune check point modulations has been demonstrated in multiple pre-clinical studies and has now been confirmed following the results of the Phase 3 PACIFIC trial, which demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival for adult patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC, whose tumours express PD-L1 on ≥ 1% of tumour cells, who received durvalumab (Imfinzi® ▼; AstraZeneca UK Limited), when their disease had not progressed following the completion of platinum-based cCRT. Based on these results, durvalumab offers a standard of care as consolidation therapy for such patients. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are approved for the treatment of patients with stage IV NSCLC and are being investigated in ongoing Phase II and III trials, in patients with stage III disease. Nivolumab was being investigated in a randomised controlled Phase III trial following cCRT (RTOG 3505; NCT02768558); however, this study was terminated in February 2019 because other treatments have been found to be efficacious, while pembrolizumab following cCRT demonstrated promising efficacy in an open-label Phase II trial in the same setting (LUN 14–179; NCT02343952).

### Current treatment paradigms for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^117PFAZS]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a multifaceted disease that is challenging to manage. The majority of patients can be appropriately treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy; however, a subset of stage III patients who are considered surgical candidates may require a modification of this plan. For example, a trimodal approach using chemoradiation followed by surgery may be beneficial for fit patients with bulky mediastinal disease who are candidates for lobectomy, whereas patients with minimal mediastinal nodal involvement may receive only chemotherapy before surgical resection. No standard chemotherapy exists for this group of stage IIIA resectable patients. Phase II data from studies employing neoadjuvant cisplatin combinations suggest that these regimens are active and well tolerated. For patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, concurrent chemoradiation is the standard of care at the present time for patients with good performance status, good pulmonary function tests, and an acceptable volume of normal lung receiving 20 Gy (V20). To manage distant micrometastasis further, induction and consolidation regimens are under investigation during which full-dose chemotherapy is administered either before (as induction) or after (as consolidation) concurrent chemoradiotherapy. To date, consolidation docetaxel after concurrent etoposide, cisplatin and thoracic radiation has shown encouraging survival results in a large Southwest Oncology Group phase II trial. This article will review the current treatment strategies for stage III NSCLC.

### Evaluation and management of patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small-cell lung cancer [^115GhWKb]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Management of the stage IIIA (N2) patient remains one of the most controversial areas in thoracic oncology. The potential curability of at least some of these patients has encouraged the development of more complex, aggressive, and toxic multimodality treatment regimens.
