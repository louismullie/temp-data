## Question

Apthous ulcers treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about aphthous ulcer treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and its subtypes. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and classify treatments by hierarchy. Next, I will examine first-line topical therapies, followed by second-line systemic options. After that, I need to consider special populations and contexts, including HIV, Behçet's disease, and pediatrics. Finally, I should integrate supportive care, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while noting uncertainties and where evidence is weak or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and classification, because treatment hinges on severity and phenotype. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) presents with painful, round, shallow ulcers on nonkeratinized mucosa, typically healing in 7–14 days without scarring; major aphthae are larger, deeper, longer-lasting, and may scar, while herpetiform ulcers are numerous and small, sometimes coalescing, and can be particularly painful [^112gPCMA] [^115AZoga]. Hold on, I should verify the epidemiology and context: RAS affects roughly 10–25% of the general population, with peaks in children and young adults, and is associated with immune dysregulation and, in some cases, systemic disease or nutritional deficiencies, which I need to keep in mind as I plan therapy [^114t53bk] [^117W79cM].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to avoid overinterpreting small studies. High-quality evidence is limited; most data come from small RCTs, observational studies, and expert reviews, and the Cochrane review of systemic therapies concludes that no single intervention has definitive benefit due to heterogeneity and methodological limitations, so I need to be cautious and transparent about certainty [^117GEAaG]. Wait, let me verify the topical evidence base as well: systematic reviews suggest topical corticosteroids and certain antimicrobials can reduce pain and duration, but recurrence is not reliably altered, reinforcing a symptom-targeted approach rather than disease modification [^115AZoga] [^115zppZ3].

> I will now examine first-line topical therapies, starting with corticosteroids, because multiple guidelines converge here. Topical corticosteroids are first-line to reduce pain and accelerate healing; options include medium- to high-potency gels or pastes such as fluocinonide, triamcinolone acetonide in carboxymethylcellulose paste, or dexamethasone ointment, with RCT data supporting faster healing and pain reduction versus placebo and minimal systemic absorption in short courses [^115Z76wi] [^112gPCMA]. Hold on, I should verify safety: serum dexamethasone was undetectable in a large multicenter trial, supporting local safety when used as directed, though I still need to counsel on local risks and avoidance in certain infections [^115Z76wi].

> Let me consider topical antiseptics next, because they are often recommended adjuncts. Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash can reduce the severity of an episode but does not reduce recurrence, so I should frame it as supportive rather than disease-modifying; it also helps with oral hygiene and secondary infection risk mitigation [^112gPCMA] [^115AZoga]. Wait, I should double-check that I'm not overstating benefit: yes, the effect is modest and primarily on symptom burden during flares, not on frequency or remission, which aligns with guideline positions [^112gPCMA].

> I need to check topical analgesics and protective agents for short-term pain control. Viscous lidocaine 2% can provide transient pain relief and improve oral intake, though evidence is limited and aspiration risk must be considered, especially in children; coating agents and bland rinses may help with contact pain but do not treat inflammation, so I should position them as adjuncts to anti-inflammatory therapy [^1149bHvx] [^112Y51PW]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not implying disease modification with these agents; correct, they are purely symptomatic and should be used judiciously [^112Y51PW].

> Now, I should review second-line systemic therapies for frequent, severe, or refractory disease, keeping in mind the weak evidence base. Systemic corticosteroids such as prednisone can shorten severe flares but do not change recurrence and carry risks with chronic use, so they should be reserved for short courses in major RAS or complex aphthosis, ideally with steroid-sparing plans thereafter [^114L3zWB] [^1129nbRU]. Let me reconsider the balance: yes, brief systemic steroids can be justified for quality-of-life–impairing episodes, but long-term reliance is inappropriate given adverse effects and lack of remission benefit [^114L3zWB].

> Colchicine is a key steroid-sparing option I should evaluate, particularly for complex aphthosis or Behçet-spectrum disease. Observational and retrospective series suggest colchicine reduces frequency and duration of oral ulcers, with pediatric cohorts showing significant clinical and laboratory improvements; however, high-quality RCT data are limited, so I should present it as a reasonable option with a favorable safety profile when monitored [^114L3zWB] [^114jHEPJ]. Wait, let me verify dosing and monitoring: typical adult dosing is 0.6–1.2 mg/day with attention to GI intolerance and cytopenias, and pediatric use is supported by cohort data though not by large RCTs, which I should disclose to families [^114L3zWB] [^114jHEPJ].

> Dapsone is another agent I should consider, particularly in combination with colchicine for refractory cases. Retrospective data suggest that dapsone alone has limited efficacy but adds benefit when combined with colchicine, with acceptable safety under hematologic monitoring; again, this is low-certainty evidence, so shared decision-making is essential [^114L3zWB]. I should confirm baseline labs and counsel on hemolysis risk, especially in G6PD-deficient patients, before initiating therapy [^1129nbRU].

> Thalidomide has documented efficacy in severe, refractory RAS and HIV-associated aphthae, but I need to emphasize its toxicity and regulatory constraints. Case series and clinical experience show rapid ulcer control in many patients, yet peripheral neuropathy, sedation, and teratogenicity mandate strict risk mitigation; use is generally reserved for specialists after failure of safer options, with REMS compliance and contraception counseling [^114CuhMg] [^1154mYGo]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating recurrence prevention: intermittent low-dose thalidomide failed to prevent recurrences in HIV, underscoring that it treats active disease rather than preventing flares [^114dBhVN].

> Apremilast, a PDE4 inhibitor, is an emerging option with promising signals in Behçet's disease and case-level evidence in RAS. Phase 3 data in Behçet's show high rates of ulcer clearance by week 12, and case reports in RAS demonstrate rapid responses; gastrointestinal adverse effects are common but often manageable, and I should consider it when available and appropriate, recognizing off-label status for RAS [^112d7D4k] [^113FaueZ]. Wait, let me verify pediatric data: there are pediatric case reports of benefit, but high-quality pediatric RCTs are lacking, so I should proceed cautiously and document informed consent [^111QKGKu].

> Roflumilast, another PDE4 inhibitor, has been explored where apremilast is unavailable; observational cohorts report about 70% response with low-dose regimens, but adverse effects are frequent and require dose adjustments, so I should treat this as investigational and not a substitute for better-supported options when available [^1172C6y1] [^113vZkVK]. I should double-check that I'm not extrapolating beyond the data: correct, these are retrospective, uncontrolled studies, so conclusions are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^1172C6y1].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts, starting with HIV-associated aphthae. Topical corticosteroids remain first-line, but thalidomide has the most robust evidence for refractory HIV-associated ulcers; however, neuropathy and other toxicities require careful selection and monitoring, and intermittent low-dose thalidomide does not prevent recurrence, so expectations should be set accordingly [^1129wN2A] [^114dBhVN]. But wait, what if topical therapy suffices? Many patients do respond to optimized topical care, so I should escalate thoughtfully rather than defaulting to thalidomide [^1129wN2A].

> For pediatric RAS, I need to ensure safety-first choices. Topical corticosteroids and antiseptics are appropriate first-line, and for frequent or severe disease, colchicine is a reasonable systemic option supported by pediatric cohorts; thalidomide is generally avoided in children due to toxicity, and apremilast remains off-label with limited pediatric data, so I should reserve it for exceptional refractory cases after specialist input [^114jHEPJ] [^1154mYGo]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm aligning with pediatric guidance: yes, most pediatric sources prioritize topicals and colchicine, with systemic steroids reserved for short rescue courses [^notfound].

> In Behçet's disease and complex aphthosis, I should confirm that management extends beyond the mouth. Colchicine is first-line for mucocutaneous disease, with escalation to azathioprine, apremilast, or TNF-alpha inhibitors for refractory cases; topical corticosteroids and antiseptics remain adjuncts for oral pain and hygiene, and multidisciplinary care is often needed [^111P5g8B] [^112Z6egr]. I need to ensure I screen for systemic involvement and coordinate with ophthalmology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology as indicated [^111P5g8B].

> Let me consider supportive and preventive strategies that patients can implement, because they meaningfully affect quality of life. Avoidance of mechanical or dietary triggers, maintenance of excellent oral hygiene, and use of non–sodium lauryl sulfate toothpaste can reduce irritation; bland rinses and topical analgesics can be used strategically during flares, and patients should be counseled that most ulcers heal spontaneously within 1–2 weeks [^111P5g8B] [^112gPCMA]. I should confirm that I'm not implying these replace anti-inflammatory therapy; they complement it and are especially helpful in minor RAS [^112gPCMA].

> I should double-check nutritional contributors, because correcting deficiencies can reduce recurrence in some patients. Meta-analytic data associate RAS with higher odds of vitamin B12, folate, and iron deficiency, and a randomized trial suggested B12 supplementation reduced outbreaks regardless of baseline B12 level; however, evidence quality varies, so I should tailor testing to risk factors and diet, and avoid overpromising benefit [^114t53bk] [^114tgP4H]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: supplementation is reasonable when deficiencies are documented, but routine supplementation without deficiency is not firmly evidence-based [^114t53bk].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm and ensure it aligns with the evidence. For minor RAS, start with topical corticosteroids and consider topical antiseptics; for major RAS or frequent recurrences, add or escalate to systemic options such as colchicine, and consider short courses of systemic steroids for severe flares; for refractory disease, consider dapsone combinations, thalidomide in specialized settings, or PDE4 inhibitors where available; throughout, address triggers, nutrition, and oral care, and reassess periodically for evolution into systemic disease [^114t53bk] [^1129nbRU]. I need to ensure I emphasize that recurrence is common and that no therapy reliably prevents flares, which shapes expectations and follow-up planning [^117GEAaG].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions so we do not overstate current capabilities. High-quality head-to-head trials are sparse, heterogeneity in outcomes and populations limits comparability, and emerging agents like PDE4 inhibitors or biologics require larger RCTs in RAS specifically; shared decision-making, careful monitoring, and individualized therapy remain essential while evidence continues to evolve [^117GEAaG] [^117W79cM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that apremilast is FDA-approved for RAS; to be precise, it is approved for psoriatic disease and Behçet's, with RAS use off-label and supported by case series and extrapolation from Behçet's data, which I should make clear to patients [^112d7D4k].

Aphthous ulcers are best managed with **topical corticosteroids as first-line** [^114t53bk] to reduce pain and speed healing [^115Z76wi]; options include triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% paste or dexamethasone 0.1% mouth rinse, applied 2–4 times daily until resolution [^notfound]. For pain, use **topical anesthetics** (e.g. 2% viscous lidocaine) before meals [^1149bHvx] and consider topical antiseptics (e.g. chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash) to reduce secondary infection and duration [^112gPCMA]. Systemic therapy is reserved for severe, recurrent, or refractory cases: colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily [^notfound], dapsone 50–100 mg/day, or thalidomide 50–100 mg/day (with strict REMS) [^114CuhMg] are options; apremilast 30 mg twice daily is effective in Behçet-associated disease [^112d7D4k]. Address triggers (stress, trauma, acidic foods), maintain oral hygiene, and consider vitamin B12 or iron if deficient [^114t53bk] [^114tgP4H]. Most ulcers heal in 7–14 days [^112gPCMA]; persistent or atypical lesions warrant evaluation for systemic disease [^1129nbRU].

## Topical therapies (first-line)

Topical therapies are the cornerstone of aphthous ulcer management, providing localized relief and promoting healing [^114t53bk].

| **Medication** | **Formulation** | **Dosage and application** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Triamcinolone acetonide | 0.1% paste | Apply 2–4 times daily until resolution | Reduces pain and accelerates healing [^notfound] |
| Dexamethasone | 0.1% mouth rinse | Rinse for 2 minutes, then expectorate; 2–4 times daily | Effective in reducing ulcer size and pain [^115Z76wi] |
| Fluocinonide | 0.05% gel | Apply 2–4 times daily until resolution | Effective in reducing inflammation and pain [^notfound] |
| Clobetasol | 0.05% ointment | Apply 2–4 times daily until resolution | Effective in severe or refractory cases [^1168BwKW] |

---

### Topical anesthetics

Topical anesthetics provide short-term pain relief, particularly before meals [^1149bHvx].

- **Lidocaine 2% viscous solution**: Apply 5–10 minutes before meals; avoid excessive use to prevent systemic absorption.
- **Benzocaine 20% gel**: Apply as needed for pain relief; avoid in patients with methemoglobinemia risk.

---

### Antiseptic mouthwashes

Antiseptic mouthwashes reduce secondary infection and may shorten ulcer duration [^notfound].

- **Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12%**: Rinse for 30 seconds, twice daily.
- **Hydrogen peroxide 1.5%**: Mix with equal parts water; rinse for 30 seconds, twice daily.

---

## Systemic therapies (second-line)

Systemic therapies are reserved for severe, recurrent, or refractory cases, particularly when topical treatments fail or ulcers are numerous and debilitating [^1129nbRU].

| **Medication** | **Dosage** | **Efficacy** | **Adverse effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Colchicine | 0.6 mg twice daily | Reduces frequency and duration of ulcers | Gastrointestinal upset, myelosuppression |
| Dapsone | 50–100 mg daily | Effective in reducing ulcer burden | Hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis |
| Thalidomide | 50–100 mg daily | Highly effective in refractory cases | Teratogenicity, peripheral neuropathy, sedation |
| Apremilast | 30 mg twice daily | Effective in Behçet-associated ulcers | Gastrointestinal upset, weight loss |

---

## Adjunctive and supportive therapies

Adjunctive therapies and lifestyle modifications can significantly improve patient comfort and reduce recurrence.

- **Vitamin B12 supplementation**: Effective in patients with documented deficiency [^114tgP4H].
- **Iron supplementation**: Consider if iron deficiency is present [^114t53bk].
- **Stress management**: Counseling and stress reduction techniques may reduce recurrence.
- **Dietary modifications**: Avoid acidic, spicy, and rough foods during active ulcers.

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies show promise but require further research. Low-dose **roflumilast** (0.25 mg/day) has shown efficacy in refractory cases [^1172C6y1], and **low-level laser therapy** has demonstrated rapid pain relief and accelerated healing in small studies [^1162ngjK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, starting with topical corticosteroids and escalating to systemic therapies if necessary [^114t53bk]. Topical corticosteroids are **first-line** [^114t53bk]; systemic therapies are reserved for refractory cases [^1129nbRU]; and patient education on triggers and oral hygiene is essential [^111P5g8B].

---

## Conclusion

Aphthous ulcers are best managed with **topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy** [^114t53bk], with topical anesthetics and antiseptics for symptomatic relief [^1149bHvx] [^112gPCMA]. Systemic therapies such as colchicine, dapsone, thalidomide, and apremilast are reserved for severe or refractory cases [^1129nbRU]. Adjunctive measures, including vitamin supplementation, stress management, and dietary modifications, can reduce recurrence and improve patient comfort [^114tgP4H].

### Systemic interventions for recurrent aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers) [^117GEAaG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most frequent form of oral ulceration, characterised by recurrent oral mucosal ulceration in an otherwise healthy individual. At its worst RAS can cause significant difficulties in eating and drinking. Treatment is primarily aimed at pain relief and the promotion of healing to reduce the duration of the disease or reduce the rate of recurrence. A variety of topical and systemic therapies have been utilised.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effect of systemic interventions in the reduction of pain associated with RAS, a reduction in episode duration or frequency.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches of: Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers (to 6 June 2012); CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library (to Issue 4, 2012); MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 6 June 2012); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 6 June 2012); CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 6 June 2012); and AMED via PubMed (1950 to 6 June 2012). We searched reference lists from relevant articles and contacted the authors of eligible trials to identify further trials and obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which the primary outcome measures assess a reduction of pain associated with RAS, a reduction in episode duration or a reduction in episode frequency. Trials were not restricted by outcome alone. We also included RCTs of a cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data in duplicate. We contacted trial authors for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. We carried out risk of bias assessment on six domains. We followed The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines and risk ratio (RR) values were to be calculated using fixed-effect models (if two or three trials in each meta-analysis) or random-effects models (if four or more trials in each meta-analysis).

Main Results

A total of 25 trials were included, 22 of which were placebo controlled and eight made head-to-head comparisons (five trials had more than two treatment arms). Twenty-one different interventions were assessed. The interventions were grouped into two categories: immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory and uncertain. Only one study was assessed as being at low risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

No single treatment was found to be effective and therefore the results remain inconclusive in regard to the best systemic intervention for RAS. This is likely to reflect the poor methodological rigour of trials, and lack of studies for certain drugs, rather than the true effect of the intervention. It is also recognised that in clinical practice, individual drugs appear to work for individual patients and so the interventions are likely to be complex in nature. In addition, it is acknowledged that systemic interventions are often reserved for those patients who have been unresponsive to topical treatments, and therefore may represent a select group of patients.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of aphthous stomatitis [^1129nbRU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are the most common oral mucosal lesions in the general population. These often are recurrent and periodic lesions that cause clinically significant morbidity. Many suggestions have been proposed but the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is unknown. Several precipitating factors for aphthous ulcers appear to operate in subjects with genetic predisposition. An autoimmune or hypersensitivity mechanism is widely considered possible. Sometimes aphthous ulcers can be the sign of systemic diseases, so it is essential to establish a correct diagnosis to determine suitable therapy. Before initiating medications for aphthous lesions, clinicians should determine whether well-recognized causes are contributing to the disease and these factors should be corrected. Various treatment modalities are used, but no therapy is definitive. Topical medications, such as antimicrobial mouth-washes and topical corticosteroids (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, fluocinonide, or clobetasol), can achieve the primary goal to reduce pain and to improve healing time but do not improve recurrence or remission rates. Systemic medications can be tried if topical therapy is ineffective.

### Topical treatments for HIV-related oral ulcers [^1154zfMJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In HIV-infected adults, oral ulcers occur more frequently, last longer and produce more painful symptoms than in immunocompetent people. Oral aphthous ulcers observed during the course of HIV infection may be severe and can result in significant morbidity in these patients. Such manifestations may interfere with oral functions and alter patients' quality of life.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and side effects of topical agents used in the treatment of HIV-related oral aphthous ulcers in adults.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched from the year 1980 to May 2011 for randomised controlled trials involving managements of oral ulcers, apthouses in HIV infected adults: EMBASE, PUBMED, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL).

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of any topical agent in treating HIV oral aphthous ulcerations in HIV positive adults were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the potentially eligible studies for inclusion. We did not find any studies that meet our eligibility criteria. Therefore, no analysis was performed.

Main Results

A total of 233 abstracts were retrieved from the databases searched. None of the identified studies met our inclusion criteria. Ten of the studies identified were reports of systemic rather than topical treatment. Therefore, no studies were included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a need for well designed studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical agents for the treatment of HIV related oral aphthous ulcers.

### Aphthous ulcers [^112Pi1FQ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are one of the most common oral diseases worldwide. Their clinical presentation is characterized by multiple, recurrent, small, round, or ovoid ulcers with circumscribed margins and erythematous haloes present in different sizes. Oral lesions similar to aphthous ulcers may be present in several systemic diseases. This article will summarize the differential diagnosis of aphthous ulceration, with emphasis on a practical guide for the management of recurrent aphthous ulceration, including topical and systemic therapy.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a comprehensive review and recommendations on therapeutic options [^112c8dvn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common chronic disease in the oral mucosa that affects about 20% of the population. It is characterized by solitary or multiple, recurrent, small ulcers with erythematous haloes and yellow/gray floors. RAS can be managed through a wide variety of preventative measures and therapies, intending to reduce ulcer pain, stimulate ulcer healing, and/or prevent ulcer recurrence. First-line treatment options include topical medications in the form of corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide), anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox), antibiotics (doxycycline), and antiseptics (lidocaine). In more severe cases of RAS where local treatment is insufficient, systemic drugs in the form of corticosteroids (prednisone), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide), and antibiotics/antimicrobials (clofazimine) can prove effective. This review will summarize current treatment options for RAS with discussion of prevention, topical measures, natural treatments, systemic therapies, and new potential therapies. Furthermore, this review will provide recommendations on therapeutic options for RAS based on disease severity and patient circumstances.

### Comprehensive management of major aphthous ulcer [^113gqHCN]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers are the most prevalent oral mucosal disease, but the subset major aphthous ulcer is a less frequent type. These ulcers are refractory, may persist for several weeks to months, and interfere with the normal state of health. The aetiology is multifactorial and so is the treatment. We present a case of an adolescent male patient reported with multiple oral ulcers. He developed three ulcers simultaneously and suffered for 10 months despite using topical medications prescribed by different dental practitioners. We executed a multidisciplinary treatment approach that resulted in a long-term disease-free state. The treatment methods followed in our case could be a successful model to implement by medical practitioners and oral physicians when the situation demands.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^116ejDW2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis remains a commonly occurring cause of oral pain and ulceration. Although the ulcerations of RAS are multifactorial and of unknown cause, recognition of the role of patient and environmental factors may be helpful in developing recommendations for treatment and prevention of future ulcers.

### Refractory aphthous ulceration treated with thalidomide: a report of 10 years' clinical experience [^114CuhMg]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Thalidomide has reported efficacy in treating refractory idiopathic aphthous ulceration and aphthous ulceration in Behçet disease (BD). However, because of its potential teratogenicity and neurotoxicity, thalidomide must be used and monitored carefully. We report our experience of using thalidomide over the past 10 years in patients referred within our region with severe refractory aphthous ulceration, and their response to treatment and side-effects. In our experience, thalidomide works well for severe refractory aphthous ulceration, with a typical patient response reported within 4 weeks, but its use is limited by neurotoxicity. The aphthous ulceration occurring in the context of BD was more difficult to control than idiopathic aphthous ulceration.

### Aphthous ulcers: a difficult clinical entity [^115ZbKvT]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2000). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) are the most common oral ulcerative disease, affecting 10% to 20% of the population. There are 3 clinical subtypes-minor, major, and herpetiform. Minor aphthous ulcers are the most common subtype, representing 80% to 90% of all recurrent aphthous ulcers. Clinically, RAU present as extremely painful, shallow ulcerations with an erythematous halo on unattached oral mucosa. The primary differential diagnosis is oral herpes simplex. The etiology of RAU is unknown. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy.

### Silver nitrate cautery in aphthous stomatitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148NLR4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Aphthous stomatitis is a painful, recurrent disease of the oral mucous membrane. Silver nitrate sticks have been used for a long time to provide pain relief for the duration of an aphthous ulceration, with only one application. Silver nitrate causes chemical cauterization and increases the depth of injury.

Objectives

To study the effect of chemical cautery with silver nitrate in reducing pain of aphthous ulceration and to determine if this treatment shortens or prolongs healing.

Methods

In a randomized, patient-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 97 patients with painful minor oral aphthous ulceration were randomized to receive silver nitrate cautery or placebo. The severity of pain was rated on a three-category scale (severe, mild, none) and was recorded each day until the seventh day after the procedure. The lesion size was recorded at the time of the procedure and on the seventh day afterwards. In the treatment group, the ulcer was gently painted with a silver nitrate stick until it turned white. In the placebo group, the ulcer was gently painted with a placebo stick.

Results

In the treatment group, 33 of 47 patients (70%) evaluated and in the placebo group, four of 38 patients (11%) evaluated had reduction in severity of pain 1 day after the procedure. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). On the seventh day after the procedure, the ulcers were completely re-epithelialized in 39 patients (83%) in the treatment group and in 34 patients (89%) in the placebo group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.39).

Conclusions

The results of our study showed that one application of silver nitrate can decrease the severity of pain in aphthous ulceration without significantly shortening or prolonging healing time. We did not observe any side-effects in our study. The effect is rapid and lasts for the duration of the lesion. The treatment is simple and cost-effective in patients with infrequent recurrences.

### Management strategies for HIV-associated aphthous stomatitis [^1129wN2A]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common oral mucosal disorder found in men and women of all ages, races, and geographic regions. There are three forms of the lesions (minor, major, and herpetiform), with major aphthous ulcers causing significant pain and potential for scarring. In HIV-infected individuals, these ulcers occur more frequently, last longer, and produce more painful symptoms than in immunocompetent persons. In addition, they may be associated with similar ulcerations involving the esophagus, rectum, anus, and genitals. The diagnosis of HIV-induced RAS requires a careful history of the condition, and a thorough extra- and intra-oral examination. Oral mucosal biopsies are required for non-healing ulcers in order to exclude the possibility of deep fungal infections, viral infections, and neoplasms. The cause of the ulcers in HIV-positive persons has not been elucidated — local diseases, genetic, immunologic, and infectious factors all probably play a role. The goals of current treatments are to promote ulcer healing, to reduce ulcer duration and pain while maintaining nutritional intake, and to prevent or diminish the frequency of recurrence. Initial therapy for infrequent RAS recurrences includes over-the-counter topical protective and analgesic products. Initial therapy for frequent RAS outbreaks requires topical anesthetics, binding agents, and corticosteroids. Major RAS and non-healing minor or herpetiform RAS may require intralesional corticosteroids and systemic prednisone. Second-line immunomodulators for frequent and non-healing ulcers includes thalidomide and other immunomodulators.

### Behçet disease: new aspects [^115aqgq2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Behçet disease is currently considered an "autoinflammatory disease" triggered by infection and environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Although the disease is characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers and ocular involvement, it can affect multiple organ systems. Complex aphthosis is characterized by recurrent oral and/or genital aphthous ulcers. It is important to evaluate the patient with complex aphthosis for Behçet disease and related systemic disorders. We discuss the etiopathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches for complex aphthosis and Behçet disease in light of the current literature.

### Interventions for the management of oral ulcers in Behçet's disease [^112Z6egr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis that can affect multiple systems. Mucocutaneous involvement is common, as is the involvement of many other systems such as the central nervous system and skin. Behç̧et's disease can cause significant morbidity, such as loss of sight, and can be life threatening. The frequency of oral ulceration in Behçet's disease is thought to be 97% to 100%. The presence of mouth ulcers can cause difficulties in eating, drinking, and speaking leading to a reduction in quality of life. There is no cure for Behçet's disease and therefore treatment of the oral ulcers that are associated with Behçet's disease is palliative.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of interventions on the pain, episode duration, and episode frequency of oral ulcers and on quality of life for patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)-type ulceration associated with Behçet's disease.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 4 October 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 4 October 2013); EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 4 October 2013); CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 4 October 2013); and AMED via Ovid (1985 to 4 October 2013). We searched the US National Institutes of Health trials register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication in the searches of the electronic databases. We contacted authors when necessary to obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at pre-specified oral outcome measures to assess the efficacy of interventions for mouth ulcers in Behçet's disease. The oral outcome measures included pain, episode duration, episode frequency, safety, and quality of life. Trials were not restricted by outcomes alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent data extraction and an assessment of risk of bias, independently by two review authors and using a pre-standardised data extraction form. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

A total of 15 trials (n = 888 randomised participants) were included, 13 were placebo controlled and three were head to head (two trials had more than two treatment arms). Eleven of the trials were conducted in Turkey, two in Japan, one in Iran and one in the UK. Most trials used the International Study Group criteria for Behçet's disease. Eleven different interventions were assessed. The interventions were grouped into two categories, topical and systemic. Only one study was assessed as being at low risk of bias. It was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low and there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any included intervention with regard to pain, episode duration, or episode frequency associated with oral ulcers, or safety of the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the heterogeneity of trials including trial design, choice of intervention, choice and timing of outcome measures, it was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. Several interventions show promise and future trials should be planned and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. Whilst the primary aim of many trials for Behç̧et's disease is not necessarily reduction of oral ulceration, reporting of oral ulcers in these studies should be standardised and pre-specified in the methodology. The use of a core outcome set for oral ulcer trials would be beneficial.

### Efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment on recurrent aphthous ulceration [^115Z76wi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Recurrent aphthous ulceration is the most common oral mucosal lesion and may be associated with many systemic diseases. Topical corticosteroids are used frequently for recurrent aphthous ulceration; however, the number of high-quality clinical experiments available is insufficient, and no reports exist on the blood level of corticosteroids after topical usage in the oral mucosa. The objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulceration and detect serum dexamethasone concentrations in the patients.

Methods

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter clinical trial was conducted in 5 centers to compare the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment with placebo. There were 810 patients with minor recurrent aphthous ulcerations screened for study eligibility, and 240 patients were enrolled at 5 centers from March 1, 2009 to April 30, 2010; 120 were assigned randomly to the treatment group and 120 to a control group. Patients were instructed to apply the given agent to the identified ulcer 3 times a day (after meals) for 5 days. The size, pain level, healing ratio, and average duration of ulcers and the safety of the agents were evaluated. The serum concentration of dexamethasone was detected using a high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry assay.

Results

The results showed that baseline characteristics were similar (P > .5). At day 6 ± 2 after treatment, there was significant difference in the variation of ulcer size between the treatment group (7.167 ± 6.3415 mm²) and the control group (4.346 ± 7.0666 mm²; P = 0.000); and in the variation of pain level between the treatment group (5.623 ± 1.9570) and the control group (4.940 ± 2.2449; P = 0.001). The healing ratio was 83.33% in the treatment group and 54.70% in the control group (P = 0.000). No severe adverse reactions were observed. No serum dexamethasone was detected before or after the use of the agents (< 0.502 ng/mL).

Conclusion

Dexamethasone ointment was efficient in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulceration and was safe as evaluated using clinical assessment and serum level detection.

### Apremilast for treatment of recalcitrant aphthous stomatitis [^114LYFCa]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Observation

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common cause of recurrent oral ulcers, which often leads to significant impairment of a patient's quality of life. The underlying pathogenic mechanism remains unclear, and no treatment modality is uniformly effective. In this report, we describe the use of apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in treatment of recalcitrant RAS.

### Effectiveness of vitamin B12 in treating recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114tgP4H]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), the most common oral mucosa lesions seen in primary care, is up to 25% in the general population. However, there has been no optimal therapeutic approach. Our objective was to confirm our previous clinical observation of the beneficial treatment of RAS with vitamin B(12).

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done using primary care patients. A sublingual a dose of 1000 mcg of vitamin B(12) was used in patients in the intervention group for 6 months.

Results

In total, 58 patients suffering from RAS participated in the study: 31 were included in the intervention group and 27 were included in control group. All parameters of RAS among patients in the intervention group were recorded and compared with the control group. The duration of outbreaks, the number of ulcers, and the level of pain were reduced significantly (P < .05) at 5 and 6 months of treatment with vitamin B(12), regardless of initial vitamin B(12) levels in the blood. During the last month of treatment a significant number of participants in the intervention group reached "no aphthous ulcers status" (74.1% vs 32.0%; P < .01).

Conclusion

Vitamin B(12) treatment, which is simple, inexpensive, and low-risk, seems to be effective for patients suffering from RAS, regardless of the serum vitamin B(12) level.

### Complex aphthosis and Behçet's disease [^114u5tww]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Complex aphthosis is a disorder in which patients develop recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers or almost constant, multiple oral aphthae, without manifestations of systemic disease. Behçet's disease is a multisystem disease characterized clinically by oral and genital aphthae, arthritis, cutaneous lesions, and ocular, gastrointestinal, and neurologic manifestations. This article reviews both disorders, including their clinical and histologic presentations, factors in pathogenesis, and includes an overview of therapeutic modalities.

### Thalidomide in low intermittent doses does not prevent recurrence of human immunodeficiency virus-associated aphthous ulcers [^114dBhVN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of thalidomide in reduced, intermittent doses for preventing recurrences of oral and esophageal aphthous ulcers in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Forty-nine HIV-infected patients whose ulcers previously had healed as a result of thalidomide therapy were randomly assigned to receive either 100 mg of oral thalidomide or placebo 3 times per week for 6 months. Ulcers recurred in 14 (61%) of 23 thalidomide-randomized patients, compared with 11 (42%) of 26 placebo-randomized patients, with no significant difference in the median time to recurrence of ulcers (P = 0.221). There were no changes in plasma levels of HIV RNA, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and soluble TNF receptor II at the time of ulcer recurrence. Adverse events among patients treated with thalidomide included neutropenia (5 patients), rash (5 patients), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (3 patients). Thalidomide in lower intermittent doses is ineffective at preventing recurrence of aphthous ulcers in HIV-infected persons.

### Roflumilast for oral ulcers in Behçet's disease and recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^112s68cc]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Outcome Measures

Clinical effectiveness and safety were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary outcome was categorized into complete remission (CR) for no new oral ulcers in the last 4 weeks, partial response (PR) for improved symptoms but with new oral ulcers, and non‐responder (NR) for no improvement. Secondary outcomes included ulcer activity, assessed through a patient questionnaire on lesion count, total new lesions in the last 4 weeks, lesion duration of a single lesion, persistent duration of overall oral ulcer, and pain severity using a numeric rating scale (NRS). In addition, modified composite index scores for oral ulcer activity were retrieved. Safety was measured by tracking adverse events (AEs) after initiation, with discontinuation recorded as intolerable AEs. Outcome measures were written in a standardized, predetermined medical record format.

### Role of drug exposure in aphthous ulcers: a case-control study [^116oR26A]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Drug-induced aphthous ulcers have been the subject of several isolated and heterogeneous case reports for the last three decades.

Objectives

To perform a case-control study to evaluate the risks linked to drug exposure in aphthous ulcers.

Methods

Eighty patients with typical clinical patterns of aphthous ulcers and 152 control patients who had had consultations for skin tumours were studied. A standardized questionnaire, concerning clinical features, life-style and medications taken during the last month, was completed for each patient.

Results

Case patients had a much higher intake of medications than control patients, respectively, 5.1 and 2. 8 medications per patient (P < 0.0001). Multivariate paired analysis showed an association between aphthous ulcers and two classes of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (P < 0.001) and beta-blockers (P = 0.002). Smoking could have a protective effect against aphthous ulcers (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Previous case reports and the results of this study suggest a real link between beta-blockers and aphthous ulcers. Our study did not confirm a role of other drugs but a few interesting case reports with positive reintroduction have to be considered. These results could be beneficial for patients, as healing may occur when the incriminated drug is discontinued.

### Successful treatment of complex aphthosis with colchicine and dapsone… [^114L3zWB]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Major aphthous ulcers are larger than the minor ulcers, are deeper, are slow to heal, and often leave a scar. Herpetiform aphthae are small and have a grouped appearance, often coalescing into a larger plaque and healing spontaneously in 1 to 4 weeks. Systemic corticosteroids offer symptomatic relief and the healing of ulcers but do not affect the disease course or provide long-term remission of complex aphthosis. Furthermore, serious risks are associated with long-term systemic corticosteroid use. Therefore, it is preferable to suppress complex aphthosis with corticosteroid-sparing anti-inflammatory agents. We review our experience with the stepwise administration of colchicine and dapsone in patients with complex aphthosis. Patients received treatment according to a therapeutic ladder that started with colchicine.

Dapsone was added for patients who did not have a substantial response to colchicine in 12 weeks or who discontinued colchicine use because of adverse effects. The study included only patients who were given colchicine, dapsone, or both and who were available for follow-up. Dapsone is an often-cited systemic treatment for RAS; however, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness in patients with complex aphthosis. Sharquie et al15 found that dapsone was effective at decreasing the number, duration, and frequency of oral ulcers in 20 patients with Behçet syndrome. Letsinger et al2 found that dapsone alone was effective in only 7% of patients, but, when used with colchicine, dapsone was effective in 57%. A further limitation was that many patients could not return to Mayo Clinic for follow-up because of the distance from the clinic and, thus, were excluded from this study.

In this retrospective review, therapy with colchicine, dapsone, or both resulted in excellent disease control in most patients with complex aphthosis, a debilitating and problematic disease. These 2 well-established drugs should be considered important "rungs" on the therapeutic ladder for complex aphthosis and efficacious in the treatment armamentarium for this disease. Furthermore, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to assess the optimal overall treatment of complex aphthosis.

### Clobetasol ameliorates aphthous ulceration in renal transplant patients on sirolimus [^1168BwKW]. American Journal of Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulceration is a common side effect of sirolimus. These lesions of the oral mucous membranes are often painful and debilitating, leading to either dose reduction or discontinuation of sirolimus in a significant number of patients. We report that the direct application of clobetasol, a high potency topical steroid, led to prompt resolution of the aphthous ulcers that developed in our renal transplant patients on sirolimus-based immunosuppression.

### Common oral conditions: a review [^114t53bk]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Dry mouth, oral candidiasis, and recurrent aphthous ulcers are 3 of the most common oral conditions that may be associated with patient discomfort, decreased quality of life, and morbidity.

Observations

In a meta-analysis of 26 population-based cohort and cross-sectional studies, the global prevalence of dry mouth symptoms was 23% (95% CI, 18% to 28%), placing individuals at risk of oral candidiasis, dental caries, dysgeusia, masticatory/speech impairment, and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Dry mouth is associated with using more than 3 oral medications per day (odds ratio [OR], 2.9 [95% CI, 1.4 to 6.2]), head and neck radiation, and Sjögren disease. Symptoms may include difficulty swallowing and speaking, thirst, and halitosis. Dry mouth is associated with an 11.5% (95% CI, 3.6% to 27%) higher risk of oral candidiasis, based on a meta-analysis of 6 observational cohorts. Management of dry mouth includes mechanical salivary stimulants, oral moisturizers, and/or systemic sialagogues. Oral candidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by overgrowth of the Candida genus with C albicans, which accounts for 76.8% of infections. The prevalence of oral candidiasis is higher in patients who are immunosuppressed, for example, those with HIV (35% [95% CI, 28% to 42%]) and those with salivary gland hypofunction (OR, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.73 to 5.28]). Common risk factors associated with oral candidiasis include use of antibiotics (P = 0.04) and oral mucosal disorders such as lichen planus. Oral burning and dysgeusia are common symptoms of oral candidiasis. Treatment includes addressing risk factors and use of topical and/or systemic antifungal medications. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is characterized by symptomatic round or oval oral ulcers, which are covered by a gray-white fibrin layer and encircled by an erythematous ring. A meta-analysis of 10 case-controlled studies revealed an increased risk of recurrent aphthous stomatitis associated with polymorphism of IL-1β (+3954C/T) (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.07 to 2.17]) and IL-1β (-511C/T) (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.67]). Another meta-analysis of 9 case-control studies reported that patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis had a higher frequency of nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin B12 (OR, 3.75 [95% CI, 2.38 to 5.94]), folic acid (OR, 7.55 [95% CI, 3.91 to 14.60]), and ferritin (OR, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.69 to 4.06]). Recurrent aphthous stomatitis can be associated with systemic diseases. A meta-analysis of 21 case-control studies revealed that celiac disease is associated with a higher incidence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (25% vs 11%; OR, 3.79 [95% CI, 2.67 to 5.39]; P < .001). Topical corticosteroids are first-line agents to manage recurrent aphthous stomatitis; however, systemic medications may be necessary in more severe cases.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dry mouth, oral candidiasis, and recurrent aphthous ulcers are common oral conditions that may be associated with patient discomfort, decreased quality of life, and morbidity. First-line treatment includes over-the-counter sialagogues for dry mouth, topical antifungals for oral candidiasis, and topical corticosteroids for aphthous ulcers. Oral conditions that do not improve with first-line treatment may require treatment with systemic medications.

### What is PFAPA syndrome? Genetic clues about the pathogenesis [^117GjDVQ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is the most common periodic fever syndrome in childhood. Recent studies report genetic susceptibility variants for PFAPA syndrome and the efficacy of tonsillectomy in a broader cohort of patients with recurrent stereotypical fever. In this review, we highlight the findings of these studies and what they may reveal about the pathogenesis of PFAPA.

Recent Findings

Newly identified genetic susceptibility loci for PFAPA suggest that it is a complex genetic disorder linked to Behçet's disease and recurrent aphthous ulcers. Patients who have PFAPA with some features of Behçet's disease have been reported. Moreover, the efficacy of tonsillectomy has now been described in patients who do not meet the full diagnostic criteria for PFAPA, although the immunologic profile in the tonsils is different from those with PFAPA. Factors that predict response to tonsillectomy are also reported.

Summary

These findings highlight the heterogeneous phenotypes that may be related to PFAPA due to common genetic susceptibility or response to therapy. These relationships raise questions about how to define PFAPA and highlight the importance of understanding of the genetic architecture of PFAPA and related diseases.

### Roflumilast for oral ulcers in Behçet's disease and recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^1172C6y1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral aphthous ulcer in Behçet's disease (BD) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a cause of discomfort for many patients, especially in cases refractory to colchicine or azathioprine. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, may be effective for treating refractory oral ulcers (OUs) in BD and RAS, especially in regions where apremilast is unavailable. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety profile of low-dose roflumilast for refractory OUs in BD and RAS. This single-center, single-arm, retrospective observational study included 46 patients screened from the outpatient department from May 2023 to Dec 2023. During the 12-week study period, the subjects received roflumilast at a dosage of 0.25mg daily. For those experiencing adverse events (AEs) requiring adjustment, the dose was reduced to 0.125mg. Objective clinical responses were evaluated as clinician-assessed treatment categories (complete remission, partial response, or non-response), based on the absence or presence of new OUs and symptom improvement. Subjective symptoms were evaluated through a patient-reported questionnaire, and AEs were monitored through the protocol. At week 12, 71.7% of patients showed a positive response to roflumilast, with 30.4% achieving complete remission. AEs were reported in 76.1% of the 46 subjects with follow-up visits, primarily gastrointestinal (71.7%) and neurological symptoms (17.4%). Among the cohort, 78.3% of patients tolerated roflumilast without discontinuation, including 15.2% with dose reduction, while 21.7% discontinued due to intolerable AEs. Roflumilast demonstrated rapid and sustained efficacy in reducing OUs in BD and RAS. Although AEs were frequent, they were generally tolerable and manageable. While the study has limitations, including its retrospective observational nature and small sample size, it suggests roflumilast as a potential treatment alternative for refractory OUs where apremilast is unavailable, deserving further research.

ABSTRACT

Oral aphthous ulcer in Behçet's disease (BD) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a cause of discomfort for many patients, especially in cases refractory to colchicine or azathioprine. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4) inhibitor, may be effective for treating refractory oral ulcers (OUs) in BD and RAS, especially in regions where apremilast is unavailable. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety profile of low‐dose roflumilast for refractory OUs in BD and RAS.

### Acute vulvar ulcers and the COVID-19 booster vaccine [^11356sAX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment for acute vulvar ulcers secondary to COVID-19 or the vaccine has been focused on symptomatic pain relief, but antibiotics can be considered in settings where bacterial superinfection seem likely. For outpatient treatment, patients with moderate to severe infection may benefit from topical or oral steroid treatments, respectively. In the case of RNSRAGU and the COVID-19 infection and vaccine, multiple case reports note successful treatment with both oral and topical steroid use.

Our hope is that this case will add to the growing literature on RNSRAGU following COVID-19 vaccination but also highlight the Pfizer booster vaccine specifically. Our patient had multiple other risk factors in addition to their booster, including a history of oral aphthous ulcers and 2 previous episodes of acute vulvar ulcers. Their infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory workup was overall unremarkable, and thus, RNSRAGU was the diagnosis of exclusion. While the patient did not report gastrointestinal symptoms, we still recommended the patient follow-up with gastroenterology to rule out underlying disease. In the absence of reported common triggers for RNSRAGU, including recent infection (including COVID-19) and stress, their Pfizer booster was likely the trigger.

### Severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis treated with adalimumab: a case report in a teenage patient [^113ZJZwh]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a chronic disorder of unknown etiology characterized by recurring ulcers involving the oral mucosa in patients with no other manifestations. It is a common cause of oral ulcers in children. In its major form, RAS can be a severe and disabling disorder due to pain and scarring, and poses a therapeutic challenge. Therapies for major RAS include prednisone, thalidomide, colchicine, and dapsone. However, many patients do not achieve adequate control of the disease with them (J Clin Diagn Res, 10, 2016 and ZE08). We report a case of severe RAS in a teenager with a dramatic response to adalimumab.

Our case series report is the first documented depiction of the appearance of aphthous ulcers secondary to imiquimod application. This case series presentation discusses the underlying pathophysiology of aphthous ulcer development and imiquimod therapy in terms of the stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The literature review suggests more than just a mere coincidence for the development of aphthous ulcers subsequent to the treatment of actinic cheilitis with imiquimod application.

Introduction: Periodic Fevers with Aphthous Ulcers, Pharyngitis, and Adenitis Syndrome (PFAPA Syndrome) is the most common pediatric periodic fever syndrome. The most recent diagnostic criteria was described by Thomas et al. in 1999 and defines PFAPA as; regular periodic fevers lasting 3 to 7 days, occurring every 3 to 8 weeks, accompanied by at least one of the following symptoms: aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis. Between febrile episodes the patient is well and demonstrates normal growth and development. Treatment of PFAPA has considerable heterogenicity between practitioners, and there is no standard of care given a lack of clinical trials. Fortunately, PFAPA is relatively benign and will usually resolve spontaneously over time. In 1989, Abramson and colleagues described successful fever resolution post-tonsillectomy. Post-tonsillectomy, patients show a complete response with immediate cessation of fevers, a partial response with fever cessation followed by recurrence, or a failure with no fever cessation. The role of tonsillectomy in PFAPA treatment remains controversial.

### Vulvar aphthous ulcer in an adolescent with COVID-19 [^114V75U1]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvar aphthous ulcers have been associated with various prodromal viral illnesses. We describe the case of an adolescent girl who developed vulvar aphthous ulcers during infection with Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

Case

A 19-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with cough, sore throat, fevers, and rash, and tested positive for COVID-19. She re-presented 2 days later with vulvar pain and was found to have a vulvar aphthous ulcer. She was admitted for pain control and treated with oral steroids. Improvement in her vulvar pain was noted, along with resolution of fevers, cough, and rash.

Summary and Conclusion

This case illustrates the novel association of COVID-19 with vulvar aphthous ulcers in adolescents. Use of oral steroids for symptomatic management of COVID-19 led to rapid clinical improvement.

### Roflumilast for oral ulcers in Behçet's disease and recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^115Wvt8G]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Oral aphthae in patients with Behçet's disease (BD) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) cause significant discomfort and require long‐term management. While colchicine or azathioprine is a common choice for systemic treatment of refractory oral ulcers, some patients show insufficient response or intolerance. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4) inhibitor, has proven to be effective for the treatment of oral ulcers in BD through phase‐3 randomized controlled studies, but was unavailable in some high‐prevalence countries, including Turkey and Korea, at the time of the study. Roflumilast, another PDE4 inhibitor approved for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has similar molecular properties with higher binding affinity to PDE4 and longer plasma halftime. Thus, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of roflumilast as an alternative treatment option for refractory oral ulcers.

### Challenging ulcerative vulvar conditions: hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn disease, and aphthous ulcers [^115bkH7B]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

This article discusses the clinical evaluation and approach to patients with 3 complex ulcerative vulvar conditions: hidradenitis suppurativa, metastatic Crohn disease of the vulva, and aphthous ulcers. These conditions are particularly challenging to medical providers because, although each is known to present with nonspecific examination findings that vary in morphology, the predominance of the diagnosis is based on clinical examination and exclusion of a wide variety of other conditions. Care of patients with these conditions is further complicated by the lack of therapeutic data and the significant impact these conditions have on quality of life.

### Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci [^117W79cM]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral ulceration is the most common ulcerative condition in humans, affecting up to 25% of young adultsand a higher proportion of children. Depending on context, ulcers in the mouth are described as mouth ulcers or canker sores, both of which are descriptive terms rather than clinical diagnoses. In this article, mouth ulcers is used as an umbrella term describing the spectrum of clinical presentation.

To date, many causes of mouth ulcers are recognised including mucosal trauma and a range of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. For example, mouth ulcers are common in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and are considered a diagnostic feature of Behçet's disease, an inflammatory disorder of blood vessels that causes ulceration of the mouth, eyes and genitals.

Many people experience recurrent mouth ulcers which cannot be attributed to systemic disease or obvious oral trauma. Here, the clinical diagnosis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is used, referring to a group of closely related conditions of uncertain aetiology, whose defining feature is the presence of clinically characteristic oral ulcers, which are painful and associated with impaired quality of life –. First line management strategies for RAS reduce the severity of ulceration without preventing recurrence. Second line management strategies involve topical or systemic use of potent and non-specific immunomodulatory drugs including thalidomide and dapsone, exposing patients to a range of side effects. Thus, there is unmet need for a wider range of therapeutic options in the management of RAS.

### Meta-analysis of stomatitis in clinical studies of everolimus: incidence and relationship with efficacy [^113mcDDD]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

introduction

Everolimus is an oral mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that is commonly used in the treatment of cancer [renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), and hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) breast cancer] as well as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). One of the most common adverse events (AEs) associated with mTOR inhibitors is stomatitis, an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth. In particular, mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis is similar to aphthous ulceration, characterized by small, distinct ovoid ulcers that are gray and surrounded by an erythematous ring, and which affect the non-keratinized mucosa of the oral cavity. Stomatitis is clinically distinct from mucositis, which is associated with conventional chemotherapy or ionizing radiation and generally presents as non-uniform erythematous and ulcerated lesions that may extend to the gastrointestinal tract.

The clinical impact of stomatitis on efficacy is of particular interest, and greater understanding of this AE may help physicians anticipate and manage this event. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from seven randomized, double-blind phase 3 clinical trials of everolimus in patients with advanced breast cancer, pNET, and RCC as well as in patients with TSC. Here, we report on the incidence, time to occurrence, and severity of stomatitis and assess the impact on clinical outcome. Our results show that stomatitis did not adversely affect progression-free survival (PFS) and support the administration of everolimus in accordance with standard management guidelines.

### Acute oral ulcers [^116BNiLi]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

In general, a detailed history and examination of the patient provides sufficient information for diagnosis. The pattern, frequency, and natural history of ulcer episodes are helpful. The presence or absence of associated features and the site of oral involvement guides most physicians accurately in the diagnosis. Additional investigations, including blood tests, and occasionally the use of oral cultures or biopsy, are needed to make a definitive diagnosis. A multispecialty approach is often necessary to evaluate patients with other systemic features. Most acute oral ulcers heal spontaneously without specific therapy being necessary, but an understanding of the cause of the ulcer is reassuring to the patient and guides the clinician in management to prevent recurrent episodes of oral ulceration, or chronicity of ulcers.

Oral ulcers are generally painful lesions that are related to various conditions developing within the oral cavity. They can be classified as acute or chronic according to their presentation and progression. Acute oral ulcers are be associated with conditions such as trauma, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, Behçet's disease, bacterial and viral infections, allergic reactions or adverse drug reactions. Chronic oral ulcers are associated with conditions such as oral lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris, mucosal pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus, mycosis and some bacterial and parasitic diseases. The correct differential diagnosis is necessary to establish the appropriate treatment, taking into account all the possible causes of ulcers in the oral cavity.

### Apremilast for treatment of recalcitrant aphthous stomatitis [^112d7D4k]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Apremilast is an orally administered small molecule that specifically inhibits phosphodiesterase-4 and modulates the immune system by increasing the levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibiting interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-γ, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor production. It is US Food and Drug Administration approved for treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but has been used off label in treating various inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis, chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis, lichen planus, and Behçet disease. In a recent multicenter, placebo-controlled phase II study, apremilast was found to be effective in treating oral and genital ulcers of Behçet disease, with 71% of patients achieving complete clearance by week 12. Pentoxifylline, an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has been reported previously to be marginally effective in treating RAS as a second-line agent. However, to the best of our knowledge, treatment of RAS with apremilast has not been reported thus far. It appears to be an effective agent through reducing proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-23, and interferon-γ and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. Apremilast has shown a good safety profile with most frequent side effects being nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Cases of diarrhea and nausea occur in approximately 17% of patients and are generally mild to moderate in severity. The side effects usually begin during the first 2 weeks of apremilast treatment and resolve within 4 weeks. Treatment strategies include adequate hydration, taking medication with small and more frequent meals, and avoiding caffeine, dairy, and artificial sweeteners. Further options include bulk-forming agents, bismuth subsalicylate, and loperamide.

Our case shows a rapid and substantial response of recalcitrant aphthous lesions to apremilast. However, further studies are needed to prove its efficacy and safety.

### Roflumilast for oral ulcers in Behçet's disease and recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^113FaueZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study suggests a notable decrease in oral ulcers with the administration of low‐dose roflumilast in BD and RAS. The efficacy of roflumilast (71.7%–76.1%) is comparable to that of 76% in a phase 3 study of apremilast for BD. Though the mean number of oral ulcers in our cohort was lower than previously reported (1.43 vs. 4.2 at baseline), likely reflecting milder disease activity in our real‐world setting compared to controlled trials during active flares, the proportional reduction mirrors that seen with apremilast. This supports roflumilast as a viable treatment for oral ulcers where apremilast is unavailable. Our cohort demonstrated pronounced effects early on, which gradually attenuated. This pattern may reflect natural disease fluctuations and our strict definition of complete remission, as well as a potential influence from tapering of concurrent immunomodulators. Thus, future research should control the use of other medications more strictly. Additionally, since a direct comparison of the effects of this medication with apremilast is not substantiated, further studies, including randomized controlled trials, are required. Adverse events occurred in 76.1% of participants, mainly gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, yet a majority (78.3%) continued treatment for 12 weeks, indicating a generally tolerable side effect profile. The discontinuation rate of 21.7% was lower than the 28%–30% reported in the real‐world use of apremilast for BD and other skin disorders. This may be due to a shorter follow‐up period and initiation with a low dosage. All adverse events resolved after stopping roflumilast, without severe adverse events. Patients with adverse events did not show an increase in any laboratory inflammatory markers and were not diagnosed as GI BD nor neuro‐BD. This suggests that the symptoms were likely attributable to the roflumilast. Interestingly, while our cohort had a higher incidence of diarrhea (63.0%), neurological side effects such as headaches were less frequent compared to previous studies. However, the occurrence of numbness of extremities, which was not reported previously, might be associated with the concurrent administration of other immunosuppressants like colchicine, known to cause gastrointestinal issues and neuropathy. The incidence of AEs in COPD patients was lower, suggesting single regimen administration might reduce side effects. Hwang et al. reported that a dose‐escalation regimen of roflumilast from 0.25 to 0.5 mg for COPD patients can minimize the risk of intolerable adverse events. Therefore, in this study, we administered low‐dose roflumilast (0.25 mg/day) to patients to mitigate AEs. Notably, two recent single‐arm observational studies from Spain also demonstrated efficacy in BD and RAS, but involved smaller cohorts. In contrast, our study included a larger patient cohort and was conducted in a real‐world setting where roflumilast was added to ongoing colchicine treatment, better reflecting routine clinical practice for refractory oral ulcers. Although its retrospective design, lack of a control group, and small, ethnically homogeneous cohort are limitations, the findings support roflumilast as a potential treatment option in settings where apremilast is inaccessible.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^1151sL4a]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common acute oral ulcerative condition in North America. RAS is divided into a mild, common form, simple aphthosis, and a severe, less common form, complex aphthosis. Aphthosis is a reactive condition. The lesions of RAS can represent the mucosal manifestation of a variety of conditions. These include conditions with oral and genital aphthae such as ulcus vulvae acutum, reactive nonsexually related acute genital ulcers, and Behçet disease. The mouth is the beginning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the lesions of RAS can be a manifestation of GI diseases such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn disease. Complex aphthosis may also have correctable causes. The clinician should seek these in a careful evaluation. Successful management of both simple and complex aphthosis depends on accurate diagnosis, proper classification, recognition of provocative factors, and the identification of associated diseases. The outlook for patients with both simple and complex aphthosis is positive.

### Apremilast for treatment of recalcitrant aphthous stomatitis [^112JxmUR]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Report of a case

A gentleman in his 60s, presented to the outpatient clinic for evaluation of recurrent painful oral ulcers present for the last 3 years. On examination, multiple, variable sized, round-to-oval circumscribed ulcers with an erythematous halo and a yellowish floor were seen to involve the hard and soft palate (Fig 1, A). There was no history suggestive of Behçet disease. Histologic examination found a superficial ulceration with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. No significant immune deposits were seen on direct immunofluorescence. Oral swabs/cultures were negative for Candida albicans and human herpes simplex virus 1 and 2. Based on clinical, histologic and immunologic features, a diagnosis of major RAS was made.

A case of recurrent apthous stomatitis successfully treated with apremilast. A case of major recurrent aphthous stomatitis. A, Multiple aphthous lesions of size 0.5 to 1 cm on the hard and soft palate before treatment with apremilast. B, Clearing of all lesions after 6 weeks of treatment with apremilast, 30 mg twice daily.

After not responding to topical and systemic corticosteroids (20 mg/d of prednisolone for 2 weeks), antibiotics (2 g/d of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 2 weeks), and colchicine (1 mg/d for 6 months), apremilast monotherapy was initiated at a dose of 10 mg once daily. The dose was gradually titrated to a maintenance dose of 30 mg twice daily. There was complete clearance of all lesions within 6 weeks (Fig 1, B). The patient has been on treatment with apremilast, 30 mg twice daily for 12 months, and no relapse has been observed so far. Apremilast was well tolerated except for minor gastrointestinal symptoms.

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^1149bHvx]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

There are some data from adult ulcerative mouth conditions and patients with cancer related mucositis. In a double blind RCT Saxen et al randomised 60 adults with aphthous ulcers to one of 3 treatment groups - 3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronan, 2.5% hyaluronan or 3% viscous lidocaine. For spontaneous and stimulated pain a significant reduction in pain was shown in all 3 groups (p < 0.01) with no demonstrable difference between the 3 topical agents. Akhionbare and Ojehanon randomised 30 patients with aphthous ulcers to either 2% plain lidocaine or 2% lidocaine with adrenaline. 87% of patients experienced a complete relief of pain after application of either solution. Although different etiologically, oral mucositis often results in unrelenting pain causing an inability to eat and drink with subsequent risk of malnutrition and dehydration. In this respect it is similar to severe infectious mouth conditions. Yet, a review of the literature on the management of mucositis demonstrates a lack of consensus of scientific opinion on optimal treatment for relieving painful mucositis and the use of a large variety of different topical agents including diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide (Maalox), nystatin and corticosteroids has been described. RCT data are limited and a Cochrane review found that there was "no proven and satisfactory treatment available" for oral mucositis in the adult population. Similarly, a paediatric review revealed a paucity of controlled trials in children, highlighting that current practice is governed more by clinical experience rather than scientific evidence.

### Consensus treatment plans for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA): a framework to evaluate treatment responses from the childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance (CARRA) PFAPA work group [^111AAcd8]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Current therapeutic studies in PFAPA are limited by small, heterogeneous patient populations, variable diagnostic criteria, retrospective data collection, and treatment analysis that did not include comparator arms between therapeutic options. Our prior survey showed considerable variation in treatment of PFAPA, both between and within subspecialties. Through consensus methodology, we developed standardized regimens that will be studied in future comparative effectiveness studies.

As is the case for other CTPs, they are not intended to be guidelines or recommendations; they merely reflect current management practices. They are also not intended to capture all patients with PFAPA such as those treated with 2 or more arms at the same time or with those that have failed earlier therapies. Other limitations include the lack of validated response criteria, disease monitoring scoring tools and criteria for remission. Furthermore, we did not include all possible therapies and dosing to reduce variability. Even though treatment related morbidity can be monitored; CTPs are not primarily intended to collect information on medication safety. Finally, corticosteroids, cimetidine and colchicine have not received FDA approval for PFAPA.

Future goals are to establish evidence-based management guidelines based on the collection of prospective data from comparative effectiveness trials after implementation of the CTPs, and to identify predictors for response to specific treatments through analysis of patient characteristics in the different treatment arms. The natural history of PFAPA is resolution with age. For the anti-pyretic and corticosteroid arms, since treatment is only with episodes, as they decrease and finally stop, so does treatment. For the prophylactic arms of cimetidine and colchicine, there are no current recommendations on duration of treatment as there is insufficient data.

### Complex aphthosis: a large case series with evaluation algorithm and therapeutic ladder from topicals to thalidomide [^113rGB9D]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a common problem with 20% to 50% of the population having experienced simple aphthous lesions (ie, canker sores). Complex aphthosis is the diagnosis given to patients with almost constant > 3 oral aphthae or recurrent oral and genital aphthae in the absence of Behcet's disease.

Methods

Eighty-one patients were referred to the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology from 1995 to 2001 with the diagnosis of presumptive Behcet's disease. After exclusion of patients with simple recurrent aphthous stomatitis or non-aphthous oral disease, 64 patients remained. Ten of the patients met criteria for Behcet's disease. The remaining 54 patients were evaluated and treated as patients with the diagnosis of complex aphthosis.

Results

The 54 patients with complex aphthosis became the subject of this study. Twelve patients had secondary complex aphthosis with 10/12 having inflammatory bowel disease. The remaining 42 patients had primary (ie, idiopathic) complex aphthosis. The therapeutic ladder for these patients ranged from topical therapy through oral colchicine and combination oral colchicine and oral dapsone therapy to oral thalidomide therapy.

Conclusion

Complex aphthosis is an important condition to distinguish from Behcet's disease. Appropriate patient evaluation algorithms and treatment therapeutic ladders are proposed.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^112Y51PW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral discomfort/pain

Aetiology

There are several potential causes of new onset oral discomfort/pain in patients with advanced cancer, including salivary gland hypofunction, mucosal conditions (i.e. infection/inflammation/ulceration), dental-related problems, denture-related problems, neurological conditions and pain referred from adjacent structures.

Management

Management should include treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. relining, adjusting, or replacing poorly fitting dentures (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Symptomatic management primarily involves pharmacological interventions, which may include both topical agents and systemic analgesics. The optimal analgesic regimen depends on the aetiology of the pain (cancer-related, coexisting condition), the pathophysiology of the pain (nociceptive, neuropathic) and a variety of patient-related factors (e.g. co-morbidities, personal preference) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V).

Bland rinses (e.g. normal saline) can often provide some relief for patients with oral ulceration, including patients with oral mucositis. Similarly, "coating" agents can provide some relief for patients with oral ulceration, particularly in patients with pain on eating/drinking ("contact"/incident pain). However, many patients with oral ulceration have associated inflammation, and so merely covering the ulcer(s) does not relieve the discomfort. Topical analgesics can be highly effective in some cases, and options include benzydamine hydrochloride solution/spray (anti-inflammatory), oral morphine solution (opioid) and doxepin solution (antidepressant). Topical analgesics are less likely to cause systemic adverse effects, and so are often considered as first line treatments. Local anaesthetics have a limited role, and care must be taken to prevent inadvertent aspiration. Equally, topical steroids have a limited role (e.g. recurrent aphthous stomatitis), and care must be taken to exclude oral problems that might worsen with steroids (e.g. oral infections).

Systemic analgesics can also be effective, but there are limited reasons for chronic administration (due to concerns about adverse effects).

Interventional techniques are another option in highly select cohorts of patients (e.g. patients with intraoral tumours).

### Herpetiform aphthous ulcerations induced by secukinumab: report of 2 cases [^116yASNN]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The anti–interleukin (IL)-17A antibody secukinumab is used for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It has an excellent safety profile and its side effects are well described. Nevertheless, many patients treated with secukinumab in real life are needed to detect exceedingly rare side effects. Here, we report 2 cases of acute gingivostomatitis that developed on introduction of secukinumab.

### Herpetiform aphthous ulcerations induced by secukinumab: report of 2 cases [^1129z5vM]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the literature, the occurrence of non- Candida gingivostomatitis after IL-17 blockers is only anecdotally reported. Mouth ulcerations were seen in 2 patients in a phase-2 secukinumab trial, but no clinical details were provided. Further, a case of a patient with spondylarthrosis who had recurrent oral ulcers after secukinumab treatment developed inflammatory bowel disease 1 month after the start of secukinumab. After the second injection of secukinumab, this patient experienced periodic occurrence of endobuccal aphthoid lesions, appearing 2 to 3 days after each injection. Finally, a case of severe mucositis appearing 1 week after initiation of secukinumab was described in a 62-year-old man. In this case, secukinumab discontinuation resulted in substantial improvement. In our 2 cases, clinical course as well as extensive laboratory workup reasonably ruled out other inflammatory diseases potentially affecting the oral mucosa, such as lichen planus, autoimmune bullous diseases, or erythema multiforme.

Why oral aphthous ulcers developed after secukinumab used remains unclear. Secukinumab is associated with the development of mucocutaneous candidiasis, as the IL-17 pathway is crucial for antifungal defense. Yet, IL-17 blockers may also affect the oral microbiome in way that is not detectable by mycologic cultures and may thus favor the development of an inflammatory stomatitis.

Taken together, acute herpetiform aphthous ulcerations may represent a rare complication of secukinumab treatment. The clinical outcome is favorable after reduction or cessation of secukinumab. With increasing use of IL-17 blockers, clinicians should be familiar with this rare but striking and bothersome side effect.

### Palatal ulceration [^111WgaAV]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Palatal ulcers are a common presentation and can be conveniently divided into developmental and acquired causes, the latter of which is subdivided into acute and chronic causes. Most commonly seen dermatologic causes have associated skin manifestations. Acute and multiple ulcers are usually infectious or drug induced in origin. Recurrent ulcers are largely dominated by aphthosis, while chronic ulcers are seen in immunocompromised patients and can occasionally be malignant. It is essential to involve the oral and maxillofacial surgeons early in the therapeutic management to tackle the inevitable complications that may ensue in the chronic cases.

Thalidomide is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated conditions, including aphthous ulcers and wasting syndrome. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a formulation of thalidomide with improved bioavailability in HIV-infected persons was examined in a placebo-controlled, dose-escalating phase 1 study. Subjects with CD4 cell counts of 200–500 cells/mm³ were enrolled and randomized 3:1 in groups of 12 to receive 50, 100, or 150 mg of thalidomide or matching placebo. Two subjects who received 150 mg of drug and 2 subjects assigned placebo experienced dose-limiting toxicity. Concentrations of thalidomide in the blood increased with escalating dose, but the time to maximum concentration and clearance did not differ across dose cohorts. Previous suggestions of autoinduction of drug metabolism were not confirmed by this study. At the doses studied, thalidomide was tolerated well and had linear pharmacokinetics.

Rationale for the use of steroid-containing mouthwash and cryotherapy for stomatitis prophylaxis

The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society for Oral Oncology evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recommend a range of measures for the management of stomatitis. A basic oral care plan, incorporating patient education and multi-agent combination oral care, is still considered best practice. A previous study investigating the use of professional oral care to prevent stomatitis in patients receiving everolimus and exemestane found that professional oral care reduced the incidence and severity of stomatitis. In addition, the use of supplementary interventions such as oral cryotherapy are recommended for certain patients with stomatitis.

Prior to clinical trials assessing the use of steroid-containing mouthwash in the management or prophylaxis of drug-induced stomatitis in patients with cancer, information around the use of steroid treatment for stomatitis was limited to those used to treat aphthous ulcers. The efficacy of topical corticosteroids in treating recurrent aphthous ulcers and stomatitis is potentially due to decreased lymphocyte production and the underlying inflammatory response. The SWISH study was a US-based, phase II, open-label trial that assessed the use of dexamethasone mouthwash (0.5 mg/5 mL oral solution) to prevent stomatitis in patients with HR+/HER2− BC who received everolimus and exemestane. Compared with patients who received everolimus plus exemestane in the multicenter, phase III BOLERO-2 study, the use of dexamethasone mouthwash reduced the proportion of any-grade and grade ≥ 2 stomatitis by 61% and 91%, respectively, after 8 weeks.

5.3.3 Many‐associated oral ulcers are painless, being related to a primary disease. However, there are some cases of discoid lupus erythematosus of the mucosa. Diseases to be differentiated include recurrent aphthous stomatitis, lichen planus, leukoplakia, and infectious diseases such as herpes simplex and fungal infection. When it is difficult to make a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, skin biopsy, including direct immunofluorescence, and investigation for infectious disease are recommended for detailed examination for the etiology. Furthermore,‐associated oral ulcers may reflect the disease state, and it should be re‐evaluated using blood biochemistry/immunological examination and urinalysis

In patients with SLE, the prevalence of oral lesions varies among reports, ranging from 2% or 3% to 50%. The lesion site is painless in some cases but painful in others. The ulcer site sometimes becomes painful, affecting lifestyle. Typical oral lesions include painless ulcers, which often occur in the upper palate in the acute stage, and discoid lupus erythematosus of the mucosa. However, various disease types, such as recurrent aphthous stomatitis, lichen planus‐like exanthema, leukoplakia, and red plaque, have been reported.
In patients with SLE receiving systemic administration of immunosuppressants, secondary infection with herpes virus or fungus may induce oral ulcers; therefore, microscopy, Tzanck test, and viral antigen tests must be performed. If herpetic gingivostomatitis or oral candidiasis is observed, treatment with antiviral or antifungal drugs should be performed.
Immunoglobulin deposition in the basement membrane is observed on direct immunofluorescence in ≥ 70% of patients with SLE‐related oral lesions, whereas the positive rate in patients with lichen planus–like exanthema or leukoplakia is ≤ 10%. It is useful for the differential diagnosis. In the case of refractory ulcers at the site of discoid lupus erythematosus, the possibility of scar carcinoma must also be considered.
Oral lesions are adopted for many criteria as a parameter of SLE activity. Therefore, if oral lesions are observed in patients with SLE, SLE activity should be initially evaluated, and the systemic administration of steroids or immunosuppressants should be performed if necessary. The systemic administration of steroids or immunosuppressants is also useful for treating oral lesions.
Systemic treatment for SLE‐associated oral ulcers is beneficial, but no study has directly evaluated the utility of local therapy. However, there is one systematic review on local treatment for recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Topical steroid therapy is the first choice of therapy.

### Roflumilast for oral ulcers in Behçet's disease and recurrent aphthous stomatitis [^115RrUyW]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

3.1 Baseline Characteristics

Our cohort included 46 patients with a mean age of 52.4 (SD, 13.0) (Table 1). Thirty‐seven (80.4%) patients were diagnosed as BD, and 9 (19.6%) had RAS without matching diagnostic criteria for BD. Participants received treatment with roflumilast at a starting dose of 0.25 mg (half tablet) per day, with adjustment depending on adverse events and patient tolerability. Initially, when roflumilast was administered, there were no modifications to dosages of existing medications, including colchicine or azathioprine; however, dose reductions were permitted in cases of symptom improvement.

### Thalidomide use in pediatric patients [^1154mYGo]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a detailed overview of thalidomide use in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

English-language articles were identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-February 2001); key terms included thalidomide, child, graft-versus-host disease, cancer, HIV, Crohn's disease, Behçet's disease, and lupus erythematosus. References cited in those articles were also evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Thalidomide appears to be effective in patients with chronic, not acute, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and in healing aphthous ulcers in patients with HIV infection. Limited case reports suggest efficacy of thalidomide in the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of Behçet's disease, Crohn's disease, and lupus in children; however, the recurrence of disease is almost universal on drug discontinuation.

Conclusions

Thalidomide should be used as a last resort when all other therapies fail, preferably in male or prepubescent female patients.

### Sunitinib malate [^112i5WWL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjuvant Treatment of RCC

The safety of sunitinib malate was evaluated in S-TRAC, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients who had undergone nephrectomy for RCC received sunitinib malate 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (n = 306) or placebo (n = 304). The median duration of treatment was 12.4 months (range: 0.13 to 14.9) for sunitinib malate and 12.4 months (range: 0.03 to 13.7) for placebo.

Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 28% of patients in the sunitinib malate arm. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in > 2% of patients include hand-foot syndrome and fatigue/asthenia. Dosing interruptions occurred in 54% and dose reductions occurred in 46% of patients who received sunitinib malate.

Table 7 summarizes the adverse reactions in S-TRAC.

### Treatment of pressure ulcers: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11526zfi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — scope and methods for pressure ulcer treatment syntheses state that pressure ulcers affect 3 million adults in the United States and can result in serious harm and that the guideline presents the evidence and provides clinical recommendations based on the comparative effectiveness of treatments of pressure ulcers. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population is patients with pressure ulcers. The literature search identified studies using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, EBM Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Health Technology Assessment database through February 2014 and was limited to English-language publications. Outcomes included complete wound healing, wound size (surface area, volume, and depth) reduction, pain, prevention of sepsis and osteomyelitis, recurrence rate, and harms of treatment including pain, dermatologic complications, bleeding, and infection.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^112hknLa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Specific cutaneous manifestations

Orofacial Crohn's disease and orofacial ulcerative colitis

In Crohn's disease (CD), oral manifestations occur in 8–9% of the patients. They are more common in the pediatric population, and may precede intestinal involvement. When there is oral involvement, the likelihood of other extraintestinal manifestations is greater. CD may appear in the oral cavity as aphthous ulcerations or superficial bleeding ulcers. However, a wide variety of disease-specific oral lesions have been described in patients with intestinal CD (Table 2).

Table 2
Oral lesions in patients with Crohn's disease

CD in the oral cavity usually takes the form of aphthous ulceration of the mucosal surface. Aphthae and mucosal tags are frequently seen if the oral cavity is carefully evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed CD. Deep tissue inflammation occurs uncommonly and may lead to labial, lingual, and facial swelling and fistula formation can result. CD sometimes shows only orofacial manifestations.

In ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, lesions of the oral cavity may appear as aphthous ulcerations, superficial hemorrhagic ulcers or angular cheilitis. In general, oral lesions coincide with exacerbations of the colonic disease. Similar ulcerations may arise on the buttocks, abdomen, thighs and face. Aphthous ulcers or angular stomatitis occur in as many as 5–10% of patients.

Indeed, classification of granulomatous orofacial disease is complex (particularly in the absence of inflammation elsewhere) and there is considerable overlap between orofacial CD, Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome, cheilitis granulomatoses, and the other orofacial granulomatosis. Therefore, diagnosis should include tissue sampling of the involved orofacial region for histopathologic examination.

Effective treatment for specific orofacial CD has not been defined. Many patients who are found to have OCD manifestations may be completely asymptomatic, since the oral findings are not clinically problematic.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^115vtXLt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

6-Thioguanine — recommendations for psoriasis state there is no FDA-approved use for psoriasis. Dosing is: start at 80 mg two times/wk; increase by 20 mg every 2–4 wk; maximum dose is 160 mg 3 times/wk. Short-term results include an open-label trial of 14 patients using pulse dosing then maintenance dosing (120 mg twice/wk to 160 mg 3 times/wk), in which of 11 patients who became longer-term responders, 6/11 showed a response after 2–4 wk. Long-term results report 76 patients followed for > 1 mo; at 24 mo, 58% were effectively maintained, with use safely up to 145 mo; another study showed 14/18 patients had 90% improvement. Contraindications include pre-existing liver disease, immunosuppression, and anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. Toxicity includes myelosuppression, liver toxicity from hepatic veno-occlusive disease, increased ALT and AST, hyperuricemia, photodermatitis, taste changes, gastroesophageal reflux, gastric ulcers, headache, nausea/vomiting, aphthous ulcers, fatigue, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and multiple warts, herpes zoster. Drug interactions note that aminosalicylate derivatives (olsalazine, mesalazine, or sulfasalazine) may inhibit TPMT. Baseline monitoring includes history and physical examination; CBC (complete blood cell) and platelet counts, chemistry screen, LFTs (liver function tests), hepatitis B and C, PPD; and pregnancy test if indicated, while ongoing monitoring specifies CBC and platelet counts every 2–4 wk; serum chemistry every 3 mo; biannual physical examination focusing on lymph node examination and skin cancer examination (SCCs in particular); and pregnancy test if indicated. Pregnancy/nursing is pregnancy category D, and pregnancy and breast-feeding should be avoided during treatment, and patients (including male) must use adequate contraception. Pediatric use and psoriatic arthritis are noted as no data.

### Oral ulcerations in a patient with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) [^1162ngjK]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 23-year-old woman with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome complicated by recurrent pneumonia and sinusitis presented with 1week of multiple painful oral ulcers unresponsive to empiric antiviral and antifungal treatment. Her ulcers progressively worsened and she required hospitalisation for intravenous hydration and pain control. PCR swab of an ulcer was positive for varicella-zoster virus. Her symptoms never fully resolved despite antiviral therapy, and within 2weeks, she relapsed with new and worsening ulcers. Biopsy revealed chronic active inflammation with no evidence of viral inclusion bodies or fungal hyphae. She was diagnosed with recurrent aphthous stomatitis and referred to a local dentist for CO 2 laser treatments with rapid resolution of her symptoms. This case highlights the broad differential for recurrent oral ulcers in people with a primary immunodeficiency. It also raises awareness of the benefits of laser therapy for aphthous stomatitis treatment and the importance of partnering with our colleagues in dentistry.

### Oral ulcers in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of the literature [^115BEcXb]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

Oral ulcers are commonly found in JSLE patients, and the typical lesion is a painless palatal erythematous ulcer at masticatory or keratinized mucosa, especially the hard palate. However, most ulcers including oral DLE and aphthous ulcers in JSLE patients appear at the lining tissue of the oral cavity (e.g. buccal mucosa, soft palate and tongue) and sometimes are unnoticed. Therefore, understanding of their clinical features and locations is very important. Clinical evaluation and follow-up is normally sufficient for making a diagnosis; however, lesional biopsy is needed particularly when other diseases (such as OLP or OLCL) cannot be ruled out. Topical corticosteroids remain the first-line treatment of oral ulcers, but the steroid-sparing agents (calcineurin inhibitors) can also be used in JSLE patients.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis… [^112gPCMA]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis usually involves nonkeratinizing mucosa. There are three clinical forms: minor, major, and herpetiform. The minor form is the most common and appears as rounded, well-demarcated, single or multiple ulcers less than 1 cm in diameter that usually heal in 10 to 14 days without scarring. Most patients with mild aphthae require no treatment or only periodic topical therapy. Commonly used therapies include topical corticosteroids, such as fluocinonide gel and triamcinolone acetonide with carboxymethylcellulose paste. However, much of the evidence in support of these treatments is from small, incompletely blinded trials, and thus their effectiveness is uncertain. 36, 37 Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash decreases the severity of an episode but does not reduce the incidence of ulcers. 15 Amlexanox 5% paste may promote healing and lessen pain.

16 In severe or constantly recurring cases, systemic therapy with agents such as thalidomide may be necessary. Because of the risk of serious adverse effects and its off-label status, thalidomide generally is reserved for severe cases such as those associated with HIV infection.
17. The condition typically waxes and wanes, and the lesions demonstrate a migrating pattern. Some patients may complain of pain or burning, especially when eating spicy foods. However, most individuals are asymptomatic and do not require treatment for this benign condition. For symptomatic cases, several treatments have been proposed, including topical steroids, zinc supplements, and topical anesthetic rinses. None of these treatments has been proven to be uniformly effective.
18. Classic lesions of reticular form often are readily identified clinically. However, lesions that do not exhibit classic features may require biopsy for diagnosis.

Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. For symptomatic patients, topical corticosteroid gels, such as fluocinonide and corticosteroid mouth rinses, may be prescribed. 22 There is debate about whether oral lichen planus is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. 40 Therefore, periodic follow-up of patients is appropriate.

### Oral ulcerations in an immunosuppressed pediatric patient [^111m56gU]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Herpes simplex virus – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus oral ulcerations may occur in immunosuppressed patients typically presenting with grouped vesicles and erosions with irregular borders overlying gingival bone, hard palate, and vermilion lip. However, this patient has discrete tongue ulcerations with a clean fibrinous base.
B. Recurrent aphthous ulceration – Incorrect. Clinically similar in appearance, recurrent aphthae are a diagnosis of exclusion and not the best answer in this patient.
C. Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) – Incorrect. Oral findings of cGVHD include lichen planus-like changes, salivary gland dysfunction, and microstomia due to tissue sclerosis. Over 90% of cGVHD occurs within the first year following transplantation. Ulcerations on a background of normal mucosa developing 3 years post-transplantation are not consistent with cGVHD.
D. Medication side effect – Correct. mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis (mIAS) is a well-documented side effect of mTOR inhibitors (eg, sirolimus) resembling common aphthae with an incidence ranging from 2% to 78%. Although mIAS pathogenesis is not fully understood, evidence suggests that oral microbiota changes may be contributory.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, mycophenolate mofetil, and losartan, which were not taken by our patient, are also reported triggers of mucosal ulcerations. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are more likely to trigger oral lichenoid reactions rather than aphthous-like ulcers.
E. Severe combined immunodeficiency – Incorrect. Severe combined immunodeficiency encompasses a heterogeneous group of immunodeficiencies resulting from severe T and B cell defects. Mucosal candidiasis is the classic oral manifestation. Oral ulcerations are not typical.

### Terminal ileitis is not always Crohn's disease [^116h4aHu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Isolated terminal ileal ulcerations

Some asymptomatic individuals may present with aphthous or small ulcerations in the TI, unaccompanied by lesions in the colon or ileocecal valve. Most of the ulcerations were surrounded by normal mucosa, regenerating epithelium, or edematous mucosa and covered by thin or faint exudates. Thus patients with isolated TI ulcerations (ITIU) in most cases do not have CD, and in some cases follow up is needed.

A recent study reported 145 patients with ITIU. All of the patients were asymptomatic healthy individuals who did not take aspirin or NSAIDs and underwent colonoscopy for other indications (mostly surveillance for colorectal carcinoma). In this study, ITIU had completely resolved on follow-up colonoscopy in 62 of 93 patients. Only one showed a significant histological abnormality, a granulomatous lesion, and this patient was confirmed as having intestinal tuberculosis. Another patient was later diagnosed with CD, based on follow-up colonoscopic findings of typical longitudinal ulcerations of CD. The time from initial diagnosis of ITIU to confirmation of typical CD was 32 months. During the follow-up period the patients did not have any symptoms nor did they receive any treatment, except for the patient with CD. Aphthous or small ulcerations in the TI may be one of the earliest manifestations of serious diseases, such as CD and intestinal tuberculosis. Some patients with aphthous type CD later develop typical CD. In these patients, progression from aphthous lesions to overt CD requires a relatively long period of time, whereas in other patients, aphthous lesions disappear or remain unchanged on follow up. Another study has reported that CD is unlikely to develop in asymptomatic individuals with isolated ileitis.

### Colchicine: an ancient drug with novel applications [^115AFzvR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Colchicine is a treatment for gout that has been used for more than a millennium. It is the treatment of choice for familial Mediterranean fever and its associated complication, amyloidosis. The 2009 U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of colchicine as a new drug had research consequences. Recent investigations with large cohorts of patients with gout who have been taking colchicine for years have demonstrated novel applications within oncology, immunology, cardiology and dermatology. Some emerging dermatological uses include the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, leucocytoclastic vasculitis, aphthous stomatitis and others. In this work we relate the history and the new horizon of this ancient medicine.

### Consensus treatment plans for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA): a framework to evaluate treatment responses from the childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance (CARRA) PFAPA work group [^11615346]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The PFAPA Work Group defined patient inclusion characteristics (Table 1) that were slightly modified from the original proposed diagnostic criteria for PFAPA. First, the duration of fever attacks was defined as 3–7 days to avoid confusion with other autoinflammatory syndromes that may share some features with PFAPA but differ in their duration of febrile attacks, such as Familial Mediterranean Fever. Second, to exclude recurrent infections and malignancy, patients had to have had more than 6 stereotypical periodic febrile episodes. Exclusion of cyclic neutropenia is kept. Third, to ensure periodicity, these episodes had to occur with regularity, defined as a maximum variability of 1 week for fever cycles occurring at 2–4-week intervals and a maximum variability of 2 weeks for fever cycles occurring at 5–8-week intervals. Fourth, age of onset ≤ 5 years was omitted because only one-third of the physicians who responded to the preliminary survery considered young age mandatory for the diagnosis of PFAPA. 5,

Table 1
CTPs inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients with PFAPA

Four treatment strategies were defined based on the literature review, survey, and the process as described above:

1) Antipyretics during episodes; 2) Abortive treatment with corticosteroids; 3) Prophylaxis with colchicine or cimetidine; and 4) Surgical management with tonsillectomy (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Consensus treatment plans for PFAPA

To evaluate efficacy, outcome measures were defined by the Work Group (Table 2) using NGT. The primary outcome was resolution of fever, categorized as complete (no fevers for 3 months), partial (reduced total number of days with fever over a period of 3 months), and no response (no change or increase in total days of fever over a period of 3 months). The group agreed that a particular regimen should be trialed for 3 febrile episodes to determine efficacy and, if deemed not effective by the physician and/or family, changed to another arm. Quality of life will be measured by missed school days and parental global assessment using a visual analog scale (a unidimensional measure of a characteristic or attitude that cannot easily be directly measured and is frequently used in populations with rheumatic diseases).

### Unusual causes of cutaneous ulceration [^113WVoSC]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Skin ulceration is a major source of morbidity and is often difficult to manage. Ulcers caused by an inflammatory cause or microvascular occlusion are particularly challenging in terms of diagnosis and treatment. The management of such ulcers requires careful assessment of associated systemic conditions and a thorough analysis of the ulcer's clinical and histologic findings. In this article, the authors discuss several examples of inflammatory ulcers and the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these ulcers.

### Management of perforated peptic ulcer: what you need to know [^1116xjhD]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite therapeutic advancements and the significant efficacy of medical management, peptic ulcer disease still affects millions of people. Elective surgical treatment, once a common intervention in General Surgery departments, is now nearly obsolete. Surgical treatment is reserved solely for complications, which occur in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Perforation is the most common indication for surgery in peptic ulcer disease and accounts for nearly 40% of deaths from the disease. Treatment success depends on various factors, with early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention being highlighted. Perforation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. This article aims to analyze the different aspects related to the treatment of perforated peptic ulcers and define the best therapeutic approaches.

### Thalidomide: an antineoplastic agent [^116akpCj]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

It has been more than three decades since the withdrawal of thalidomide from the marketplace. Thalidomide is attracting growing interest because of its reported immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Current evidence indicates that thalidomide reduces the activity of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha by accelerating the degradation of its messenger RNA. Thalidomide inhibits angiogenesis. Recently, thalidomide was approved for sale in the United States for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, an inflammatory complication of Hansen's disease. Thalidomide has been used successfully in several other dermatologic disorders, including aphthous stomatitis, Behcet's syndrome, chronic cutaneous systemic lupus erythematosus, and graft-versus-host disease, the apparent shared characteristic of which is immune dysregulation. Many recent studies have evaluated thalidomide in patients with HIV infection, in which this drug is an efficacious agent against oral aphthous ulcers, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, HIV-related diarrhea, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Only in the last several years has thalidomide been aggressively investigated for its antiangiogenic potential and immunomodulatory properties in various tumor types. Current research on thalidomide in oncology covers investigation in a wide range of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with recurrent orogenital ulceration, including Behçet's syndrome [^113jL4qE]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

### Canakinumab (Ilaris) [^116G6tie]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint of the randomized, 16-week treatment period (Part 2) was the proportion of complete responders within each cohort as defined by patients who had resolution of their index disease flare at Day 15 and did not experience a new disease flare during the remainder of the 16-week treatment period. Resolution of the index disease flare (initial flare at the time of the randomization) was defined at the Day 15 visit as a PGA Disease Activity score less than 2 ("minimal or no disease") and C-reactive Protein (CRP) within normal range (less than or equal to 10 mg/L) or reduction greater than or equal to 70% from baseline. The key signs and symptoms assessed in the PGA for each condition were the following: TRAPS: abdominal pain, skin rash, musculoskeletal pain, eye manifestations; HIDS/MKD: abdominal pain; lymphadenopathy, aphthous ulcers; FMF: abdominal pain, skin rash, chest pain, arthralgia/arthritis. A new flare was defined as a PGA score greater than or equal to 2 ("mild, moderate, or severe disease") and CRP greater to or equal than 30 mg/L. In the 16-week treatment period (Part 2), patients who needed dose escalation, who crossed over from placebo to ILARIS, or who discontinued from the study due to any reason prior to Week 16 were considered as non-responders.

### Consensus treatment plans for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA): a framework to evaluate treatment responses from the childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance (CARRA) PFAPA work group [^112uhmkR]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The prophylaxis arms were intended to examine the efficacy of cimetidine and colchicine, although there is limited evidence in the literature on their effectiveness. While other drugs were candidates for prophylaxis (e.g. montelukast), only publications in peer-reviewed journals were included. Prophylaxis could be chosen by the physician as a first choice or after a failure of another arm.

There were a few small studies reporting a correlation between vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency and PFAPA and one which found benefit of vitamin supplementation. However, while promising; this preliminary evidence was not considered sufficient to suggest Vitamin D as prophylactic therapy for PFAPA.

Tonsillectomy has been reported to prevent recurrences and while this may be effective for patients with PFAPA, it is not without risk. Although two small randomized control trials suggested that patients with PFAPA have less fever and less severe episodes after tonsillectomy compared to those receiving no surgery, a Cochrane review concluded that this evidence is of moderate quality (meaning that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect) due to the small numbers of patients in the studies and concerns about the generalizability of the results. Moreover, the number of patients randomly allocated to surgery was too small to detect potentially important complications. Currently there are no data on the efficacy of tonsillotomy in PFAPA and therefore it was not included in the CTP.

Evidence for IL-1 blockade, while promising, was anecdotal or based on small case series and uncontrolled trials so was not included as a therapeutic option.

For treatment arms, the benefits need to be carefully weighed against the risks, given the relatively benign and self-limiting nature of PFAPA.

PFAPA, like other diseases studied by consensus methodology, has no validated response measures, making comparisons between treatment arms challenging. Therefore, we established response criteria a priori (Table 2). Fever was chosen as the primary outcome measure. The quality of life measures were tailored to the periodic nature of PFAPA. Since PFAPA does not confer clinical sequlae (unlike FMF for example which may cause amyloidosis) and is mainly a quality of life problem, the occurrence of inflammatory marker elevation in between episodes was not considered a response criterion. Moreover, if a child with an assumed diagnosis of PFAPA has persistently elevated inflammatory markers then the diagnosis of PFAPA is incorrect.

### Toxic side effects of targeted therapies and immunotherapies affecting the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails [^111LkANZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Oral Mucosal Toxicities

Oral Mucosal Toxicities of Targeted Therapies

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitor-Associated Stomatitis

Oral mucositis is the most frequent dose-limiting toxicity observed with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus). It is characterized by aphthous-like lesions which are very different from the ones induced by chemo- and radiotherapy. These single or multiple well-circumscribed, round, superficial, painful ulcers are solely localized in the non-keratinized mucosa and occasionally surrounded by an erythematous halo. mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis occurs in about 30% of patients treated with monotherapy, mostly within the first 8 weeks of treatment; 5% are grade ≥ 3 toxicities. In addition, although usually self-limited, lesions can be very painful.

Early patient education is critical to prevent repeated trauma and avoid aggressive treatment modalities to the oral mucosa. Close follow-up by an odontologist is also essential. Early management consists of the promotion of good oral hygiene, including mouth washing with normal saline, sterile water, or sodium bicarbonate. A wide range of treatments can also be used, including low-level laser therapy, also known as soft laser therapy, pain management, and morphine mouthwash, but the first line of therapy should include topical corticosteroids. The SWISH trial demonstrated the efficacy of topical corticosteroids in post-menopausal women treated with everolimus and exemestane who prophylactically used dexamethasone-based mouthwash starting on the first day of treatment. After 8 weeks, the incidence of grade ≥ 2 stomatitis was only 2% compared with 33% in the historical BOLERO-2 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus-2) study (p < 0.0001), with no grade 3 toxicity.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^114jHEPJ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results: Among the 186 patients classified as BSD-related RAS (81 males, 105 females), the median age at symptom onset was 5 (0.5–16.5) years. Minor aphthae were the most common ulcer type, observed in 82.8% of patients, while major aphthae were detected in 17.2%. Following colchicine treatment in all patients, the frequency and duration of oral ulcers significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Both patient-/family-reported and physician-reported visual analog scale scores showed a substantial decrease after treatment (p < 0.001). Laboratory assessments conducted during the asymptomatic period before and after colchicine therapy revealed a significant reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and leukocyte count (p < 0.001, p = 0.018, respectively).

Conclusion: These findings demonstrate a substantial reduction in both clinical symptoms and laboratory markers following colchicine treatment, supporting its effectiveness as a therapeutic option for BSD-related RAS.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of seronegative enteropathies: expert review [^114zHqEy]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — conditions, characteristics, and treatment of potential etiologies of seronegative enteropathy — also outlines immune-mediated, neoplastic, and injury-related causes with diagnostic clues and management. Collagenous sprue shows subepithelial collagen deposition and treatment with GFD with or without immunosuppression (budesonide, prednisone, azathioprine). Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) presents with onset after age 2 y, poor response to vaccines, recurrent infections, and persistent diarrhea, histology with absence of plasma cells and polymorphonuclear infiltrate, testing listing IgG < 5 g/L with low IgA or IgM, and treatment with budesonide. Autoimmune enteropathy includes intractable diarrhea and weight loss, few intraepithelial lymphocytes with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the lamina propria, decreased goblet cells, and neutrophilic cryptitis, with anti-enterocyte antibody testing and immunosuppression (eg, steroids, azathioprine, infliximab). Intestinal lymphoma shows a monoclonal population of T cells with evaluation using inflammatory markers, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and PET scan, and hematology consultation. Crohn's disease features aphthous ulceration, skip lesions, and granulomas, other tests with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and treatment with immunosuppression and biologic agents. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis has massive eosinophilic infiltration with peripheral hyper eosinophilia and treatment with dietary therapy and glucocorticoids. Radiation enteropathy lists lamina propria fibrosis, and graft vs host disease shows crypt cell necrosis with loss of epithelium and treatment with prednisone or budesonide.

Discussion

The diagnosis of PG met the Delphi consensus criteria (1 major and 6 minor). Given its similarity to infections, vasculitis, and vascular ulcers, and its potential malignancy association, a thorough work-up was performed to rule out these conditions. Given colitis on endoscopic and biopsy findings 7 months prior and the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms during the current admission, mild IBD was considered the most likely PG trigger.

EIMs of IBD can be classified by their relationship to intestinal disease activity. Some, like erythema nodosum and oral aphthous ulcers, parallel IBD flares, while others, such as uveitis and ankylosing spondylitis, progress independently. PG and PUK fall into a third category with an unclear association with IBD activity. Ocular manifestations of IBD are common, particularly anterior uveitis and episcleritis.PUK is rare but has been reported in IBD cases requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Oral manifestations occur in up to 37% of adult IBD patients, with aphthous stomatitis being the most common. Other manifestations include pyostomatitis vegetans, mucosal cobblestoning, and orofacial granulomatosis. Most of these oral manifestations follow the activity of gut disease, making them useful clinical markers for IBD exacerbation.

PG has been implicated as a cause of PUK and oral ulcers, particularly in the presence of IBD. The most common presenting sign of ocular PG is ulceration, PUK, and decreased visual acuity. Oral ulcers associated with PG are irregular, with necrotic or friable bases. Differentiating PG versus IBD-related mucosal lesions is challenging due to similar presentation and nonspecific biopsy findings. However, in this case, the timing of mucosal lesions paralleling PG rather than IBD activity suggests they were manifestations of PG. Moreover, PUK is more consistent with PG. Paraneoplastic syndromes can also occur and present similarly, but there was no evidence of hematologic or solid organ malignancy on work-up.

The first-line treatment for severe, refractory cases of PG is intravenous corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists. Infliximab is an effective treatment for IBD-associated PG, which the patient's cutaneous, ocular, and oral manifestations responded to.

Distinguishing between IBD-related EIMs and PG mucosal lesions is clinically significant as it can potentially influence treatment decisions. While both conditions respond to systemic immunosuppression, ocular and oral PG may indicate a more severe, refractory disease course, warranting close monitoring and aggressive treatment. Recognizing and managing such cases requires a multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmologists, dentists, and gastroenterologists.

Introduction: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common oral mucosal disorder characterized by painful ulcers in pediatric patients. Significant genetic commonalities among RAS, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA), and Behçet's disease (BD) suggest shared underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Consequently, these disorders have been proposed to constitute a unified clinical spectrum termed "Behçet Spectrum Disorders (BSD)".

Objectives: Given the scarcity of objective data regarding the efficacy of colchicine in pediatric BSD-related RAS, this study aimed to evaluate clinical and laboratory changes in patients before and after colchicine treatment.

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 317 patients with RAS were evaluated between December 2019 and March 2024. Only patients with complete data were included in the study. Of these, 186 were classified as having BSD-related RAS, while 131 were excluded due to underlying conditions such as micronutrient deficiencies, autoinflammatory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic infections, immunodeficiencies, or hematologic disorders. The included patients were classified into three subgroups: Behçet's disease -associated RAS (BARAS), idiopathic-RAS (IRAS), and PFAPA-associated RAS (PFARAS). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed before and after colchicine treatment.

### Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci [^117CeV8c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Mouth ulcers are the most common ulcerative condition and encompass several clinical diagnoses, including recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Despite previous evidence for heritability, it is not clear which specific genetic loci are implicated in RAS. In this genome-wide association study (n = 461,106) heritability is estimated at 8.2% (95% CI: 6.4%, 9.9%). This study finds 97 variants which alter the odds of developing non-specific mouth ulcers and replicate these in an independent cohort (n = 355,744) (lead variant after meta-analysis: rs76830965, near IL12A, OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.73); P = 4.4e−483). Additional effect estimates from three independent cohorts with more specific phenotyping and specific study characteristics support many of these findings. In silico functional analyses provide evidence for a role of T cell regulation in the aetiology of mouth ulcers. These results provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of a common, important condition.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^111vJ5yo]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Thioguanine supplementary table — psoriasis systemic therapy — lists that it is "Not FDA approved for psoriasis", provides dosing as "Start at 80 mg 2 times/wk; increase by 20 mg every 2–4 weeks" with "Maximum dose is 160 mg 3 times/wk", and contraindications including "Pre-existing liver disease", "Immunosuppression", and "Anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia". Baseline monitoring includes "History and physical examination", "CBC (complete blood count) and platelet counts, CMP (complete metabolic profile), LFTs (liver function tests), hepatitis B and C, TB (tuberculosis) screen", and "Pregnancy test if indicated", while ongoing monitoring specifies "CBC and platelet count every 2–4 weeks; CMP every 3 months", "Semiannual physical examination focusing on evidence of lymphadenopathy and NMSCs", and "Pregnancy test if indicated". Reported toxicities include "Myelosuppression", "Liver toxicity from hepatic veno-occlusive disease", "Increased ALT and AST", "Hyperuricemia", "Photodermatitis", "Taste changes", "Gastroesophageal reflux, gastric ulcers", "Headache", "Nausea/vomiting", "Aphthous ulcers", "Fatigue", "Nonmelanoma skin cancer", and "Verrucae vulgaris, herpes zoster". Drug interactions note "Aminosalicylate derivatives (olsalazine, mesalazine, or sulfasalazine) may inhibit thiopurine methyltransferase", and for pregnancy "Pregnancy and breast-feeding should be avoided during treatment, and patients (including men) must use adequate contraception". The table clarifies scope: "Supplemental information is expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations".

### Penicillamine [^117EuKng]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Less commonly, a late rash may be seen, usually after six months or more of treatment, and requires discontinuation of penicillamine. It is usually on the trunk, is accompanied by intense pruritus, and is usually unresponsive to topical corticosteroid therapy. Late rash may take weeks to disappear after penicillamine is stopped and usually recurs if the drug is restarted.

The appearance of a drug eruption accompanied by fever, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy or other allergic manifestations usually requires discontinuation of penicillamine.

Certain patients will develop a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test and some of these may show a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome similar to drug-induced lupus associated with other drugs. The lupus erythematosus-like syndrome is not associated with hypocomplementemia and may be present without nephropathy. The development of a positive ANA test does not mandate discontinuance of the drug; however, the physician should be alerted to the possibility that a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome may develop in the future.

Some patients may develop oral ulcerations which in some cases have the appearance of aphthous stomatitis. The stomatitis usually recurs on rechallenge but often clears on a lower dosage. Although rare, cheilosis, glossitis and gingivostomatitis have also been reported. These oral lesions are frequently dose-related and may preclude further increase in penicillamine dosage or require discontinuation of the drug.

### Vulvar aphthous ulcer following pfizer-bioNTech COVID-19 vaccine – A case report [^111D8Dyr]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In this case report, we describe a potential association between the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and development of a vulvar aphthous ulcer in a virginal 14-year-old girl.

Case

A 14-year-old patient reported vulvar pain and visible lesion. Exam findings were consistent with vulvar aphthous ulcers. Two days prior to the onset of her symptoms she received her second Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The evening of vaccine administration, she experienced several hours duration of fatigue, muscle aching and insomnia but had otherwise been recently healthy and testing for common viral associations of vulvar ulcers was negative.

Summary and Conclusion

Vaccination, in general, has been associated with mucosal side-effects and oral ulceration has been reported in subjects who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It is reasonable to hypothesize that vulvar ulceration may be caused by a similar mechanism and should be considered a rare side effect of this vaccine.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114vvUj4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines: aims, targets, and limitations

The Guidelines are aimed to present the state-of-the-art regarding diagnosis and therapeutic options for an optimal management of complicated peptic ulcer. These guidelines are thus intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on the specific topic of complicated peptic ulcer, providing an up-to-date tool that can help during the decision-making process. For this reason, the Guidelines are evidence-based and the grade of recommendation is provided to summarize the evidences present in literature. The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

### PFAPA syndrome: a review on treatment and outcome [^114dpoEi]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA syndrome) is the most common cause of periodic fever in childhood. The current pharmacological treatment includes corticosteroids, which usually are efficacious in the management of fever episodes, colchicine, for the prophylaxis of febrile episodes, and other medication for which efficacy has not been proven so far. Tonsillectomy is an option for selected patients. Usually PFAPA syndrome resolves during adolescence, but there is increasing evidence that this condition may persist into adulthood.

### Phase I study to determine the safety, tolerability and immunostimulatory activity of thalidomide analogue CC-5013 in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma and other advanced cancers [^113Bg81K]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

CC-5013 is in development for the treatment of a variety of oncological and inflammatory diseases. The first available immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), Thalomid® (thalidomide), is approved for the treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Thalidomide has also been shown to be a useful drug in a wide range of other clinical conditions for which there is little other treatment option. These include rheumatoid arthritis, the inflammatory and wasting effects of chronic tuberculosis, Behcet's disease, Crohn's disease aphthous ulcers, cachexia (wasting) associated with HIV infection and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. There is also a wide body of evidence from large-scale clinical trials showing the effectiveness of thalidomide as a treatment for refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), and this extends to the treatment of a number of other tumours.

Immunomodulatory drug analogues are able to costimulate T cells and are highly antiangiogenic. The ability to costimulate T cells has been associated with an increased Th1-type cytokine response and suggests that in certain clinical settings, IMiD analogues are likely to act as adjuvants to promote T-cell responses, thereby contributing to antitumour activity in vivo. In this regard, IMiDs have been shown to augment antitumour responses in vivo, leading to long-term protection from tumour challenge. Antiangiogenic activity has provided the rationale for the use of this class of compound as anticancer agents and, although unproven, this has often been linked to thalidomide's teratogenicity. However, the lead IMiD, CC-5013, has been shown to be both nonteratogenic and antiangiogenic in animal models.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^1156FgoJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Therapy usually involves the use of agents with proven efficacy in enteric CD, including topical and systemic corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents. A cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet may be the first approach. Symptomatic treatment, including topical anesthetics, such as 2% viscous xylocaine, can help reduce the pain due to aphthous ulcers.

Beclamethasone mouthwashes (0.5 mg dissolved in water, several times a day) bring symptomatic relief. Lip swelling is sometimes helped by topical tacrolimus. Intralesional injection of steroids into swollen lips has been reported. In patients with persistent pain, swelling, and cosmetic disfigurement, the use of immunosuppression at an early point is to be considered. Doses used in conventional CD are employed. There are no reliable outcome data on this approach.

Biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α have been established as effective therapies and are now the treatment of choice for enteric fistulizing CD. Case reports have suggested that infliximab and adalimumab are effective therapies in orofacial CD; orofacial fistula healing and closure have been described.

CMC Management: JAK Inhibitor Treatment Can Be Sufficient but Transplantation May Be an Option

After a clinical assessment of P1, peroral treatment with baricitinib 2 mg/day (0.03 mg/kg) was initiated in 2019, with the addition of prophylactic fluconazole and valacyclovir. Neither prophylactic antibiotics nor immunoglobulin replacement therapy was considered necessary at that time. P1 has since then been adherent to baricitinib, except during pregnancy. The treatment caused significant improvement of the mucocutaneous inflammation within a month. The aphthous ulcers subsequently healed after a period of 6 months and fluconazole and valacyclovir were discontinued. Suspected adverse events were a sinusitis with H. influenzae and a varicella zoster infection, which were both treated without further complications. Preventive treatment with valacyclovir was reinserted.

In P2, baricitinib treatment 2 mg/day (0.03 mg/kg) was initiated in 2020, as well as fluconazole and valacyclovir. P2 declined offered antibiotic treatment and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. There was an initial slight reduction of mucosal inflammation, but after 3 weeks, the baricitinib treatment was discontinued due to adverse effects with painful aphteous ulcers and a productive cough, fever (38 °C), aching muscles, and elevated liver enzymes. CXR showed recent bilateral peribronchial infiltration and thickened bronchial walls. The bronchitis was treated with antibiotics. The patient made another attempt with baricitinib treatment 6 months later, after receiving echinocandin treatment and prophylactic antibiotics, but again discontinued the treatment due to aphteous ulcers and increased respiratory tract symptoms. Today (May 2022), P2 still has chronic bronchitis, uses peroral preventive treatment for fungal and viral infections, and has relapses of mucocutaneous candidiasis treated with intravenous echinocandins.
