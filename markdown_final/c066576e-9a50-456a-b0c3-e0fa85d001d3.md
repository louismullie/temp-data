## Question

triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and nomenclature of the triad. Then, I should verify the characteristic clinical features of each component. Next, I need to check how often each symptom occurs and whether the triad must be complete. After that, I will review diagnostic classifications, associated features, and pathophysiology that ties the triad together. Finally, I should confirm imaging, testing, and treatment implications to synthesize a clinically actionable summary [^113YF7nL].

> Let me first confirm the definition and the name. The core syndrome is defined by three symptoms: gait impairment, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment; this is classically termed the Hakim-Adams triad, and it anchors the diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus when integrated with characteristic imaging and response to CSF drainage, although none of the symptoms alone is pathognomonic [^113YF7nL] [^112uDado] [^114rZFbL]. Wait, let me verify the wording — some sources say "dementia", but clinically it is more precise to state "cognitive impairment", because frank dementia may not be present early and the pattern is often frontal-subcortical rather than cortical Alzheimer-type at onset [^113YF7nL].

> I will now examine the gait component, which is usually earliest and most prominent. The phenotype reflects a frontal-subcortical gait disorder with reduced speed, short steps, diminished foot clearance, outward foot rotation, broad base, and impaired dynamic equilibrium; clinicians often describe "magnetic" or apraxic features, consistent with periventricular motor system compromise and mesencephalic locomotor circuit involvement [^115Nk771] [^113qsdET]. Hold on, I should verify prevalence — gait disturbance is reported most frequently among the triad and tends to respond best after CSF diversion, so it is often the clinical cue prompting neuroimaging [^113tstWc].

> Next, I should review cognition. The cognitive profile in iNPH is typically subcortical, with executive dysfunction, psychomotor slowing, and variable memory deficits in which encoding and retrieval can be impaired but may be less severely and less amnestic than in Alzheimer disease early on; executive functions such as shifting, updating, and inhibition are commonly impaired and are measurable on neuropsychological testing [^113tstWc] [^114sUF4g]. Wait, let me double-check — global scores like the MMSE can shift after tap tests, but the signal is heterogeneous across domains and timepoints, which affects prognostication for shunting [^1143pQGx].

> I will now consider urinary dysfunction. Clinically, urgency and urge incontinence are typical, nocturia is very common, and urodynamics frequently demonstrate detrusor overactivity, supporting a neurogenic mechanism from disruption of frontal–pontine–sacral continence pathways rather than primary outlet obstruction in many patients, although obstruction can coexist, especially in older men [^111WQtiV] [^111P1sZd]. Hold on, I should verify severity — quality of life impact is often moderate even when symptom scores are "mild to moderate", reflecting the disproportionate burden of incontinence in daily function [^111WQtiV].

> I need to check how often each symptom is present and whether all three are required. Population-level data suggest gait disturbance occurs in approximately 90–100% of diagnosed cases, cognitive impairment in 56–98%, and urinary symptoms in 60–92%, and importantly, no single symptom is universal; the complete triad may be absent, and in one series with urodynamics the full triad was present in roughly half of patients, underscoring that incomplete presentations are common [^113tstWc] [^111P1sZd]. Hmm, wait a minute — this means insisting on a complete triad would systematically miss patients who could benefit from treatment [^113tstWc].

> Next, I should review diagnostic classification to avoid overcalling or undercalling cases. International guidance stratifies iNPH into unlikely, possible, and probable categories, while Japanese criteria use possible, probable, and definite, with convergence on at least two triad features (especially gait), normal CSF opening pressure, and supportive imaging for probable disease; "definite" in the Japanese scheme typically requires objective improvement after CSF drainage or shunting, which functionally serves as a diagnostic-therapeutic test in select settings [^114dRdya] [^1114Df1Z]. Hold on, I should verify — these frameworks explicitly acknowledge that partial triads can still merit evaluation and that comorbidities must be weighed in class assignment [^1114Df1Z].

> Let me consider associated features that can complicate the picture. Parkinsonian signs such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability are common in iNPH cohorts and may improve after CSF removal or shunting, though their presence broadens the differential with Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism; asymmetric classic rest tremor is less typical for iNPH [^114CmDGL] [^115kdBRC]. I should also check bulbar features — prospective data suggest swallowing and speech abnormalities are frequent and can improve post-shunting, though these are not part of the formal triad and should be interpreted in context [^112y6QuR].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology linking the triad. Enlarged ventricles and abnormal CSF dynamics exert mechanical and possibly metabolic effects on periventricular white matter tracts, disrupting frontal-subcortical circuits for gait, continence, and executive function; midbrain involvement correlates with gait severity, and midbrain dimensions can increase after shunting in association with gait improvement, supporting a mechanistic connection to mesencephalic locomotor pathways [^113qsdET] [^116pQS3L] [^112aggqq]. Wait, let me verify contemporary data — molecular and proteomic studies are refining these hypotheses but continue to support a systems-level disruption centered on periventricular networks in iNPH [^113YF7nL].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workflow triggered by recognizing the triad. Clinically, two or more triad symptoms should prompt neuroimaging to assess for ventriculomegaly and a characteristic pattern such as disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus with a narrow callosal angle; an Evans index of 0.3 or greater is a simple threshold for ventricular enlargement but is nonspecific and must be integrated with other features and clinical context [^113tstWc] [^1124AGdQ] [^111FUPAi]. Hold on, I should verify confirmation strategies — objective improvement after a large-volume lumbar puncture or extended lumbar drainage strengthens the case for shunting in appropriate candidates, acknowledging that negative predictive value is limited and decisions must remain individualized [^116Zmnjo] [^113YF7nL].

> I need to ensure therapeutic implications are precise. CSF shunting remains the mainstay and produces the highest proportional improvement in gait, followed by cognition and urinary symptoms; pooled estimates suggest gait improves in roughly 72%, cognition about 55%, and urinary symptoms about 54%, with variability across shunt types and case mixes and with complication profiles influencing device selection [^114yLMny] [^112uDado]. Wait, let me verify device nuances — ventriculo-peritoneal shunts often deliver faster relief but may carry higher infection risk, whereas lumbo-peritoneal systems can be safer but may require more revisions, so choices should be individualized to patient risk and center expertise [^112uDado].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic modifiers and timing. Gait-predominant presentations and shorter symptom duration are associated with better outcomes after shunting, supporting earlier identification and intervention when the triad is suspected; observational cohorts show that longer preoperative symptom duration tracks with reduced short-term benefit, particularly for gait, although late follow-up may attenuate these differences [^115in3xh] [^112cshwB]. I need to check the natural history — without surgery, most iNPH patients deteriorate measurably within months, reinforcing the importance of timely evaluation when the triad is recognized [^115yMdru]. I should also confirm guideline advice — elevated CSF outflow resistance, when measured, may indicate a higher likelihood of shunt response and can inform counseling, though no single test is definitive [^111Dj7o4].

> But wait, what if comorbid disease clouds reversibility and specificity of the triad. Overlap with Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and parkinsonian syndromes is common and limits both diagnosis and the magnitude of cognitive recovery; neuropathology studies increasingly show coexistent proteinopathies, which may account for partial rather than complete reversibility despite triad-directed therapy, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly and ancillary biomarkers or advanced imaging may assist selection at experienced centers [^113YF7nL] [^1129L5Wz] [^116AQ9jo]. Let me reconsider emerging tools — machine learning approaches using multisequence MRI show promise for predicting symptom domain responses, particularly gait, but remain investigational and complementary to clinical judgment grounded in the triad framework [^114TmcC2].

> Final reasoned answer: The Hakim-Adams triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus comprises gait impairment, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment, typically from periventricular white matter disruption due to ventriculomegaly; gait is usually earliest and most responsive to CSF shunting, while urinary and cognitive symptoms improve less consistently, and the complete triad need not be present for diagnosis or benefit when imaging and CSF testing support iNPH [^113YF7nL] [^114yLMny]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical takeaway — recognizing even a partial triad, especially gait-predominant presentations in the appropriate radiologic context, should trigger timely evaluation because iNPH is one of the few potentially reversible causes of gait and cognitive decline in older adults [^113tstWc] [^115in3xh].

The triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) [^113YF7nL] consists of **gait disturbance** [^114pYDpv] — broad-based, magnetic gait — **cognitive impairment** (frontal-subcortical slowing, executive dysfunction) [^113tstWc], and **urinary incontinence** (urgency, frequency, or urge incontinence) [^111WQtiV]. Gait disturbance is typically the **earliest and most prominent symptom** [^114yLMny] [^113tstWc]. The triad is associated with ventriculomegaly on imaging and normal CSF pressure [^114pYDpv].

---

## Gait disturbance

Gait disturbance is the **earliest and most prominent symptom** in NPH and is present in 90–100% of cases [^113tstWc] [^114pYDpv]. It features a broad-based, magnetic gait with short steps, difficulty initiating movement, and impaired balance, often leading to falls [^113YF7nL]. This pattern is distinct from other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, and is a key diagnostic feature of NPH [^115WbBP8] [^113YF7nL].

---

## Cognitive impairment

Cognitive impairment in NPH typically presents as a **frontal-subcortical syndrome**, with slowed processing speed, impaired attention, executive dysfunction, and memory deficits [^113YF7nL] [^113tstWc]. This profile is distinct from Alzheimer's disease, which primarily affects memory and language. Cognitive impairment in NPH is often at least partially reversible with appropriate treatment, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting [^114yLMny] [^114sUF4g].

---

## Urinary incontinence

Urinary incontinence is the third component of the NPH triad and occurs in approximately 60–92% of cases [^113tstWc]. It typically presents as **urinary urgency, frequency, or urge incontinence** and is often associated with detrusor overactivity on urodynamic testing [^111WQtiV] [^111P1sZd]. Urinary symptoms in NPH are often mild to moderate but can significantly affect quality of life [^111WQtiV].

---

## Clinical significance of the triad

The clinical triad of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence is **essential to diagnosis** of NPH [^114dRdya]. The presence of these symptoms, along with ventriculomegaly on imaging and normal CSF pressure, distinguishes NPH from other neurodegenerative disorders [^113YF7nL] [^113tstWc] [^114pYDpv]. Early recognition of the triad is critical, as NPH is a **potentially reversible** condition with appropriate treatment, such as CSF shunting [^113YF7nL] [^114yLMny] [^112cshwB].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and guidelines

The diagnosis of NPH is based on **clinical symptoms, imaging findings, and response to CSF diversion tests** [^114dRdya] [^114pYDpv]. According to the Japanese Society of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus guidelines, possible NPH is diagnosed when the following features are present [^1114Df1Z]:

- Clinical symptoms of gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and/or urinary incontinence
- Ventriculomegaly on neuroimaging (Evans index ≥ 0.3)
- Symptoms not explained by other neurological conditions
- No obvious preceding causes of hydrocephalus

- **Probable NPH** requires additional neuroimaging features or objective gait improvement after large-volume lumbar puncture or external lumbar drain [^1114Df1Z]. **Definite NPH** is diagnosed when there is definitive improvement after CSF shunting [^113YF7nL].

---

## Treatment and prognosis

The primary treatment for NPH is **CSF shunting**, which can significantly improve symptoms, particularly gait disturbance [^113YF7nL] [^114yLMny] [^112aggqq]. Cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence may also improve, though to a lesser extent [^114yLMny] [^114sUF4g]. Early diagnosis and treatment are associated with better outcomes, whereas delayed treatment may result in irreversible neurological damage [^113YF7nL].

---

In summary, the NPH triad — gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence — is central to diagnosis and management, and **early recognition and intervention** can significantly improve patient outcomes [^114yLMny].

### Unbiased CSF proteomics in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus to identify molecular signatures and candidate biomarkers [^113YF7nL]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neurologic disorder characterized by abnormal CSF volume expansion in the ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, which is visible on radiologic imaging. Clinically, the iNPH syndrome is characterized by three main symptoms: gait impairment, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment, also known as the Hakim-Adams triad of symptoms. A hallmark of iNPH is that diversion of excess CSF from the ventricular system, through the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, can decrease or eliminate a patient's symptoms and neurologic deficits. Diagnosis is typically established by assessing the patient's main symptoms, characteristic imaging features, and their response to CSF diversion through a large-volume lumbar puncture (LP) or external lumbar drain.

Differential iNPH diagnosis is complicated by overlapping symptomatology with other common conditions of aging, including arthritis, frailty, prostate and pelvic floor dysfunction, and common neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease, or Parkinson's disease. Aside from neuroimaging, there are currently no biomarkers available for iNPH diagnosis, leading to frequent misdiagnosis in the form of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. This may lead to excessive morbidity by not treating a treatable condition or unnecessary surgical intervention.

iNPH pathophysiology remains poorly understood, and studies into the underlying proteomic changes in iNPH are sparse and limited in sample size, or narrowly focused on inflammatory markers or micro-RNAs.

### Longitudinal neuropsychological trajectories in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a population-based study [^113tstWc]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a progressive syndrome that negatively affects the "triad" of gait, cognition, and incontinence. Distinct radiological features on brain imaging include an Evans' index ≥ 0.3, wide temporal horns, and a narrow callosal angle. Typically, adults aged 65 years or older are affected by iNPH, with an estimated prevalence of 1.4–3.7% that increases with age. The clearance of excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through shunting is an effective treatment, and waiting time for surgery can negatively impact the outcome; hence, timely interventions are important.

Gait disturbance is the most frequent symptom in iNPH, present in 90–100% of diagnosed cases, followed by worsened cognition (56–98%) and incontinence (60–92%). Although gait disturbances are hallmark signs of iNPH, upper motor dysfunction is also a part of the syndrome. One prominent cognitive dysfunction in iNPH is poor executive functioning, which can be divided into three separate but related domains: shifting, updating, and inhibition, with a prominent frontal-lobe contribution. Another salient form of cognitive disturbance is decreased verbal memory. Verbal memory tests, such as the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), assess the ability to learn, store, and retrieve verbal information, thus reflecting declarative memory.

Few studies have focused on the developmental trajectory of iNPH. Additionally, although not all studies, most are retrospective with a focus on radiological signs of iNPH before symptom onset, referred to as AVIM (asympto).

### Characterization of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111WQtiV]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).

- **Methods**: Patients with new-onset iNPH were prospectively evaluated for LUTS through a detailed history and physical examination. Questionnaires from the International Consultation on Incontinence were administered to assess incontinence (ICIQ-UI), overactive bladder (ICIQ-OAB), and quality of life (ICIQ-LUTqol), alongside the American Urological Association Symptom Score bother scale. All patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS were offered urodynamic testing. A sub-analysis was performed based on gender, medical comorbidities, and age.

- **Results**: Fifty-five consecutive patients with iNPH completed the initial evaluations and surveys. The total urinary incontinence score was mild to moderate (8.71 ± 0.64 on a 0–21 scale), with 90.9% experiencing leakage and 74.5% reporting urge incontinence. The most common overactive bladder symptom was nocturia (2.2 ± 0.14 on a 0–4 scale), with urge incontinence being the most bothersome (3.71 ± 0.44 on a 0–10 scale). The quality-of-life impact was moderate (4.47 ± 0.4 on a 0–10 scale), and the American Urological Association Symptom Score bother scale was 2.89 ± 0.22 (0–6 scale). Urodynamics testing revealed 100% detrusor overactivity and a mean bladder capacity of 200 mL. Several differences were noted based on gender, medical comorbidities, and age.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with iNPH present with mild to moderate incontinence, with nocturia being the most common symptom and urge incontinence the most bothersome. All patients exhibited detrusor overactivity. Differences based on age, gender, and medical comorbidities were observed.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: A systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^112uDado]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is characterized by the clinical triad of gait disturbance, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is the gold standard treatment. Despite the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VPS) being more commonly used, the lumbo-peritoneal shunt (LPS) offers a minimally invasive alternative, raising questions about their relative efficacy and safety.

A systematic review was conducted on multiple databases with a two-step selection process to exclude studies with insufficient data, irrelevance, and lack of comparative analysis between the two procedures. From the included studies, we comparatively analyzed preoperative clinical-radiological characteristics, surgical details, and clinical-radiological outcomes. We included 6 studies matching our inclusion criteria.

- **Clinical outcomes**: Both VPS and LPS improved functional and cognitive performance. VPS provided faster symptom relief but has been associated with higher risks of infection, whereas LPS showed a safer profile but required more frequent revisions due to mechanical issues.

VPS and LPS are both effective treatments for iNPH. The choice of intervention should be tailored to individual patient risk profiles, resource availability, and surgical expertise. Future research should focus on standardizing assessment scores, resolving controversies, and evaluating long-term outcomes.

### Diagnosing idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^114dRdya]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The precise incidence and prevalence of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) are not known, and evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria have not been developed previously. This report contains evidence-based guidelines for the clinical diagnosis of INPH that are intended to facilitate future epidemiological studies, promote earlier and more accurate diagnosis, and ultimately improve treatment outcomes.

- **Methods**: The criteria for the diagnosis of INPH are based on evidence from the medical literature, supplemented as necessary by expert opinion. From 1966 to 2003, 653 publications on "normal-pressure hydrocephalus" were cited in MEDLINE, including 29 articles that met the more stringent criteria of including "idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus" in their title. Additional studies were considered that explicitly identified INPH cases and/or specified the criteria for a diagnosis of INPH. Studies were graded according to the class of evidence, and results were summarized in evidentiary tables. For issues of clinical relevance that lacked substantive evidence from the medical literature, the opinions of consulting experts were considered and contributed to "Options".

- **Results**: Evidence-based guidelines for the clinical diagnosis of INPH have been developed. A detailed understanding of the range of clinical manifestations of this disorder and adherence to practice guidelines should improve the timely and accurate recognition of this disorder.

- **Conclusion**: It is recommended that INPH be classified into probable, possible, and unlikely categories.

### Genetic risk factors in normal pressure hydrocephalus: What we know and what is next [^111cLdke]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

- **Selection criteria and data synthesis**: By NPH, we referred to studies whose subjects met the criteria outlined in existing diagnostic guidelines, as detailed in the introduction. Studies published before these guidelines were included if the authors identified subjects as having idiopathic/primary NPH with slowly progressive symptoms from the triad and accompanying communicating hydrocephalus. Manuscripts describing cases more likely attributable to other neurological conditions or involving obstructive, congenital, or arrested childhood hydrocephalus were excluded, along with review articles, guidelines, conference abstracts, and consensus statements.

Two authors (C.C.P. and S. A.) independently screened the titles and abstracts uploaded to Covidence, resolving inconsistencies through discussion until consensus was reached. Subsequently, the same authors reviewed and screened the full-text articles for inclusion and data extraction. Disagreements were discussed, with a third author (I.F.M.) consulted for unresolved cases. A narrative synthesis approach was used to summarize the findings from the selected studies. Data were categorized into the following themes: familial NPH, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES/WGS), copy-number variation studies (CNV), genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and Mendelian randomization studies, candidate gene approach, and transcriptomic studies.

A meta-analysis was not conducted because of the heterogeneity in study designs, settings, methodologies, and outcomes. For each manuscript, the number of subjects and controls analyzed was documented.

### Parkinsonian symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus: A population-based study [^114CmDGL]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Parkinsonian symptomatology exists in addition to the classical triad of gait, cognitive, and urinary symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and may complicate the diagnostic considerations. Radiology of the brain is essential to diagnose NPH, with typical findings of dilated ventricles without any macroscopic obstruction to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) flow, often with signs of compressed cortical sulci combined with focally enlarged sulci. NPH is a treatable condition; approximately 80% of the patients experience symptom improvement after surgical treatment with a CSF shunt.

The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a widely used rating scale for Parkinson's disease (PD), and the motor examination part (UPDRS-m) has also been used to rate parkinsonian motor symptoms in NPH patients. In previous hospital-based studies, upper body bradykinesia has been described in 62% and parkinsonism in up to 71% of NPH patients. Significant improvements in the total UPDRS-m score have been observed after shunt surgery and after CSF removal by lumbar puncture (CSF tap test). Mild parkinsonian signs in the four categories — bradykinesia, tremor at rest, rigidity, and postural/gait changes — are found in 20–40% of the older population. Aside from neurodegenerative diseases, factors associated with normal aging, as well as comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease and essential tremor, may contribute to findings of isolated parkinsonian signs.

As parkinsonian features are important in the differential diagnosis of neurological disorders, we wanted to describe the factors influencing the presentation.

### Familial normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) with an autosomal-dominant inheritance: a novel subgroup of NPH [^112iggWT]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) has two clinical forms: secondary NPH and idiopathic NPH (iNPH). Most patients with NPH occur sporadically; until now, only two families have been reported to have sibling cases of NPH. We here report a large family with four patients with elderly-onset NPH across three generations. All of them had cognitive impairment, gait disturbance, and urinary problems, alongside normal pressure of cerebrospinal fluid. Their brain MRI showed enlargement of the ventricles and a disproportional narrowing of the subarachnoid space and cortical sulci at the high convexity of the cerebrum, which are the features of iNPH on MRI. The family interview also disclosed an additional four patients who were suspected to have NPH. The disease appears to be inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion, with no known causes of secondary NPH found in any of the patients. This report is the first to show a large family with NPH patients in three generations, having clinical and MRI features indistinguishable from iNPH. This seems to represent a novel subgroup of NPH, familial NPH.

### The effectiveness of various CSF diversion surgeries in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yLMny]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

When outcomes were categorized based on symptoms of Hakim's triad (gait, cognition, and urinary symptoms), gait showed a high proportional improvement, occurring in 72% of patients (95% CI: 67–77%). This was followed by improvements in cognition in 55% of patients (95% CI: 46–65%) and urinary symptoms in 54% of patients (95% CI: 45–63%). Across the shunt types — VP, LP, or VA — the improvement for gait ranges from 67 to 74%, cognition from 49 to 59%, and urinary symptoms from 50 to 56%.

- **CSF diversion procedure improvement by Hakim's triad of symptoms**: Forest plots visualized the proportional improvement of iNPH patients stratified by symptoms of Hakim's triad in the order of "Gait", "Urinary", and "Cognition" following each shunt CSF diversion (VPS, LPS, and VA) and overall. The box represents the estimate with the 95% confidence interval shown as whiskers. The diamonds indicate the overall pooled proportion. The pooled estimate was obtained by proportional random effect meta-analysis where applicable.

### Genetic risk factors in normal pressure hydrocephalus: What we know and what is next [^117CHgZf]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This article reviews cumulative data on the role of genetics in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) risk, highlighting its complexity and supporting that NPH may range from being primarily driven by genetics to largely influenced by environmental factors. At the time of writing, the literature documents more than 30 families with two or more individuals affected by NPH, including 28 families where at least one member responded to shunt surgery. In addition, studies on European descendant cohorts showed that 10%–16% of NPH individuals had relatives with two or more NPH symptoms.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and copy-number variation (CNV) studies identified variants significantly enriched in patients with NPH compared with controls, involving:

- **Japanese families**: CFAP43
- **Multiple populations (Japanese, Finnish, Norwegian)**: SFMBT1
- **Multiethnic cohort**: CWH43
- **Population of unspecified ancestry**:
	- **CWH43 and others**: CWH43
	- **Genes of interest**: AK9, RXFP2, PRKD1, HAVCR1, OTOG, MYO7A, NOTCH1, SPG11, MYH13, FOXJ1

These genes are highly expressed in the choroid plexus and ependymal cells, with many linked to cilia function, underscoring their potential as candidate genes in NPH. Further studies are needed to confirm their role, particularly CFAP43, found in one family, and FOXJ1, identified in a single individual.

- **Summary of findings**: Genes identified through whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, copy-number variation studies, and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) may contribute to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, circulation, or drainage. The NME8 gene was no longer significant after correction for multiple comparisons but was linked to periventricular effects.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus and cognitive impairment: The gait phenotype matters too [^116bHYsY]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a chronic neurological condition that leads to progressive gait and cognitive disorders, which become irreversible if not diagnosed and treated early. Since the treatment involves a neurosurgical intervention, it is crucial to correctly identify suitable patients to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures. In this study, we focused on the gait phenotype to provide easily accessible information for clinicians in the evaluation of iNPH patients. We investigated whether the gait phenotype is associated with the severity of cognitive deficits in iNPH.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and analysis of long-term outcomes in idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^115in3xh]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

The response to shunt surgery for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is variable because INPH is difficult to distinguish from other conditions causing the same symptoms. At the time of writing, no clinical picture or diagnostic test can distinguish INPH or predict response to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt surgery. We reviewed our 10-year experience with INPH to characterize long-term outcomes and to identify independent predictors of outcome after shunt surgery.

- **Methods**: Patients were classified as having INPH only if they had: 1) ventriculomegaly, 2) two or more INPH clinical features, 3) no risk factor for secondary normal-pressure hydrocephalus, 4) A- or B-waves on CSF pressure monitoring, and 5) clinical improvement during a 3-day CSF drainage trial via a spinal catheter. Independent predictors of outcome were assessed via a multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis.

- **Results**: One hundred thirty-two patients underwent 179 shunt surgeries. Forty-four (33%), 79 (60%), and 99 (75%) patients demonstrated objective improvement 3, 6, and 24 months after shunt surgery, respectively. Gait improved first in 88 (93%) patients. Dementia and urinary incontinence were twofold less likely to improve. Radiological evidence of corpus callosum distension, gait impairment as the primary symptom, and shorter duration of INPH symptoms predicted improvement. Duration of symptoms and gait as the primary symptom were independent predictors by multivariate analysis.

- **Conclusion**: INPH can be diagnosed accurately with CSF pressure monitoring and CSF drainage via a spinal catheter.

### Evidence that congenital hydrocephalus is a precursor to idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus in only a subset of patients [^112jtUpX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

To identify the proportion of patients in a large idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) cohort with a large head circumference (HC), which presumably indicates congenital hydrocephalus not clinically apparent until later in life, the head circumference was measured in 158 patients diagnosed with communicating INPH. These measurements were adjusted for height and sex, categorizing patients into HC centile ranges. The proportion of patients with INPH and HC above the 97th, 90th, or 50th centiles was compared to the expected proportion in a normal population.

- **Results**: The proportion of patients with HC greater than the 90th centile was significantly larger than expected in a normal distribution (19.6% vs. 10%, p = 0.0001). Similarly, the proportion with HC above the 97th centile was larger than anticipated (8.9% vs. 3%, p = 0.0001). The relative association between INPH and HC above the 97th centile was nearly tripled (relative association 2.95; CI 1.36 to 6.41), but the association between INPH and HC above the 50th centile was not significantly higher than predicted (relative association 1.13; CI 0.95 to 1.34).

- **Conclusion**: A significantly larger proportion of elderly adults with INPH have HC measurements greater than the 90th or 97th centiles than predicted by population norms. This supports the concept that compensated congenital hydrocephalus, which does not become symptomatic until late in life, is one cause of INPH, although not responsible for all cases. The mechanism underlying the development of INPH in most patients remains elusive.

### Management of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113qsdET]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia are the signs and symptoms typically found in patients who have normal pressure hydrocephalus. Estimated to cause no more than 5 percent of cases of dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus often is treatable, and accurate recognition of the clinical triad coupled with radiographic evidence most commonly identifies likely responders. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography typically demonstrates ventricular dilation with preservation of the surrounding brain tissue.

The abnormality in normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs secondary to an abnormality in fluid removal, leading to an increase in ventricular size and encroachment of enlarged ventricles on adjacent brain tissue. The pressure exerted on the cerebral parenchyma by immense fluid-filled cavities deforms white matter tracts, instigating gait abnormalities and incomplete control of the bladder, as well as difficulties in processing incoming stimulation and in producing expeditious responses.

Signs and symptoms often occur as sequelae to an imbalance between the expected ongoing production of cerebrospinal fluid and continuous efflux. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is used to relieve excess ventricular fluid not absorbed by normal physiologic channels. Multiple studies have explored various techniques to identify patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus in an effort to predict likely benefit from shunting. However, the effectiveness of cerebrospinal fluid diversion has never been proven in a randomized controlled trial comparing use of a shunt versus no shunt.

### Timing of surgical treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: Association between treatment delay and reduced short-term benefit [^112cshwB]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

A growing body of evidence suggests that longer durations of preoperative symptoms may correlate with worse postoperative outcomes following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion for the treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The aim of this study is to determine whether the duration of preoperative symptoms alters postoperative outcomes in patients treated for iNPH.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 393 cases of iNPH involving patients treated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting. The duration of symptoms prior to the operative intervention was recorded. The following outcome variables were assessed at baseline, 6 months postoperatively, and at last follow-up: gait performance, urinary continence, and cognition.

- **Results**: The patients' median age at shunt placement was 74 years. Increased symptom duration was significantly associated with worse gait outcomes (relative risk [RR] 1.055 per year of symptoms, p = 0.037), and an overall absence of improvement in any of the classic triad symptomatology (RR 1.053 per year of symptoms, p = 0.033) at 6 months postoperatively. Additionally, there were trends toward significance for symptom duration increasing the risk of having no 6-month postoperative improvement in urinary incontinence (RR 1.049 per year of symptoms, p = 0.069) or cognitive symptoms (RR 1.051 per year of symptoms, p = 0.069). However, no statistically significant differences were noted in these outcomes at last follow-up (median 31 months). Age stratification by decade revealed that prolonging symptom duration was significant.

### Selection of patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus for shunt placement: a single-institution experience [^114rZFbL]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). High credibility.

The ability to predict outcomes after shunt placement in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) represents a challenge. At the time of writing, no single diagnostic tool or combination of tools has proved capable of reliably predicting whether the condition of a patient with suspected NPH will improve following a shunting procedure. In this paper, the authors report their experience with 120 patients, aiming to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics criteria capable of selecting patients with idiopathic NPH. Specifically, they focused on the comparison between CSF-outflow resistance (R-out) and intracranial elastance (IE).

Between January 1977 and December 2005, 120 patients diagnosed with idiopathic NPH (based on clinical findings and imaging) underwent CSF hydrodynamics evaluation using an intraventricular infusion test. Ninety-six patients underwent CSF shunt placement: 32 between 1977 and 1989 (Group I) on the basis of purely clinical and radiological criteria; 44 between 1990 and 2002 (Group II) based on the same criteria as Group I and an IE slope > 0.25; and 20 between 2003 and 2005 (Group III) based on the same criteria as Group II but with an IE slope ≥ 0.30. Outcomes were evaluated by both the Stein-Langfitt and Larsson scores. Patients' conditions were considered improved when there was a stable decrease (at 6- and 12-month follow-up) of at least 1 point in the Stein-Langfitt score and 2 points in the Larsson score.

Group I outcomes indicated no statistically significant difference in…

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus combined with quadruple misfolded proteinopathy: An autopsy case report and a short review of literature [^1129L5Wz]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which clinically presents as the triad of gait disorder, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence, was once believed to be a leading cause of reversible dementia. With further research, however, it has become evident that the dementia caused by NPH is only partially reversible and cannot be completely cured through tap tests or shunt surgery.

There are many reports about the comorbidity of NPH and other neurodegenerative diseases; the primary findings in neuropathological studies of patients with NPH include amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein inclusions. This suggests that proteinopathy may be one of the potential causes of NPH. However, cases of NPH combined with quadruple misfolded proteinopathy (QMP) are still lacking. QMP is a pathological term used to describe the coexistence of four proteinopathies (amyloid β-protein [Aβ], tau, α-synuclein, and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 [TDP-43]) in the same brain. While QMP is common in aged human brains, understanding of the pathological features and the detailed disease course of QMP patients remains incomplete. Here, we report the first autopsy case of NPH combined with QMP.

### MR elastography demonstrates increased brain stiffness in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111coAwr]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a reversible neurologic disorder characterized by a triad of cognitive impairment, gait abnormality, and urinary incontinence, commonly treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. However, multiple overlapping symptoms often make it difficult to differentiate normal pressure hydrocephalus from other types of dementia; improved diagnostic techniques would help patient management. MR elastography is a novel diagnostic tool that could potentially identify patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. The purpose of this study was to assess brain stiffness changes in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus compared with age- and sex-matched cognitively healthy individuals.

- **Materials and methods**: MR elastography was performed on 10 patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and 21 age- and sex-matched volunteers with no known neurologic disorders. Image acquisition was conducted on a 3T MR imaging scanner. Shear waves with a 60-Hz vibration frequency were transmitted into the brain by a pillowlike passive driver. A novel postprocessing technique resistant to noise and edge artifacts was implemented to determine regional brain stiffness. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and linear regression were used for statistical analysis.

- **Results**: A significant increase in stiffness was observed in the cerebrum (P = .001), occipital lobe (P < .001), parietal lobe (P = .001), and the temporal lobe (P = .02) in the normal pressure hydrocephalus group compared with healthy controls. However, no significant difference was noted for other regions.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunting of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus increases midbrain size: a potential mechanism for gait improvement [^112aggqq]. Neurosurgery (2006). High credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is characterized by a classic clinical triad of symptoms, including dementia, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbance. Recent work has demonstrated that the maximal midbrain anteroposterior (AP) diameter is significantly smaller in patients with INPH than in healthy, age-matched controls. The study was undertaken to determine the effect of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement on midbrain dimensions in INPH patients.

- **Methods**: Twelve consecutive INPH patients undergoing ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement with pre- and postoperative computed tomographic scans at the Columbia University Medical Center were enrolled. Each patient's pre- and postoperative maximum AP and left-to-right diameters of the midbrain at the pontomesencephalic junction were independently measured in a blinded fashion by two of the authors. The average value of each dimension was computed by calculating the mean values of the measurements of the two observers.

- **Results**: Both the mean AP diameter (preoperative mean, 2.06 ± 0.04 cm; postoperative mean, 2.27 ± 0.05 cm; P = 0.0007) and left-to-right diameter (preoperative mean, 2.80 ± 0.07 cm; postoperative mean, 3.03 ± 0.08 cm; P = 0.0029) increased from pre- to postoperative imaging. The approximate cross-sectional area, determined as the product of AP and left-to-right diameters, also increased from pre- to postoperative images (preoperative mean, 5.79 ± 0.22 cm²; postoperative mean, 6.90 ± 0.25 cm²; P = 0.00049).

- **Conclusion**: This study provides supportive evidence that midbrain cytoarchitecture may play a role in gait improvement following ventriculoperitoneal shunting in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.

### Cognitive functions after spinal tap in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^1143pQGx]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is characterized by gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia. Even though dementia is a cardinal symptom of NPH, there is little data available concerning cognitive functioning. The aim of this observational case-control study was to evaluate the use of neuropsychological (NPSY) tests before and following a spinal tap test, which might be helpful for diagnosis, treatment, and as a prognostic factor for shunt surgery. Fifteen patients with NPH and eighteen controls were examined with eleven different tests covering all neuropsychological domains on two consecutive days. The second examination in NPH patients was conducted one day following a spinal tap of 30–50 mL cerebrospinal fluid.

A significant difference between NPH and controls in the change between baseline and one day after the spinal tap was only observed in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In the domains of visuo-constructive function and attention, controls performed slightly better on day one compared to baseline. This could be interpreted as a learning effect, but after adjusting for multiple testing, none of the P values were significant. In contrast to other reports, the MMSE seems to provide a sensitive evaluation of the response to spinal tap in NPH patients and might therefore be included in the routine work-up of NPH patients. All other NPSY tests showed less prominent changes within one day after the spinal tap.

### Pathogenesis and management of low-pressure hydrocephalus: A narrative review [^115hTEYQ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). High credibility.

Patients diagnosed with low-pressure hydrocephalus typically present with enlarged ventricles and unusually low intracranial pressure, often measuring below 5 cmH₂O or even below atmospheric pressure. This atypical presentation often leads to low recognition and diagnostic rates. The development of low-pressure hydrocephalus is believed to be associated with a decrease in the viscoelasticity of brain tissue or separation between the ventricular and subarachnoid spaces.

Risk factors for low-pressure hydrocephalus include subarachnoid hemorrhage, aqueduct stenosis, prior cranial radiotherapy, ventricular shunting, and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. For potential low-pressure hydrocephalus, diagnostic criteria include neurological symptoms related to hydrocephalus, an Evans index > 0.3 on imaging, ICP ≤ 5 cm H₂O, symptom improvement with negative pressure drainage, and exclusion of ventriculomegaly caused by neurodegenerative diseases.

The pathogenesis and pathophysiological features of low-pressure hydrocephalus differ significantly from other types of hydrocephalus, making it challenging to restore normal ventricular morphology through conventional drainage methods. The primary treatment options for low-pressure hydrocephalus involve negative pressure drainage and third ventriculostomy. With appropriate treatment, most patients can regain their previous neurological function. However, in most cases, permanent shunt surgery is still necessary. Low-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare condition with a high rate of underdiagnosis and mortality. Early identification and appropriate intervention are crucial.

### Correlation of midbrain diameter and gait disturbance in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116pQS3L]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Although gait disturbance is an important feature of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), only tentative theories have been offered to explain its pathophysiology. It has been suggested that the mesencephalic locomotor region is the anatomical substrate for the development of the hypokinetic NPH gait. To investigate this possibility, we evaluated the correlation between gait disturbance and midbrain diameter.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 21 patients with NPH and 20 age-matched control subjects for the study. The maximal diameter of the midbrain and pons, and the width of the lateral and third ventricles were measured using midsagittal T1-weighted MRI and axial T2-weighted MRI, respectively. Gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and incontinence were semiquantified.

- **Results**: The maximal midbrain diameter was significantly smaller in the NPH group than in controls (14.8 ± 0.9 vs. 17.1 ± 0.7 mm, p < 0.001). There were inverse correlations between the midbrain diameter and the widths of the two ventricles (r = -0.562, p = 0.008 for the third ventricle, and r = -0.510, p = 0.018 for the lateral ventricle). The severity of gait disturbance was negatively correlated with the midbrain diameter (r = -0.598, p = 0.004). However, the degree of cognitive dysfunction and incontinence showed no significant correlation with midbrain diameter or ventricular width.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that midbrain atrophy is significantly associated with gait disturbance in NPH.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116AQ9jo]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The clinical picture of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) comprises disturbed gait and balance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence, treatable by CSF shunting. In modern studies, around 80% of treated patients experience improved symptoms. Despite extensive research into a wide range of radiological, biochemical, and hydrodynamic markers, at the time of writing, no specific test can adequately diagnose iNPH or predict which patients will benefit from shunt surgery. Reliable tests for the prediction of outcomes are warranted.

Concerning symptoms and signs, several studies have suggested that either the presence of the complete triad or a clinical picture with a predominant gait disturbance are prognostically favorable. Agerskov et al. showed that the sign of shuffling gait was predictive of improvement post-shunting. Earlier studies have been small or limited with regard to studied symptomatology. The POiNT (Prediction of Outcome in iNPH) study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of clinical, CSF, and MRI markers on outcome after shunt surgery, and this paper aims to explore the predictive value of a broad panel of symptoms and signs typical for iNPH using an outcome measure specifically developed for iNPH patients.

### Cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^117PEvf2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neurological disorder characterized by a triad of gait difficulty, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. In aging populations, iNPH has growing importance as a cause of dementia, with a prevalence of 0.18% among those over age 60 and an estimated 3.7% prevalence in people over age 65, which increases with age. Differences in prevalence likely trace to differences in clinical decision-making among countries. The symptoms of iNPH can be reversed with shunt surgery, and early diagnosis is vital for patient quality of life and reduced costs. The cause of iNPH remains unconfirmed, but cilial dysfunction is considered to be a key element in its development. Comorbid neurological disorders or former ischemic events can lead to a poor outcome of shunt surgery, and co-occurring conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are relevant in selecting patients who would benefit from shunt surgery. Furthermore, around 20% of shunted iNPH patients will have developed clinical AD at follow-up.

### MRI-based prediction of clinical improvement after ventricular shunt placement for normal pressure hydrocephalus: Development and evaluation of an integrated multisequence machine learning algorithm [^114TmcC2]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2024). High credibility.

Symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) are sometimes refractory to shunt placement, with limited ability to predict improvement for individual patients. We evaluated an MRI-based artificial intelligence method to predict post-shunt NPH symptom improvement.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients with NPH who underwent MRI before shunt placement at a single center (2014–2021) were identified. Twelve-month post-shunt improvement in mRS, incontinence, gait, and cognition were retrospectively abstracted from clinical documentation. 3D deep residual neural networks were built on skull-stripped T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Predictions based on both sequences were fused by additional network layers. Patients from 2014–2019 were used for parameter optimization, while those from 2020–2021 were used for testing. Models were validated on an external validation data set from a second institution (n = 33).

- **Results**: Of 249 patients, n = 201 and n = 185 were included in the T2-based and FLAIR-based models according to imaging availability. The combination of T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences offered the best performance in mRS and gait improvement predictions relative to models trained on imaging acquired by using only one sequence, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values of 0.7395 [0.5765–0.9024] for mRS and 0.8816 [0.8030–0.9602] for gait. For urinary incontinence and cognition, combined model performances on predicting outcomes were similar to FLAIR-only performance, with AUROC values of 0.7874 [0.6845–0.8903] and 0.7230 [0.5600–0.8850].

### Bulbar dysfunction in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a prospective study [^112y6QuR]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is clinically characterized by gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, and enlargement of the ventricles. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no previous publications regarding the correlation between bulbar dysfunction and NPH. The primary objective of this study was to compare the preoperative and postoperative prevalence of bulbar dysfunction in patients with NPH. Secondary objectives included assessing the results of surgery regarding swallowing, speech, gait, cognition, and urination, and evaluating the correlation between bulbar dysfunction and triad symptoms.

Methods: Fifty-three patients with NPH who underwent shunt placement surgery at Siriraj Hospital were included in the study. Patients were evaluated for gait, cognition, urination, swallowing, and speech before and six months after shunt placement. Triad symptoms were assessed using standard methods. Bulbar dysfunctions were assessed using the Swallowing Problem Questionnaire, Thai Articulation Test, Resonation Screening Test (RST), and Thai Nasality Test. The Thai Speech Assessment Program and nasometer were used for objective speech measurement.

Results: Preoperatively, 86% (43/50) of patients had swallowing problems and 75% (37/49) had speech problems, as measured by the RST. Postoperatively, there was a significant improvement in swallowing (p < 0.001), speech problems by RST (p = 0.008), and voice volume (p = 0.009), but no significant change in the nasometer test. All triad symptoms were improved. There were significant correlations observed.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114sUF4g]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is characterized by a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain despite apparently normal CSF pressure at lumbar puncture. Idiopathic NPH (iNPH) typically occurs in later life without any obvious cause. Symptoms include gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and progressive dementia. Dementia-related symptoms are characterized by deficits in memory, visuospatial abilities, psychomotor speed, and executive function.

The effect of shunt treatment on cognitive performance in patients with NPH is controversial. While CSF drainage is generally considered to relieve problems with gait and incontinence, cognitive impairment is reported to be the least likely symptom to improve. Rates of cognitive improvement range from 0 to 80% of patients in a given series. However, methodological limitations have been identified which could explain the variability observed between studies. These include unclear patient selection criteria, inconsistent follow-up intervals, and use of subjective measures of improvement. Additionally, due to the lack of standardized clinical guidelines for assessing cognitive function in this patient group, assessment methods often vary between centers, with functional grading scales, clinical rating scales, and neuropsychological testing being employed. Studies that have focused on neuropsychological test performance generally show a beneficial effect of shunt surgery on cognitive function. However, the pattern of post-operative neuropsychological improvement varies widely between studies.

### Gaps, controversies, and proposed roadmap for research in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^1165GAk8]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is considered common but remains underinvestigated. There are no uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria or therapeutic guidelines. This paper summarizes the accumulated evidence regarding the definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. It highlights many gaps and controversies, including diagnostic challenges, the frequent association with neurodegeneration and vascular disease, and the many unknowns regarding patient selection and outcome predictors. A roadmap to fill these gaps and resolve the controversies around this condition is also proposed.

More evidence is required with respect to diagnostic criteria, the value of ancillary testing, prospective population-based studies, and novel trial designs. Furthermore, there is a need to develop new advanced options in shunt technology.

### Diffusion tensor imaging helps identify shunt-responsive normal pressure hydrocephalus patients among probable iNPH cohort [^113MYma2]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a clinical syndrome classically characterized by a triad of progressive dementia, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence, with imaging findings of ventriculomegaly despite normal opening pressures on lumbar puncture. The reported prevalence of iNPH in elderly individuals usually lies within the 1–2% range, with some studies reporting up to 5.9% prevalence among individuals aged 80 years and older. Therefore, iNPH is a significant burden not only to the affected and their families but also to healthcare systems as a whole. Consequently, accurate and timely diagnosis of iNPH is crucial, probably even more so than in some other neurodegenerative disorders, as the progression of many of the iNPH symptoms can be slowed down or even reversed by timely shunt-placement surgery. Several studies also demonstrated that a shorter duration between symptom onset and shunt surgery yields a better response to shunt placement and general outcomes, and that shunt placement is a cost-effective treatment method.

However, the clinical features of iNPH are grossly non-specific, as individual components of Hakim's triad are ubiquitous in the elderly population and often coincide without an underlying iNPH. iNPH is associated with certain imaging findings, and a scoring system has been developed (iNPH Radscale), which seems to differentiate well between shunt-responsive iNPH patients and asymptomatic controls. However, the discriminatory power between shunt responders and symptomatic non-responders is relatively low.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus — an overview of pathophysiological mechanisms and diagnostic procedures [^1132mdMT]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an important differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly as the prevalence of dementia is increasing in line with the global rise in life expectancy. NPH can be categorized into idiopathic (iNPH) and secondary (sNPH), which is significant in terms of clinical symptoms, future progression, and potential treatment outcomes. The complete clinical triad is not present in all cases, and the pathophysiology of iNPH remains unclear. Diagnosis is based on evaluating clinical symptoms, specifically Hakim's triad, combined with MRI assessments and the evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamic parameters through various methods such as tap tests, lumbar infusion tests (LIT), and external lumbar drainage (ELD).

Despite advancements in diagnostic techniques and management strategies, NPH continues to pose challenges for specialists, even after more than 50 years of research. Nonetheless, these studies have unveiled new opportunities in diagnosis, therapy, and have enhanced the quality of life and survival time for NPH patients with improved symptoms. This article aims to present the pathophysiological hypotheses of NPH and provide an overview of the diagnostic techniques used for evaluating patients with NPH.

### Estimated incidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus and shunt outcome in patients residing in assisted-living and extended-care facilities [^115VErPj]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), both diagnosed and undiagnosed, among residents of assisted-living and extended-care facilities by using a practical screening tool. A secondary objective was to prospectively evaluate the diagnosis and outcome of surgical treatment in a subset of patients residing in healthcare facilities who were at risk for idiopathic NPH.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart analysis was performed using the medical records from four nursing homes. The final analysis included 147 patient records. Symptomatology and comorbidity were evaluated, as was the ability to perform activities of daily living. In a subset of 17 patients residing in healthcare facilities, the authors applied a standard idiopathic NPH diagnostic and management protocol and followed up the patients 1 year after treatment. The estimated incidence of suspected idiopathic NPH among all patients in the retrospective survey ranged from 9 to 14%, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. Among the cohort of 17 patients available for an in-hospital study and 1-year follow-up, 11 received shunts and seven of these showed either transient or sustained improvement.

- **Conclusions**: A valid and practical diagnostic method is needed to accurately identify idiopathic NPH before admitting patients to a healthcare facility. Data from a prospective study of 17 patients residing in healthcare facilities indicated that supplementary tests remain predictive of a positive response to shunt insertion but cannot predict with certainty the long-term outcomes.

### An immune response characterizes early Alzheimer's disease pathology and subjective cognitive impairment in hydrocephalus biopsies [^113TXhEE]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

NPH was originally defined by ventricular dilation with normal CSF pressure, featuring a classical clinical triad of imbalance/ataxia, cognitive impairment — particularly short-term memory decline — and urinary incontinence. The usefulness of the concept of NPH has been more recently challenged. This is due to the symptoms in this clinical triad being common in the elderly population at large, the possibility that not all three symptoms actually occur in all patients diagnosed with NPH, and the fact that CSF pressure in NPH patients can be variably elevated, suggesting a chronic deficit in CSF resorption.

Not surprisingly, NPH may sometimes arise secondarily to known medical conditions that affect CSF resorption, leading to the concept of secondary NPH, which is distinguished from iNPH. Patients suspected of having NPH can be clinically stratified into probable NPH vs. possible NPH, depending on how well the patient's symptoms match the appropriate clinical picture and whether any comorbidities may also account for the patient's clinical and imaging findings.

We performed RNA-seq on 106 biopsies from NPH patients, 90 of which fell within the definition of probable or possible iNPH, according to the criteria of Relkin et al. Sixteen biopsies came from patients with a known benign lesion near the cerebral aqueduct that may have contributed to the patient's chronic hydrocephalus, which would qualify as secondary NPH. Our cohort of 106 samples has an average age of 74.9 years (standard deviation 8), with 42 females and 64 males. In all cases, patients were shunted for treatment.

### Genetic risk factors in normal pressure hydrocephalus: What we know and what is next [^116YVr2e]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Of the 56 articles included in the review, 12 were categorized under "familial aggregation", which includes reports of familial cases and a higher incidence of triad symptoms among NPH relatives. Although NPH has traditionally been classified into primary and secondary forms, these findings support the hypothesis that NPH may result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, rather than fitting neatly into distinct categories. This introduces a nondichotomous model of etiology, similar to other neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, where genetic influences span a spectrum from predominantly genetic to largely environmental. In this context, genetic factors may also play a role in secondary NPH, albeit possibly to a lesser extent, explaining why not all patients develop secondary forms after intracranial insults.

This review identified that 10% (2/20) of NPH probands in a predominantly White non‐Hispanic cohort had a first‐degree relative with two or more NPH symptoms. Among relatives of NPH probands, 7.1% (10/140) had two or more symptoms, compared with 0.7% (1/151) of control relatives (odds ratio [OR], 11.53). NPH relatives showed symptoms at a younger age. In a Finnish NPH population, 16% (60/375) of probands had affected relatives, most of whom were first degree, with 4.8% undergoing shunt surgery. No age of symptoms onset or control data were reported.

In addition, at least 32 families with two or more individuals affected by NPH have been documented.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: A systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^115zFv6C]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Low credibility.

In the same year, Chankaew et al. reported a cohort of NPH patients undergoing both LPS and VPS, noting comparable improvements in the classical clinical triad across both groups. Moreover, this study highlighted a high prevalence of swallowing and speech problems in these patients, demonstrating significant improvements after shunt surgery in both groups. Importantly, this study found correlations between bulbar dysfunction and classical NPH symptoms, suggesting that the former should also be considered a core symptom in the diagnosis and management of NPH.

Additionally, Kanno et al. (2017) observed in DTI imaging improvements in fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the corona radiata, suggesting recovery of white matter integrity and a reduction of ventricular-dilation-induced stress in shunt-responsive patients. On the other hand, non-responsive patients did not exhibit significant FA changes. They also observed that changes in FA and mean diffusivity (MD) were more evident in VPS patients, reflecting its higher association with potential cerebral recovery. All in all, however, this study showed a global clinical improvement in both LPS and VPS patients, measured as enhancements in iNPH grading and reduction in ventricular size.

Nakajima et al, in 2018, also supported these findings, reporting an improvement in the mRS scale of 63% for LPS and 69% for VPS patients at one-year follow-up. An additional analysis showed similar improvements in gait, cognition, and urinary function between the two groups, although the frequency of shunt revisions was higher in the LPS group (7% vs .).

### Genetic risk factors in normal pressure hydrocephalus: What we know and what is next [^1114Df1Z]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), first described in 1965, is characterized by gait instability, cognitive decline, and impaired bladder control, collectively known as the Hakim triad. It is currently divided into primary NPH, with no identifiable cause, and secondary NPH, linked to previous intracranial insults.

The diagnosis of primary NPH is guided by two major criteria sets. The Japanese guideline categorizes NPH as possible, probable, and definite, whereas the International guideline classifies it as unlikely, possible, and probable. "Unlikely NPH" refers to cases where symptoms are better explained by other causes. For "possible NPH", the Japanese guideline requires at least two symptoms from the triad, excluding atypical or secondary features, whereas the International guideline requires at least one symptom, which may be accompanied by atypical features. For "probable NPH", both guidelines require at least two symptoms (particularly gait disturbance), normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, and specific neuroimaging features (or symptom improvement following a CSF drainage test in the Japanese guideline). "Definite NPH" refers to individuals who improve after shunt surgery.

The prevalence of NPH increases with age, ranging from 0.003% in individuals aged 50–59 years to 5.9% in those aged 80 years and older. Martín‐Láez et al. suggested that 60 years could be considered the threshold for a population "at risk for NPH", given its prevalence is 15-fold higher in the seventh decade of life compared with the sixth. Although familial NPH has been underexplored, 4.8%.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus and cognitive impairment: The gait phenotype matters too [^1134QkEW]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The study addresses idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a chronic neurological disease that leads to progressive gait and cognitive disorders. It investigates whether the gait phenotype is associated with the severity of cognitive deficits in iNPH patients.

This retrospective study involved 88 patients with a mean age of 76.18 years, of whom 42% were female. Initially referred for suspicion of iNPH, these patients underwent a comprehensive analysis, including assessments of gait and cognitive function.

- **Results**:
	- In this cohort, 27% had normal gait, 25% exhibited frontal gait, 16% had parkinsonian gait, and 27% displayed other gait abnormalities.
	- Patients with parkinsonian and frontal gait had the lowest Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and the slowest gait speeds.
	- Those with a normal gait demonstrated the highest MMSE scores and fastest gait speeds.

Frontal gait was associated with a lower MMSE score, even after adjusting for variables such as age, gender, comorbidities, white matter lesions, and education level (β = −0.221 [95% confidence interval (CI) = −3.718 to −0.150], p = 0.034). Normal gait was linked to the best MMSE scores, with adjustments for the same variables (β = 0.231 [95% CI = 0.124–3.639], p = 0.036).

Conclusions of the study suggest that gait phenotypes among iNPH patients are connected to global cognition, as assessed using the MMSE.

### Volumetric measurements in the detection of reduced ventricular volume in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus whose clinical condition improved after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement [^114NkeLC]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

The syndrome of normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) refers to the clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence in association with idiopathic ventriculomegaly and normal intracranial pressure. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement often yields significant clinical improvements, sometimes without apparent reduction of ventricular size. The authors hypothesized that careful volumetric measurements would show a decrease in ventricular volume in these patients.

- **Methods**: Twenty consecutive patients with NPH underwent placement of VP shunts equipped with programmable valves. In 11 patients, pre- and postoperative neuroimaging was performed, allowing for volumetric analysis. Volumetric measurements of the lateral ventricles were calculated in triplicate by National Institutes of Health image-processing software to assess standard computerized tomography (CT) scans (eight patients) or magnetic resonance (MR) images (three patients) obtained before and after shunt placement. Ventricular volumes were also assessed by an independent neuroradiologist. Postoperative studies were performed at a time of clinical improvement, between 1 and 9 months postsurgery (mean 5 months). Preoperative and postoperative Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale evaluations were performed in four patients. Significant clinical improvement occurred in all patients after shunt placement (mean follow-up period 17.5 months). Although 10 (91%) of 11 patients demonstrated a calculable decrease in volume in the lateral ventricles (mean decrease 39%), formal interpretation

### Development of guidelines for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: Introduction [^115twAiw]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to address the lack of currently accepted evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients. As a result, an independent study group was assembled to determine the feasibility of developing standardized guidelines that would be acceptable in the United States and abroad. These guidelines were to be based on the available scientific evidence and encompass the value of clinical presentation, supplementary diagnostic tests, surgical management, and outcome assessment.

- **Methods**: Initially, a series of 10 questions were formulated in the areas of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment to obtain a consensus from panels of experts (see Acknowledgments) assembled in San Antonio, TX, in September 2000. This workshop provided significant insight into the difficulties in developing NPH guidelines, and a consensus was reached on questions involving expert opinion. Subsequently, evidentiary tables were developed based on the available evidence, including only those studies with 20 or more idiopathic NPH (INPH) patients.

- **Results**: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for INPH diagnostic criteria were assessed, and guidelines were developed based on the available evidence. Recommendations for the classification of INPH and additional studies were documented.

- **Conclusion**: The development of the guidelines was challenging due to the limited number of systematic studies on INPH and the small patient numbers. It was decided to maintain the classification of NPH.

### Diagnostic importance of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus and callosal angle measurements in the context of normal pressure hydrocephalus: A useful tool for clinicians [^111FUPAi]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Low credibility.

Hydrocephalus is a clinical and neurologic condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Currently, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is recognized as a late-onset neurologic disorder defined by a clinical triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia. Imaging studies often reveal a disproportionate increase in subarachnoid space and ventricular size relative to brain volume, with normal CSF pressure during lumbar puncture.

Recent developments in neuroimaging have led to the establishment of criteria for diagnosing and managing iNPH, incorporating the concept of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH). Distinguishing iNPH from the natural neurological aging process and other forms of dementia, wherein brain atrophy and hydrocephalus ex vacuo can be observed, can present challenges for both neurologists and neuroradiologists. Despite DESH becoming a radiologic criterion for diagnosing iNPH in some guidelines, its recognition remains limited.

### Assessment of the urodynamic diagnosis in patients with urinary incontinence associated with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111P1sZd]. Neurourology and urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the urodynamic patterns present in patients with adult normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in our institution, a study was retrospectively conducted on patients diagnosed with NPH by the Neurosurgery Department of our institution. These patients, who had neither etiological treatment nor urogynecological disorders, underwent a urodynamic study (UDS) performed according to methods proposed by the International Society of Continence (ICS). Clinical information, complementary tests, and UDS were collected, and a descriptive analysis was performed with a special focus on the urodynamic final diagnosis.

Eighty-one UDS were performed between 2003 and 2013. Fifty-one patients were male (63%) with a mean age of 74.89 ± 8.58 years (range 52–88 years). The classical triad of symptoms — gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence (UI) — was present in 48.1% of these patients. Urinary urgency was noted in 80.9% and UI in 70%. In two cases (2.5%), UDS was not valuable. Urodynamic features of the 79 remaining studies revealed overactive detrusor (OD) in 56 patients (70.9%), with an association with stress UI (SUI) in one case and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in 19 cases. SUI was observed in six patients (7.6%) and BOO in five (6.3%). There was detrusor underactivity in four cases (5%) and a normal study in eight (10.1%). About 47.1% of males presented BOO. Cerebrospinal fluid shunt surgery was performed on 32 patients during follow-up, with subsequent clinical improvement observed in 90.6% of them.

OD was the most frequent diagnosis within UDS conducted on adult NPH patients in our institution, with BOO present in an elevated percentage of them.

### Role of neuroimaging in multidisciplinary approach towards non-Alzheimer's dementia [^112eiibj]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) represents ventricular dilatation and a clinical triad of cognitive decline, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure. Management of this condition is challenging due to diagnostic uncertainty and requires careful patient selection for CSF shunting. The etiology remains debatable, explained by two existing theories: impaired CSF absorption due to prior meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and decreased white matter tensile strength due to ischemic changes.

Imaging plays a minor role, and MRI findings that may suggest NPH include:

- **Disproportionate ventricular dilatation**: In comparison to sulcal prominence.
- **Periventricular halo**: Suggesting transependymal CSF flow.
- **Prominent CSF flow void at the aqueduct of Sylvius**: Attributable to excessive rapidly pulsatile CSF flow.
Ballooning of the corpus callosum is another imaging feature. MRI cine flow velocity mapping measures the aqueductal CSF flow velocity and stroke volume, which are used at some centers to predict the response to shunt surgery.

### The splenial angle: A novel radiological index for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^115kwUkm]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is characterized by the classic triad of gait apraxia, dementia, and urinary incontinence, but confounding factors commonly exist. Neuroimaging provides supplementary information to the comprehensive clinical assessment of NPH. Ventriculomegaly in the absence of obstructive hydrocephalus or raised intracranial pressure is typical. Specifically, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus, characterized by ventriculomegaly with sulcal crowding near the vertex and enlargement of the Sylvian fissures, is well described.

Evans' index (EI), a quantitative radiological index included in the international and Japanese guidelines for the diagnosis and management of NPH, is a well-accepted gross measure of ventriculomegaly. However, it is non-specific, performs poorly at distinguishing between differing causes of ventriculomegaly, and is an unreliable predictor for shunt responsiveness.

The callosal angle (CA) is more specific and useful in discriminating NPH from other neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinico-radiological presentations of ventriculomegaly from brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, and/or Parkinsonism gait disorder. A narrow CA in NPH is believed to result from mechanical stretching of the corpus callosum by enlarged lateral ventricles and compression by enlarged Sylvian fissures. A small CA is also associated with better shunt responses. Yet, given its advantages, the CA measurement is limited by its notable variability in practice.

### Deficient visuomotor hand coordination in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^114i8Sy9]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

NPH is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, and communicating hydrocephalus, as evident from CT or MRI. Its manifestation has recently been shown by dynamic MRI scanning of an intrathecally administered contrast agent to result from impaired resorption of the cerebrospinal fluid by the glymphatic system. This disturbance has been hypothesized to also cause intermittent peaks of intracranial pressure that result in periventricular fluid effusion and subsequent degeneration of descending fiber tracts in hemispheric white matter.

In this prospective study, we used neuroimaging data and validated quantitative measures of cognitive and gait functions to identify patients with NPH from a group of 47 patients admitted for diagnostic work-up of suspected NPH. We found that there were patients with definite NPH, with possible NPH, and patients with neurological abnormalities not compatible with NPH. This accords with the well-known heterogeneity of the clinical presentation of patients assumed to have NPH. In addition, we determined arm function in these patients through quantitative kinematic measures. We found that gait disturbance was associated with compromised control of arm movements. Using rotation movements of the hand, we found that in patients with definite NPH, the visuomotor control of intermittent movements was severely impaired such that most patients failed at higher levels of difficulty. Although the spinal tap improved this performance slightly for all patients' right hands, th…

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus and cognitive impairment: The gait phenotype matters too [^113duDTk]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a chronic neurological disease resulting in progressive gait and cognitive disorders. We investigated whether the gait phenotype is associated with the severity of cognitive deficits in iNPH.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study recruited 88 patients (mean age = 76.18 ± 7.21 years, 42% female). Patients were initially referred for suspicion of iNPH and underwent a comprehensive analysis, including gait analysis and cognitive evaluation.

- **Results**: In this cohort (27% normal gait, 25% frontal gait, 16% parkinsonian gait, 27% other gait abnormalities), patients with parkinsonian and frontal gait had the lowest Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and the slowest gait speed. Patients with normal gait had the highest MMSE scores and gait speed. Frontal gait was associated with lower MMSE scores, even after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, white matter lesions, and education level (β = -0.221 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.718 to -0.150], p = 0.034). Normal gait was associated with the best MMSE scores, even after adjusting for the abovementioned variables (β = 0.231 [95% CI = 0.124–3.639], p = 0.036).

- **Conclusions**: Gait phenotypes among iNPH patients are linked to global cognition as assessed with MMSE.

### Beyond early motor response: Longitudinal cognitive and gait assessments after extended lumbar drainage in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^115Nk771]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is the most common form of adult hydrocephalus, characterized by cognitive deficits, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence, known as Hakim's triad. Motor impairment is usually the first sign to appear, featuring equilibrium and gait disturbances. The locomotion pattern is characterized by low gait velocity, due to diminished stride length, diminished foot-to-floor clearance during swing phase, and typical disruption of dynamic equilibrium, leading to a broad-based gait and outward rotation of the feet. Regarding cognitive impairment, defined as a subcortical cognitive decline due to the involvement of specific brain components, deficits are extensive and involve attention, executive functions, memory, verbal fluency, working memory, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial functions.

As iNPH is a potentially reversible condition, diagnostic accuracy is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, up to the time of writing, the gold standard for the diagnosis of iNPH is shunt response, which also serves as the treatment. According to the literature, the response to shunt surgery varies between case series from 29% to 90%: this disparity in reported results reflects the difficulty in selecting suitable patients for shunt surgery, as many pathologies mimic the symptoms of iNPH. Existing iNPH guidelines, such as the latest Japanese iNPH guidelines, present several tests to diagnose iNPH and quantify disability, for example, the tap test (TT), infusion test (IT), and extended lumbar drainage.

### Parkinsonian symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a population-based study [^115kdBRC]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

In this study, parkinsonian motor symptoms, except resting tremor, were frequent among individuals with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and correlated with the severity of NPH symptoms. Asymmetric distribution was rare. We recommend a liberal use of neuroradiological imaging when investigating a patient with parkinsonian features, particularly when the symptoms do not respond to dopaminergic treatment.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116yPdfy]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

In this study, we made a substantial effort to identify clinical variables of predictive value. Our research included well over 100 patients, was prospective and consecutive in nature, and involved the registration of around 30 different symptoms and signs, as well as comorbidities and BMI. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the largest of its kind addressing this question so far.

It has been a major challenge for previous research to predict outcomes after shunt treatment in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and to identify the approximate 20% of patients not improved by shunt surgery. Available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamic or drainage tests show low negative predictive values, and the use of CSF and MRI biomarkers has not improved the identification of non-responders. Therefore, better predictive markers are highly warranted. Since the diagnosis of iNPH is based on the recognition of the typical clinical syndrome in combination with radiological markers, the use of symptoms and signs for prediction is both practical and appealing.

In our sample of diagnosed and operated iNPH patients, none of the preoperative clinical tests could distinguish between patients who later benefited from shunt surgery and those who did not. Comparisons of clinical baseline data between improved and non-improved patients revealed no preoperative differences. The odds ratios for improvement were non-significant for all these baseline variables. Only the anamnestic information of memory impairment being the dominating subjective complaint was found to have a predictive value, with a lower improvement rate of 44% in that group.

### Magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers distinguish normal pressure hydrocephalus from progressive supranuclear palsy [^115WbBP8]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) share several clinical and radiological features, making differential diagnosis challenging at times. The objective of this study was to differentiate idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus from PSP using MR volumetric and linear measurements.

- **Methods**: Twenty-seven idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients, 103 probable PSP patients, and 43 control subjects were consecutively enrolled. Automated ventricular volumetry was performed using Freesurfer 6 on MR T1-weighted images. Linear measurements, such as the callosal angle and a new measure, termed Magnetic Resonance Hydrocephalic Index, were calculated on MR T1-weighted images. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to differentiate between patient groups. Generalizability and reproducibility of the results were validated by dividing each participant group into two cohorts, used as training and testing subsets.

- **Results**: Ventricular volumes and linear measurements (callosal angle and Magnetic Resonance Hydrocephalic Index) revealed greater ventricular enlargement in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus than in PSP patients and controls. PSP patients had a larger ventricular volume than controls. Automated ventricular volumetry and Magnetic Resonance Hydrocephalic Index were the most accurate measures (98.5%) for differentiating patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus from PSP patients, whereas the callosal angle misclassified several PSP patients and showed a low positive predictive value (70.0%) in differentiating between these two diseases.

### Natural history of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^115yMdru]. Neurosurgical Review (2011). Low credibility.

The natural history of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is not clear. We performed a literature search for studies that looked into the outcome of unshunted INPH patients, trying to answer the following questions: Do all INPH patients deteriorate without a shunt? If yes, at what rate? Do some NPH patients improve without a shunt? If yes, to what extent?

Six studies objectively described the outcome of 102 INPH patients. Results show that without surgery, most INPH patients had measurable deterioration as early as three months following the initial assessment. A small number of patients might improve without a shunt; however, the extent of improvement is not clear. The homogeneity of the findings of the cohort studies provided high evidence supporting the role of shunt surgery in INPH patients.

### The diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116Zmnjo]. Nature Clinical Practice. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is a syndrome characterized by gait impairment, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence, associated with ventriculomegaly in the absence of elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. There is significant variation in the clinical presentation and progression of this disorder, and its diagnosis often poses a challenge for neurologists and neurosurgeons.

Various supplemental tests, including the CSF tap test, external CSF drainage via spinal catheter, and CSF outflow resistance determination, can improve the accuracy of predicting a response to surgical treatment. CSF shunting provides significant symptom improvement in the majority of appropriately evaluated patients.

In 2005, an international study group published evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of INPH. This review will highlight the clinical presentation, radiographic findings, supplemental prognostic tests, differential diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcomes of INPH.

### Standardized image evaluation in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: Consistency and reproducibility [^1124AGdQ]. Neuroradiology (2019). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a progressive neurological syndrome characterized by impairments in gait, balance, cognition, and urinary bladder control. The diagnosis of iNPH is based on the presence of symptoms and ventriculomegaly, as well as related imaging findings. The etiology is unclear, but cerebrospinal fluid dynamics are disturbed, leading to the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.

There are several imaging features typical of iNPH, such as widening of the temporal horns, a small callosal angle, periventricular white matter changes, narrowing of the parafalcine sulci over the vertex, focally enlarged sulci, and widening of the Sylvian fissures. The iNPH Radscale is a radiological scale that summarizes these imaging features into a structured score. We have previously shown that the iNPH Radscale score correlates with iNPH symptoms in an unselected population.

According to two guidelines, computed tomography (CT) can be used in the diagnostics of iNPH, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred due to its superior soft tissue contrast, lack of ionizing radiation, and ability to discriminate between iNPH and obstructive hydrocephalus. However, patients with iNPH symptoms commonly undergo a CT scan of the brain first due to fall accidents or referrals from physicians in general healthcare. Since the condition can be effectively treated by shunt surgery, especially in the early stages of the disease, it is important that the radiological picture of iNPH is recognized on CT.
