## Question

Elevated triglyceride management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a stepwise approach to managing elevated triglycerides, including thresholds, secondary causes, and a prioritized pharmacotherapy algorithm that distinguishes ASCVD risk reduction from pancreatitis prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hypertriglyceridemia is defined and why specific cut points matter. Then, I should verify secondary causes and the impact of lifestyle interventions. Next, I will determine whether the primary goal is ASCVD risk reduction or pancreatitis prevention based on the triglyceride level. After that, I will outline first-line and add-on drug therapies, including statins, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, and omega-3s, and when to combine them. Finally, I will set monitoring intervals, safety checks, and address special situations and emerging options [^1154fSJQ] [^113Ef1s8].

> Let me first confirm the clinically meaningful thresholds because everything downstream depends on these definitions. Normal triglycerides are typically < 150 mg/dL, mild-to-moderate elevations span 150–499 mg/dL, severe begins at ≥ 500 mg/dL, and pancreatitis risk rises sharply at ≥ 1,000 mg/dL; these cut points anchor ASCVD and pancreatitis risk assessment and match major guidance and epidemiology showing risk increases even at modest elevations, especially in younger patients [^1154fSJQ] [^114CWiLv] [^111dAAoS].

> Wait, let me verify secondary drivers before I jump to prescriptions, because correcting these can substantially lower triglycerides and sometimes obviate additional drugs. I need to check for uncontrolled diabetes, obesity and insulin resistance, high refined carbohydrate or saturated fat intake, alcohol excess, hypothyroidism, renal disease, and medications like corticosteroids, estrogens, or retinoids; in parallel, I should emphasize diet quality, caloric balance with weight loss if overweight, regular aerobic activity, smoking cessation, and in severe hypertriglyceridemia a very-low-fat diet and alcohol abstinence, as these are foundational steps across guidelines [^116YNxfY] [^113EYkox] [^116TRXB8] [^115yBtXB].

> Hold on, I should clarify the immediate clinical objective because it changes the order of treatments. If triglycerides are < 500 mg/dL, the primary goal is ASCVD risk reduction guided by global risk and LDL/non-HDL targets; if triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL, and particularly ≥ 1,000 mg/dL, the priority is rapid lowering to prevent acute pancreatitis while also addressing ASCVD risk as appropriate, which is explicitly emphasized across US and Endocrine Society guidance [^113Ef1s8] [^112Ks7ep] [^1132spPP].

> Next, I will examine first-line pharmacotherapy for ASCVD risk, and I need to ensure I'm aligning with high-credibility sources. Statins are first-line in high-risk patients with triglycerides > 200 mg/dL or when overall ASCVD risk warrants them, and I should intensify to maximally tolerated therapy if lipids remain suboptimal; beyond LDL lowering, statins reduce triglycerides about 15–30% on average, which helps address the atherogenic remnant burden [^1178237d] [^112Z18YD] [^116JBMw9] [^111r47Xd].

> But wait, what if triglycerides persist in the 135–499 mg/dL range on statins in a high- or very-high-risk patient; I should double-check when to add icosapent ethyl. The ESC/EAS and multiple endocrine guidelines deem it reasonable to add icosapent ethyl 2 g twice daily to reduce events in such patients, a strategy supported by REDUCE-IT demonstrating a 25% relative risk reduction on top of statins, and EPA-only is preferred over EPA+DHA given the potential for DHA to raise LDL-C in very high triglycerides [^1154fSJQ] [^114k3vsS] [^115ZmKCU] [^116byjNg] [^116s6D4i] [^113ND9fZ].

> I should confirm next when fibrates come into play, and which agent is safest to combine with a statin. In high-risk, statin-treated patients who have achieved LDL-C goals but continue to have triglycerides > 200 mg/dL, adding a fibrate can be considered, with fenofibrate or bezafibrate preferred; gemfibrozil should generally be avoided with statins due to interaction risk, and this approach has particular relevance in diabetes or metabolic syndrome phenotypes [^116tmQhL] [^111mmXAd] [^113Wvz4a].

> Now, for severe hypertriglyceridemia at or above 500 mg/dL, I need to ensure I pivot to pancreatitis prevention while still addressing ASCVD risk. Immediate steps include a very-low-fat diet, strict alcohol abstinence, and optimized glycemic control; pharmacologically, fibrates are first-line for pancreatitis prevention, prescription omega-3 fatty acids at 2–4 g/day EPA+DHA or EPA-only are reasonable adjuncts, and statins remain appropriate for ASCVD risk with the understanding that combination therapy is often necessary; guideline nuance notes outcome evidence for mixed EPA+DHA is limited in severe hypertriglyceridemia, which reflects data gaps rather than lack of triglyceride lowering, and plasmapheresis should not be used as first-line in triglyceride-induced pancreatitis [^113Ef1s8] [^117F1Bvi] [^113ND9fZ] [^113xM4k1] [^11687SvN] [^116TRXB8] [^112g2Ubw] [^1135mzbs].

> I should double-check monitoring cadence and safety labs to close the loop. I will recheck a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, assess adherence and secondary causes, and monitor liver enzymes with statins and fibrates, creatine kinase if myalgias occur, serum creatinine with fibrates, and glucose if niacin is used; treatment metrics include achieving triglycerides < 150 mg/dL when feasible or at least < 500 mg/dL to reduce pancreatitis risk, and using non-HDL-C per risk category as a secondary target to capture the remnant apoB burden [^116JBMw9] [^111m77eV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, there are adjuncts and caveats I should not overlook. Niacin is less favored given lack of outcome benefit and side effects, bile acid sequestrants can raise triglycerides so I need to check levels before and after starting them, novel agents like volanesorsen and pemafibrate are options mainly in specialized or refractory settings pending robust outcome data, and I should remember to avoid reflexively using plasmapheresis unless a refractory, life-threatening pancreatitis scenario warrants it in expert hands [^115p6usU] [^111npgmG] [^11518ooc] [^112UoNUm] [^1135mzbs].

> Finally, let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. A practical algorithm is to confirm severity and rule out secondary causes, implement lifestyle therapy for all, use statins first for ASCVD risk, add icosapent ethyl when triglycerides persist at 135–499 mg/dL in high-risk patients on statins, consider fenofibrate add-on if triglycerides remain > 200 mg/dL despite statins and lifestyle, escalate to fibrate-centered regimens plus omega-3s for triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL to prevent pancreatitis, and reassess every 4–12 weeks while managing non-HDL-C; individualized decisions should weigh baseline ASCVD risk, diabetes and metabolic syndrome features, tolerability, and access, consistent with ESC/EAS, AHA/ACC, and endocrine guidance and anchored by REDUCE-IT for EPA-only therapy [^1154fSJQ] [^113Ef1s8] [^115yBtXB] [^115ZmKCU].

---

Elevated triglyceride management centers on **lifestyle first** and **statins for ASCVD risk**. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL), prioritize **pancreatitis prevention** [^114HD488] with a very low-fat diet [^116TRXB8], alcohol avoidance [^1144sQ12], and fibrates [^113Ef1s8] or high-dose omega-3s [^112g2Ubw] if needed. For moderate elevations (150–499 mg/dL), use statins to **reduce cardiovascular risk** [^1178237d], and consider **icosapent ethyl** in high-risk patients [^115ZmKCU] on statins with persistent triglycerides 135–499 mg/dL [^1154fSJQ]. Always address secondary causes [^116YNxfY] and monitor for adverse effects.

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone [^113EYkox] of triglyceride management, with **diet and exercise** as first-line therapy [^115yBtXB].

- **Dietary modifications**: Reduce saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbohydrates [^111AU7b3], and added sugars; increase omega-3 intake; limit alcohol [^113EYkox].
- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes/week [^113EYkox] of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
- **Weight management**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss in overweight/obese patients [^113EYkox].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacotherapy is indicated when lifestyle measures are insufficient [^115yBtXB] or when **triglycerides are severely elevated** [^114HD488].

---

### Statins

Statins are **first-line** for moderate hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) [^1178237d], lowering triglycerides by 15–30% [^1178237d] [^111r47Xd] and significantly reducing ASCVD risk [^1178237d] [^116JBMw9].

---

### Fibrates

Fibrates are indicated for severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) to **prevent pancreatitis** [^113Ef1s8], lowering triglycerides by 30–50% [^113Ef1s8] [^115p6usU]. Cardiovascular benefit is **limited**; their use is primarily for pancreatitis prevention [^113Ef1s8] [^114oHtrv].

---

### Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) are effective for **severe hypertriglyceridemia** [^112g2Ubw], lowering triglycerides by 20–50% [^112g2Ubw] [^113ND9fZ]. Cardiovascular benefit includes **reduced ASCVD events** with icosapent ethyl in high-risk patients [^115ZmKCU] [^1154fSJQ].

---

### Niacin

Niacin lowers triglycerides by 20–30% but is limited by **adverse effects** (flushing, hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) [^1134Ao2b], and its **cardiovascular benefit** has limited evidence; use cautiously [^1131cjfw].

---

## Management by triglyceride level

| **Triglyceride level** | **Management strategy** |
|-|-|
| 150–499 mg/dL | - Lifestyle modifications <br/> - Statins for ASCVD risk [^1178237d] <br/> - Consider icosapent ethyl if high risk [^1154fSJQ] |
| ≥ 500 mg/dL | - Very low-fat diet [^116TRXB8] <br/> - Alcohol avoidance [^116TRXB8] <br/> - Fibrates or omega-3s [^114HD488] [^112g2Ubw] <br/> - Statins if ASCVD risk [^113Ef1s8] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **essential** to assess response and adherence. Obtain **lipid panels** every 3–6 months initially, then annually [^115SUSRL], and reinforce **adherence** to both lifestyle interventions and medications [^113tgunW].

---

## Emerging therapies

Novel agents targeting **triglyceride metabolism** are in development [^111VYb9n], including **ApoC-III inhibitors** such as volanesorsen and olezarsen and **ANGPTL3 inhibitors** such as evinacumab and vupanorsen.

---

## Special considerations

- **Diabetes**: Optimize glycemic control to reduce triglycerides [^116YNxfY].
- **Pancreatitis**: Aggressive triglyceride lowering to < 500 mg/dL [^114HD488].
- **Genetic disorders**: Consider genetic testing and specialized care [^114CWiLv].

---

Elevated triglyceride management emphasizes **lifestyle first**, with pharmacotherapy tailored to triglyceride level and ASCVD risk. Statins are first-line for moderate elevations, while fibrates or omega-3s are used for severe hypertriglyceridemia to prevent pancreatitis [^115yBtXB].

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: Same data but different interpretations [^1144sQ12]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The ESC/EAS Guidelines identify a fasting triglyceride level of ≥ 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) as associated with increased ASCVD risk. Statins are recommended as the initial drug of choice in high-risk individuals with triglycerides > 2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) (class I, B), while exclusion of secondary causes and dietary measures are advised for all such patients. Fibrates may be considered for high-risk, statin-treated patients whose triglycerides remain above this level (class IIb, B), and for statin-treated primary prevention patients with similar degrees of hypertriglyceridemia (class IIb, B). Based on the results of a randomized controlled trial not available at the time of the evidence review for the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline, the ESC/EAS Guidelines indicated that the addition of icosapent ethyl 2 g twice daily is reasonable for high-risk patients with triglyceride levels between 1.5 and 5.6 mmol/L (135–499 mg/dL) despite statin treatment (IIa, B). In addition to triglyceride levels, icosapent ethyl has been shown to reduce non-HDL-C and apoB levels, thus reducing atherogenic particle concentrations.

The ESC/EAS Guidelines recognize that the risk for acute pancreatitis is significantly increased in those with triglycerides > 10 mmol/L (880 mg/dL). As with the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline, it is recommended that dietary factors, including alcohol, should be addressed, and a very-low-fat diet (10%–15% of total calories) should be initiated. Addressing glycemic control for those with diabetes mellitus and initiating fenofibrate and adjunctive therapy with 2 to 4 g daily of om are also advised.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of omega-3 PUFAs (icosapent ethyl 2×2 g/day) for high or very high-risk patients with triglyceride levels of 135–499 mg/dL (1.5–5.6 mmol/L) despite statin treatment.

The 2019 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and other professional associations recommend considering the initiation of fibrates for medical management in adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia to prevent acute pancreatitis. This is particularly advisable for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL (≥ 5.7 mmol/L), and especially when levels reach ≥ 1,000 mg/dL (≥ 11.3 mmol/L). The initiation of fibrates is recommended if triglyceride levels remain persistently elevated or continue to increase after addressing other causative factors of hypertriglyceridemia.

### Demystifying the management of hypertriglyceridaemia [^115p6usU]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridaemia, characterized by triglyceride levels between 1.7–5.0 mmol/l, is caused by interactions between various genetic and non-genetic factors and is a common risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with hypertriglyceridaemia typically present with obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, ectopic fat deposition, and diabetes mellitus. This condition reflects the accumulation in plasma of proatherogenic lipoproteins, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) remnants, and small, dense LDL particles. Mendelian randomization studies and research on inherited dyslipidaemias, such as type III dysbetalipoproteinaemia, indicate that TRLs are causally related to atherosclerotic CVD.

Extreme hypertriglyceridaemia, defined by a triglyceride level > 20 mmol/l, is rare, often monogenic in etiology, and frequently causes pancreatitis. The treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia relies on correcting secondary factors and unhealthy lifestyle habits, particularly poor diet and lack of exercise. Pharmacotherapy is indicated for patients with established CVD or individuals at moderate-to-high risk of CVD, primarily those with metabolic syndrome or diabetes. Statins form the cornerstone of this treatment, followed by fibrates and n-3 fatty acids, to achieve the recommended therapeutic levels of plasma LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100. Although the case for using niacin has been weakened by the results of clinical trials, further investigation is needed.

Extreme hypertriglyceridaemia requires strict dietary measures, and patients with a diagnosis of genetic lipoprotein disorders should receive individualized treatment plans.

### Triglycerides and heart disease: Still a hypothesis [^113PkHGZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the basic and clinical science relating plasma triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. Although many aspects of the basic physiology of triglyceride production, plasma transport, and tissue uptake have been known for several decades, the relationship of plasma triglyceride levels to vascular disease is uncertain. Are triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, their influence on high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein, or the underlying diseases that lead to defects in triglyceride metabolism the culprit?

Animal models have failed to confirm that anything other than early fatty lesions can be produced by triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Metabolic products of triglyceride metabolism can be toxic to arterial cells; however, these studies are primarily in vitro. Correlative studies of fasting and postprandial triglycerides and genetic diseases implicate very-low-density lipoprotein and their remnants, as well as chylomicron remnants, in atherosclerosis development. However, the concomitant alterations in other lipoproteins and other risk factors obscure any conclusions about direct relationships between disease and triglycerides.

Genes that regulate triglyceride levels also correlate with vascular disease. Human intervention trials, however, have lacked an appropriately defined population and have produced outcomes without definitive conclusions. The time is more than ripe for new and creative approaches to understanding the relationship between triglycerides and heart disease.

### Hypertriglyceridaemia and risk of coronary artery disease [^112UoNUm]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

An elevated serum level of LDL cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the role of elevated triglyceride levels is debated. Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia — they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic.

Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis.

Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others. However, CVD outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have produced inconsistent results, meaning that no convincing evidence is available that lowering triglycerides by any approach can reduce mortality.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^115PjfLa]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The existence of an independent association between elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, cardiovascular (CV) risk, and mortality has been largely controversial. The main difficulty in isolating the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on CV risk is the fact that elevated triglyceride levels are commonly associated with concomitant changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and other lipoproteins. As a result of this problem, and in disregard of the real biological role of TG, its significance as a plausible therapeutic target was unfoundedly underestimated for many years.

However, taking epidemiological data together, both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridemia are associated with a substantially increased long-term total mortality and CV risk. Plasma TG levels partially reflect the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (TRL): very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons, and their remnants. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia commonly leads to a reduction in HDL and an increase in atherogenic small dense LDL levels. TG may also stimulate atherogenesis by mechanisms such as excessive free fatty acids (FFA) release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Genetic studies strongly support hypertriglyceridemia and high concentrations of TRL as causal risk factors for CV disease.

The most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to being overweight and a sedentary lifestyle, which in turn lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MS), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

### Triglycerides: A reappraisal [^1131cjfw]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated cholesterol levels are clearly independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Another class of lipid particles, triglycerides, is also abundant in the human body and has been found in atherosclerotic plaques. Recent observational studies have demonstrated an association between elevated triglyceride levels and an increased risk for future cardiovascular events. With this knowledge and the discovery of effective agents to lower triglyceride levels, the management of triglycerides is currently undergoing a renaissance.

Unfortunately, no randomized, controlled clinical trials have been completed at the time of writing, proving that lowering triglycerides will reduce cardiovascular events. In this review, we highlight some of the evidence that led to this stage and discuss the data on pharmacologic intervention of triglyceride levels and the effect on clinical outcomes. Lastly, we want to give the reader insight into what the most recent lipid guidelines state about clinical triglyceride management, mention new pharmacological agents, and highlight the clinical evidence for the safe and effective lowering of triglyceride levels with lifestyle modification.

### Profound reductions in first and total cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl in the REDUCE-IT trial: Why these results usher in a new era in dyslipidaemia therapeutics [^115ZmKCU]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

The aims of this clinical review are to highlight the importance of elevated baseline triglycerides (TG) in the setting of well-controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on statins as a major contributor to residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, particularly among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, whose distinctive lipid phenotype cannot be optimally treated with LDL-C reduction therapy alone. Additionally, it describes the findings and clinical implications of the landmark REDUCE-IT trial in which ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid significantly improved ASCVD outcomes.

While many genetic studies have shown that elevated TG is an independent causal factor for ASCVD, prior placebo-controlled trials using niacin, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and dietary supplement fish oil preparations have failed to demonstrate significant CV event reduction when added to statin therapy. In contrast, the REDUCE-IT trial in 8,179 participants showed convincingly that the administration of 4 g daily of icosapent ethyl (an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid) in patients at high risk for ASCVD with increased levels of baseline TG [median value, 2.44 mmol/L (216.0 mg/dL)] but well-controlled LDL-C [median value, 1.94 mmol/L (75.0 mg/dL)] significantly reduced incident events across both the trial primary endpoint and multiple prespecified secondary endpoints. These included cardiovascular death, as well as both subsequent and total primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint events. Icosapent ethyl unequivocally contributed to ASCVD event reduction.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^116tmQhL]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertriglyceridemia, particularly concerning the use of fibrates, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of fenofibrate or bezafibrate to statins in high-risk patients. This is advised for individuals with triglyceride levels exceeding 2.3 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) who have achieved the LDL-C goal.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^113xM4k1]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, specifically with respect to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the AACE 2025 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL).

---

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^112Z18YD]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend initiating statins as first-line therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride levels > 200 mg/dL or > 2.3 mmol/L).

### Triglycerides, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular outcome studies: Focus on omega-3 fatty acids [^1134Ao2b]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

To provide an overview of the roles of triglycerides and triglyceride-lowering agents in atherosclerosis within the context of cardiovascular outcomes studies, we reviewed published literature as well as ClinicalTrials.gov entries for ongoing studies.

Despite improved atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes with statin therapy, residual risk remains. Epidemiologic data and recent genetic insights provide compelling evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway for the development of atherosclerosis, thereby renewing interest in targeting triglycerides to improve ASCVD outcomes. Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FAs) are three classes of triglyceride-lowering drugs. Outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have been inconsistent.

With regard to OM3FAs, the JELIS study showed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduced major coronary events in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients. Regarding other agents, extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are no longer recommended as statin add-on therapy (by some guidelines, though not all) because of the lack of convincing evidence from outcome studies. Notably, subgroup analyses from the outcome studies have generated the hypothesis that triglyceride lowering may provide benefit in statin-treated patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. Two ongoing OM3FA outcome studies (REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH) are testing this hypothesis in high-risk, statin-treated patients with triglyceride levels of 200 to 500 mg/dL.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111npgmG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

In specific circumstances concerning dyslipidemia, particularly with patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the general principles of the ES 2020 guidelines recommend measuring triglyceride levels before and after starting a bile acid sequestrant in patients with elevated triglycerides (> 150–499 mg/dL; 1.7–5.6 mmol/L).

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides as therapeutic targets for preventing and treating coronary artery disease [^1162fUyi]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic and clinical trials show that elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, adjustment for covariates frequently weakens or abolishes the predictive significance of triglycerides, whereas the evidence for HDL-C is more consistently strong. Data indicate that there is a 2% to 3% decrease in coronary risk for each 1 mg/dL increase in HDL-C, whereas the benefit of triglyceride lowering appears to occur largely in patients with the highest baseline levels.

The 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for detecting and treating high blood cholesterol reflect our improved understanding of triglycerides and HDL as CHD risk factors. However, the guidelines place more emphasis on lowering triglycerides than on raising HDL-C by identifying non-HDL-C (i.e. low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] + very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [VLDL-C]) as a secondary target of therapy. In clinical practice, VLDL-C is the most readily available measure of atherogenic triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins. On the basis of the available epidemiologic and clinical evidence, refinement of the NCEP guidelines to include more emphasis on raising HDL-C levels should be considered. Novel drugs are being developed that have the potential to increase HDL-C concentrations and/or improve the functionality of HDL.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114CWiLv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, email discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

The panel stresses that lifestyle modifications should underpin the management of all patients at increased cardiovascular (CV) risk, especially those with elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL) and/or low plasma levels of HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL). As non-compliance can be a significant issue, addressing its causes and identifying solutions, including improvement in the physician–patient alliance, is essential. Secondary causes of dyslipidaemia, such as poor glycaemic control, obesity, diets high in refined carbohydrates, alcohol excess, lack of exercise, and smoking, must be addressed. Despite adherence to lifestyle interventions, it is likely that many of these patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia will require pharmacotherapy. At least 50% of all high-risk patients on a statin may require optimization of treatment to further lower LDL-C, and about 10–15% may need additional treatment for elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C. In these patients, clinicians may consider adding niacin or a fibrate, while taking into account potential safety issues, as discussed in this paper.

- **Recommended basic lifestyle interventions to lower triglycerides and increase HDL-C**:
	- Stop smoking: All smokers at high cardiovascular risk unable to quit smoking should be referred to specialized smoking cessation clinics.
	- Increase physical activity: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (activity producing a heart rate of 60–75% of age-related maximum heart rate) for at least 5 days per week.
	- Adopt a Mediterranean-type diet characterized by high monounsaturated and…

### Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia: How can clinicians effectively implement them [^113tgunW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines support lowering cholesterol to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across the entire lifespan with intensive lifestyle intervention, as well as statin and non-statin pharmacotherapy for those at highest risk. Modest improvements in the initiation, use, and adherence to statin therapy in patients with ASCVD have occurred over the past decades. However, studies continue to document a less-than-desired implementation of guidelines, highlighting a substantial and persistent treatment gap. The success of implementation depends on the consideration of a variety of barriers that exist throughout the healthcare delivery system. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these barriers in order to develop appropriate and sustainable interventions to improve guideline implementation.

### Triglycerides and cardiovascular disease [^115cHtkE]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

After the introduction of statins, clinical emphasis first focused on LDL cholesterol-lowering, then on the potential for raising HDL cholesterol, with less focus on lowering triglycerides. However, understanding from genetic studies and negative results from randomized trials that low HDL cholesterol might not cause cardiovascular disease as originally thought has generated renewed interest in raised concentrations of triglycerides. This renewed interest has also been driven by epidemiological and genetic evidence supporting raised triglycerides, remnant cholesterol, or triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as an additional cause of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.

Triglycerides can be measured in the non-fasting or fasting states, with concentrations of 2–10 mmol/L conferring an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and concentrations greater than 10 mmol/L conferring an increased risk of acute pancreatitis and possibly cardiovascular disease. Although randomized trials showing cardiovascular benefit of triglyceride reduction are scarce, new triglyceride-lowering drugs are being developed, and large-scale trials have been initiated that will hopefully provide conclusive evidence as to whether lowering triglycerides reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Elevated plasma triglyceride concentration and risk of adverse clinical outcomes in 1.5 million people: A CALIBER linked electronic health record study [^111dAAoS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). High credibility.

Clinically, our findings provide insight into the serious health risks associated with both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridemia, especially in younger patients. Our continuous trait analysis identifies that the risk of adverse outcomes, especially for acute pancreatitis, increases exponentially once triglycerides are just moderately elevated. This finding potentially challenges treatment thresholds while supporting guidelines advocating intervention at lower triglyceride concentrations. Furthermore, our findings support the measurement of triglycerides for cardiovascular risk management, serving as a marker of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs), for which emerging therapies may provide cardiovascular benefits. Finally, unlike many studies on triglycerides, our findings represent "real world" association analyses, with patients who have treated and untreated lipids and various comorbidities. As such, the findings are more generalizable but could also explain why some estimates may differ from more bespoke studies.

In conclusion, we show in over 1.5 million people that moderate and severe triglyceride elevation is associated with the risk of acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP), new onset diabetes, and death, but for myocardial infarction (MI), only moderate hypertriglyceridemia is associated with risk. Of note, these risks are continuous and start at modest elevations of triglyceride concentrations, being higher in younger people. Drugs may have a limited impact on reducing these risks from severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia. We anticipate these findings will support clinical interpretation of triglyceride concentrations and decisions for investig.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: Evidence and guidance for management [^111mvxjf]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In summary, statins firmly remain the first line treatment of choice for attainment of LDL-C goal in patients at high risk of CVD. After LDL-C goal attainment, however, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL, as defined by recent European guidelines) and HDL-C is low (< 1.0 mmol/L), further intervention is warranted.

- **Intensive lifestyle intervention**: If triglyceride levels remain elevated (≥ 1.7 mmol/L, as recommended by the most recent European guidelines) and/or HDL-C is low (< 1.0 mmol/L), even after intensive lifestyle intervention and ensuring compliance with pharmacotherapy and addressing secondary causes of dyslipidaemia, additional lipid-modifying therapy may be considered.

- **Combination therapy considerations**: Based on clinical outcome data and safety considerations for combination statin–fibrate therapy, fenofibrate is the preferred fibrate. This therapy may have particular value in patients with T2DM and mild-to-moderate retinopathy. Greater LDL-C lowering may be achieved by the addition of ezetimibe to a statin. Ezetimibe has a dose-sparing advantage in patients intolerant of higher doses of statins.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112Bav1w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Beyond LDL-C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk-enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10-year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL-C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid-related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk-enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

### Effective, disease-modifying, clinical approaches to patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia [^111LRX1A]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Plasma triglyceride concentration is easily, inexpensively, and accurately measured, and when elevated, it is a highly informative disease marker that identifies individuals who frequently have a host of underlying metabolic, inflammatory, and atherogenic risk factors. Although this concept aligns with much that has been discussed regarding the metabolic syndrome, individuals identified with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia on a screening lipid profile are not necessarily recognized as having features of the metabolic syndrome and frequently do not receive definitive, meaningful, disease-modifying therapy.

This treatment includes:

- **Lifestyle modification** and LDL-lowering therapies to aggressively treat elevated apolipoprotein B-containing particles.
- **Antihypertensive therapies**: that have optimal therapeutic profiles for those individuals with metabolic syndrome.
- **Icosapent ethyl**: for those individuals at high risk, particularly patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who have residual hypertriglyceridaemia despite treatment with appropriate LDL-lowering therapies.
- **Preferential use of cardiovascular protective diabetes therapies**: in individuals with diabetes.
- **Antithrombotic therapies**: for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the context of high vascular disease risk and diabetes.

Several emerging therapies, such as novel weight-reducing, anti-inflammatory, lipid-modifying therapies, and therapies targeting the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, could also soon enter the clinical arena.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^115SUSRL]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In most adult patients, a fasting lipid profile should be measured at least annually. For adults with low-risk lipid values, such as an LDL cholesterol level below 100 mg/dL and triglycerides less than 150 mg/dL, less frequent monitoring may be considered. However, more frequent assessments are recommended in individuals with elevated LDL cholesterol levels above 100 mg/dL, triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL, or those with multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors.

In individuals without overt cardiovascular disease (CVD), the primary goal is to maintain an LDL cholesterol level below 100 mg/dL. For patients considered at higher risk, such as those with existing CVD, a more stringent target of an LDL cholesterol level below 70 mg/dL may be appropriate. For men, HDL cholesterol levels should be maintained above 40 mg/dL.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: Common questions and answers [^111AU7b3]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Less common risk factors include excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders.

Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL) starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can lower triglyceride levels, as well as improve body composition and exercise capacity. Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is pertinent to determine the role of medications.

Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality. Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^115nv12S]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

- **Dyslipidemia/lipid management screening**: In most adult patients, measure fasting lipid profile at least annually. In adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol 50 mg/dl, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dl), lipid assessments may be repeated every 2 years.

- **Treatment recommendations and goals**: Lifestyle modification focusing on the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; increase of n-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber, and plant stanols/sterols; weight loss (if indicated); and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes. Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy, regardless of baseline lipid levels, for diabetic patients with overt CVD. Statin therapy is also recommended for patients without CVD who are over the age of 40 years and have one or more other CVD risk factors. For lower-risk patients (e.g. without overt CVD and under the age of 40 years), statin therapy should be considered in addition to lifestyle therapy if LDL cholesterol remains above 100 mg/dl or in those with multiple CVD risk factors. In individuals without overt CVD, the primary goal is an LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). In individuals with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), using a high dose of a statin, is an option. If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of approximately 30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. Triglycerides levels should be < 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l).

Regarding the medical management of hypertriglyceridemia, and more specifically in relation to PUFAs, the AACE 2025 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of eicosapentaenoic acid (icosapent ethyl) in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL).

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^114UZWpx]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The EAS Consensus Panel believes that the adoption of these recommendations for the clinical management of elevated triglycerides, a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low concentrations of HDL-C, supported by an appraisal of the evidence, will facilitate a reduction in the substantial cardiovascular risk that persists in high-risk patients at LDL-C goal, especially those with cardiometabolic abnormalities.

- **Key messages**:
	- High-risk individuals, especially those with cardiometabolic disease, who achieve LDL-C goals remain at high risk of cardiovascular events.
	- Appraisal of the evidence base implicates elevated triglycerides, a marker of TRL and their remnants, and low levels of HDL-C in this excess cardiovascular risk.
	- In clinical intervention studies using surrogate outcome measures, the addition of niacin to statin therapy reduced atherosclerosis progression in high-risk patients with low LDL-C and elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C. Subgroup analyses also showed an additional reduction in cardiovascular events with fibrate therapy, either alone or in combination with a statin, in patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia.
	- Consistent with European guidelines, elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL) and/or low HDL-C levels (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) should trigger consideration of further treatment in high-risk individuals.
	- Lifestyle intervention and addressing compliance and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia constitute the first step in management.
	- Adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering, are suggested options for the correction of atherogenic dyslipidaemia.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in adult patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dL; > 1.7 mmol/L) who are on statins and have either atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes plus two additional risk factors.

### Elevated plasma triglyceride concentration and risk of adverse clinical outcomes in 1.5 million people: A CALIBER linked electronic health record study [^113UjUZ5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

Of particular interest is the association between triglycerides and myocardial infarction (MI). Observational studies have repeatedly demonstrated that mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia is associated with a higher risk of MI, but when adjusted for non-HDL cholesterol, the risk is usually attenuated.

These findings are consistent with the idea that cardiovascular risk associated with hypertriglyceridemia is mediated by atherogenic apoB-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs) and remnants, captured by non-HDL, and not the triglycerides per se. Our findings extend prior work by including the full range of triglyceride concentrations, including severe hypertriglyceridemia, and provide similar results.

The lack of association with severe hypertriglyceridemia is likely explained by the greater dominance of large triglyceride-containing lipoprotein particles (mainly chylomicrons and large VLDLs) at these levels, which are too large to enter the intima and thus less atherogenic than smaller lipoprotein particles. In contrast, more moderate hypertriglyceridemia may be a marker for a greater burden of smaller atherogenic TGRLs.

Of note, patients aged ≤ 40 years with moderate hypertriglyceridemia had the highest risk for MI, potentially due to additional contributions from inherited mixed dyslipidemias, such as familial combined hyperlipidemia, and more atherogenic lipoproteins conferring atherosclerotic risk.

Of course, MI risk could also be explained by the co-presence of other metabolic disturbances, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity, themselves contributing to triglyceride concentrations in this range.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: A science advisory from the American Heart Association [^113ND9fZ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus.

In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia.

The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents.

- **Effects and considerations**: In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30%, with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides.

- **Comparative effectiveness**: When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin.

### Lipids and CVD management: Towards a global consensus [^117JEJqa]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its incidence is likely to increase. Multiple risk factors contribute to CVD. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80–90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce CVD incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24–37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%.

The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for the management of CVD. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved. It also highlights areas where the guidelines differ and discusses points to consider when selecting the most appropriate recommendation.

### Triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the causal pathway of cardiovascular disease [^112N7BMK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic and clinical studies suggest that elevated triglyceride levels are a biomarker of cardiovascular (CV) risk. Consistent with these findings, recent genetic evidence from mutational analyses, genome-wide association studies, and Mendelian randomization studies provides robust evidence that triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are in the causal pathway for atherosclerotic CV disease, indicating that they may play a pathogenic role, much like low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

Although statins are the cornerstone of dyslipidemia management, high triglyceride levels may persist in some patients despite statin therapy. Several triglyceride-lowering agents are available, including fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, of which prescription omega-3 fatty acids have the best tolerability and safety profile. In clinical studies, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels, but products containing both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid may increase LDL-C levels. Icosapent ethyl, a high-purity eicosapentaenoic acid-only product, does not raise LDL-C levels and also reduces triglyceride, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels.

In conclusion, omega-3 fatty acids are currently being evaluated in large CV outcome studies in statin-treated patients; these studies should help to elucidate the causative role of triglycerides in atherosclerotic CV disease.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: A too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^1117EUvd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The existence of an independent association between elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, cardiovascular (CV) risk, and mortality has been largely controversial. The main difficulty in isolating the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on CV risk is that elevated triglyceride levels are commonly associated with concomitant changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and other lipoproteins. As a result, the significance of TG as a plausible therapeutic target has been unfoundedly underestimated for many years.

However, epidemiological data indicate that both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridemia are associated with substantially increased long-term total mortality and CV risk. Plasma TG levels partially reflect the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (TRL): very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons, and their remnants. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia commonly leads to a reduction in HDL and an increase in atherogenic small dense LDL levels. TG may also stimulate atherogenesis through mechanisms such as excessive free fatty acids (FFA) release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis.

Genetic studies strongly support hypertriglyceridemia and high concentrations of TRL as causal risk factors for CV disease. The most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to overweight and sedentary lifestyle, which in turn lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MS), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

### A review of the current status of the management of mixed dyslipidemia associated with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [^1119bsBi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with a statin as the primary lipid-modifying intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. However, even with high-dose statin therapy or the combination of statin plus ezetimibe, many patients remain at substantial risk of a cardiovascular event. Increasingly, there is recognition of the importance of treating all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemic profile associated with both conditions, specifically low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels, in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol. Both niacin (nicotinic acid) and fibrates are recommended as options for combination with a statin in this setting. Data from ongoing prospective outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these combinations.

### Unmet need for adjunctive dyslipidemia therapy in hypertriglyceridemia management [^115X4MUZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the important role of high-intensity statins in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in secondary and primary prevention, substantial residual risk persists, particularly among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Considerable attention is currently directed to the role that elevated triglycerides (TGs) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels play as important mediators of residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, which is further strongly supported by genetic linkage studies.

Previous trials with fibrates, niacin, and most cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors that targeted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol raising, and/or TG lowering, have failed to show conclusive evidence of incremental event reduction after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were "optimally controlled" with statins. Although omega-3 fatty acids are efficacious in lowering TG levels and may have pleiotropic effects such as reducing plaque instability and proinflammatory mediators of atherogenesis, clinical outcomes data are currently lacking. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials of TG-lowering strategies with an optimal dosage of omega-3 fatty acids are nearing completion.

### Management of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117CageT]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is highly prevalent globally, and its prevalence is rising with a worldwide increase in the incidence of obesity and diabetes. This review examines its management and future therapies.

For this review, HTG is defined as a mild-to-moderate elevation in the levels of triglycerides (TG): a fasting or nonfasting TG level of ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 500 mg/dL. We reviewed scientific studies published over the last 30 years and professional society recommendations regarding the evaluation and treatment of HTG.

Genetics, lifestyle, and other environmental factors impact TG levels. In adults with mild-to-moderate HTG, clinicians should routinely assess and treat secondary treatable causes, such as diet, physical activity, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and the reduction or cessation of medications that elevate TG levels. Because atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk is the primary clinical concern, statins are usually the first-line treatment. Patients with TG levels between ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 500 mg/dL, whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is treated adequately with statins (at "maximally tolerated" doses, per some statements) and who have either prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus along with at least two additional cardiovascular disease risk factors, should be considered for added icosapent ethyl treatment to further reduce their cardiovascular disease risk. Fibrates, niacin, and other approved agents or agents under development are also reviewed in detail.

### A voyager meta-analysis of the impact of statin therapy on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia [^111r47Xd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, defined by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel as a TG level of 177 to 885 mg/dl (2.0 to 10.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction remains the primary treatment goal. Using data from the individual patient meta-analysis of statin therapy in at-risk groups: effects of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin (VOYAGER) meta-analysis, we analyzed LDL-C and TG reductions in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L). Least squares mean percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG was compared using 15,800 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 5 to 40 mg, atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and simvastatin 10 to 80 mg in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L).

Comparisons were made using mixed-effects models with data only from studies directly comparing treatments by randomized design. Mean LDL-C reductions ranged from -26.9% to -55.5%. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater LDL-C reductions than equal or double doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin (p < 0.05). Mean TG reductions ranged from -15.1% to -31.3%. Rosuvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than atorvastatin 10 mg (p < 0.05). Rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg resulted in TG reductions similar to those with equal doses of atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than equal or double doses of simvastatin (p < 0.05).

- **Restrict alcohol intake**: Limit to less than 30 g per day (< 20 g/day in women). Avoid alcohol consumption if high triglyceride levels are present.

Niacin may be of special value for reducing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnants while raising HDL-C levels among patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities, particularly those with insulin resistance. However, definitive data from AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE are needed. Niacin is also unique in lowering Lp(a) levels. Treatment with niacin is supported by clinical evidence of stabilization or regression of atherosclerosis in clinical trials. Plasma glucose and urate levels should be monitored regularly due to the risk of hyperglycemia and hyperuricemia, respectively, and liver function tests should be conducted to exclude hepatotoxicity. In patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, lifestyle modification should be the primary option to control glucose levels, and if niacin is introduced, glucose levels should be monitored.

The level of evidence for clinical outcome benefits and safety suggests that fenofibrate may be the preferred fibrate for combination with a statin, and may also hold particular value for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with mild-to-moderate retinopathy. From a safety perspective, measure pre-treatment serum transaminases, creatine (phospho)kinase, and creatinine. Creatine (phospho)kinase should be repeated if myalgia is reported, or if there are known risk factors for myopathy.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: Evidence and guidance for management [^114PtKBY]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Post hoc analyses of prospective trials in ACS and stable CHD patients reveal that elevated plasma levels of triglycerides and low plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are intimately associated with this high risk, even at or below recommended LDL-C goals. Furthermore, in T2DM patients, the UKPDS identified HDL-C as the second most important coronary risk factor, after LDL-C. Despite these data, guidelines are inconsistent in their recommendations for proposed levels of HDL-C or triglycerides either for initiation of additional therapies or for targets for such treatments in patients at LDL-C goal.

The aim of this paper is to critically appraise the evidence relating to triglycerides and HDL-C as cardiovascular risk factors or markers and to consider therapeutic strategies for their management. The focus is on individuals with cardiometabolic risk, characterized by the clustering of central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which together increase the risk of CVD and T2DM.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: Same data but different interpretations [^1142zDR3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

While the AHA/ACC/MS guideline is identified as a guideline on the management of blood cholesterol, it also provides recommendations on the management of triglyceride disorders. It defines hypertriglyceridemia as a fasting level ≥ 2 mmol/L (175 mg/dL), which, if persistent on 3 determinations, is a risk-enhancing factor favoring statin initiation in primary prevention patients 40 to 75 years of age with a 5% to 19.9% 10-year ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations.

In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the AHA/ACC/MS guideline also suggests that apoB measurements may have advantages, especially in individuals with triglycerides ≥ 2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). An apoB level ≥ 130 mg/dL constitutes a risk-enhancing factor favoring initiation of a moderate-intensity statin or intensification of statin therapy in those already taking a moderate-intensity statin (class IIa, B-R). For those with severe hypertriglyceridemia of ≥ 5.7 mmol/L (500 mg/dL) and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, it is reasonable, after addressing possible secondary causes, to initiate a moderate- or high-intensity statin (level IIa, B-R).

Further intensification of diet therapy and treatment with omega-3 fatty acids or, if needed, fibrates should be considered in those with triglycerides ≥ 11.3 mmol/L (1000 mg/dL) to reduce the likelihood of acute pancreatitis (class IIa, B-NR).

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^115yBtXB]. BMJ (2020). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the most common lipid abnormalities encountered in clinical practice. Many monogenic disorders causing severe hypertriglyceridemia have been identified, but in most patients, triglyceride elevations result from a combination of multiple genetic variations with small effects and environmental factors. Common secondary causes include obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol misuse, and various commonly used drugs. Correcting these factors and optimizing lifestyle choices, including dietary modification, is important before starting drug treatment. The goal of drug treatment is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia.

This review discusses the various genetic and acquired causes of hypertriglyceridemia, as well as management strategies. Evidence supporting the different drug and non-drug approaches to treating hypertriglyceridemia is examined, and an easy-to-adopt step-by-step management strategy is presented.

### The evolution of European guidelines: Changing the management of cholesterol levels [^1165rLhC]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e. in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### Mechanistic insights from REDUCE-IT STRENGTHen the case against triglyceride lowering as a strategy for cardiovascular disease risk reduction [^114oHtrv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels have been linked to residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in patients with controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, outcome trials testing TG-lowering agents have failed to demonstrate cardiovascular risk reduction in statin-treated subjects. One such example is the recent STRENGTH trial, which tested mixed omega fatty acids (n3-FAs, 4 g/d) in high-risk patients with elevated TGs. Similar to trials using fibrates and niacin, the STRENGTH trial failed despite effective TG lowering. Results from these studies have contributed to skepticism about the use of TG-lowering therapy for cardiovascular risk. However, new mechanistic insights are provided by the REDUCE-IT trial that used icosapent ethyl (IPE), a purified formulation of the n3-FA eicosapentaenoic acid. In high-risk patients, IPE reduced a composite of cardiovascular events (25%, P < .001) in a manner not predicted by TG lowering. Benefits with IPE appear linked to broad pleiotropic actions associated with on-treatment eicosapentaenoic acid levels. These studies indicate that although TGs are a potential biomarker of cardiovascular risk, there is no evidence that TG lowering itself is an effective strategy for reducing such risk.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: Evidence and guidance for management [^111x2dQ3]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors and to advise on therapeutic strategies for management. Evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRL and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRL and remnants, together with the epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease.

For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk; genetic evidence is unclear, however, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism. The panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, i.e. the risk.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^111VYb9n]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Importantly, the efficacy and safety of the emerging treatments for HTG depicted in Table 6 need to be assessed in outcome trials. Such trials will help to better understand whether the clinical effect of TG-lowering correlates with ApoB reduction and the importance of TG lowering in patients with well-controlled (very low) LDL-C. We need a better understanding of the potentially heterogeneous pathology of different TG-rich particles and their metabolism, for example, the importance of increased TG production versus reduced catabolism.

Since lifestyle measures are of utmost importance for the management of HTG patients, novel approaches are wanted to improve implementation, monitoring, and adherence. To this end, point-of-care analytical devices, such as a recently reported miniaturized electrochemical TG analyzer that can be used with a smartphone, may provide important options for future research and patient care.

### Prognostic value and relative cutoffs of triglycerides predicting cardiovascular outcome in a large regional-based Italian database [^113UEkyV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Despite epidemiologic data demonstrating the association between elevations in serum triglycerides and cardiovascular disease, the exact level at which risk begins to increase is unclear. The first lipid guidelines for cardiovascular prevention defined elevated triglycerides as > 250 mg/dL. Since then, clinical trials evaluating the impact of triglyceride-lowering therapies have used a cutoff around 150 mg/dL. Therefore, in the recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the treatment target and goal on cardiovascular prevention indicates the conventional cutoff of 150 mg/dL. However, the specific prognostic cutoff value of triglycerides around which the rise of incident cardiovascular events associated with triglyceride changes appears has not been precisely evaluated in a European cohort. The Working Group on Uric Acid and Cardiovascular Risk of the Italian Society of Hypertension has conceived and designed an ad hoc protocol aimed at searching for prognostic cutoff values of triglycerides in predicting cardiovascular events in a large regional-based Italian cohort of men and women.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and treatment guidelines [^111fbp94]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Setting consistent guidelines for the treatment of lipid abnormalities must consider several factors, balancing the need for precision — favored by specialists — and practicality in the patient setting, which general medical practitioners favor. The appropriate populations for treatment should be clearly defined, and usual threshold levels, target levels, and treatments should be well established. Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has not been widely incorporated in guidelines as a significant abnormality predictive of cardiovascular risk and as a therapeutic target.

However, that view is changing in light of recent improved understanding of the importance of each lipid fraction abnormality, including HDL-C, in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated the apparent benefit of increasing low levels of HDL-C in reducing cardiovascular events. The use of guidelines incorporating threshold and target levels for managing HDL-C in high-risk populations is increasingly seen as a practical means of improving patient outcomes, especially for specific groups, such as the elderly and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
